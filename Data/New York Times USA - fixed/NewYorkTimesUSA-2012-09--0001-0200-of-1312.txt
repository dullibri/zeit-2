HEADLINE: Last Plea on School Loans: Proving a Hopeless Future

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER; Andrew Martin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PLAIN CITY, Ohio -- It isn't easy to stand up in an open courtroom and bear witness to the abject wretchedness of your financial situation, but by the time Doug Wallace Jr. was 31 years old, he had little to lose by trying.
Diabetes had rendered him legally blind and unemployed just a few years after graduating from Eastern Kentucky University. He filed for bankruptcy protection and quickly got rid of thousands of dollars of medical and other debt.
But his $89,000 in student loans were another story. Federal bankruptcy law requires those who wish to erase that debt to prove that repaying it will cause an ''undue hardship.'' And one component of that test is often convincing a federal judge that there is a ''certainty of hopelessness'' to their financial lives for much of the repayment period.
''It's like you're not worth much in society,'' Mr. Wallace said. 
Nevertheless, Mr. Wallace made his case. And on Wednesday, nearly six years after he first filed for bankruptcy, he may finally get a signal as to whether his situation is sufficiently bleak to merit the cancellation of his loans.
The gantlet he has run so far is so forbidding that a large majority of bankrupt people do not attempt it. Yet for a small number of debtors like Mr. Wallace who persist, some academic research shows there may be a reasonable shot at shedding at least part of their debt. So they try.
Before the mid-1970s, debtors were able to get rid of student loans in bankruptcy court just as they could credit card debt or auto loans. But after scattered reports of new doctors and lawyers filing for bankruptcy and wiping away their student debt, resentful members of Congress changed the law in 1976.
In an effort to protect the taxpayer money that is on the line every time a student or parent signs for a new federal loan, Congress toughened the law again in 1990 and again in 1998. In 2005, for-profit companies that lend money to students persuaded Congress to extend the same rules to their private loans.
But with each change, lawmakers never defined what debtors had to do to prove that their financial hardship was ''undue.'' Instead, federal bankruptcy judges have spent years struggling to do it themselves.
Most have settled on something called the Brunner test, named after a case that laid out a three-pronged standard for judges to use when determining whether they should discharge someone's student loan debt. It calls on judges to examine whether debtors have made a good-faith effort to repay their debt by trying to find a job, earning as much as they can and minimizing expenses. Then comes an examination of a debtor's budget, with an allowance for a ''minimal'' standard of living that generally does not allow for much beyond basics like food, shelter and health insurance, and some inexpensive recreation.
The third prong, which looks at a debtor's future prospects during the loan repayment period, has proved to be especially squirm-inducing for bankruptcy judges because it puts them in the prediction business. This has only been complicated by the fact that many federal judicial circuits have established the ''certainty of hopelessness'' test that Mr. Wallace must pass in Ohio.
Lawyers sometimes joke about the impossibility of getting over this high bar, even as they stand in front of judges. ''What I say to the judge is that as long as we've got a lottery, there is no certainty of hopelessness,'' said William Brewer Jr., a bankruptcy attorney in Raleigh, N.C. ''They smile, and then they rule against you.''
Debtors themselves struggle with testifying in their undue hardship cases. Carol Kenner, who spent 18 years working as a federal bankruptcy judge in Massachusetts before becoming a lawyer for the National Consumer Law Center, said that one particular case stuck in her mind.
The debtor had a history of hospitalization for mental illness but testified that she did not suffer from depression at all. ''She was so mortified about the desperation of her situation that she was committing perjury on the stand,'' Ms. Kenner said. ''It just blew me away. That's the craziness that this system brings us to.''
Debtors also stretch the truth in other directions. In 2008, a federal bankruptcy judge in the Northern District of Georgia expressed barely disguised disgust in deciding a case involving a 32-year-old, Mercedes-driving federal public defender with degrees from Yale and Georgetown. With nearly $114,000 in total household income, the woman's financial situation was far from hopeless, despite her $172,000 in student loan debt.
No one keeps track of how many people bring undue hardship cases each year, but it appears to be under 1,000, far less than the number of people failing to make their student loan payments. In its most recent snapshot of student loan defaults, the Department of Education reported that among the more than 3.6 million borrowers who entered repayment from Oct. 1, 2008, to Sept. 30, 2009, more than 320,000 had fallen behind in their payments by 360 days or more by the end of September 2010. About 10.3 million students and their parents borrowed money under the federal student loan program during the 2010-11 school year.
One reason so few people try to discharge their debt may be that such cases require an entirely separate legal process from the normal bankruptcy proceeding. In addition, those who may qualify generally lack the money to hire a lawyer or the pluck to file a suit without one.
Nor is the process quick, since the lender or the federal government often appeals when it loses. And even if clients can pay for legal assistance, some lawyers want nothing to do with undue hardship cases. That's the approach Steven Stanton, a bankruptcy lawyer in Granite City, Ill., settled on after trying to help David Whitener, a visually impaired man who was receiving Social Security disability checks. The judge was not ready to declare him hopeless and gave him a two-year ''window of opportunity'' to recover from his financial situation, saying he believed that Mr. Whitener had the potential to obtain ''meaningful'' employment.
Mr. Stanton did not see it that way. ''It's the last one I've ever done, because I was just so horrified,'' he said. ''I didn't even have the client pay me. In all of the cases in 30 years of bankruptcy work, I came away with about the worst taste in my mouth that I've ever had.''
Those who do go to court face the daunting task of arguing against opponents who specialize in beating back the bankrupt.
They will often square off against Educational Credit Management Corporation, a so-called guaranty agency sanctioned by the government to handle a variety of loan-related legal tasks, from certifying students who are eligible for loans to fighting them when they try to discharge the loans in bankruptcy court.
On its Web site, the agency paints a picture of how much of a long shot an undue hardship claim is, noting that people ''rarely'' succeed in discharging student loan debt.
Some academic researchers have come to a different conclusion, however. Rafael Pardo, a professor at the Emory University School of Law, and Michelle Lacey, a math professor at Tulane University, examined 115 legal filings from the western half of Washington State. They found that 57 percent of bankrupt debtors who initiated an undue hardship adversary proceeding were able to get some or all of their loans discharged.
Jason Iuliano, a Harvard Law School graduate who is now in a Ph.D. program in politics at Princeton, examined 207 proceedings that unfolded across the country. He found that 39 percent received full or partial discharges.
His assessment of E.C.M.C.'s view of the rarity of success? ''I think that's wrong,'' he said. While his sample size was small and he agrees that it's not easy to prove undue hardship and personal hopelessness, his assessment of bankruptcy data suggests that as many as 69,000 more people each year ought to try to make a case. And they don't necessarily need to pay lawyers to argue for them, as he found no statistical difference between the outcomes of people who hired lawyers and those who represented themselves.
Dan Fisher, E.C.M.C.'s general counsel, said it had no opinion on whether more borrowers should try to make undue hardship claims. As for the ''rarely'' language on its Web site, he said the company stood by its assertion that it was uncommon for an undue hardship lawsuit to end in a judgment discharging the loans in its portfolio.
Sometimes, getting any judgment is a challenge, as judges may delay a decision if the case seems too close to call or there is a possibility that the facts may change reasonably soon.
Radoje Vujovic, a North Carolina consumer bankruptcy lawyer, for instance, had more than $280,000 in student loan debt and just $23,000 in annual income.
When Judge A. Thomas Small, a federal bankruptcy judge in the eastern district of North Carolina, examined the case in 2008, he decided to wait two years before rendering final judgment, given that Mr. Vujovic thought his law practice might grow. ''Must the cost of hope be permanent denial of discharge of debt?'' Judge Small asked in his written opinion. ''The answer to that question cannot be an unequivocal 'yes.' Hope is not enough to end the inquiry and, ironically, permanently tip the scales against a struggling debtor.''
The Department of Education, unhappy with the two-year delay, appealed before the period was up and persuaded a higher court to overturn the ruling. ''I would stand by my decision,'' Judge Small, who is now retired, said in an interview. ''If you're forced to make that decision, all you have is speculation, and speculation is really not good enough to overcome the burden of proof.''
Getting judges out of the speculation business, however, would require a new law or an entirely new standard, possibly from the United States Supreme Court. Neither appears likely anytime soon.
In the meantime, Doug Wallace, the blind man in Ohio, is nearing the end of his long wait for a ruling.
In December 2010, C. Kathryn Preston, a federal bankruptcy judge in the southern district of Ohio, tried to assess Mr. Wallace's hopelessness by pointing to expert testimony that blindness does not necessarily lead to an inability to ever work again. But she also noted that because he lived in a rural area, he faced significant transportation obstacles. So she set a new court date for Sept. 5, to give him ''additional time to adjust to his situation.''
The question for Mr. Wallace then became what sort of adjustments he was supposed to make aside from a court-ordered $20 monthly loan payment. His routine has not changed much. Aside from hernia surgery a few months ago, his days consist of sitting close to the television (he can just make it out through one eye that still has a bit of vision) and regular trips to the gym with his father. His college diploma hangs on the living room wall, and at night he sleeps underneath it on the couch of the rental house he shares with his father and sister.
Mr. Wallace's sister, a community college student, is sometimes around during the day while his father works at a Honda factory. There are few visitors. ''I've got friends around here, I'm sure, but they've got lives for themselves,'' he said. ''So I don't really bother them.''
The judge did not explicitly order him to move closer to a training center, and his lawyer, Matt Thompson, said that doing so would set him up for certain failure. ''I don't think there is anyplace he could go in central Ohio and live on $840 a month,'' he said.
Logistics aside, Mr. Wallace said that it was hard to imagine his overall situation ever improving and wondered who would hire a blind man in this economic environment.
''Do I think I'm hopeless?'' he said. ''Well, yeah, I mean, by looking at it you would think I am hopeless. Like it won't get better for me.''

HEADLINE: Commodities Prices Rise Broadly For a Monthly Gain

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Commodities rose broadly on Friday, ending August with a third consecutive month of gains, after strong rallies through most of the month in oil, soybeans and cocoa. Gold prices also advanced on renewed bets for economic stimulus in the United States, while copper eked out a more modest gain as a result of persistent worries about demand from China and about the global economic recovery.

HEADLINE: Wind Still Swirling, Gulf Casinos Shake Off and Roll Back to Life

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
BILOXI, Miss. -- The Gulf Coast woke up and got down to the work of cleaning up from Hurricane Isaac on Friday, heading out under cloudy skies to find groceries and then returning home to fill trash bags and pry plywood from windows.
But here on the floor of the Beau Rivage Resort and Casino, the wheels of fortune spun and the lucky doubled down. The party had already begun the night before. 
The 1,740-room hotel and casino, half of which sits on a barge jutting into the Gulf of Mexico, was the first of the Biloxi casinos to reopen, welcoming three poker players to a table just before 6 p.m., the last effects of the storm still blowing outside. Five of the 12 casinos on the coast here managed to open later Thursday night, when many businesses were still dark. The rest were expected to be opened by Saturday.
Seven years ago, when Hurricane Katrina pulled the Beau Rivage slot machines and craps tables into the ocean, it took $550 million and a year to reopen. On Thursday, in a feat that seemed as coordinated as a sophisticated military operation, it took just under five hours.
It would be hard to overestimate the economic importance of getting the coastal casinos back in business. In July alone, they took in $110 million. The state gets 8 percent of that, and the cities and counties get 4 percent. Every day that the casinos were closed, the local government lost $100,000.
''Why are they open?'' asked Jordan Brooks, a retired school administrator playing a video poker machine on Thursday night. ''There is no secret,'' he said, rubbing his fingers together and making the international sign for money.
MGM Resorts International, which owns the Beau Rivage, initially did not want to shut down operations as the storm approached. No mandatory evacuations were in effect, and the building was designed to withstand a good-size hurricane.
Of course, the Labor Day holiday was on everyone's mind. Almost all the hotels here had been fully booked. Poker tournaments and special shows were scheduled.
Every hour that the resorts stayed closed meant dozens of cancellations for the weekend.
Besides, shutting down a casino and hotel is not a simple matter of locking up millions of dollars and turning out the lights.
Although the Gulf Coast gambling industry is not as big as the ones in Las Vegas or Atlantic City, casino jobs are the Mississippi River of employment in this part of the country.
At the Beau Rivage alone, 3,000 people collect paychecks, said Mary Cracchiolo Spain, the resort's spokeswoman. And that does not account for businesses that supply prime steaks for the high rollers, fancy oils for the spas, and thousands of other products that flow to the region every day.
The Mississippi Gaming Commission ordered the casinos to shut down by Tuesday morning as the slow-moving storm was approaching the coast of Louisiana and Mississippi. The few hundred hotel guests left in the 29-story Beau Rivage were told that they would have to leave by the morning.
The casino flies thousands of people a year in and out on a private 737. That plane would have to be moved, so it was packed with employees who could recreate the casino's call center at its sister property upstate.
The executive chef, Joseph Friel, a veteran of the Plaza Hotel and the ''21'' Club in New York, drained all the fryers and packed food from the hotel's 19 kitchens into walk-in freezers and a refrigerated truck across the street that would all run on generators.
Slot machines and A.T.M.'s were covered in plastic. Chips were moved to a vault. In the counting room, where workers wear coveralls with no pockets and everything from the tables to the trash cans are made of clear glass or plastic, the last of the money was accounted for.
Brink's made a last pickup, and the gaming commission made a last check of the computer systems that run the slot machines and counted the last of the dice and the cards. The flood walls went up, and everyone abandoned ship, save for a dozen workers who stayed to ride out the storm.
Immediately, George P. Corchis Jr., the president of regional operations for MGM, started thinking about when to reopen, making repeated calls to the gaming commission, his staff and the meteorologists the company keeps on retainer.
Like many people on the Gulf Coast, he woke up early Thursday expecting the storm to be over. But it was still raging outside, and the coastal highway was still partly underwater, so he postponed the decision. But by 1 p.m., he was ready to take the gamble. He would have the doors open before 6 p.m.
Employees were called in. The kitchen was fired up. Silt was washed from the bus lobby, which, except for slot machines hit by a few leaks, was the only part of the building that took on water. What Mr. Corchis called ''a very large Brink's truck'' filled with money arrived.
Since the power had not gone out, the gaming commission did not need to check each of the 2,200 machines. That made the job easier. As a craps dealer loaded $750,000 worth of chips onto a table and a bartender readied his station, the O.K. was given.
With it, the marketing team leapt into action, posting messages on Twitter and Facebook and calling every special guest they could with the news. The casino was ready.
Waiting at the door were three poker players, who headed right to a no-limit Texas Hold 'Em table. Like poker players everywhere, they were not showing much emotion over the speed with which the gambling industry on the coast had managed to get back into business.
''I tried to go to a movie, and it was closed,'' Ismail Birben, who drove in from Gautier, Miss., said with a shrug. ''This was the only place that was open.''

HEADLINE: Catfish Farmers Fight Fish Glut and High Feed Prices

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the federal government's efforts to help farmers and ranchers survive this year's devastating drought, perhaps the most surprising step has been a dose of support for struggling producers of catfish.
It's not that their ponds, shimmering across some of the poorest counties from Alabama to Arkansas, were drying up, although the catfish industry has been shriveling for 10 years.
Rather, catfish assistance came as part of a $170 million federal purchase of pork, chicken, lamb and fish announced in early August, all intended to prop up farmers hit by skyrocketing prices of feed like corn and soybeans. 
The Agriculture Department, in addition to its routine purchases for school lunches and food banks, would buy an extra $10 million of catfish, the administration announced.
That would be more catfish than the government bought all last year, and enough to put a significant dent in a glut of catfish that has left fish farmers squeezed this year between rising feed costs and falling prices for the fish.
Whether it is enough to head off the continuing collapse of the industry is another question, catfish specialists say.
''I think we are seeing a change before our very eyes, quicker than we ever dreamed,'' said Roger Barlow, executive vice president of the Catfish Farmers of America. ''We have never had as high a feed cost and at the same time seen our pond-bank price go down,'' Mr. Barlow said.
A $10 million purchase, at recent prices paid by the government, would be more than three million pounds of frozen catfish.
''That's not a lot, but it can't help but help,'' said Craig Tucker, a catfish expert and former director of the Thad Cochran National Warmwater Aquaculture Center of Mississippi State University, in Stoneville.
The glut that has depressed fish prices built up suddenly this year, to the industry's surprise, after a shortage last year after increasing numbers of farmers bailed out.
Inventories of frozen catfish doubled to about 10 million pounds from about 5 million in the last year, according to the government. In effect, the government will soak up most of that increase.
But nobody expects the federal purchases, equivalent to about one week's national sales of processed catfish, to bring the price at the pond up to the break-even point or to affect the price of feed in any way, or to offset import competition, which was up 30 percent in June from a year earlier.
''It does not get at any of the underlying problems facing the farmers,'' said Terrill R. Hanson, an aquaculture economist at Auburn University.
Domestic production of farm-raised catfish has been declining for years, and the trend has accelerated as feed prices and imports have risen. By various measures, the industry has shrunk by half since its peak a decade or so ago.
From January 2010 to January 2011, more than 20 percent of catfish farming operations closed.
That caused a shortage last year of fully grown catfish for the companies that cut them up, process them for cooking and freeze them, eventually selling them through brokers to restaurants and supermarkets. The price of catfish, both at the farm and after processing, went up as a result, and the business was reasonably profitable last year.
As recently as the start of this year, Mr. Hanson predicted in an annual report that there would not be enough fish to supply processors in 2012 and 2013.
But instead, the supply has exceeded the demand. As the price of domestic catfish increased last year, customers substituted other fish like inexpensive tilapia, or imported catfish and similar species from countries like Vietnam and China.
These buyers, unlike the federal government, have not come back even though prices have fallen.
''What makes the situation so dire is that the processors are not getting these sales back,'' said Dr. Hanson. ''And now, everyone is uncertain -- if they grow fish, will there be anyone to sell them to?''
The prospect of continuing high feed prices is deeply worrying to farmers, who can easily spend roughly 75 cents on feed to produce each pound of fish in the two years it takes to raise a fingerling to fillet size. Today, they are getting about 85 cents a pound for grown fish, not enough to generate a profit. They sell on the spot market, not under production contracts.
The price of catfish feed drifted between about $200 and $300 a ton for 20 years before suddenly rising above $400 a ton in the last two years, and to nearly $600 this summer.
''It's impossible to make even a napkin calculation showing that this is profitable,'' said Mr. Tucker.
In Arkansas, for example, farmers raised more than 75 million market-ready fish 10 years ago, weighing well over 100 million pounds; this summer there were barely 15 million food-size fish in ponds, with a live weight of 20 million pounds, according to a July census.
Many farmers, especially those in Mississippi and Arkansas, where ponds replaced marginal plantings of row crops decades ago, are tempted to simply drain the ponds and plant beans and corn -- ''to grow grain rather than feed grain,'' as Mr. Barlow of the catfish farmers' group put it. Among other considerations, those crops qualify for federal insurance.
In Mississippi's Delta region, the heart of the catfish belt, Mr. Tucker said, ''You can drive down roads and see soybeans growing in what is obviously an old catfish pond.''
Compared to catfish, ''It's almost a gold rush,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Hopes Rose In August As Debt Fell

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Consumer sentiment hit a three-month high in August as households chipped away at outstanding debt, but Americans were pessimistic about the future, a survey showed on Friday.
Separate reports on the manufacturing industry painted a mixed picture, with factory orders rising more than expected in July, but Midwest business activity slipping in August. 
Manufacturing was in the vanguard of the country's recovery from the recession that began in 2007. But it has lost momentum in recent months as economic difficulty in Europe and beyond has damped overseas demand for products from the United States.
Consumers in the United States, though, were in a slightly better mood in August. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final reading on overall consumer sentiment for the month rose to 74.3, its highest level since May.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions rose to 88.7 from 82.7, the highest point since January 2008.
Buying was bolstered by price discounts and low interest rates, the survey found. But the biggest source of optimism was tied to success in trimming debt.
''Rather than citing income changes, consumers were more likely to cite favorable shifts in the amount of their outstanding debt and the value of their assets,'' the survey director, Richard Curtin, said in a statement.
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations, however, fell to 65.1 from 65.6, the lowest level since December 2001.
Half of those questioned said their financial situations were worse than they were five years ago, and a majority expected no wage gains during the year ahead, the survey showed.
Data released on Friday showed that new orders for factory goods rose in July by the biggest margin in a year.
But the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its index of Midwest business activity fell in August, though new orders increased.
''You have a good strength in orders and employment, but the trouble is that Chicago has its own motion and is not reflective of the national trend,'' said Pierre Ellis, senior global fixed-income economist at Decision Economics in New York.
The Institute for Supply Management's monthly survey said manufacturing contracted for a second straight month in July.

HEADLINE: Nonaligned Nations Back Iran on Nuclear Power, but Not on Syria

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK; Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- The 120-nation Nonaligned Movement handed its host Iran a diplomatic victory on Friday, unanimously decreeing support for the disputed Iranian nuclear energy program and criticizing the American-led attempt to isolate and punish Iran with unilateral economic sanctions.
But the group's communiqué, issued by Iranian state news media at the end of its annual meeting, omitted any mention of support for Syria, Iran's vital Middle East ally, which appeared to reflect a view among many members that the Syrian government's attempt to crush the uprising there was indefensible. 
The conspicuous omission of Syria from the document, called the Tehran Declaration, followed a dramatic day of maneuvering by Iran's delegation to secure some kind of support for Syria's government, diplomats said, as the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and his aides were criticizing foreign backing of the Syrian insurgency.
Nonetheless for Iran, the final result of the Nonaligned Movement's meeting, the biggest international gathering in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, amounted to the strongest expression of support for Iran's nuclear energy rights in its showdown with the West. The unanimous backing of the final document undercut the American argument that Iran was an isolated outlier nation.
The Tehran Declaration document not only emphasizes Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy but acknowledges the right to ownership of a full nuclear fuel cycle, which means uranium enrichment -- a matter of deep dispute.
The United Nations Security Council has repeatedly demanded a halt to all Iranian uranium enrichment until Iran can allay suspicions that it is seeking the ability to make nuclear weapons. The United States has led a Western effort to punish Iran with increasingly onerous economic sanctions while Iran defies the Security Council's demands.
Iran, which has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear program is peaceful, contends it is already in compliance with its obligations as a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and has countered that Israel, which is not a signatory, has an unacknowledged nuclear weapons arsenal. Israel, which regards Iran as its major enemy, has threatened to attack Iranian enrichment sites.
The nuclear issue was further highlighted by a new report issued Thursday by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear monitor of the United Nations, asserting that Iran had rapidly escalated its uranium enrichment capacity in recent months.
The Syrians emerged as the big losers at the Nonaligned meeting, with Iran first unwilling and later unable to gather support for President Bashar al-Assad's government. In the days preceding the closing ceremony, Iranian leaders remained silent on Syria to prevent disagreements, Iranian officials acknowledged.
Frustration was visible on Friday afternoon when the Iranian foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, could be seen talking and gesturing in the main hall while debating with his Syrian counterpart for nearly 20 minutes, witnesses said. The Syrians left the room afterward, only to reappear hours later.
Diplomats said that in the afternoon, the Iranian delegation pushed for a separate paragraph on Syria and nonproliferation, which was resisted by Arab delegations. India, itself a nuclear power, was also unhappy with the proposed nonproliferation language, sources in the conference said.
Iran's inability to help Syria at the conference came a day after Egypt's new Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, surprised his Iranian hosts with a ringing repudiation of Mr. Assad's government that reflected broad Arab support for the insurgency in Syria. Experts said the speech by Mr. Morsi, whose participation in the meeting had been welcomed by Iran as a sign of an anti-Western power shift in the Middle East, should have been a wake-up call to the Iranians.
''On the one hand, they got a predictable but very helpful endorsement of their right to develop peaceful nuclear power, but their strategic position on Syria was not helped at all,'' said Augustus Richard Norton, an Islamic scholar and professor of international relations at Boston University.
''That was a shot across the bow,'' he said. ''It gives them a sense that they're mainly out of touch with mainstream opinion with the Arab world. That should concern them quite a lot.''
Ayatollah Khamenei indirectly criticized Mr. Morsi for his remarks, which created an awkward obstacle to Iran, the rotating president of the Nonaligned Movement through 2015.
An influential former ambassador, Hossein Sheikholeslam, was more blunt. He was quoted by the semiofficial Mehr news agency as saying that the Egyptian president had overstepped diplomatic principles, displayed political immaturity and made ''a big mistake.''
Further signs of friction emanated from actions by another honored guest at the Nonaligned Movement meeting, Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, whose participation was considered by Iranian officials to be an important repudiation of American and Israeli efforts to ostracize Iran. In a speech at Iran's School of International Relations, Mr. Ban said that he had privately urged Ayatollah Khamenei to release all political prisoners.
With the summit meeting serving as a venue for Iranian leaders to convince their domestic audience of Iran's international importance, state television ignored remarks that deviated from the official political narrative. Most Iranian media outlets did not comment on the contentious parts of Mr. Morsi's speech.
One Iranian official, however, said Iran had welcomed Mr. Morsi's opinion. ''We are not against expression of views,'' the official, Mohammad Javad Larijani, the head of Iran's High Council for Human Rights, was quoted by the Mehr news agency as saying. ''We also believe that no one should impose one's opinion on others.''

HEADLINE: Japan and North Korea Agree to Hold More Talks

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan and North Korea ended their first direct talks in four years on Friday with an agreement to meet again as early as next month, apparently in a sign of the North's desire to reduce tensions with Japan, and by extension, the United States. 
Japanese analysts have said that the talks in Beijing, which began Wednesday, may be a signal that the North's new ruler, Kim Jong-un, wants to improve his nation's destitute economy by reaching out to Japan, America's most important Asian ally. They said Mr. Kim might also be trying to reduce his country's economic dependence on China, which supplies the North with fuel and food.
Disagreements over issues like the fate of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents decades ago had led Japan to cut off all trade and ties with the North. On Friday, the top Japanese government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura, said the abduction issue would be on the agenda when the two nations meet again.
This appeared to be a concession by North Korea, which had insisted that the abduction issue was resolved in 2002, when five Japanese were returned. Japanese officials are seeking information on what happened to at least a dozen more Japanese whom they also believe were kidnapped to teach language to North Korean spies.
While the North's overtures might represent a new openness, North Korea has reached out to countries it considers adversaries before, only to break agreements and lash out in anger.
This week's talks began as a meeting to discuss Japan's retrieval of the remains of some of the 21,000 Japanese who died at the end of World War II in what is now North Korea, which at the time was part of a Japanese colony. But the meeting broadened into a discussion of an agenda for future talks between the two nations.
Other future topics include the repatriation of Japanese wives of North Koreans who moved to the North in the late 1950s, and the handing over of Japanese citizens who fled to North Korea after hijacking a Japanese airliner in 1970.
Japanese officials described the meetings as working-level talks between midrank diplomats. They said they asked that the next meetings, which could be held in early September in Beijing, be held between higher-ranking officials.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Cleaner Cars, a Safer Planet

 BODY:
The federal automobile efficiency standards announced this week are an important step on America's path to a lower-carbon and more-secure energy future. They are expected to yield multiple benefits: reduced dependence on foreign oil, fewer greenhouse gas emissions, consumer savings at the pump and a more competitive auto industry. They may also serve as proof that well-tailored government regulation can achieve positive results and that consensus among old enemies -- in this case environmentalists and the car companies -- is possible even at a time of partisan discord. 
The standards build on a 2009 agreement that established a unified set of rules governing fuel economy and carbon dioxide pollution from automobiles and light trucks. Those rules covered model years 2012-16; the new rules cover 2017 to 2025. Taken together, the two sets of rules would increase fuel efficiency from today's average of about 29 miles per gallon to 54.5 miles per gallon when they are fully effective in 2025. This is expected to result in a cut of 40 percent to 50 percent in fuel consumption and roughly equivalent cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.
The White House says the rules would reduce oil consumption by two million barrels a day by 2025; the nation now consumes 19 million barrels a day and imports just less than half that amount. And while fuel-efficient cars will cost more initially, lower fuel use is expected to save consumers up to $8,000 over the life of their vehicles.
The battle for greater fuel economy goes back years and involved many players: California, which in 2002 passed its own law regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles sold there; environmentalists, who pressured the Environmental Protection Agency to impose similar rules nationwide; the Supreme Court, which in 2007 authorized the agency to move forward; and Congress, which ordered the Department of Transportation to update fuel economy standards that had been largely untouched since 1975. President Obama's contribution was to bring about a consensus among the agencies, the states, the automakers and the interest groups on federal and state standards that reduced fuel use and gave industry the regulatory certainty it needed to move forward.
It is a model of public-private cooperation. Even so, the Romney campaign has called the rules ''extreme'' and House Republicans have threatened to roll them back. That would be a grave disservice to consumers, the auto companies, the economy and the planet.

HEADLINE: Overpriced Real Estate? Well, Maybe It's Art

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
If it's $100 million, is it art?
Since Citigroup's former chairman, Sandy Weill, sold his penthouse at 15 Central Park West late last year for $88 million, or $13,000 a square foot, to a Russian billionaire, sales prices in Manhattan have been flirting with $100 million, and brokers say it's only a matter of time until the barrier is broken.
Sales at such stratospheric levels in Manhattan, as well as records in certain neighborhoods in Miami, Los Angeles and a few other pockets isolated from the nationwide collapse in real estate prices, have left real estate professionals struggling to explain the surge. Art may be the answer.
''Art is what people are willing to pay for, and an apartment like this is like a piece of art,'' the Long Island real estate developer Steven Klar told a colleague of mine at The Times, Alexei Barrionuevo, in late July as he listed his penthouse on West 56th Street for $100 million. 
Kathleen Coumou, senior vice president at Christie's International Real Estate, said that some residential properties could legitimately be marketed and sold as art.
''When we call a property art, it tends to have architectural or historic significance,'' she said.
She cited the recent sale of a Manhattan town house designed by the famed 19th-century architect Stanford White, which was listed by Christie's at what now seems a bargain, $49 million. ''But even new construction could be considered art. It's the equivalent of postwar and contemporary art, which is setting record prices.''
Something is certainly leading to record prices for what brokers describe interchangeably as trophy or art properties. An apartment at One57, a tower under construction across from Carnegie Hall, sold for $90 million and another is in contract for a sum said to be over $90 million (though less than the list price of $115 million.) The casino executive Steve Wynn, who is also a prominent art collector, bought a penthouse at the Ritz-Carlton on Central Park South for $70 million in June. A duplex co-op on Park Avenue sold for $52 million in May.
For high-end real estate sellers and buyers, the art analogy holds obvious appeal, since prices for paintings cracked the $100 million barrier at auction years ago and quickly rebounded from the financial crisis. The record for the most expensive painting is said to be held by Cezanne's ''The Card Players,'' sold last year to the royal family of Qatar for a price estimated by Vanity Fair at $250 million. (A few weeks ago, a member of the same family walked away from a deal at One57, opting instead for a $47 million Upper East Side town house.)
To reduce the Cezanne's 97-by-130-centimeter dimensions to real estate terms, that's $19,826 per square centimeter. Mr. Klar is asking only $12,500 per square foot, and his apartment comes with swag drapes and a crystal chandelier.
It may be time for a reality check.
David Kusin, a former Metropolitan Museum of Art curator who also worked on Wall Street and now runs Kusin & Company, a consulting firm in Dallas that specializes in the economics of the art market, told me the comparison of real estate to fine art infuriated him.
''There's absolutely no statistical validity to it,'' he said. ''It's like comparing Earth to Saturn. And I've been studying these markets for 18 years. I live in a home designed by the dean of Taliesin,'' Frank Lloyd Wright's school of architecture. ''The interior designer and landscape architect are at the apex of their fields. There is no comparability at all between the structure I live in and the art that hangs on the walls.''
Among the more obvious differences he and others mentioned is that most art is portable, and thus sells in a global market; most great art is unique and can't be replicated; art serves no utilitarian function; art values are based on a wide range of scholarship, research and critical evaluations, which may take generations to evolve; and valuing art is much more complicated than valuing real estate.
''When people get crazy over something, they like to rationalize what they do,'' Mr. Kusin added. ''If a Russian oligarch is going to spend $88 million, then somehow he has to justify it. So he says it's more than an apartment. It's art. That's absolutely ridiculous. At the end of the day, it's still a piece of real estate. It's immovable, and it needs to be maintained.''
There are a few real estate properties that even Mr. Kusin would concede qualify as masterpieces, but curiously, they aren't the ones asking -- or getting -- anywhere near $100 million. And none of them are in new Manhattan condo buildings. Sotheby's auctioned the Farnsworth House, a landmark in modernist architecture designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and built in 1951 on 58 acres of prairie southwest of Chicago. The winning bidder was the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which paid $7.5 million.
Frank Lloyd Wright's landmark Ennis House, set on a hill in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, sold last summer to the billionaire executive Ronald Burkle for less than $4.5 million. It was listed by Christie's in 2009 at $15 million.
Sotheby's has several listings for palazzos in Venice, some dating to the 14th century.
''If you're standing on a terrazzo floor built in the 1300s, that has a lot of value,'' Philip White, president of Sotheby's International Realty, said. ''There are early frescoes in some of the walls that are part of the real estate, and the frescoes alone are worth a lot of money.''
Be that as it may, such listings in Venice start at $3.5 million, and Mr. White said none has sold for more than $20 million.
''There are only a few properties of great architectural and historic significance,'' Mr. White said. ''The Mies Farnsworth house was one of those; some of the Frank Lloyd Wright houses; the Philip Johnson glass house in Connecticut. They transformed architecture the way Picasso transformed the art world. That's how we at Sotheby's look at it.
''I don't think you can put 15 Central Park West in that category, even if an apartment did sell for $88 million. I'm sure it has some nice elements, but it's a new condominium.''
Paul Provost, deputy chairman of Christie's, agreed that the analogy could go only so far.
''At some point, it falls apart,'' he said. Art and real estate ''are very different. The assets are different, the liquidity is different. Still, as the art market has become increasingly global, people are looking at art as an asset because the values have increased so much. People have always considered their home as an asset. If they see it's worth $50 million, they're even more likely to consider it an asset. So you can see the markets converging.''
According to Jonathan Miller, president of real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel, ''When people refer to their real estate as art, they're really trying to say it's unique, that it can't be replicated.''
He said he's seen the phenomenon not just in New York, but also Miami, London, Los Angeles and other markets where investors ''are looking for safety in a world of turmoil and uncertainty.''
But, he said, ''they're confusing price with art. You'd think that titans of industry would be very individualistic about their acquisitions, but at the very top, there's a herd mentality. You get one or two very large transactions that grab headlines and then it's like a light switch goes off. In New York, this happened in the second half of 2010, and since then it's been very intense. The size of what's happening is unprecedented. How long can this go on? You see this kind of behavior and you have to wonder.''
Does any of this tickle down to the broader housing market?
Anything selling for close to $100 million has to be considered a niche, accessible to only a small number of extremely wealthy buyers, Mr. Miller said. The recent high-end sales seem to have preceded an upturn in the broader real estate market, and some real estates experts consider luxury home sales a leading indicator of broader price trends.
This week, the widely followed Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Index reported that average American home prices in June posted their first year-over-year increase in nearly two years.
''This is an isolated market, but it does create optimism,'' Ms. Coumou, of Christie's, said of the ultrahigh-end sales. ''I see the beginning of a recovery. I hope next year we'll see better results in areas outside Los Angeles, Manhattan and Miami.''
Whether record prices can keep soaring is another matter. Mr. Weill realized close to a 20 percent annualized rate of return on his apartment at 15 Central Park West, which he bought in 2007 for $43.7 million. To maintain that rate, it would have to sell for over $200 million in just five years.
There's also the risk of overbuilding at the extreme high end.
Unlike Picasso, who's dead, several such developments like the kind of real estate now fetching close to $100 million -- lofty new Manhattan condos with sweeping Central Park views -- are under construction or rumored to be in the offing. A tower being built at 56th and Park Avenue is expected to top One57 by several hundred feet; the Baccarat Hotel and Residences New York, scheduled for completion in 2014, is rising across the street from the Museum of Modern Art and will feature interior touches like Baccarat crystal chandeliers; Vornado Realty Trust has proposed a new ultraluxury tower at 220 Central Park South, offering direct park views, not ones from several blocks away; and another soaring tower is rumored for a site near 57th and Broadway.
''Are there enough billionaires to fill all these spaces?'' one broker mused.
Art advisers often caution prospective buyers that they should buy art because they love it, and not just because they expect it to appreciate in value. Perhaps the same could be said about high-end real estate. If living at the top of a new condominium tower delivers unparalleled satisfaction, then perhaps price doesn't matter.
As for the art analogy, in 2008, a stainless steel rabbit sculpture by the American artist Jeff Koons reportedly sold privately for $80 million, not long after his ''Hanging Heart'' set a record at auction for a living artist, selling for $23.6 million. But since then, prices for his works have plunged -- when they actually sell.
His ''Balloon Flower (Blue)'' sold for $16.9 million in 2010 and another ''Hanging Heart'' sold privately this year for a reported $11 million. Several other Koons works put up for auction didn't sell.

HEADLINE: Indulging in a Yacht, but Still Minding the Expenses

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
I HAVE spent many Labor Day weekends in Edgartown, Mass., on Martha's Vineyard, and one of my favorite activities is looking at the yachts bobbing in the harbor while eating a lobster roll.
The smaller ones remind me of the 30-foot Sea Ray that I used to own and still dream of owning again. But like most people, I gawk at the giant yachts, moored in the prime spots on the harbor and wonder who owns them.
Boats, like all luxury assets, lost a lot of value during the financial downturn, and demand for even the big ones dried up. But recently, I've been hearing that yacht prices have bottomed out and demand is picking up.
And I started wondering how people were thinking about the expenses of yachts, perhaps second only to private jets in my personal calculus of expensive indulgences. After all, it must cost a small fortune to run a grand yacht, from fuel to insurance to crew. But I also wondered if there were any tricks to saving a bit of money here and there that could help the more modest boating enthusiast. 
Of course, true boaters don't ride the high seas with calculators next to their cocktails. ''When we're cruising and burning 100 gallons of fuel an hour, I don't think it's costing me $300 an hour,'' said Bob Schmetterer, the former chairman and chief executive of Euro RSCG Worldwide, the giant advertising and marketing company, referring to his 80-foot Marlow Explorer. (It holds 3,000 gallons, and he was moored aboard it in Maine when we spoke.)
He told me that his yacht, named Blue Moon, was the culmination of years of trading up. He started with a 17-foot boat and went to 22, 27, 38 and 51 feet. In 2006, when he retired, he bought the Marlow. It cost $3.5 million.
''It's a great joy to spend time on her,'' he said. ''One of the things we're fortunate about is my wife and I equally love the boat and the yachting lifestyle. We know a few other couples like that, but more often one of them really loves it, and it's a tricky balance.''
Mr. Schmetterer was lucky in his choice of spouse, but he was wise in gradually buying bigger boats. Many first-time enthusiasts rush to buy the biggest boat they can afford, something that experts say is at risk of happening even more now with prices relatively low.
''We've seen a substantial deflation of hull values, whether it's the $50 million yacht or the $2 million yacht,'' said Sean Blue, head of global watercraft at Chartis, the insurance company. ''New buyers who are coming on the scene are benefiting by getting a lot of yacht for the money.''
That has several risks, though. For one, it instills a discount mentality. Mr. Blue's concerns are naturally with insurance: value-minded buyers may look for the cheapest insurer and be disappointed if they have to make a claim.
Repairing or replacing the engines, for example, costs the same whether you bought the boat new or used. Mr. Blue used the example of my old Sea Ray. It had two engines, and each one would have cost about $15,000 to replace. Some insurers would pay this amount in a claim; others would depreciate the value of the engines based on how old they were. Either way, the owner needs to come up with $15,000 if he wants his boat to run again.
Not surprisingly, the buying risks increase with more expensive boats. At the height of the market, buyers were doing whatever they could to move up on the long waiting lists for megayachts, which can take three years to build. Now, with fewer boats built over the last three or four years, buyers need to make sure that the builder is financially sound, exactly because it takes years to build a large yacht.
Ron Gong, co-head of the Palo Alto, Calif., office at Harris myCFO, a wealth management firm, said he advised clients buying megayachts to use escrow accounts where both parties need to agree to release payments. ''You need to have a trusted, informed person such as the yacht architect or a knowledgeable builders' representative to measure progress and determine if the work invoiced has been completed,'' he said.
Another risk is that you buy the wrong boat for the waters where you want to cruise. Jeff Vrana, who oversees one man's five yachts, the largest of which is a 192-foot Lurssen called Ronin, said new buyers might not understand that there are specific yachts for the Bahamas, for example, where the waters are shallower, and the Caribbean, where they are deeper.
Mr. Vrana said he would also encourage people to buy a smaller yacht until they understood the real costs of owning a boat. ''When you have money to burn and don't mind writing checks for $1 million a month, then buy that 190-footer,'' he said.
When he takes Ronin to Germany from Florida for service this fall, it will cost 180,000 euros in fuel one way and 3 million euros for maintenance work.
The cost will definitely be lower for someone with a smaller yacht, but it is relative to the boat's value. Mr. Schmetterer says he has a computer program for Blue Moon that tracks the service the yacht needs based on the number of hours the engines are run.
''Boats have complicated systems, and they're exposed to salt and hard waves,'' he said. And this means the yacht owner has to be vigilant about what may break down and prepared for what can happen.
On the largest yachts, a big issue is the crew. Selecting the captain and the chief engineer (who maintains the systems) is crucial. Mr. Vrana, a chief engineer by training, said picking the right ones could reduce annual expenses. The most common measure of a boat's cost is 10 percent of its value per year, but he said the expenses on the five-yacht fleet he managed were around 6 to 8 percent. Given that he has 27 crew members, it shows just how expensive having a mini-fleet can be.
One easy way a crew can save money is by having a fuel strategy. Ronin holds 30,000 gallons. So knowing where to buy fuel that is 10 cents a gallon cheaper will quickly add up. Likewise, a captain and engineer with a good safety record can reduce insurance costs.
But the area that even big owners overlook is Internet usage on board. At as much as $8 per megabyte of data, the cost for a weekend aboard with the grandchildren can run $2,000 to $6,000, Mr. Vrana said. The alternative is an unlimited plan, but as he put it, that costs ''$5,000 a month to look at Google.''
Knowing all of these expenses and more, why would anyone buy a boat in this economy? I asked Scott Moore, a retired reinsurance executive, who took up sailing while working in Bermuda in the 1990s. Now retired and living in Darien, Conn., he bought a 36-foot Morris Yacht in the fall of 2006. In June, he traded up to a new 42-foot Morris, with classic sailing lines. The extra six feet cost about $300,000, with a 42-foot Morris selling for about $750,000.
Mr. Moore put the purchase in the context of making a choice. He committed money to a bigger yacht, which he moors close to his home, because he enjoys going out with his son.
''This is our one real, indulgent thing, our vacation house,'' he said. ''It's a getaway for me. And it's 20 minutes away, not a five-hour slog up 95.''
Ultimately, owning a beautiful boat has to be about the dream of being on the water and feeling that you are controlling your destiny, if just for a while.
Mr. Schmetterer, too, remains philosophical about expenses. ''I've thought for some years that the most important depreciating asset we have is time,'' he said. ''For us, being on Blue Moon gives us a quality of time of the highest order.''

HEADLINE: Only The Good Get Rich

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
As the Republican convention fades into oblivion, the one thing everybody is still talking about is, of course, the party platform.
Honest. You should see the tweets.
The convention was so full of opportunities to catch a glimpse of celebrities like John Sununu and Rudy Giuliani that I didn't get around to the platform until the flight back from Tampa. But it was so worth the wait. Really, I could hardly take my eyes away from it long enough to watch the flight attendant demonstrate how to use a seat buckle.
As you'd expect, there were paeans to things Republicans like (phonics, Israel, coal, English, defense spending, transparency for everything except political donations) and denunciations of the stuff they hate (Obamacare, mass transit, the Law of the Sea Treaty, Venezuela, teachers' unions, Obamacare). But you may be interested to know that the proven methods of improving school performance are high standards, accountability and ''renewed focus on the Constitution and the writings of the Founding Fathers.'' 
Some of the recommendations are stunning. Besides the inevitable tribute to the Second Amendment, the platform goes to the trouble of specifically mentioning that Republicans are against limiting the sale of those extra-bullet magazines for guns that maximized the victim count in the mass shootings in Tucson, Colorado and Wisconsin.
Please, keep that in mind. Wherever there's a gun capable of spraying 100 bullets, there's a Republican platform behind it.
But the most startling sentence is in the preamble, where the Republicans announce they are the party with ''a positive, optimistic view of an opportunity society where any American who works hard, dreams big and follows the rules can achieve anything he or she wants.''
People, do you think the Republican hierarchy really believes that working hard and playing by the rules is a guarantee of big-dream fulfillment? This is a worldview you usually only hear before the first elimination round on ''American Idol.''
No wonder they don't like food stamps and unemployment compensation.
The platform provides some welcome hints about what the Romney ticket stands for. We do need help on that point because when it comes to actual plans, Romney-Ryan has been pretty opaque.
Leaving Tampa, we knew no more about the big Medicare issue than when we arrived. The biggest Republican talking point is that the Obama health care reform will, in the words of Mitt Romney, ''hurt today's seniors.'' That's all about the $716 billion in projected long-term savings, except that Ryan had the same cut in his budget plans and what the heck are we supposed to make of that?
Fortunately, Fortune magazine asked the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, that question during the convention, and Cantor was able to clear it all up thusly: ''The assumption was that, um, the, the, ah, again -- I probably can't speak to that in an exact way, so I better just not.''
So, O.K.
The big, if-not-quite-articulated, message in Tampa was that in a free economy, everybody will get what they deserve. There is no need to worry about the vast, growing gap between the richest and the rest, or the shrinking middle class, or the fact that America currently has one of the worst rates of social mobility in the developed world.
Untrammeled, the business sector will create plenty of jobs, and the hard-working big-dreamers will jump in, amass wealth and achieve success. You cut taxes, reduce regulation and let the magic happen. It's that or what Paul Ryan called ''a dull adventureless journey from one entitlement to the next, a government-planned life, a country where everything is free but us.''
Listening to the convention speeches, it was easy to get the impression that every high-ranking Republican in the country had parents who were truck drivers or convenience store workers who moved up entirely through their own efforts. Also, there were a lot of grandfathers who worked in the mines. Republicans love mines, particularly coal mines. This is partly because of their big donors, but the fact that environmentalists hate coal makes coal mines even more adorable.
And the miners themselves are always sympathetic figures because they work hard and play by the rules. As a result, their biggest dreams have been realized, and they are able to spend their lives underground developing chronic pulmonary disease.
Shortly before the convention, Mitt Romney had pressed the coal theme with an appearance in Ohio, where he stood with a group of sooty miners whose sad, solemn faces seemed to underscore their concern about big government. Also, some of them later told the news media that they had been required to show up and weren't paid for the day.
The reward will undoubtedly arrive at a later date.

HEADLINE: Before Talk With Chair, Clearance From the Top

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting from Kenner, La., and Michael Cieply from Los Angeles.

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- For all the finger-pointing about Clint Eastwood's rambling conversation with an empty chair on Thursday night, the most bizarre, head-scratching 12 minutes in recent political convention history were set in motion by Mitt Romney himself and made possible by his aides, who had shrouded the actor's appearance in secrecy.
Mr. Romney privately invited Mr. Eastwood, of ''Dirty Harry'' fame, to speak after the actor had given him a gravelly, full-throated endorsement at a star-studded fund-raiser at the Sun Valley Resort Lodge in Idaho this summer. ''He just made my day. What a guy,'' Mr. Romney joked with his donors that night, flanked by the fake log columns of the lodge.
Thus began an effort by Mr. Romney's campaign over several weeks to inject a Hollywood-style surprise into the highly scripted, tightly controlled convention where Mr. Romney would formally accept the nomination of the Republican Party to be president. 
Behind the scenes, Mr. Eastwood's convention cameo was cleared by Mr. Romney's top message mavens, Russ Schriefer and Stuart Stevens, who drew up talking points that Mr. Eastwood included, in his own way. They gave him a time limit and flashed a blinking red light that told him his time was up. He ignored both. The actor's decision to use a chair as a prop was last-minute, and his own.
''The prop person probably thought he was going to sit in it,'' a baffled senior aide said on Thursday night.
Mr. Eastwood's rambling and off-color appearance just moments before the biggest speech of Mr. Romney's life instantly became a Twitter and cable-news sensation, which drowned out much of the usual postconvention analysis that his campaign had hoped to bask in.
It also startled and unsettled Mr. Romney's top advisers and prompted a blame game among them. ''Not me,'' an exasperated-looking senior adviser said when asked who was responsible for Mr. Eastwood's speech. In interviews, aides called the speech ''strange'' and ''weird.'' One described it as ''theater of the absurd.''
Ann Romney, who made the rounds of the three network morning shows, hardly pretended that she was happy as she was repeatedly asked about the speech. ''I was thrilled for his support,'' she said on NBC, trying to be positive. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin said on MSNBC that he ''cringed'' as he sat in the hall during Mr. Eastwood's performance.
The speech was a reminder of how fleeting a successful political moment can be, and how carefully staged events can be upset by an unpredictable turn. And it suggested a slip-up inside the button-down, corporate-style headquarters of the Romney campaign in Boston.
Romney advisers so trusted Mr. Eastwood, 82, that unlike with other speakers, they said they did not conduct rehearsals or insist on a script or communicate guidelines for the style or format of his remarks. For Mr. Eastwood, the convention speech was a bit part in a career that has had its political moments. Angered by zoning laws he did not like, he served one two-year term as mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea in California. In 1988, George Bush briefly considered choosing him as his running mate; he picked Dan Quayle instead.
During the weeks after Mr. Romney extended the invitation in Idaho, the actor's role in the convention lineup was kept secret. On the public schedule, his slot was listed as ''to be announced.''
As the last night of the convention approached, planners tried to keep a lid on the story even as Mr. Eastwood's name leaked out on the Internet, hoping his appearance would be the good kind of a surprise, not the bad kind.
''If we announced it, it wouldn't be a mystery anymore,'' Mr. Schriefer told reporters, playfully.
Another adviser said that several top aides had reviewed the talking points given to Mr. Eastwood just a few hours before his appearance. They included a request to mention the millions of people who remain unemployed -- something Mr. Eastwood did, though he misstated the number.
As actors sometimes do, he improvised.
Instead of reading off a teleprompter -- something Mr. Eastwood is said to despise -- he pretended to have a sarcasm-filled conversation with President Obama, seated by his side.
''What do you mean, shut up?'' Mr. Eastwood said, mumbling to a befuddled audience. A moment later, he stopped again, saying, ''What do you want me to tell Mr. Romney?''
''I can't tell him that. He can't do that to himself,'' Mr. Eastwood said. ''You're getting as bad as Biden.''
Initially, there were no plans for Mr. Eastwood to take a chair onstage. But at the last minute, the actor asked the production staff backstage if he could use one but did not explain why.
Had Mr. Eastwood appeared earlier, many fewer people might have noticed. The networks began their hour of convention coverage at 10 p.m. Eastern time, which meant that Mr. Eastwood was the first act of the night for their millions of viewers.
He was scheduled to speak for about five minutes but stayed onstage for more than twice as long, throwing off the schedule for Mr. Romney.
Mr. Stevens, in an interview, said he would not discuss internal decision making, but he said that Mr. Romney was backstage during Mr. Eastwood's remarks.
''He spoke from the heart with a classic improv sketch which everyone at the convention loved,'' Mr. Stevens said, calling it ''an honor that a great American icon would come and talk about the failure of the current president.''
Rush Limbaugh called Mr. Eastwood's performance ''bold.'' But other members of the party faithful were not so sure. As they flew home from Tampa on Friday, some delegates grumbled that Mr. Eastwood was a waste of a prime-time slot that might have been better used to feature other speakers or the biographical video of Mr. Romney's life.
Mr. Eastwood is generally liked and respected in Hollywood, where his colleagues often do not agree with his politics. Leonard Hirshan, Mr. Eastwood's manager, said the actor was traveling and would not be available for interviews.
Mr. Hirshan said he had heard a chorus of response since the speech, divided evenly between those supportive and those critical. Mr. Eastwood's next film, ''Trouble With the Curve,'' is set for release on Sept. 21.
''He does these things for himself,'' Mr. Hirshan said. ''It's his private life. He believes in what he's doing.''

HEADLINE: Fact-Checkers Howl, but Campaigns Seem Attached to Dishonest Ads

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Marjorie Connelly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In his very first television advertisement last year, Mitt Romney highlighted the nation's dire unemployment crisis, its record number of home foreclosures and the rising national debt, and showed video of President Obama delivering this arresting remark: ''If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.''
There was one problem: the quotation was taken so wildly out of context that it turned Mr. Obama's actual meaning upside-down. The truncated clip came from a speech Mr. Obama gave in 2008 talking about his opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona. The full quotation? ''Senator McCain's campaign actually said, and I quote, 'If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.' ''
PolitiFact.com, the Pulitzer Prize-winning fact-checking Web site, rated the advertisement ''Pants on Fire,'' its most deceptive rating possible, but it achieved what the Romney campaign had hoped: people started talking about the sluggish economy and how Mr. Obama's campaign promises had fallen short. And it set the tone for the campaign that followed, which has often seemed dismissive of fact-checkers. 
''We're not going let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers,'' Neil Newhouse, the Romney campaign's pollster, said this week during a breakfast discussion at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., that was sponsored by ABC News and Yahoo News. He said that fact-checkers brought their own sets of thoughts and beliefs to their work, and that the campaign stands behind its ads.
Every four years there are lies in campaigns, and at times a blurry line between acceptable political argument and outright sophistry. But recent events -- from the misleading statements in convention speeches to television advertisements repeating widely debunked claims -- have raised new questions about whether the political culture still holds any penalty for falsehood.
Brooks Jackson, the director of FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, said that at various points this year both sides have blithely gone on repeating statements that were found false.
''They don't care,'' he said, ''because it gets votes.'' The increasingly disaggregated media ecosystem, the diminished trust in traditional news organizations and the rise of social media had made it easier than ever to inject questionable assertions directly into the media bloodstream -- and to rebut them.
But while there is arguably more fact-checking now than ever -- and, thanks to the Web, more ways to independently check what candidates and campaigns say -- verdicts that a campaign has crossed the line are often drowned out by dissent from its supporters, who take it upon themselves to check the checkers.
Brendan Nyhan, an assistant professor of government at Dartmouth College, said nonpartisan fact-checking groups now compete with ideologically motivated groups from both sides that consider their work to be checking facts as well. (The political campaigns also call some of their own news releases ''fact-checks.'')
''The term 'fact check' can easily be devalued, as people throw it onto any sort of an opinion that they have,'' Mr. Nyhan said. ''The other problem is that the partisans who pay attention to politics are being conditioned to disregard the fact-checkers when their own side gets criticized.''
The cycle was on display at the Republican convention when Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, made a number of questionable or misleading claims in his speech. Even before he stopped speaking, some of his claims were being questioned on Twitter. Soon fact-checkers were highlighting some of the misleading statements. More partisan sites rushed to Mr. Ryan's defense with posts finding fault with the first round of fact checks.
The truth-twisting has not been limited to Republicans. Democrats gleefully repeated an out-of-context quote that made it sound as if Mr. Romney enjoys firing people. An outside group supporting Mr. Obama ran an advertisement giving the unfair impression that Mr. Romney was responsible for the death of the wife of a steelworker who lost his job and his health insurance when Mr. Romney's old company, Bain Capital, closed down the plant where he worked.
And the Obama campaign ran a commercial falsely suggesting that Mr. Romney opposes abortion even in cases or rape or incest; he says he supports such exceptions.
But some independent commentators have argued that the Romney campaign appears to be more dishonest at this point in the campaign, citing the many times it has broadcast a commercial making the false claim that Mr. Obama wants to gut the work requirements of welfare.
Mark Halperin, the Time magazine writer, made the point this week on MSNBC, even as he noted that the Democrats had lost some of the high ground with their recent misleading attacks. ''But at this point I think the Romney campaign is besting them in making these distortions and untruths a bigger part of their message,'' he said.
Confidence in the old arbiters, the mainstream media, has fallen precipitously in recent decades: the percentage of Americans who trust newspapers, television and radio to report the news accurately and fairly fell to 43 percent in 2010, down from 72 percent in 1976, according to the Gallup Poll. Mr. Nyhan's research has shown the difficulties in trying to set the record straight through news accounts.
In a recent paper, called ''When Corrections Fail: The Persistence of Political Misperceptions,'' he and Jason Reifler, an assistant professor of political science at Georgia State University, found that corrective information in standard news articles -- compared with separate fact-check pieces -- was often ineffective at changing the minds of people predisposed to believe a misperception, and sometimes made the problem worse with what they termed a ''backfire effect.''
Bill Adair, the editor of PolitiFact.com, a project of The Tampa Bay Times, has seen his site come under fire from the left and the right in recent years, but said that this may prove to be the year of the fact-checker.
''I think there has always been a calculation by political campaigns to forge ahead with a falsehood if they think it will score the points they want to score,'' said Mr. Adair, who noted that campaigns still care enough about the truth to spend time explaining their positions and statements to his reporters. ''What's different this time is there is more fact-checking than ever.''

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Makes A Detailed Case For a Stimulus

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, delivered a detailed and forceful argument on Friday for new steps to stimulate the economy, reinforcing earlier indications that the Fed is on the verge of action.
Calling the persistently high rate of unemployment a ''grave concern,'' language that several experts described as unusually strong, Mr. Bernanke made clear that a recent run of tepid rather than terrible economic data had not altered the Fed's will to act, because the pace of growth remained too slow to reduce the number of people who lack jobs.
The federal government said on Wednesday that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.7 percent in the second quarter, slightly higher than its initial estimate of 1.5 percent but lackluster in normal times. A measure of consumer confidence hit a three-month high on Friday, but that, too, was impressive only in comparison with the immediate past. The government will release a preliminary estimate of August job growth next week; it is expected to show that the unemployment rate remains above 8 percent.
Mr. Bernanke said that the Fed's efforts over the last several years had helped to hasten economic recovery, that there was a clear need for additional action and that the likely benefits of new steps to stimulate growth outweighed the potential costs. 
''It is important to achieve further progress, particularly in the labor market,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''Taking due account of the uncertainties and limits of its policy tools, the Federal Reserve will provide additional policy accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.''
In setting the stage for action when the Fed's policy-making committee meets in two weeks, Mr. Bernanke appeared to defy political pressure from Republicans to refrain from new measures. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, has said such action would be counterproductive, and has pledged to replace Mr. Bernanke at the earliest opportunity.
''Policies from Congress, not more short-term stimulus from the Fed, are the ingredients necessary for restoring growth in the American economy,'' Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said in a statement after Mr. Bernanke's speech.
On the other hand, Democrats welcomed Mr. Bernanke's remarks. There is little prospect that Fed action will lift the economy before the election, but party officials fear the opposite possibility -- that inaction could undermine economic confidence -- and so they greeted the speech with relief.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Mr. Bernanke ''should not let any political backlash deter him from following through and doing the right thing.''
Mr. Bernanke did not announce any new steps in his speech, delivered here before an annual monetary policy conference organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Nor did he indicate which steps were most likely, a reticence that reflects his desire not to give details ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee, which convenes in two weeks.
Some analysts expect the Fed to announce a new round of asset purchases after that meeting, further expanding its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities to reduce borrowing costs and spur investment. Others expect that it will instead announce its intent to keep its benchmark interest rate near zero beyond its current forecast of late 2014.
Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs, said he was now convinced that the Fed would extend its forecast, because Mr. Bernanke described benefits but not costs of that approach. He said he also expected the Fed to announce new asset purchases, but not necessarily in September. The speech, he said, made the Fed's intentions clear, ''but it still doesn't really tell you the timing.''
Stocks fell slightly after the release of Mr. Bernanke's remarks, then climbed again. Commodities like gold and oil also increased.
Mr. Bernanke devoted much of his speech to asset purchases. He said past rounds of purchases had produced ''economically meaningful'' benefits, contributing to lower borrowing costs for corporations and a general rise in stock prices. He cited one study that found that the combined effect of the Fed's three rounds of asset purchases raised output by 3 percent and increased employment by two million jobs.
He provided a shorter description of the benefits of policy forecasts.
In both cases, after reviewing the costs of existing actions and the potential consequences of doing more, Mr. Bernanke rendered a clear verdict on the balance.
''The costs of nontraditional policies, when considered carefully, appear manageable, implying that we should not rule out further use of such policies if economic conditions warrant,'' he told the audience of central bankers, fiscal policy makers and academic economists gathered at the Jackson Lake Lodge in the middle of Grand Teton National Park for the annual policy conference.
The Fed has sent signals in recent months that it is preparing to take new action to stimulate the economy. Its policy-making committee said after its most recent meeting in early August that it would ''provide additional accommodation as needed.''
Since that meeting, the depressed housing market has shown signs of modest revival. But worries about fiscal policy have intensified, and Europe remains on a low boil. Mr. Bernanke's verdict on Friday was unambiguous: ''The economic situation obviously is far from satisfactory,'' he said. And his description of the high unemployment rate as a ''grave concern'' drew particular notice from his well-versed audience.
''It goes well beyond normal central bank expressions of the need to bring unemployment down,'' said Alan S. Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton University and a former Fed vice chairman. ''It is an interesting question for someone to research if any central banker has ever made a statement that strong'' about unemployment.
In addition to asset purchases and forward guidance, the account of the most recent meeting mentioned two other options. The Fed could lower the interest rate it pays banks on reserves kept at the Fed, which might push some money into circulation. It could also seek to provide low-cost financing for certain kinds of lending, like mortgage loans, emulating a program recently begun by the Bank of England.
Several Fed officials have said they would like to replace the time horizon for current policy with a trigger tied to economic data, declaring, for example, that the Fed is likely to keep interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate falls below a specified level, or until economic output exceeds a certain threshold.
The internal debate underscored a striking contrast with Mr. Bernanke's speech at this same conference in 2010, when he gave the first indication that the Fed would embark on a second round of asset purchases.
Then, Mr. Bernanke devoted most of his remarks to establishing the need for action, largely taking for granted that the Fed had the power to improve the economy. On Friday, it was the need for action that Mr. Bernanke took for granted. The question now is how much more the Fed can do.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Court Hands Win To Samsung Over Apple

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI and NICK WINGFIELD; Hiroko Tabuchi reported from Tokyo and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- A Japanese court on Friday rejected patent claims made by Apple against Samsung, a victory for the company after its crushing defeat in the United States last week and a reminder of the global scope of the patent war between the two technology giants.
While Apple prevailed over Samsung in the United States, winning an award of $1 billion in damages from a federal jury, the two companies remain neck-and-neck in legal disputes in almost a dozen countries. A judge in South Korea, where Samsung is based, for example, handed down a split decision in a patent case shortly before the jury verdict in the American case. 
''Internationally, it's been a mixed picture'' for Apple, said James Bessen, an economist and lecturer at the Boston University School of Law. ''Part of that is because most other countries don't have the same attitude toward software patenting that the U.S. has.''
For both companies, Japan makes up a far smaller proportion of sales than the all-important American market. But the Tokyo ruling suggests that despite Apple's victory last week, the jostling between the two companies for the upper hand in the fast-growing smartphone and tablet businesses is just beginning.
The Tokyo District Court ruled that Samsung's Galaxy smartphones and tablets did not violate an Apple patent on technology that synchronizes music and videos between devices and servers.
Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., sued Samsung in Tokyo last year in a case that sought 100 million yen, or $1.3 million, in damages.
That is a far cry from the billions in damages that Apple had sought from Samsung in federal court in San Jose, Calif. A nine-member jury there ultimately decided on an award of $1 billion after several days of deliberation.
Some law professors who have studied international patent disputes say the outcome of that case may be unique in the global tussle between the two companies. Mr. Bessen said that's partly because the United States is the only major jurisdiction where patent disputes are heard before juries, and foreign companies often face a higher risk of losing cases in such a setting.
''I wouldn't expect there to be a lot of judgments like this one,'' said Ronald A. Cass, a former law professor and vice chairman of the International Trade Commission, who is now a legal consultant.
Apple has filed other patent suits in Japan against Samsung, including one claiming that the Korean company copied the bounce-back effect when a user scrolls to the end of a list on the iPhone and iPad. And Apple has asked for an injunction that would prevent Samsung from shipping some Galaxy smartphones to Japan. Samsung has also sued Apple in Japan, asserting that both the iPhone and iPad infringe on Samsung patents.
In a statement, Samsung Electronics, based in Suwon, South Korea, said the ruling had validated its claims that it had not copied Apple.
''Samsung has strongly asserted that its technology is altogether different and does not infringe on Apple patents. The ruling recognizes the legitimacy of Samsung's assertions and is highly valid,'' it said.
Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, declined to comment.
Apple hardly needs a lift in Japan. The iPhone was the top-selling smartphone there in 2011, while Samsung's Galaxy series trailed in the No. 5 spot -- behind smartphones made by Sharp, Fujitsu and Sony, according to the MM Research Institute, based in Tokyo. Globally, however, Samsung is the largest smartphone maker.
But even in Japan, the operating system most commonly used by Samsung and other smartphone makers, Android from Google, has grown steadily, posing a challenge to Apple. Android captured 58 percent of the Japanese market in the first quarter of 2012, compared with the 38 percent market share claimed by Apple's mobile operating system, iOS, according to the research firm Nielsen.
Many analysts see Apple's suits against Samsung as a proxy battle against Google and Android, which Apple has called a copy of iOS.
The patent war between Apple and Google has set off a debate about the future of technological innovation -- one that has intensified since the jury in California ruled in Apple's favor. The jury said Samsung smartphone and tablet products violated Apple's patents protecting designs and functions, including the rectangular shape and rounded edges of the iPhone.
Some experts say such rulings will force smartphone makers to focus on innovating rather than copying, while others say designers could now be stifled by the need to constantly second-guess whether new designs or functions violate other companies' patents.
Meanwhile, Japanese electronics makers have figured little in the smartphone patent wars, underscoring how negligible a threat they now pose to either Apple or Samsung in the sector.
Samsung, the world's largest seller of smartphones, and Apple, the world's second-largest, together control a little more than 50 percent of the global smartphone market, the research firm Strategy Analytics has said.
Japanese smartphone makers like Sharp and Fujitsu, on the other hand, have little presence beyond Japan's shores.

HEADLINE: Merkel's China Trip Focuses on Economy, Not Rights

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and MELISSA EDDY; David Barboza reported from Shanghai, and Melissa Eddy from Berlin.

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany headed home on Friday from a two-day visit to China with a stack of newly signed business contracts and a pledge for Beijing's backing in the euro crisis, but few promises from Beijing to improve human rights.
Ms. Merkel, seven members of her cabinet and several dozen representatives of Germany's largest companies visited China at the invitation of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao as both countries faced the prospect of slower growth and weakening demand for their exports, pushing economic concerns to the forefront. 
At the heart of Ms. Merkel's concerns were winning support from Mr. Wen and the man expected to succeed him early next year, Li Keqiang, in buying up more European debt in an effort to ease the sovereign debt crisis, which has been crippling Europe for three years and causing uncertainty in global markets.
Although members of the Chinese delegation made it clear they had little understanding of how long it took Europeans to draw up new agreements to fight the crisis and ''did not hold back'' during intense talks about the euro, according to dpa, a German news agency, Mr. Wen said his country intended to invest in more European debt.
The chancellor also met with President Hu Jintao and his expected successor, Xi Jinping, while in Beijing on Thursday, and posed for a photograph with Mr. Wen with the Forbidden City in the background.
Yet the chancellor's efforts to underline what both sides have dubbed their ''special relationship'' came under fire from critics at home, who recall her previous willingness to risk Germany's economic interest to highlight China's poor record on human rights issues. In 2007, she invited the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, to the chancellery for talks, prompting an angry response from Beijing.
A summary of Ms. Merkel's trip ran under the headline ''The Domesticated Chancellor'' in the online version of Der Spiegel on Friday, and the conservative newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung warned of the danger of believing that the two countries' relationship could be defined by economic ties alone.
''No matter how dynamically the relation develops in terms of trade and investment,'' said an editorial published in the paper on Thursday, ''there can never be a 'special relationship' between the Communist People's Republic and Germany, a democratic country in the heart of the European Union, at least not in the sense of the Anglo-American connection.''
One of the sharpest critics of the chancellor, however, was in Beijing. The artist provocateur Ai Weiwei, who has a strong following in Germany, began poking fun at Ms. Merkel and posting comments on the Internet to show his disappointment at not being invited to meet her for lunch. He even posted pictures of himself striding outside, wearing Chinese slippers and carrying a cardboard cutout of Ms. Merkel through his garden. He called it ''Taking Merkel to Lunch.''
Human rights issues may have been largely ignored on this visit, but economic ties have flourished since the two countries began a program of annual governmental exchanges in 2010. On this trip, German executives signed contracts worth more than 4.8 billion euros, or $6 billion, including an order for Airbus, a French-German venture, for 50 jets worth more than $4.4 billion.
Still, disagreements over trade, transparency and access to China's lucrative domestic market remain. Ms. Merkel said on Thursday that she favored negotiation in a trade dispute in which Germany's largest producer of solar panels is accusing China of dumping low-cost panels in Europe.
During a visit to Mr. Wen's home city, Tianjin, outside Beijing, she made it clear that Chinese companies needed to recognize that subsidies distorted competition and violated European law.
''My plea is that everyone be transparent, that they lay their cards on the table about how they produce,'' the chancellor said, Reuters reported. Europe's trade commissioner is expected to decide next week whether to take up the case.
At a meeting with German business leaders, Mr. Wen sought to assuage concerns that their subsidiaries based in China were not treated the same as domestic companies.
''Fair access to the markets through the access of our subsidiaries as Chinese companies is close to our hearts,'' Peter Löscher, the chief executive of Siemens, told the prime minister, dpa reported.
Mr. Wen responded by inviting complaints and promising to address any concerns that reached him in writing.
Experts on China say Beijing is eager to have Europe welcome more Chinese investment in major areas, not just in the debt market.
''The significance of this visit lies primarily in the bilateral economic relations,'' said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing and an adviser to the State Council, or cabinet. ''There has been a lot of discussion over China providing financial assistance to Europe. But Germany cannot solely represent Europe, and Europe as an integrated entity still has some concern over receiving Chinese assistance.''

HEADLINE: Can Demographics Shift an Election?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES | THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
TAMPA, FLORIDA -- One way to think about the U.S. election this year is as a contest between the impact of a sour economy (advantage Romney) and the power of America's shifting demographics (advantage Obama).
Put simply, the groups that support President Barack Obama most strongly -- blacks, Hispanics, young people, unmarried women -- have been growing as a share of the electorate. Those who support Mitt Romney the most -- white working men, in particular -- have not. 
This demographic tide is so strong that some Democrats came away from their 2008 victory feeling that a political reordering was in the works that could be as important as the New Deal realignment that ushered in a generation of Democratic strength after the Great Depression.
The recent recession put a deep dent in that hope. But now both sides see that the demographic tide is still running. But it is running into the effects of the bad economy.
As Republicans convened this past week, Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, issued a warning to fellow Republicans. Perhaps the hard times will get them through this year. But they will soon have to face the longer-term implications of America's population shifts.
''Our demographics are changing, and we have to change,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Not necessarily our core beliefs, but the tone of our message and the message and the intensity of it for sure. Long-term, conservative principles, if they're to be successful and implemented, there has to be a concerted effort to reach out to a much broader audience than we do today.''
Democrats are hoping Mr. Bush is wrong about the impact this year. In fact, it could be said that they are hoping that the continuing demographic shifts will salvage Mr. Obama from the wreckage of the economy.
Charles Cook, one of the foremost analysts of U.S. election trends, says that basic public opinion about the election has been so stable now for so many months ''that the makeup of the electorate is one of the few critical questions.''
The percentage of the electorate that is white and not of Hispanic origin has been dropping steadily. It was about 90 percent of the vote in the 1970s. By 2008 it was 74 percent. The white vote has declined an average of three points in each presidential election since 1992.
Will the trend continue into 2012?
Yes, concludes a study by a liberal research group that looked at census data in battleground states. The researchers, Ruy Teixeira and John Halpin of the Center for American Progress, combined declines in the white electorate (3 percent) with growth among blacks and Hispanics (2 percent) as well as college-educated whites (1 percent), who are more sympathetic to Democrats than are white voters in general. That produced a total swing of 6 percent toward voters more likely to favor Mr. Obama.
But demographics are not always destiny. Population trends don't actually register voters or bring them to the polls. In 2010, the young voters who had helped elect Mr. Obama in 2008 stayed away in droves during the midterm elections. So did blacks and Hispanics. The same thing could happen this year.
Just Wednesday, Mr. Obama campaigned among University of Virginia students in Charlottesville, one of three college-town appearances in a week to gin up support among young voters.
''Go out there, register,'' he implored the students. ''Stand up. If you do, we will win Virginia, and if we win Virginia we will win this election and we will finish what we started.''
In his convention address, the Republican vice presidential nominee, Representative Paul D. Ryan, was direct in his effort to appeal to younger voters, making fun of Mr. Romney's music tastes and painting a biting image of the economic malaise: ''College graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life.''
Reviving the economy is an appeal Republicans hope will be heard by all voters, including those who have leaned Democratic. The downturn hit everyone, after all. Pat Mullins, the Republican chairman in Virginia, said party polling had found that Hispanic voters were less worried about immigration policy than about unemployment.
The chairman of the Democratic National Convention, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles, took a shot at the Republicans for lining up a string of minority speakers on the opening night of their convention. ''You can't just trot out a brown face or a Spanish surname and expect people are going to vote for your party or your candidate,'' Mr. Villaraigosa said.
A search for black faces at the Republican convention has become a kind of game on Twitter. The Republican Party says delegates are not asked to identify their race, so they don't know how many are black. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, which has counted just that figure since 1974, said there were at least 47 black delegates, about 2.1 percent.
When it comes to Hispanics, Mr. Romney hurt himself during the primaries, particularly when he refused to support legislation by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, to address the problem of young immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally by parents and have lived in the country for years, gone to school and built lives, but have remained illegally. Mr. Obama then outmaneuvered Mr. Romney by unilaterally suspending deportations of those residents.
To counter that, Mr. Romney took a step that reflects the very notion Jeb Bush raised -- to look at the makeup of the electorate, shape the message and change its intensity. For his speech Thursday evening, the newly minted nominee chose someone to introduce him who reflects that changing demographic: Marco Rubio.

HEADLINE: Republicans, in Search Of a Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By BRIAN KATULIS. 
Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, studies United States foreign policy in the Middle East and South Asia.

 BODY:
Washington
MITT ROMNEY stuck fast to his foreign-policy playbook in his acceptance speech Thursday night -- sloganeering about American exceptionalism, sneering at President Obama's record on Iran and Israel, and obscuring his own lack of new ideas. He said he would ''honor America's democratic ideals because a free world is a more peaceful world'' and he praised the ''bipartisan foreign policy legacy of Truman and Reagan,'' but said nothing specific about how he would follow in their footsteps.
The vagueness seems like a strategy in itself, and there's a good explanation: the disarray in his own party over national security. Today's Republicans are as divided on foreign policy as they've ever been, and Mr. Romney is finding it hard to bridge the divisions. No wonder he zoomed past foreign policy in some 3 minutes of a 39-minute speech. 
Centrists and neoconservatives are divided not only over security strategy, but the conservative base is also fractured over government spending -- including the defense budget. Neoconservatives who opposed even the modest defense cuts suggested by former Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates have come up against neo-isolationist Tea Party-backed tax-cutters and their guru, Grover G. Norquist. At the same time, some Republicans who have long said that government spending doesn't generally create jobs have promised -- hypocritically -- to oppose defense cuts that might cause job losses back at home.
Is there a single foreign policy area on which Republicans largely agree?
Not the Arab Spring. Calls from Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham to arm Syria's rebels and impose a no-fly zone have largely fallen on deaf ears, including Mr. Romney's. Conservatives like Newt Gingrich and Representative Michele Bachmann have stoked fears about Islam in general, leaving it hard to tell just how much democracy they would seek to promote in countries like Egypt -- where Islamists of various stripes have been winning elections, most recently for the presidency.
Not Afghanistan. Republicans have struggled to articulate a coherent position distinct from Mr. Obama's, which may explain why Mr. Romney's acceptance speech didn't even mention the decade-long war, in which slightly fewer than 80,000 American troops are still fighting.
Not cybersecurity. Squabbling among Republicans in Congress helped prevent the adoption of legislation this summer to enhance our technological defenses and protect infrastructure from digital attack.
Not diplomacy. The Congressional debate over the Law of the Sea Treaty this year, like the 2010 debate over the New Start treaty, which would reduce Russian and American nuclear missile arsenals, reflected deep philosophical divisions within the Republican ranks over whether treaties and other tools of statecraft advanced or hindered America's interests.
In the past, Republican divisions over foreign policy were typically between a realist wing and a more fervent nationalist wing; realism usually won. In the 1950s, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, an internationalist, prevailed over Senator Robert A. Taft and his isolationist followers. Later, President Richard M. Nixon's engagement with China and President Ronald Reagan's diplomatic outreach to the Soviet Union won out over the skepticism of cold-war conservatives.
After the 9/11 attacks, President George W. Bush ushered in a new level of infighting, from which his party has not recovered. Initially, neoconservatives like Paul D. Wolfowitz pressed a doctrine of preventive war and put it into effect in Iraq. Eventually, more pragmatic conservatives like Condoleezza Rice pulled the president back toward diplomacy.
Over the last four years, Republicans tried to paper over their divisions. In the 2008 and 2010 elections, foreign policy hardly figured at all. But the Republican primary contest this year bared the deep conservative disarray. And this time, a new battle, between neoconservatives and neo-isolationists, all but crowded out the party's pragmatic internationalists, like James A. Baker III and Colin L. Powell.
Mr. Romney has dealt with these divisions in two ways. He has derided Mr. Obama's handling of foreign policy (notably on Iran and Israel) with overheated rhetoric but only vague hints at alternatives. Ms. Rice (whose rhetorical jab at Mr. Obama's ''leading from behind'' was a big applause line) and Mr. McCain (whose calls for aiding the Syrian opposition drew muted applause) echoed that theme at the convention.
On the few matters in which Mr. Romney has offered a clearer difference, he has echoed the confrontational approach taken by Dick Cheney, John R. Bolton and other hard-line conservatives from the Bush years. For example, he called Russia the ''No. 1 geopolitical foe'' of the United States and said he would designate China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. His call for Republicans to block ratification of the New Start treaty put him at odds with all five living Republican former secretaries of state, including Ms. Rice.
But a mixture of cheerleading and fire-breathing does not make for a coherent and credible worldview. Now that he's the Republican nominee, Mr. Romney has an obligation to clarify his and his party's positions. It is imperative that he justify his plan to add more than $2 trillion in defense spending over the next 10 years and explain how the plan meshes with his proposals to simultaneously cut taxes, reduce the debt and strengthen America's economy.
Mr. Romney should also explain what -- if anything -- he would do differently from President Obama in Egypt, which is perhaps the most important test today of America's support for democratic transitions around the world. He should go beyond clichés to specify how, exactly, he would strengthen military cooperation with Israel -- which Israel's own defense minister, Ehud Barak, praised a month ago as ''more than anything I can remember in the past.''
And he needs to get specific about his tactical approach to Syria, where the United States is already trying to help the Syrian opposition, control which elements of it get foreign military aid, and isolate the murderous regime of President Bashar al-Assad.
Mitt Romney hopes to persuade Americans not only that he can fix the economy but also that he can lead at a time of great uncertainty abroad. To do so, he needs to first unite his party by offering clear alternatives to the president's policies. Vague criticisms of Mr. Obama won't cut it.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise After Fed Chairman's Speech and End Month Higher

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stock indexes finished higher on Friday and posted big enough gains to put them into positive territory for August after a positive statement from Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman.
Stocks gyrated after his speech Friday morning. They first gave up their morning gains, then bolted to their highs for the day, before finishing in between. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 90.13 points, or 0.69 percent, at 13,090.84.
A half-hour after trading began, Mr. Bernanke declared that the Fed was ready to take more action to help an economy that's ''far from satisfactory.'' 
Investors have been watching to see whether the Fed will buy more bonds to further lower long-term interest rates. Stocks fell initially, however, after it became clear that no such announcement was coming Friday and that Mr. Bernanke had stopped short of committing the Fed to any specific move.
Still, he said the Fed ''should not rule out'' new policies to improve the job market.
Stocks rebounded once investors parsed his comments. At one point the Dow was up as many as 151 points.
In terms of volatility, ''it's been the most action we've seen in a couple of weeks,'' said Ryan Larson, a senior equity trader at RBC Global Asset Management. He noted that pre-Labor Day volume was light, with many investors and traders on vacation, which can contribute to bigger price swings.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.10 points, or 0.51 percent, to 1,406.58. The Nasdaq composite index gained 18.25 points, or 0.60 percent, to 3,066.96.
The Dow finished the month of August up by 0.63 percent. The S.& P. 500 rose more than 2 percent for the month, and the Nasdaq increased more than 4 percent.
Investors looking for help from the Federal Reserve may have only one more chance before the election, said Frank Fantozzi, the chief executive of Planned Financial Services in Cleveland. The Fed's policy-making arm meets on Sept. 13. If it does not announce some form of stimulus then, it probably will not until after the election, he said.
''He's waiting until the last possible minute,'' Mr. Fantozzi said of Mr. Bernanke. ''I think in the next two weeks they're going to really digest the economic data and say, 'O.K., do we get involved or not?' ''
Mr. Bernanke said at a Fed meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyo., that it's ''probably not a coincidence'' that stock prices have risen since March 2009, when the Fed first announced its plan to buy Treasuries and other securities. The Dow is up 77 percent since the 2009 announcement.
Mr. Bernanke's comments on Friday received a more uniform reception in energy markets, which tend to rise on bullish signs for the economy. Oil prices jumped $1.85, to $96.47 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Natural gas and heating oil both rose more than 1 percent.
Stocks rose in nine out of 10 industry groups in the S.& P. 500. Energy stocks and materials stocks had the biggest gains, each up 1 percent. Utility stocks declined slightly.
Also Friday, the Commerce Department said factory orders rose 2.8 percent in July on surging demand for autos and commercial planes. However, orders for core capital goods -- a key measure of investment spending -- dropped 4 percent. It was that figure's fourth decline in five months.
Investors seemed more focused on Mr. Bernanke's comments and the overall higher factory orders, though.
Stocks in Europe were mixed. The German DAX and the CAC 40 in France both rose, while the FTSE 100 in Britain fell.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 24/32, to 100 23/32, and the yield fell to 1.55 percent from 1.63 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Too Busy or Just Too Tired, Some Floridians Paid Convention Little Mind

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
ORLANDO, Fla. -- Kaye Collie really wanted to pay attention to the last night of the Republican National Convention, particularly the big moment when the nominee, Mitt Romney, would step out on the huge stage in Tampa, Fla., and make the speech of his lifetime.
But she lasted only about 10 minutes in front of her television before she fell fast asleep to the sound of Mr. Romney's (apparently soothing) voice, and when she woke up the next morning, all the buzz was about Clint Eastwood's onstage antics. 
Ms. Collie was like many voters along the politically critical Interstate 4 corridor of Florida, which runs from Tampa to Orlando to Daytona Beach over seven diverse and struggling counties that tend to sway the most of any in this swing state.
Interviews with voters here suggest that Mr. Romney's moment was well received by some, but was also lost amid a tide of other urgent concerns. The timing of Hurricane Isaac's landfall in New Orleans had a huge impact, but so did plain old fatigue with both presidential campaigns, and the day-to-day realities of having a job, feeding the family and running errands.
Wendy Beaudry, 41, an unemployed single mother who lives in Davenport, Fla., enjoyed listening when Mr. Romney's wife, Ann, took center stage on Tuesday.
''I thought she was amazing because she said a lot of good things about moms and the bottom line,'' Ms. Beaudry said. ''Honestly, I thought she seemed very down to earth.''
''I'm a Democrat, but I feel we need a change because things have been going down, down, down. And people are worried, how much worse can it get?'' she said. ''I didn't watch for that long, but she made her husband seem like a phenomenal family man.''
Mr. Romney spent a significant amount of his prime time making a direct appeal to women, putting his wife, Ann, on a pedestal as a homemaker and praising his mother, who once ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate. Often criticized as stiff and aloof, Mr. Romney sough to humanize himself in an effort to appeal to the broad array of undecided voters, many of whom are women.
But with voters' attention floating in and out, it was not clear whether his efforts had much impact. In a word of warning to President Obama, who holds his own convention in Charlotte, N.C., next week, the conventions do not seem to be must-see television. Ratings were down significantly from four years ago, according to Nielsen Media Research.
Helen and Jimmy Staggs, retired nursery workers, watched a bit of the convention at their home in Dover, Fla., east of Tampa.
''To tell you the truth, I was about tired of it before it began,'' Mrs. Staggs, 67, said.
For her part, Ms. Collie, 60, a lawyer, had a busy week. There were hurricane preparations to be made -- then unmade -- all while dealing with an unusually heavy workload in the office. Midway through the convention, she was worried about family and friends in Louisiana and Mississippi, who came to be in Hurricane Isaac's shifted path. By Thursday night, she said she was physically and emotionally exhausted.
The speech's late start time in the East didn't help, either.
In her office on Friday morning, coffee talk, she said, was about Mr. Eastwood. ''Somebody said, what was that business about the empty chair?''
Mr. Eastwood's speech -- a bizarre ramble in which he pretended to have a snippy conversation with an invisible President Obama sitting by his side in an empty chair -- fell flat with many voters.
''I thought the chair was there because he's old and maybe he'd need to sit down,'' Ms. Collie said in all seriousness.
The convention overall got a passing grade from many, just not a high one.
''I actually thought it was dull,'' said Eric Menken, 48, a Republican from Davenport, Fla., who is quite excited to vote Mr. Obama out of office and watched the convention all three nights it was broadcast. ''There were some one-liners, some zingers, but overall, it was a flat convention, including the last night.''
Tracy Zirkle, a stay-at-home mother in Orlando, watched the finale, and the highest praise she could muster for Mr. Romney was that he did not mess up.
''I was leaning toward him anyway,'' said Ms. Zirkle, 40. ''His speech didn't hurt, let's put it that way.''
Rachel Carlson, a 30-year-old Republican, said she caught a glimpse of the convention as she flipped channels looking for something to watch on Wednesday night. Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan was speaking, joking about the old songs on Mr. Romney's iPod.
''The crowd was laughing and it looked like they were having a good time,'' she said. ''But I just kept on flipping.''

HEADLINE: Should Fracking Be Part of Our Energy Future?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Sean Lennon makes baseless claims about the development of American natural gas (''Destroying Precious Land for Gas,'' Op-Ed, Aug. 28). 
New York's proposed natural gas development regulations for the Marcellus Shale -- potentially the world's second largest natural gas field -- are forward-leaning and aim to ensure that these abundant, clean-burning resources are safely developed, proving, as President Obama has said, ''that we don't have to choose between our environment and our economy.''
Indeed, United States carbon dioxide emissions are now at a 20-year low, according to the Energy Information Administration. The chief reason? Expanded natural gas use.
At the same time, natural gas production from Pennsylvania's portion of the Marcellus Shale has increased more than 80 percent from a year ago. This responsible production is making our nation more secure and helping to create literally tens of thousands of good jobs at a time when they're most needed.
KATHRYN Z. KLABER President, Marcellus Shale Coalition Pittsburgh, Aug. 28, 2012
To the Editor:
The Ouleout Creek runs through my yard in Meridale, in Delaware County, N.Y., so I was happy to see it mentioned by Sean Lennon. He is certainly right to alert New York City residents to the dangers posed to our drinking water (I also live in Brooklyn) by exploiting shale deposits upstate.
However, it is important to avoid pitting upstate and New York City residents against one another in this debate, which is why I and many other New Yorkers support a statewide ban.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo are not alone in their misguided support for fracking; President Obama has, most unfortunately, thrown his support behind this dangerous technology.
But the bottom line is that there is no ''right place'' to poison the water and air upon which all of us depend.

HEADLINE: The G.O.P. Convention: It's a Wrap

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''A Suitor Makes the Case for Divorce'' (news analysis, front page, Aug. 31):
I am a member of President Obama's base of supporters. I am disappointed in him because of his failure to sell his achievements to the American people. He inherited two wars and the worst recession since the Great Depression. He also inherited a Congress that was more interested in getting re-elected than in working in the best interests of the American people. 
We have a Supreme Court that feels money is the equivalent of free speech, and so more money is being spent in this election than in any previous election. This money is being spent by both parties to spread lies and half-truths.
I do not like the America envisioned by Mitt Romney and Paul D. Ryan, in which taxes are cut and there is no safety net for the poor, weak and disabled except for private charities -- and in which the primary motive for Americans is to accumulate wealth with no regard for our climate, for the health and education of our children or for the rest of the world.
SUSAN STERN Newton, Mass., Aug. 31, 2012
To the Editor:
Republicans at their party's national convention said that ''big government'' must go.
Sixty years ago, in Chicago, they nominated Dwight D. Eisenhower for president. In his eight-year presidency, he initiated the huge Interstate highway system -- a historic federal-state government partnership that changed America forever. It created jobs, linked cities and rural areas as never before, and stimulated commerce in ways the private sector could never do alone. Now, many Republicans resist spending tax dollars to refurbish that infrastructure.
Before Eisenhower left office at the cold war's height, he warned about the drain on the federal budget from the ''military-industrial complex.'' Now, many Republicans want big cuts elsewhere, but never at the Pentagon.
It seems the Grand Old Party needs a history lesson on Eisenhower's legacy. He was no big spender, but he was pragmatic and progressive about what government can and should do.

To the Editor:
Re ''Surprise Speaker Delivers the Unexpected'' (The Caucus, Aug. 31):
I have watched every Republican and Democratic convention on TV since 1960. Clint Eastwood's unscripted, stand-up routine on Thursday night in Tampa was downright bizarre.
All I can say is wait till Charlotte next week. Barack Obama is no empty seat.

HEADLINE: Federal Judge in Ohio Restores Early Voting

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA

 BODY:
A federal judge in Ohio on Friday ordered the state to give all voters the right to cast their ballots in person on the final three days before Election Day. 
The ruling was a victory for state Democrats andPresident Obama's campaign in a swing state and was the latest salvo in the contentious battle over the state's early voting laws before the Nov. 6 election.
The state Democratic Party and the Obama campaign had sued the state over the constitutionality of a law that ended early in-person voting on the Friday evening before the election to all but voters serving in the military or living overseas.
The judge, Peter C. Economus of Federal District Court in Columbus, issued a preliminary injunction against the law, saying that in making an exception for some, the law unconstitutionally valued some voters over others.
Judge Economus also cited statistical studies presented by Democrats showing that low-income and minority voters would be disproportionately affected by the elimination of the voting days.
In his ruling, the judge roundly rejected the state's arguments that restoring the final three days would make it difficult for county election boards to prepare for Election Day and would make it difficult for military voters to cast their ballots early.
The Ohio attorney general,Mike DeWine, above, announced that he would appeal the decision.
"With all due respect to the judge, we disagree with his ruling today," Mr. DeWine said. "We have always allowed distinction for military voters, and to say this violates equal protection is wrong."
Ohio opened early balloting to all voters - one of 32 states to do so - after the 2004 election debacle that left thousands of state residents stranded in long lines unable to cast their ballots before the polls closed.
Democrats estimated in their lawsuit that 93,000 people voted early in the final three days of the 2008 election. At least one study Democrats presented in their lawsuit showed that early voters tended to favor Democrats.
The Republican-controlled legislature eliminated the final three days in a flurry of legislation in the last year. Then last month, the secretary of state, a Republican, eliminated all weekend voting during the five-week early voting period, which begins Oct. 2.
After Friday's decision, the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio called on the state to restore all weekends during the early voting period.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Ryan's Budget Proposal Is Pitting G.O.P. Troops Against Top of the Ticket

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Even as Mitt Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan exhort Republicans to embrace their proposed Medicare changes and spending cuts, the party's rank and file is growing less enthusiastic about the fight than the top of the ticket.
Republican lawmakers and candidates are distancing themselves from the Ryan budget plan, which helped make the proposed changes a national issue. Republicans say the party now belongs to the more senior -- and historically more malleable -- member of the ticket, Mr. Romney, and not Mr. Ryan, the younger conservative firebrand who has become the subject of repeated Democratic criticism.
''The plan is the Romney plan,'' said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota. ''He's the one that's going to drive the agenda.''
The distancing ranges from subtle to stark. Some first-time House candidates, unencumbered by a vote on the Ryan plan, have told local news media outlets that they have not and will not endorse the proposals found in the vice-presidential nominee's budget. Some veteran lawmakers who voted for the plan are demurring on whether it will be the party's policy blueprint, while the few in tough races who voted against it have made their opposition a calling card. 
In a flier distributed to constituents, Representative David McKinley, Republican of West Virginia, who voted against the plan, said that it ''would privatize Medicare for future retirees, raise the retirement age and keep in place the Medicare cuts included in last year's health care bill.'' The flier added, ''The Congressional Budget Office determined the plan would nearly double out-of-pocket health care costs for future retirees.''
Ricky Gill, a 25-year-old Republican challenging Representative Jerry McNerney in California's Central Valley, said he ''commended the fact that there's a mature conversation about the national debt.'' But, he added, ''it would be very difficult for me to endorse any specific plan without having a seat at the table.''
This week, Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio repeatedly declined to say that a Republican election victory in November would be a mandate to pass a Ryan-style Medicare overhaul, instead pointing to energy, tax reform and more generalized deficit reduction.
Some Republicans continue to say that they will benefit from showing that they are willing to make hard choices about the deficit.
''In this election, on this issue, the usual posturing on the left isn't going to work,'' Mr. Ryan declared at the Republican National Convention. ''Ladies and gentlemen, our nation needs this debate. We want this debate. We will win this debate.''
Yet even Mr. Ryan chose to criticize Mr. Obama's Medicare cuts in his speech instead of describing his own plan.
The change in tone will disappoint conservatives like the anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, who has said that the job of a Republican president is to sign the laws passed by a Republican Congress. Those laws were supposed to be dictated by Mr. Ryan's ''Path to Prosperity,'' the budget approved this year by the House, which was seen by conservatives not as a starting point for negotiations but as marching orders.
Such certitude is giving way to political reality. Democrats have made the Ryan plan's Medicare prescriptions their No. 1 issue in the battle for the House and Senate. Even Republicans conceded the attacks are taking a toll.
One Republican political consultant working on House and Senate races admitted ''the Ryan budget is well under water,'' hurting Republican House candidates in California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey and Virginia, as well as Representative Rick Berg of North Dakota, once considered a shoo-in for the Senate. Republicans can effectively counter the Medicare attacks by going after Democrats on the president's health care law, the consultant said, but every moment tussling over health care is a diversion from the issue that Republicans say can win the race -- the economy.
Democrats are happy to concur. ''We left for recess in a fairly neutral environment, where nearly a month later, we have a good stiff wind at our backs,'' said Representative Steve Israel of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ''That wind is mostly propelled by Paul Ryan and his budget.''
Democrats are now pouring on the Medicare attack. A recent advertisement by the party attacked Representative Dan Benishek of Michigan, a freshman, saying that he had voted to ''essentially end Medicare and raise costs on seniors by over $6,000,'' the amount the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the Ryan plan would shift annually to Medicare beneficiaries.
The same line of attack is on the air in North Carolina against the Republican challenger David Rouzer, coupled with the charge that the Ryan budget also would cut taxes for millionaires, ''definitely not North Carolina values.''
Republican candidates are reacting accordingly. Along with his colleague Mr. McKinley, Representative Denny Rehberg, Republican of Montana, openly disparages the Medicare proposal in his run for the Senate.
Mr. Gill, the California House candidate, cautioned, ''The Republican Party has to be the party of fairness.''
Even veteran Republicans who are not facing the Democratic fusillade are grappling with the reality of legislating such sweeping changes to programs as popular as Medicare. Under the Ryan proposal, those currently under 55 would no longer receive guaranteed government health coverage at 65. Instead, at 67, they would receive a fixed annual subsidy to purchase private health insurance policies or pay into the government fee-for-service plan. That subsidy would increase each year slightly faster than the growth of the economy, regardless of the rate of health care cost inflation.
Mr. Romney has embraced the plan in theory, and said during the primary campaign that, as president, he would sign it into law. But some Republicans suggest that he would take a less dogmatic approach to negotiations that would likely include Democrats. Mr. Romney has ''a track record of bringing people in to work together,'' Mr. Hoeven said.
''Nobody knows whether it's going to be the full Ryan plan or not,'' cautioned Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare. ''Mitt Romney will carefully go over every aspect of it.''
Officials at the National Republican Congressional Committee said the partisan attacks were already losing their potency. Guy Harrison, executive director of the committee, predicted that within a week or so, frustrated Democrats would move on to other issues.
But other Republicans do not expect Democrats to let up, and Democrats signaled even before Mr. Ryan was chosen as the vice-presidential nominee that his plan would be at the center of their 2012 strategy. Tom Cotton, a rising Republican star in Arkansas running for the seat of Representative Mike Ross, a Democrat who is retiring, said his opponent had tried to label him a Ryan ''clone.'' It will not work in his Republican-leaning district, he said, but other candidates are struggling.
Still, he said, most candidates are ready to fight for Mr. Ryan's plan.
''They recognize, as the House members already there recognize, we have to have this debate, and we have to win this debate,'' Mr. Cotton said, recalling ambush training he had in the Army when soldiers were drilled to face an attack head-on. ''This is the most predictable ambush in politics. You don't duck and cover. You turn and face it.''
Democrats are pointing to a number of recent polls, conducted by Democratic firms and suggesting that their candidates are gaining ground. On Friday, the House Majority PAC released a poll in a Minnesota race, showing that the Democratic challenger, Nick Nolan, was essentially tied with Representative Chip Cravaack, a freshman Republican.
This week, polls conducted for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee showed several Democrats in tight races with incumbent Republicans, including Patrick Murphy and Representative Allen B. West, a Tea Party-backed freshman, in a new Republican-leaning district in Florida; Dan Maffei and Representative Ann Marie Buerkle, another freshman, in a rematch from 2010 in upstate New York; and in a newly drawn district in California, Ami Bera and Representative Dan Lungren.
A poll conducted in early July by the Democratic firm Lake Research Partners for Mr. McNerney in California, who barely survived 2010 and now is running in a redrawn district far from his Bay Area base of support, showed Mr. Gill running far behind, Mr. Gill, however, pointed to a July 28 poll conducted by the Tarrance Group for his campaign that showed the race to be much closer.

HEADLINE: 2 Campaigns Differ Sharply on Medicaid, Seeking Vast Growth or Vast Cuts

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The way Mitt Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan frame it, the debate over social programs that has become a dominant theme of the presidential race is all about the future of Medicare, the government health insurance program for retirees.
But the outcome of the election will probably have a more immediate and profound effect on Medicaid, the joint state-federal program that provides health care to poor and disabled people. 
Few other issues present a starker difference between the Republican and Democratic tickets. President Obama, through the health care law that was a centerpiece of his domestic agenda, seeks a vast expansion of Medicaid, which currently covers more than 60 million Americans -- compared with 50 million in Medicare -- and costs the states and the federal government more than $400 billion a year.
To fulfill the law's goal of near-universal coverage, the president envisions adding as many as 17 million people to the rolls by allowing everyone with incomes up to 133 percent of the poverty level to enroll, including many childless adults. While the Supreme Court ruled in June that states could opt out of the expansion, Medicaid -- and federal spending on it -- is still likely to grow significantly if Mr. Obama wins a second term.
Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan would take Medicaid in the opposite direction. They would push for the repeal of the health care law and replace the current Medicaid program with block grants, giving each state a lump sum and letting them decide eligibility and benefits. (Currently, the federal government sets minimum requirements, like covering all children under the poverty level, which some states surpass. It also provides unlimited matching funds.) The grants would grow at the rate of inflation, with adjustments for population growth. Critics say annual increases would not keep up with rising health care costs.
In pure dollar terms, the difference comes down to this: As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Mr. Ryan has proposed cutting federal spending on Medicaid by $810 billion over 10 years. Mr. Obama's expansion plan, by contrast, would cost an additional $642 billion over the same period, according to the most recent estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.
For all the allegations and counterallegations about Medicare on the campaign trail, hardly any words have been uttered about Medicaid, probably because the elderly are considered a more engaged and influential voting group than the poor. But what happens to Medicaid will have a significant effect on many middle-class older people who rely on the program for nursing home care. More than half of current Medicaid spending is on the elderly and the disabled. About half of Medicaid recipients are children; an additional 25 percent are elderly or disabled people.
The sharply different visions of the two campaigns come as many states, squeezed by soaring Medicaid costs and plunging revenues, are complaining bitterly about the fact that the program is swallowing an ever-larger chunk of their budgets. States have generally not been allowed to cut Medicaid eligibility since the passage of the health care law in 2010, but many have slashed optional benefits and payments to doctors and hospitals instead. Even states that support the planned Medicaid expansion, like California and Massachusetts, have made such cuts, saying that budget crises have given them no choice.
Proponents of the Republican plan for Medicaid say block grants would be the best way to curb Medicaid spending and make the program more efficient. ''You give me a block grant, let me do whatever I want, and I will cover the right people,'' Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, said at a meeting of the National Governors Association last year.
But critics of the block grant plan say it would inevitably shrink the medical safety net for the poorest Americans. The Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research group, estimated that under a similar House budget proposal last year, 14 million to 27 million people could lose Medicaid coverage by 2021.
Republicans have proposed block grants in various forms over the years, going back to the Reagan administration. One such effort provoked a political uproar in 1995, when Congress passed legislation to give each state a fixed amount of federal money for Medicaid. President Bill Clinton vetoed the legislation, saying it would make ''devastating cuts'' and hurt millions of poor people.
Joshua Archambault, director of health care policy at the Pioneer Institute, a conservative research group in Boston, said that while block grants were ''one possible tool'' to curb spending and root out waste in Medicaid, many questions about the Republican proposal remain unanswered. One such question, he and others said, is how the federal government would determine the amount of each state's block grant.
''Congressman Ryan's plan moves the conversation in the right direction to correct the perverse incentives that have put Medicaid on an unsustainable path,'' Mr. Archambault said in an e-mail. ''But the devil's in the details.''

HEADLINE: How Greek Taxpayers Hide 11 Billion Euros a Year

BYLINE: DAN KEDMEY


HIGHLIGHT: The culture of tax evasion in Greece is widespread and "will take some time" to change. 

 BODY:
After a brief summer holiday, the euro crisis is back. Adam Davidson's latest column previews seven dramas coming to the Euro zone this fall. As usual, things begin with Greece, which has to cut its budget by an additional 11.5 billion euros in order to secure the next round of debt relief. In a surprising twist, that may be the exact amount of money that Greece loses from tax evaders each year.
Margarita Tsoutsoura, a finance professor at University of Chicago, says tax evasion is an open secret in her home country. "You encounter it in everyday life," she says. "When you go to a restaurant, they will not give you receipts. When you go to the doctor, they will not give receipts." Tsoutsoura wanted to know just how much money was tucked away in this paperless economy. But how could she tally up secret stashes of cash, short of peeking under people's mattresses? It turns out the Greek banks had already taken a peek for her.
Banks have an incentive to estimate the "true" incomes of their clients, so that they know how much money to lend them. Over the years, banks have created estimates of true incomes by gathering data on occupations, salaries and loan histories. One of Greece's largest banks shared this wealth of data with Tsoutsoura and her research colleagues. A result is a new study that provides startling insights into the culture of tax evasion.
For starters, the average self-employed worker in Greece makes almost twice as much money as he or she reports on tax forms. And among the self-employed, those who are doctors, lawyers or other highly paid professionals with scant paper trails - due to the fact that they provide a service and don't have a detailed inventory of inputs - tend to be the most agile tax evaders. The total loss to the government is more than $11 billion euros a year, enough to resolve Greece's immediate budget crisis.
So why hasn't the government cracked down on tax evasion? It could have something to do with a recent riot on Hydra, where more than 200 people attacked the police for arresting a local tax evader. As one local hotel owner put it, both sides overreacted to "the common incident of tax evasion."
Tsoutsoura says, "It will take some time for this culture to change." Time, unfortunately, is a luxury Greece does not have, as its creditors demand immediate and far-reaching austerity measures. Read the full column to see how the next few months could seal the euro's fate.

HEADLINE: Breathing Life Into a Dead Language

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: The Vatican wants to revive Latin for the benefit not only of the church but of the wider secular world. But what are the advantages of knowing a dead language in a global economy that operates in languages such as English and Mandarin? 

 BODY:
LONDON - It seems that Latin is a dead language that refuses to lie down.
Reports from the Vatican say Pope Benedict XVI is launching an initiative to establish a new Papal Latin Academy to promote the language, not only within the Catholic Church but also in the secular world and in schools.
Italy's La Stampa on Friday quoted Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, who heads the Vatican's cultural council, as saying eminent scholars from a number of countries would be hired to assist the enterprise.
Although Latin is the official language of the Church, it has been in decline since Vatican reforms in the 1960s introduced the use of vernacular languages in the liturgy. 
The reforms were bitterly opposed by ultra-traditionalists who were recently in negotiations with the Vatican on the terms of their possible return to the Church of Rome.
But, leaving aside any ecclesiastical motive for reviving Latin, is it worth resurrecting the language of the Roman Empire in the wider secular world?
Fluency in Latin and Ancient Greek was once the hallmark of an educated European. Familiarity with the works of the likes of Julius Caesar and Cicero was seen as an adequate, if vital resource for running Europe's empires. 
Aspirational parents are these days more likely to want their offspring to speak Mandarin or Arabic. Knowledge of English, the modern , is the of survival in the global economy.
Yet Latin doggedly hangs on. 
Recent figures showed that the study of Mandarin was floundering in British schools amid a general decline in the numbers of students taking language courses. Latin, however, was experiencing a revival, with a 7.5 percent increase in student numbers.
It is the same in Germany, where a third of high school students will be studying Latin this year and the language places third after English and French as an exam choice.
Traditionalists look kindly on a Latin revival in schools - no doubt regarding the compulsory conjugation of Latin verbs as the linguistic version of the lash - but even its partisans struggle to explain its popularity.
Writing on a revival of Latin studies in American schools back in 2008, my colleague Winnie Hu quoted Latin scholars as saying the trend really took off as the language infiltrated popular culture, including J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books.
The Hogwarts motto, "Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus," is Latin for "Never Tickle a Sleeping Dragon."
- Harry Potter World (@PotterWorldUK) August 30, 2012
Classicists argue that Latin is a sound preparation for learning other languages, and the structure of one's own, and for developing cognitive skills. 
The Rev. Romano Nicolini, an Italian priest involved in the Pope's initiative, says simply: "Latin teaches us to show respect for beautiful things and it also teaches us to value our roots." 
 (Donald Clark, a British blogger, provides an alternative 10-point list of reasons why NOT to teach Latin.)
It is, however, a language ill-suited to conveying modern concepts. Scholars at Latinitas, the Vatican's existing Latin foundation, struggle to keep up with the 21th century with frequent updates to their lexicon. 
New coinings include for mountain bike, a conveyance unknown in Caesar's time, and for blue jeans, a garment that post-dates the toga. 
If you know Latin or not, let us know whether you think it's a language worth promoting and preserving. Leave a comment below or send us an - an e-mail.

HEADLINE: Obama Visits Swing States Before Convention

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: With his party's nominating convention approaching, President Obama started a four-day campaign swing in Iowa on Saturday, returning to the state where he opened his unlikely quest for the presidency five years ago. 

 BODY:
URBANDALE, Iowa - With his party's nominating convention approaching next week, President Obama started a four-day, four-state campaign trip in Iowa on Saturday, the state where he opened his quest for the presidency five years ago.
It was Mr. Obama's seventh visit to the state this year, and his 13th as president, reflecting the importance of this swing state's six electoral votes to his prospects of winning the necessary 270 votes in a close, unpredictable election.
Speaking to an estimated 10,000 supporters at an outdoor rally in this rural town near Des Moines, Mr. Obama lampooned Mitt Romney's just-concluded Republican convention as heavy on criticism of the president, bereft of new proposals and stuck on ideas of the past.
"You might as well have watched it on a black-and-white TV," said Mr. Obama, to the applause and amusement of his audience. He offered a summary, "Everything's bad, it's Obama's fault and Gov. Romney is going to be the one who knows the secret to creating jobs and growing the economy."
"There was a lot of talk about hard truths and bold choices, but nobody ever actually bothered to tell you what they were," he added. "And when Gov. Romney had his chance to let you in on his secrets, he did not offer a single new idea - just retreads of the same old policies that have been sticking it to the middle class for years."
Mr. Romney and other Republicans did not provide policy details, Mr. Obama said, "because they know you won't like it, because you've lived through it and you can't afford to repeat it."
He said he opposed their ideas of providing additional tax cuts to wealthy Americans and turning Medicare into a voucher program for future beneficiaries. And Mr. Obama criticized Republicans for their vows to undo laws tightening regulations of financial institutions, expanding health insurance coverage, and protecting the quality of air and water.
Mr. Obama, who was introduced at the rally by Lucas Beenken, a veteran of the Iraq war, for the first time pointed to an omission in Mr. Romney's speech accepting his party's nomination: "Gov. Romney had nothing to say about Afghanistan last week, let alone offer a plan for the 33,000 troops who will have come home from the war by the end of this month."
"You know, he said ending the war in Iraq was tragic; I said we'd end that war and we did. I said we'd take out Bin Laden and we did" - a line that drew among the biggest bursts of applause and chants of "U.S.A." from the crowd.
After his first appearance, Mr. Obama did interviews with three local television stations from separate parts of the state, before flying to Sioux City, Iowa. From there he goes to Colorado on Sunday and then Ohio, both battleground states.
On Monday he will take a detour from campaigning to tour the storm damage in Louisiana, a solid Republican state, and visit Virginia, a swing state, on Tuesday before arriving for the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: After Fed Action, Then What?

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: There was broad agreement in Jackson Hole, Wyo., that the stimulus that the Fed is considering, and may announce in two weeks, will not revive the economy. Indeed, given the magnitude of the looming "fiscal cliff," they may not even be enough to prevent a recession. 

 BODY:
JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- The Fed is on the verge of expanding its stimulus policies. We learned that much during the meetings in Jackson Hole, Wyo. But what may be more interesting is the undercurrent of discussion about what happens when those measures prove insufficient.
There was broad agreement at the conference that the actions the Fed is considering, and may announce in two weeks, will not revive the economy. Indeed, given the magnitude of the looming "fiscal cliff," they may not even be enough to prevent a recession.
Some economists and policy makers - notably the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke - say they believe that the new Fed policies would still have significant benefits. Some are dubious. But no one seems to think it will suffice.
What more can be done? Well, pretty much everyone here is upset about the breakdown of fiscal policy, which is becoming a principal drag on growth.
Indeed, quite a few attendees regard that as the entire issue. They do not agree on what fiscal policies are needed. (The grab bag includes tax cuts and spending increases, household debt reduction and government debt reduction.) But they do agree that monetary policy has basically done (almost) all that it can. 
Others, however, see opportunities to do more. The most concrete proposal, which I wrote about Friday, came from Michael Woodford, an economics professor at Columbia University, who told the conference that the Fed could lift growth now by announcing that it will tolerate higher inflation later, as the economy begins to recover. Professor Woodford sought to rebut two critiques of this idea, by presenting evidence that the Fed has the power to move inflation upward, and that it could do so temporarily without losing the credibility of its long-term commitment to maintain inflation at the 2 percent level it considers most healthy.
Adam S. Posen, an American economist who served until Friday on the Bank of England's policy-making committee, urged central banks to consider providing cheap financing for areas of the economy that are starved for credit. The Bank of England has introduced such a program. And the Fed's purchases of mortgage-backed securities - which would likely be expanded as part of any new program of asset purchases - are similar in spirit. Opponents view efforts like these as a form of fiscal policy, a position Mr. Posen derided as "a prehistoric way of thinking."
Alan S. Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors, reiterated his suggestion that the Fed should start charging banks for the reserves they keep with it, reversing its current policy of paying them a modest rate of interest on those balances. As he wrote recently in The Wall Street Journal, "If the Fed reduces the reward for holding excess reserves, banks will hold less of them - which means they will have to find something else to do with the money, such as lending it out or putting it in the capital markets."
But the Fed has shown little appetite for new measures. Mr. Bernanke appears focused instead on building a consensus for the expansion of existing policies, for reasons that Greg Ip ably described for The Economist.
The two main options under consideration are an expansion of the Fed's asset purchases, and an extension of its prediction that it will maintain short-term interest rates near zero until late 2014, at least. Economists generally concur the benefits of such policies would be no more than modest.
Conservatives at the conference expressed opposition to even those efforts. Any benefits, they warned, are outweighed by the risk of inflation, and by the potential consequences to the Fed's independence - for its ability to operate normally in normal times.
The Republican Party included a plank in its election platform calling for increased Congressional oversight of monetary policy, and there are perpetual rumblings that Republicans will push legislation instructing the Fed to focus solely on inflation, instead of its current dual responsibility for inflation and unemployment. 
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former Fed governor and adviser to President George W. Bush, said Friday that the experience of the last two decades should teach economists and central bankers, "Modesty in what we express and can do."
That could serve as a motto for central bankers, who are cautious by nature and profession. Donald L. Kohn, a former Fed vice chairman, asked Saturday why the Fed's unprecedented efforts so far had produced "so little growth." 
"The fact that we keep trying to bring spending from the future to the present with lower and lower interest rates, are there diminishing returns?" he asked. "There's a lot we don't understand and it's hard to make policy if you don't."

HEADLINE: Electric Honda Plays Hard to Get

BYLINE: By JIM MOTAVALLI

 BODY:
TESTED 2013 Honda Fit EV
WHAT IS IT? A battery version of the popular subcompact hatchback.
HOW MUCH? $389 a month in a three-year lease. There is no purchase option.
WHAT MAKES IT RUN? Coaxial electric motor with a maximum output of 92 kilowatts, coupled to a relatively small 20-kilowatt-hour Toshiba battery pack.
WHAT'S THE RANGE? The E.P.A.'s ''real world'' estimate is 82 miles in combined city and highway driving. The E.P.A. also rates the car at the electric equivalent of 118 miles per gallon combined. Results will vary considerably depending on how you drive. 
HOW LONG TO RECHARGE? At 240 volts, less than three hours from the ''low charge'' indicator (15 percent of range remaining).
ALTERNATIVES Nissan Leaf SL, $38,100 before a $7,500 federal income tax credit; the Leaf can be leased for three years at $369 a month. Mitsubishi i-MiEV SE, $31,975 (before the federal tax credit).
AS the original owner of a fuel-frugal 2007 Honda Fit that has largely justified my faith in it, I've long wanted to get behind the wheel of its even more environmentally friendly electric sibling, the 2013 Fit EV. Honda didn't make it easy for me, by restricting distribution to just 1,100 cars for the 2013 and 2014 model years and making them available initially only in California and Oregon. But with the Fit EV coming to the New York metropolitan area next spring, I was able to snare a few days in an electric-blue test car.
The low production numbers suggest that Honda is building the Fit EV primarily to comply with the demand of California regulators that mass-market automakers build some zero-emission vehicles. Even so, a lot of thought went into building the car.
The Fit EV is nicely packaged. The lithium-ion battery pack is under the floor, so there's no significant intrusion into the cabin or cargo area. The rear seats fold but, alas, the EV lacks the ''magic seat,'' which easily folds in various ways, that makes the regular Fit so versatile. The Fit EV can seat five, with good rear legroom for a car of its size.
At a glance, the Fit EV seems to lack the lavish Internet-inspired dashboard displays of the Leaf or the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid. But the car conveys much of the same information in a low-key way. For example, the Leaf uses a graphic display to reveal how much power the accessories are drawing. In the Fit EV, blue lights remind you that the air-conditioning or other systems are on, sucking up electrons.
For the range-anxious -- nearly everyone who will drive this car -- the remaining miles are displayed in a numeric digital readout and a conventional gauge with a charger icon. Their opinions sometimes seem to differ slightly. A power-charge indicator shows whether the batteries are adding power or losing it.
The three drive modes -- Sport, Normal, Econ -- are color-coded. If you punch the Econ button, the dash lights up in feel-good-about-yourself green; if you choose the sporting option, a red glow warns you that you're living dangerously, at least so far as the car's range is concerned.
Luckily, this electric car makes it easy to hoard miles. Selecting Econ mode and shifting into B (for braking) may not yield the fastest acceleration, but it certainly conserves energy. The B setting maximizes regenerative braking while enabling one-pedal driving; when you lift off the accelerator the car slows right down, sending power to the batteries and adding miles of travel.
Driving in Sport mode uses the motor's full 92-kilowatt output (equivalent to 123 horsepower) and provides acceleration that matches or at least comes close to the gasoline version of the car. It was fun to grab onto the instant 189 pound-feet of torque that makes acceleration to 30 m.p.h. so exhilarating. But the rapidly fading range -- in a flash, 104 miles became 84 -- soon had me back in Econ mode, which makes 63 horsepower. In any mode, the Fit's inherently good handling is enhanced by the EV's low center of gravity.
I made a game of staying ahead of the range curve, with stop-and-go traffic offering a good opportunity to add regenerated power to the battery pack. On a night out that included a folk concert at the town hall in Newtown, Conn., I covered 36 miles even though the range indicator dropped by only 15 miles. The 18-mile return trip was mostly downhill, which enabled lots of coasting and so much regenerated energy that I arrived home with 74 miles of range left -- exactly what I'd had when I left Newtown.

HEADLINE: Expanding Her Efforts To Be a Role Model

BYLINE: By IRINA ALEKSANDER

 BODY:
ONE afternoon in late July, traffic stopped in Manhattan so that a small parade of models could cross the street. They entered the Coffee Shop, a restaurant in Union Square, and descended to a dimly lighted subterranean lounge with leather banquettes and Champagne buckets filled with mini cartons of coconut water. The girls, most of them around 16 years old, wore shorts and tank tops along with chunky heels and too much eye makeup.
''These are really the babies, but to me, this is the perfect group,'' said Coco Rocha, the 23-year-old model, who was there to give a lesson on modeling and social media. She was wearing slim black pants, black boots and a snug white blazer over an oxford shirt buttoned to the neck. Her red hair was pulled up into a neat topknot. 
''Who here has a Tumblr blog?'' she asked, addressing an audience of several dozen. Ten hesitant hands sprouted. Ms. Rocha smiled. ''O.K., what we're going to talk about in class today is how important it is to brand yourself.'' Ms. Rocha, who used to teach dance to 4-year-olds, stood with one foot planted firmly in front of the other, pumping her right knee in the manner of a cabaret dancer as she spoke. ''You cannot be just another pretty face,'' she added. ''Do you know how many girls there are in New York right now?''
More than just a pretty face, Ms. Rocha is one of the few models who has become known by just her first name. At a moment when the fashion industry has increasingly marginalized models -- to anonymous, size 0 waifs, a life span of three seasons (that's a year and a half in human years), and off the magazine covers in place of celebrities like Jennifer Lopez and Lady Gaga -- she has emerged as the model's liberator.
Her message is about reclaiming power in a profession that has been depleted of it. Her medium is the Web, where Ms. Rocha has acquired millions of followers across 13 social media platforms (400,000 on Twitter; 197,000 on Instagram; and 1.6 million on Google Plus, to name a few). Translating this popularity into a calculated, career-prolonging strategy, Ms. Rocha has earned spokeswoman gigs typically reserved for actresses, a secondary role as an advocate for model's rights, and now, one of the most high-profile jobs of her career. This fall, Ms. Rocha will begin filming episodes of ''The Face'' on the Oxygen network (imagine ''The Voice'' for models), appearing alongside Naomi Campbell and Karolina Kurkova as a celebrity coach.
Long gone is the era of the supermodel, but if there was ever a hope for its return, Ms. Rocha just might be it. ''Fashion is obviously cyclical and Coco is a testament that we're getting back to that a little bit,'' said Valerie Boster, the bookings editor at Vogue. ''For a while we had these anonymous faces that changed every season and designers who maybe didn't want a model to insert her own personality or label, but Coco is very different. Coco is a brand of her own, which is what accounts for her longevity.''
The Coffee Shop event, sponsored by Tumblr, provided a glimpse into the kind of advice Ms. Rocha will presumably dispense on the show. To harness the rewards of social media, she told the roomful of eager faces, a model must post original content (''I don't care if it's about cats, just make it the best cat Tumblr out there''); update every day (''I get tired of posting, too, but we have to think about the future''); and show clients that a model's online following is worth something (''People pay big bucks for a Kim Kardashian to talk about something, but what about you?'').
When she began taking questions, a young girl with an Australian accent asked how Ms. Rocha was able to make it as a model despite turning down shoots she deemed too provocative. (Ms. Rocha, raised a Jehovah's Witness, is well known for never posing nude or seminude, which includes lingerie and swimwear.)
''I'm an overzealous poser: One-two-three-four,'' said Ms. Rocha, striking a pose a second, a skill that has earned her the title ''queen of posing'' from Tyra Banks. ''I'm known for this, it's my brand. You go home tonight and you write down, 'What is my brand? Am I the sexy girl? Am I the sporty girl?' You are a company and you're going to brand yourself.''
On the morning that Oxygen announced the show's celebrity lineup, Ms. Rocha was sitting on the porch of her Westchester home, which stands on a hill and overlooks a wild garden. Ms. Rocha and her husband, the muralist James Conran, recently sold their Gramercy Park condo for a reported $1.51 million; the couple has been renting in Hastings-on-Hudson since March to try on life in the suburbs. ''It's weird to have to drive every time you want to get food,'' Ms. Rocha said, ''but then again, we found all these cute little chains, like the Cheesecake Factory.''
Ms. Rocha was wearing snakeskin-print jeans, a black T-shirt and no shoes. She offered her visitor a soft drink: Coke, Diet Coke or Coke Zero. As part of an ongoing effort to balance her high-fashion work with more commercial spokeswoman roles, Ms. Rocha last year appeared in a Diet Coke campaign shot by Karl Lagerfeld.
''For so long we were told that we had to be quiet, hush-hush, that fashion had to be untouchable,'' Ms. Rocha said. ''In the beginning I thought maybe I shouldn't do that or say that or take that job because it's not high fashion enough. But when high fashion is done with you, guess what? You go back to your parents' basement and no one ever hears from you again.''
Ms. Rocha grew up south of Vancouver in the shoreline city of Richmond, British Columbia. Her mother is an Air Canada flight attendant; her father works as a V.I.P. travel concierge in Toronto. Scouted at an Irish dance competition at age 14, Ms. Rocha, in a few short years, went from doing catalog shoots in Asia to working with the star-making photographer Steven Meisel, to dancing the jig down Jean Paul Gaultier's runway in 2007. That year, American Vogue featured her on its cover as one of ''The World's Next Top Models,'' announcing the ''Coco Moment'' and suggesting that the industry was ready for another supermodel.
But Linda, Christy and Naomi were illusive, glamorous creatures that levitated high above the masses. Ms. Rocha's approach to her career is, in turn, more populist -- a dismantling of the pyramid. On the Web is where she reveals the more prosaic moments of a model's existence, responds to fans and airs grievances against the industry. ''I'm a 21-year-old model, 6 inches taller and 10 sizes smaller than the average American woman,'' Ms. Rocha wrote on Tumblr two years ago after reports surfaced that she had gained a few pounds. ''Yet in another parallel universe I am considered 'fat.' ''
Her Instagram is a series of snapshots that, alongside glossy campaign images, show Ms. Rocha watching ''Hoarders'' in bed with the model Karlie Kloss and awaiting delayed flights atop heaps of luggage. (Unlike the supermodels, Ms. Rocha's generation of models often fly economy and stay in three-star hotels.) More recently on Twitter, addressing a series of Photoshop injustices, Ms. Rocha wrote, ''Hey, photoshop guys! Can you please be sure to count two arms and two legs on the girls you cut and paste? Thanks!! Sincerely, Models.''
And yet the fashion industry, which has generally preferred its models to be seen and not heard, has embraced Ms. Rocha's candor. Anna Wintour invited Ms. Rocha to participate in the yearly Council of Fashion Designers of America's Health Initiative conferences and speak about the weight and age pressures facing models. (Earlier this year, the C.F.D.A. released a new set of guidelines, urging designers and magazines to not hire models under 16; Ms. Rocha is now on the board of the Model Alliance, a nonprofit group recently formed to improve working conditions for models.) Clients, meanwhile, began to see the marketing potential of hiring a model with a built-in audience of five million. ''Heading to Rome decked out in #Longchamp travel gear -- One of the perks of being the campaign girl!'' Ms. Rocha tweeted recently.
''I'm not interested in a new girl every season,'' said the designer Zac Posen, who has booked Ms. Rocha for his runways for the last six years. ''I'd rather have a girl like Coco who's not just a hanger but a brand all by herself. In a time when the industry doesn't promote models having voices, she's really broken the mold.'' (Because of the shooting schedule of ''The Face,'' Ms. Rocha will not be appearing in the shows that make up New York Fashion Week, which begins Wednesday.)
In April, Ms. Rocha became the first model to surpass one million followers on Google Plus. She has reached an additional two million fans on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. ''She's really ahead of the curve,'' said Roman Young, the director of Wilhelmina Models and Ms. Rocha's agent. ''I mean, how many people think about a market for themselves in China?''
''The reason why celebrities sell covers is because they have huge followings,'' Ms. Rocha said. ''But models have that, too. You just had to give us a chance to speak.''
As she spoke, Mr. Conran, 31, came downstairs wearing black jeans and a teal button-up over a graphic T-shirt. It was Mr. Conran who suggested, when the couple began dating in 2009, that an amplified social media presence could prolong her career. Now, helping to manage it along with her agents, he had spent his morning updating Ms. Rocha's many social media hubs.
''Sometimes it's fun, but it can get mundane, too,'' he said of maintaining his wife's digital empire, a full-time job. For the last year, Mr. Conran, who has become a self-taught graphic designer and photographer, has had almost no time for his career as a mural painter. ''For a while, I was trying to do both, but I was getting exhausted and irritable,'' he said.
''If we weren't together, I probably would've burned out and went home by now,'' Ms. Rocha said. ''And you'd be painting.''
Mr. Conran quickly reassumed the role of the affable husband. ''I could always paint,'' he said, ''but Coco really only has one shot at making her career.''
The fleeting window Mr. Conran was referring to was not in regard to establishing Ms. Rocha's modeling career -- she's already done that -- but maintaining it while laying down the groundwork for what comes after, a perpetual dilemma for the aging model. Kate Moss and Erin Wasson designed clothing lines. Irina Lazareanu and Karen Elson recorded music. Iman and Miranda Kerr founded beauty lines. But a lucrative TV career has often come at the cost of a model's standing within the fashion world; Tyra Banks and Heidi Klum are, at this point, arguably better known as media moguls than as models.
So far, Ms. Rocha has been able to walk the fraught tightrope between high fashion and commercial work rather effortlessly -- simultaneously working for John Galliano, Louis Vuitton and Chanel, as well as for Ann Taylor Loft, Nordstrom and Esprit. But could she succeed in the realm of reality TV without having to forfeit her career as a high fashion model?
Ms. Rocha's hero is Cindy Crawford, who in the late 1980s, against her agent's advice, accepted a job as the host of MTV's ''House of Style.'' The move eventually made her a household name and earned her a Pepsi campaign. Today, Ms. Crawford is best known for her namesake furniture line that is sold at Raymour & Flanigan. ''I don't know that Coco is a sign of times changing as much as she will be the changer of times,'' Ms. Crawford said recently. ''I mean, is it possible for designers to sell at Target?'' She added, ''Ten years ago everyone would say no, but now you've got Cavalli at H&M.''
''The Face,'' which is set to be broadcast early next year, will show Ms. Rocha and her celebrity fellow mentors coaching teams of aspiring models as they compete to become ''the face'' of a yet-to-be-disclosed brand. Like ''America's Next Top Model,'' the contestants will be taught to pose and walk the runway (the former ''Top Model'' judge Nigel Barker has signed on as the host); but the network insists that the challenges will be more authentic than the contrived, outlandish antics ''Top Model'' has become known for, all the while failing to produce any actual top models.
''I want to bring back the poise and glamour,'' said Ms. Campbell, who is supervising model castings for the series. ''When you're a model, you're an illusion. I don't want to see fighting or any of that stuff. It spoils the fantasy. We want a girl that will really be in magazines and walk the runways in Paris, London, Milan and New York.''
Ms. Rocha's hope for the show, at least as far as her own career is concerned, is somewhat contrary. ''I think it will make Middle America know who I am,'' she said over a lunch of spinach salad and grilled Cuban sandwiches. ''Not that that's the biggest goal of my life, but if there are companies deciding between a model and a celebrity, the celebrity usually wins. This could change that.''
The afternoon light was filtering into the dining room and Mr. Conran began clearing the empty plates. ''I just don't want you to turn into a fashion monster who says 'darling' and 'fabulous,' '' he teased. ''No slogans, O.K.?''
Ms. Rocha shook her head.

HEADLINE: Can Europe Survive The Rise of the Rest?

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY GARTON ASH. 
Professor of European studies at Oxford University and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.

 BODY:
Oxford, England
WHO won the most medals at the Olympics? Europe. Who has the largest economy in the world? Europe again. And where do most people want to go on holiday? Europe, of course. On many measures of power, the European Union belongs with the United States and China in a global Big Three. Yet say that to officials in Beijing, Washington or any other world capital today and they would probably laugh out loud. As European leaders stagger into yet another round of crisis summitry, this potential superpower is widely viewed as the sick man of the developed world.
Why? The flawed design of the euro zone has made Europe's recession more acute than America's, and a collapse of the euro zone would drag the rest of the world economy down with it. But why haven't Europeans shown the political will to save the euro zone by moving toward closer fiscal and political union? What happened to the forces that drove the project of European unification forward over the last 60 years? And, if those have faded, where might Europeans find new inspiration? 
As I recently argued in Foreign Affairs, the five great drivers of European unification since the 1950s have now either disappeared or lost much of their energy.
First and foremost was the personal memory of war, and the mantra of ''never again,'' which motivated three generations of Europeans after 1945. But the last generation to have experienced World War II is passing on, and the collective memory is weak.
Second, the Soviet threat provided a powerful incentive for Western Europeans to unite during the cold war. And throughout the cold war, the United States was an active supporter of European integration, from the Marshall Plan to the diplomacy around German reunification. No longer. Try as he might, Vladimir Putin is no Joseph Stalin. And these days, the United States has other priorities.
Third, until the 1990s, the engine of European integration was the Federal Republic of Germany, with France at the steering wheel. Germans felt a powerful idealistic desire to rehabilitate themselves in the European family of nations -- and had a hard national interest in doing so. For only by gaining the trust of their neighbors and international partners could they achieve German reunification. Now that national purpose has been accomplished, and European idealism has faded with the passing of the wartime generations. These days, Germany will no longer reach for its checkbook whenever Europe calls.
Fourth, the once captive nations of Eastern Europe are no longer uniformly passionate about the European Union even though their citizens have more recent memories of dictatorship, hardship and war. While Poland is one of the union's most vigorous advocates, Hungary and the Czech Republic are now among its most skeptical and contentious members.
Finally, the widespread assumption that ''Europe'' would mean a rising standard of living and social security for all Europeans has been badly dented by accumulated debt, aging populations, global competition and the crisis of the euro zone. Young Greeks and Spaniards hardly see those benefits today.
Nonetheless, even in the most skeptical countries there is a basic understanding that it is better to belong to a single market of 500 million consumers, rather than depend on a domestic one of 50 million, or fewer than 10 million -- the size of half the European Union's current members.
And that is the beginning of the new case for European unification. While we Europeans should redouble our efforts to ensure that our continent does not forget its troubled past, the need for scale is the key to our shared future. The 21st-century world will be one of giants: weary old ones, like the United States and Russia, and hungry new ones, like China, India, Brazil and South Africa. You do not need to accept the most apocalyptic forecasts of European decline to acknowledge that Europe is unlikely to remain the world's largest economy for long. In such a world, even Germany will be a small- to medium-size power.
IF Europeans are to preserve the remarkable combination of prosperity, peace, relative social security and quality of life that they have achieved over the last 60 years, they need the scale that only the European Union can provide.
In a world of giants, you had better be a giant yourself: A trade negotiation between China and the European Union is a conversation between equals; one between China and France is an unequal affair.
A decade ago, Chinese policy makers took the European Union seriously as an emerging political force, a potential new pole in a multipolar world. Today, they treat it with something close to contempt. They look to Brussels only in a few specific areas, like trade and competition policy, where the European Union really does act as one. Otherwise, they prefer to deal with individual nations, as this week's reception in Beijing for Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, made clear.
The remedy lies in Europe's own hands. Were it to move beyond the resolution of the euro zone crisis into a closer fiscal and political union, then onto a genuinely common foreign policy, China would take it more seriously, as would America and Russia.
And Europeans should not entirely abandon the hope -- faint though it looks today -- that their pioneering version of peaceful integration between previously warring states could point the way for better ''global governance'' in response to shared threats like climate change and to the tensions that inevitably arise between rising and declining powers. For without enhanced cooperation on a global scale, the 21st-century world may come to look like the late-19th-century Europe of rivalrous great powers, writ large. At best, Europe could become not just another giant; it could offer the example of a new kind of cooperative multinational giant.
When Ms. Merkel's 19th-century predecessor Otto von Bismarck was shown a map of Africa by an eager German colonialist, the Iron Chancellor, dismissing the strategic value of faraway colonies, replied that the only map that mattered to him lay in Europe: ''France is to the left, Russia to the right, we're in the middle -- that's my map of Africa.'' Today's Europeans need to adapt Bismarck's wisdom, declaring ''China, India and Russia are to the right, America and Brazil to the left -- that's our map of Europe.''

HEADLINE: Vermont Biking: It's All Downhill

BYLINE: By WARREN CORNWALL

 BODY:
IT was an idyllic Vermont view from halfway up Burke Mountain. A patchwork of forest and pasture rolled westward to a distant mountain ridge. Puffy white clouds hung in a blue sky. But I was focused on a brown ribbon that plunged down the slope like a dirt bobsled track, nervously clenching the handlebars of a hulking bicycle that resembled a motocross motorcycle.
''Try to relax,'' my instructor, Lilias Ide, was saying to me and six other middle-aged mountain bikers.
I had come to Vermont's northeast corner on the advice of a friend who had heard me complaining about the roots and rocks that make many New England mountain bike trails so jarring. In this area, known as the Northeast Kingdom, instead of teeth-rattling boulders, glaciers had deposited a massive ridge of sand known as Darling Hill. 
Local die-hard mountain bikers knew a good thing when they saw it. Over the last 20 years -- first as an impromptu group of bike fanatics, later as the nonprofit Kingdom Trail Association -- they adopted defunct cross-country ski trails and carved new ones. The result is the Kingdom Trails, a network of more than 100 miles. Bike Magazine declared it the best trail system in North America for 2008.
Cashing in on the enthusiasm, two years ago the local Burke Mountain Resort opened a chairlift in the summer to ferry mountain bikers to the top of a ski run, charging them $30 for a day pass. Last year the trail association started offering downhill classes, dubbed ''Gravity School,'' aimed squarely at people like me.
Though cross-country mountain biking is my preferred niche, I had watched downhill riding -- in which cyclists plunge down precipitous mountains, cliffs or, in this case, ski runs -- from afar, half awed and half mystified at the sport's allure. Now, with an instructor and rental gear, including bikes with huge shock absorbers, extra-wide tires and hefty disc brakes, this was my chance to see what it was all about.
AS we prepared to descend, Ms. Ide offered some advice in a casual, matter-of-fact way that mirrored both her expertise and her outfit. While we all wore white plastic armor that had us resembling riot police, she was on a pink bike bearing the brand name Sinister, wearing baggy shorts and kneepads. Huge silver hoop earrings poked out from under her helmet.
Look down the trail to see what's coming, not directly in front of your wheel, she told us. Look where you want to go, because that's where you will steer. Don't sit down. Standing on the pedals keeps you nimble.
We opened with an appetizer of sorts. With Ms. Ide in the lead, we rolled single file over little humps and through sweeping turns for several hundred yards. No problem. Ms. Ide stopped and previewed the section ahead. It was a set of downhill snaking curves with high, banked sides, one right after the other. I set off with a tightening in my gut. Nearly shooting straight into dirt walls as I twisted and turned around the course, I found myself locking up the brakes and staring at my front wheel, willing it to not fly off the uphill lip of the trail. Somehow, I arrived at the bottom unscathed and jittery with adrenaline.
Forty-five minutes and several runs later, we steered toward Knightslayer, the area's premier downhill run. The map showed two black diamonds on it: experts only. It was a slender trail snaking through a forest of maple trees and studded with jumps built from mounds of dirt. The most ubiquitous were ''tabletops'' -- steep six-foot-tall ramps, topped with a plateau and ending in another plunging slope. The best riders zip up the ramp, fly over the top and land on the far side. The less brave jump onto the plateau and roll down. At the first tabletop, I barely worked up enough nerve and speed to creep up and onto the top. At that moment my biggest fear was losing so much speed that I would stop on the ramp and fall over backward -- an embarrassment I narrowly avoided.
But halfway down the hill, something clicked as I approached another tabletop. The pressure of decelerating as I started into the jump gave way to a brief moment of weightlessness as I became airborne, ending with a satisfying thud as I landed on top and rolled down the far side. I repeated the maneuver on another tabletop, then sped behind Ms. Ide off a four-foot drop, landing with surprising softness.
An hour and a half after class began, she declared us graduates of ''Gravity 101.''
We had 45 minutes before the deadline to return our bicycles. I tagged along with a group from Ottawa as we raced to the chairlift like elementary school students rushing to recess. The next few runs down Knightslayer were a blur of whoops and cheers. ''I feel like a kid,'' said Luc Chabot, a 44-year-old librarian, as he peeled off his body armor in the rental shop, where we arrived five minutes late after squeezing in one last trip down the mountain.
I rode my own, decidedly less souped up mountain bike into East Burke, a tiny village in the trails area. Cars bristling with rooftop bikes filled dirt parking lots. Packs of Lycra-clad cyclists lounged in front of the general store or stood in line outside Chappy's Ice Cream. Families splashed in the east branch of the Passumpsic River just behind East Burke Sports, the village bike shop. A sign next to the swimming hole read ''Please Do Not Wash Bikes in River.'' French was as common as English, adding an international flavor. With the Canadian border just 40 miles away, Canadians -- many from French-speaking Quebec -- accounted for nearly half of the 51,000 visits to the trails in 2011.
The rise of biking has been an economic boon in this remote, hardscrabble part of Vermont. Once largely dependent on fall-foliage watchers and the modest Burke Mountain Resort ski area, inns and campgrounds now advertise mountain biking packages. East Burke's population of several hundred can swell to over a thousand on a summer weekend.
At Willy's, an upscale restaurant in the village, I dined on pan-seared halibut with my wife, Shala Erlich, who had gone on her own mountain bike ride during my lesson. Around us, guests chatted about the day's adventures. Shala was less thrilled about her day. A novice mountain biker, she acquired several bruises after making a wrong turn on a steep expert trail.
The next morning, after breakfast at the Inn at Mountain View Farm -- a grand farmhouse and dairy converted to a spacious 14-room inn -- we made a quick circuit of a beginners' biking loop. The trail started on the inn's property, behind a red barn dating to 1890. We rode through a field of knee-high grass and down a gently sloping trail shaded by maples and beech trees. Ferns carpeted the forest floor, and the calls of robins, wood thrushes and blue jays filled the trees. It was a serene contrast to the previous day.
Afterward, Shala opted for a 1.7-mile solo hike up Mount Pisgah, above Lake Willoughby, and I met up with three friends, all biking enthusiasts, who offered to take me on a greatest-hits tour of the Kingdom Trails.
WE spent the next two hours picking the best of dozens of interlocking routes. We would ride up Darling Hill, then plunge back down on twisting trails with names like Tap & Die and Troll Stroll. We pedaled through dimly lit forests, sunny meadows and forests of cedar and balsam fir, pausing for lunch at the Market Café, a shack in the woods that had been converted into a sandwich shop.
Near the end of the ride, we stopped at a final downhill. One of my group, Jennie, described the route ahead -- some tabletops, followed by tight turns. You can just ride around the tabletops if you want to, she said to me. Buoyed by my newfound downhill knowledge, I told her I could probably handle it. We started the descent, with me trailing behind. I rose up the first ramp and then I was flying in the air, earning a ''Whoa!'' from some kids who were watching from the sidelines. Music to a middle-aged man's ears. Then we swooped into turns, shooting through gaps in the trees.
I recalled a scene from a Star Wars movie that I had watched as a child, when the characters had chased each other through a forest on what amounted to airborne jet skis. It was thrilling to watch, but this, I thought, is as close as you can get in real life.
IF YOU GO
A day pass for the Kingdom Trails costs $15. A 90-minute Gravity School lesson costs $79, including a lift ticket and rental of a downhill bike, body armor and helmet. The Kingdom Trail Association, which manages the school and the trails, also acts as a hub for visitor information (802-626-0737; kingdomtrails.com). The trail system opens in early May and closes in late October.
PLACES TO STAY
The Inn at Mountain View Farm (3383 Darling Hill Road; 800-572-4509; innmtnview.com). Located in the middle of the trail system, the historic dairy farm has 14 guest rooms and suites. Rates start at $175, and include breakfast.
There are numerous campgrounds, as well as condominiums and town houses for rent around the Burke Mountain Resort.
PLACES TO EAT
Willy's Restaurant and Catering (570 Route 114; 800-626-9900; willysrestaurant.net). An upscale restaurant with a range of well prepared, if not daring, dishes, including seafood, chicken, steak and vegetarian options. Some outdoor seating is available. Dinner entrees are $15 to $26.
Have lunch on the trail at the Market Café (802-535-5407; marketcafevt.com), at the bottom of the Old Web's trail, at the southwest end of Darling Hill. Fresh wraps, veggie burgers, soup, salads and snacks are available, but you'll need cash to buy them. Sandwiches are $4 to $6.

HEADLINE: And the Rich Shall Inherit The Woes

BYLINE: By JOHN ANDERSON

 BODY:
THE movie bad guy may wear a black hat, but gray has always been his color. Lately, it seems, Mr. Gray is showing up in a Brioni suit with a diversified portfolio of several billion dollars.
That filmmakers would have their eye on Wall Street and the morality of unfettered capitalism is hardly a shock. Nor is the idea that the world of high finance could provide meaty villains or, at least, intriguingly disreputable characters. Rich people are fantasy figures; the country's continuing economic woes make them topical, and their sorrows generate vicarious joy.
Equally important, a conflicted conscience makes for good drama. It may be, as Jean Renoir once said, that the hell of life is that everyone has his or her reasons. But it's those reasons that make questionable characters intriguing, nuanced and something more than animals. It's what separates Bruce Wayne from Bruce the Shark. 
''Why is the public so interested in movies about the wealthy?'' said Nicholas Jarecki, whose debut narrative feature, ''Arbitrage,'' stars Richard Gere as a compromised commodities trader scrambling to save his fortune and his family. ''My answer is that Shakespeare wrote about kings. That's where the action is. And it's the classic cathartic thing. You get to indulge in a lifestyle you're not part of, a tragic error leads to a downfall, and you get to say, 'Thank God I'm not him.' ''
Creating really interesting ne'er-do-wells, and giving them currency, also hinges on ''the scope of the villainy,'' said the director David Cronenberg, whose current drama, ''Cosmopolis,'' adapted from the novel by Don DeLillo, follows an unconscionably wealthy Wall Street trader on a trip to a haircut, or hell, depending on one's point of view.
''I think it's a matter of reach,'' Mr. Cronenberg said by phone from Toronto. ''For example I watched 'The Killing,' the American version, on TV, and there's a lot of politics to it, and the mayor of Seattle is corrupt and all that. But even if he is corrupt, how far does the corruption reach? Not that far.
''But when you think of Bernie Madoff, he was operating on a global scale. It's monumental. So I think, in a way, unless you're talking about the president of the United States or people very high up in the government or the Pentagon, financial villainy has a much more dangerous scope.''
He compared the dynamics to a superhero movie: ''You need a guy who wants to destroy the world. Just destroy a city? That's nothing. From a storytelling point of view it's far more dramatic.''
Rich people getting their comeuppance has been a standard conceit since the Great Depression. For every wacky, likable heiress in a '30s screwball comedy (''It Happened One Night,'' ''My Man Godfrey,'' ''Bringing Up Baby''), there was a Frank Capra-esque villain, usually played by Edward Arnold (''Meet John Doe''), fuming with pure evil. The prime moneyed malefactor of yore is probably Mr. Potter in ''It's a Wonderful Life,'' who since 1946 has personified the warped soul of the well-financed.
The main characters of ''Arbitrage'' and ''Cosmopolis'' fit into a newer tradition of far squishier protagonists. See ''Boiler Room'' from 2000, ''Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps'' (2010), ''Margin Call'' from last year and even the current documentary ''The Queen of Versailles,'' Lauren Greenfield's film about a fabulously wealthy family laid low, in which schadenfreude plays a major factor.
And yet fictional heroes need redeeming qualities, which is why Mr. Cronenberg wanted Robert Pattinson as the star of his film. ''Quite a few critics have talked about him being icy and all that, but the fact is that even as a vampire he's pretty warm and attractive,'' Mr. Cronenberg said, referring to the actor's ''Twilight'' role. ''I think he's likable, and I wanted that, probably for the same reason they wanted Richard Gere for 'Arbitrage.' ''
Mr. Gere, reached in East Hampton, N.Y., said the story of Robert Miller, the role he plays, reminded him in part of the Madoff case.
''Robert Miller's not a sociopath,'' he said, ''and Madoff was. But the people around him who were not sociopaths, they're more interesting. The ones who knew, who took the money and said to themselves 'This can't be true,' those are the more interesting people to me.'' Miller, he said, is one of those people who think of themselves as good guys, as ''winners who can never lose.''
''Jamie Dimon is more like this guy than Madoff,'' Mr. Gere said, referring to the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, whose company recently had a trading loss of billions of dollars. ''Very equipped. Charming. An alpha personality. It's inconceivable to him that he wouldn't win every bet. But the hubris of that, that you're never going to lose, is insane. And how do you fix the mistake that was unthinkable? This movie's not just about finance, but personal failing.''
And that is not only what makes ''Arbitrage'' interesting, he said, but also connects it and movies like it to an era when crime and politics, rather than pure money, dominated drama. ''The lineage of this film is from Sidney Lumet,'' he said. ''It's like a '70s movie, the kind that took on a current subject and so immersed itself in character that it reached another plane. It's rare. It used to be that there were a lot of smart, well-made films like this at the studios, but now it's all in the independent world, where you have to go begging and searching for money.''
Mr. Jarecki didn't exactly have to beg. The son of the entrepreneur, philanthropist and investor Dr. Henry Jarecki and a former commodities trader, Marjorie Heidsieck (and half brother to the filmmakers Andrew and Eugene Jarecki), he got his budget through a group of young private-equity investors, augmented by the money he received from the sale of a script several years ago (for ''The Informers,'' based on a book by Bret Easton Ellis). As is common enough in filmmaking, however, at a point he came up short.
''I needed money,'' Mr. Jarecki said. ''I asked my dad. He laughed at me. We were at that point in the conversation where I said, 'I appreciate the lesson, but really need it,' and he said: 'It's not a lesson. I just don't want to invest in this movie.' ''

HEADLINE: Breaking the Silence On a Carbon Tax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I applaud Robert H. Frank's column ''Carbon Tax Silence, Overtaken by Events'' (Economic View, Aug. 26).
That climate change, the biggest challenge ever to face mankind, will most likely be off the radar screens at the Republican and Democratic conventions is unfathomable. How long will we Americans ignore the predictions of an estimated 98 percent of the world's climate scientists?
Mitt Romney's newly unveiled energy plan, calling for aggressive extraction of coal and other fossil fuels inside our borders, is dismaying. If we follow this path, and the climate scientists turn out to be right, we will be consigning today's children and billions who will follow them to severe economic hardship and suffering. 
Professor Frank's advocacy of a carbon tax -- starting now -- is common sense. As with most matters affecting human beings, early preventive action is far less costly than is substantially deferred intervention.
Leslie K. Downey
Silver Spring, Md., Aug. 27
To the Editor:
Robert H. Frank presents a persuasive argument for addressing global warming. But he underestimates the difficulties that a domestic tax on carbon emissions would create for imports: tariffs or other offset mechanisms must be determined for each imported item to compensate for the global greenhouse gas contribution attributable to it. Also, our exports would become relatively more expensive unless they are subsidized for the carbon tax burden they carry.
An international agreement, like the Kyoto treaty, that emphasizes cost-effective measures by each participating country to meet mutually agreed-upon global greenhouse gas reductions makes better economic sense.
Fred Haag
Burnt Hills, N.Y., Aug. 27
To the Editor:
Robert H. Frank's call for a carbon tax is deeply misguided. By raising energy costs, carbon taxes would be economically stultifying, and deeply regressive. They would render the United States less competitive on world markets and ultimately trigger industry and capital flight.
For all that pain, there would be no gain. With China and India set to dominate global greenhouse gas emissions for a century, unilateral action by the United States would have virtually no impact on the trajectory of global average temperatures. And it would be unilateral: there is no prospect for global greenhouse gas controls anytime soon. Besides, as the International Energy Agency points out, United States carbon dioxide emissions have already fallen by 430 million metric tons (7.7 percent) since 2006, ''the largest reduction of all countries or regions.''
Let's be honest: a carbon tax is simply another tax that advocates believe would be more palatable to the public because it's painted green.

To the Editor:
Robert H. Frank is correct that a carbon tax would be good economic and environmental policy. However, with so many in Congress allergic to new taxes, the idea seems unlikely to be carried out soon.
Rather than waiting for a carbon tax, I'm living as if we had one already.
Where I live in Massachusetts, the price of gasoline is about $3.75. A rational energy policy that took into account the environmental and health costs of extraction, production and pollution would make it at least twice as expensive (as it is in Germany). So for every dollar I spend at the pump, I donate the same amount to 350.org, the climate advocacy organization, to help take our planet back.
Not everyone drives a car. Not everyone can afford this plan. But some of us do, and some of us can. Why wait?

HEADLINE: Downsizing the Jumbo

BYLINE: By VICKIE ELMER

 BODY:
WITH interest rates still low, many homeowners have been saying goodbye to their ''jumbo'' mortgages and refinancing into conventional loans. They may need to write sizable checks at the closing, but in the end they are likely to reduce their monthly payments while improving their cash flow.
''It's an opportunity not to be missed,'' said Melissa Cohn, the chief executive of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, adding that her customers like the idea of locking in a lower rate. 
Jumbo mortgages, also called nonconforming loans, exceed $625,500 in high-cost areas like New York. Unlike conforming mortgages, they do not meet specific guidelines of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which repurchase loans and resell them to investors. Because lenders assume more risk, interest rates for nonconforming loans are higher than for conforming.
These days the spread between conventional and nonconventional is 0.5 percentage points, on average, according to data from HSH.com, though if the jumbo loan was taken out during the financial crisis of 2008, it could have been up to 1.8 percentage points more.
To refinance out of a jumbo loan, most borrowers will have to put in extra money -- sometimes $100,000 or more -- to decrease the balance to below $625,500, or $417,000 in other parts of the country. Some, though, may see this as a sound investment.
''A lot of homeowners are sitting on cash, concerned about the stock market,'' said Bob Moulton, the president of the Americana Mortgage Group in Manhasset, N.Y. ''They get 3.5 percent-plus by putting it into their home,'' he added, referring to the prevailing rate nationwide on a 30-year fixed-rate loan.
''If you don't have a need for the cash -- if your cash position is O.K. -- then that's the right decision,'' he added.
Mr. Moulton says he has had several customers eager to buy down their mortgage balances. ''When people are to the cusp,'' he said, referring to borrowers' balances near the cutoff for conventional loans, ''I always bring that to their attention.''
Cash-in refinancing has remained popular as homeowners work to cut their debt levels. Some 23 percent of homeowners refinancing in the second quarter decreased their mortgage balances, according to Freddie Mac; in the fourth quarter of last year it was 47 percent. The agency provides a guide for consumers on its Web site.
Sheila Walker Hartwell, the owner of Hartwell Planning, a financial planner based in Manhattan, says homeowners with a good financial foundation could greatly benefit by moving to a conventional mortgage from a jumbo. She provided one scenario in which a couple pays in $75,000 when they refinance a $700,000 mortgage, and save at least $5,900 a year on interest based on a 0.33 percentage point reduction in their interest rate. They would need to earn almost 7.5 percent a year on that money to net the same amount from savings or investments, she said.
But Ms. Hartwell cautioned that when homeowners pay into their mortgages to build up equity, ''the money's not liquid,'' or readily available. She said that she would prefer that her clients develop a savings and spending plan and make sure that they have a ''contingency fund'' with at least six months' and sometimes up to 12 months of living expenses. (The 12-month fund is worthwhile when the economy is uncertain or if your job or industry seems less than solid, she said.) It's not a good idea to deplete those funds to pay down your mortgage, even if the funds are earning next to nothing, Ms. Hartwell said.
Especially, Mr. Moulton added, ''if they anticipate big expenses -- college expenses, home improvement -- or have other debts at a higher interest rate. Then they don't want to do this.''
Another drawback, Ms. Hartwell said: Unless the length of a loan is reduced, each time you refinance, the mortgage starts again at the beginning and initial payments are almost all interest.

HEADLINE: 'Framing' Prevents Needed Stimulus

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale.

 BODY:
WHY have so many teachers, police officers, firefighters and other public workers been laid off since the financial crisis hit -- and why are so few being offered new jobs now?
From July 2008 to July 2012, the number of state and local employees nationwide fell by 715,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The reality is actually worse than that figure suggests. The total ended up 1.31 million people below where it would have been had public sector employment simply kept pace with population growth.
The situation did not improve as the financial crisis eased and the economy picked up. From March 2009 to March 2012, the nation's total nonfarm employment increased 0.6 percent. State and local government employment, by contrast, fell 2.9 percent. 
It is not as if many Americans say they want this to happen. A CBS News-New York Times poll in July asked: ''Looking at your local public schools, would you be willing or not willing to have shorter school days or more crowded classrooms if it meant you would pay significantly less in taxes?'' Seventy-four percent of respondents replied that they were ''not willing'' (21 percent were willing and 5 percent were unsure). When similar questions were posed about firefighters or police officers, the percent ''willing'' was even lower (12 percent and 15 percent).
Keeping the number of teachers, firefighters, police officers and other public employees in line with the local population seems sensible enough, even if it means higher taxes. Granted, no one likes paying higher taxes. But in this case, the result would be a more livable community and more local jobs.
If state and local governments had not cut back so much, the broader economy would be stronger today. That would be true even if they had raised taxes to avoid incurring more debt. This would be a result of the balanced budget multiplier theory I have been discussing in this column, coupled with various studies of the impact of tax and expenditure changes on the zero-interest-rate economy.
Why, then, did governments do what they did? One answer comes from the field of behavioral public finance, which applies psychology to the world of taxes. What actually happens with tax policy in the political marketplace may be entirely different from what we would choose if, as a community, we focused on salient questions. Bruce Ackerman of Yale and James S. Fishkin of Stanford have proposed a new national holiday, Deliberation Day. Before an election, everyone would get Deliberation Day off and be paid to attend community meetings. The idea would be to encourage communities to share information.
Maybe one day. For now, however, many citizens simply are not engaged. And when that is the case, public decisions can become quixotic and arbitrary. In their 2006 book Behavioral Public Finance, Edward J. McCaffery of the University of Southern California and Joel B. Slemrod of the University of Michigan summed it up by saying that in real-world public finance, ''form matters.''
They were applying to public finance the psychological principle of ''framing'' -- the notion that when people make decisions without enough deliberation, consultation and information, they are easily influenced by superficial forms and irrelevant details of presentation or wording.
In most communities, it is difficult to hold tax receipts steady, let alone increase tax rates, given the recent (and projected future) declines in assessed values and the public's general resistance to seeing tax rates go up. Many people view substantial increases in property tax rates as unfair, even if the resulting revenue is used for services the community wants. Professor Slemrod calls this the metric effect.
POLITICIANS are not in complete control of framing. Property owners get a tax bill every year, and that bill is highly salient when presented: its form frames the issue. News of property tax increases is shared among neighbors or colleagues, who mostly talk among themselves, and who would not be personally threatened by job cuts in the public sector.
A good part of the benefits of tax increases go to as-yet-unspecified public workers who would otherwise be laid off in the future. We naturally care less about people we do not know than those we do.
Deborah Small of the University of Pennsylvania and George Loewenstein of Carnegie Mellon University have run experiments that show that people are more sympathetic to ''identifiable victims'' than they are to ''statistical victims.''
In a 2003 field experiment, they sent subjects an appeal to contribute to Habitat for Humanity to help build a house for a needy family. Two letters were sent, and they differed by just three words. One said the needy family ''has been selected'' from an enclosed list. The other said the family ''will be selected.'' People who received the first letter (about identifiable victims) gave 25 percent more than those getting the other letter (about statistical victims).
Politicians sometimes avoid creating identifiable victims when they raise taxes, as they do, for example, with the corporate profits tax, which seems to be paid by abstract entities, rather than real people. But there are limits to their ability to raise such taxes.
Politicians can sometimes find other frames to raise taxes in the public interest. Prohibition was ended early in the Great Depression, when government budgets were in deficit. That was no coincidence. Many politicians were seeking to find a new source of tax revenue, in the form of liquor taxes, without creating an identifiable victim by raising tax rates. Governments mostly have run out of other avenues to do that.
But politicians keep trying to manipulate the framing of taxes. At their convention this week, Democrats may refer to specific, identifiable victims of unemployment, as Barack Obama did at the 2008 convention, when he described the ''man in Indiana'' who lost his job to China.
All of these efforts to manipulate framing, however, are dwarfed by the natural framing that occurs in real life, away from the television sets, and that prevents active government stimulus and so perpetuates an unfortunate slump.

HEADLINE: Tracking a Subtle Scent, a Dog May Help Save the Whales

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON; Sean Patrick Farrell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
OFF THE COAST OF SAN JUAN ISLAND, Wash. -- A dog named Tucker with a thumping tail and a mysterious past as a stray on the streets of Seattle has become an unexpected star in the realm of canine-assisted science. He is the world's only working dog, marine biologists say, able to find and track the scent of orca scat, or feces, in open ocean water -- up to a mile away, in the smallest of specks.
Through dint of hard work and obsession with an orange ball on a rope, which he gets to play with as a reward after a successful search on the water, Tucker is an ace in finding something that most people, and perhaps most dogs, would just as soon avoid.
And it is not easy. Scat can sink or disperse in 30 minutes or less. But it is crucial in monitoring the health of the whales here, an endangered group that is probably among the most studied animal populations in the world. Most of the 85 or so orcas, or killer whales, that frequent the San Juans, about two hours northwest of Seattle, have been genotyped and tracked for decades, down to their birth years and number of offspring. 
And none of this could happen as easily as it does without Tucker and his wet, black nose -- or the new tricks that he taught the scientists.
''Sometimes he'd just turn around and sit down and stare at me, waiting for me to figure it out,'' said Deborah A. Giles, who is completing a Ph.D. on how orcas here are affected by the thousands of whale watchers and scores of commercial whale-watch vessels that cluster around the animals. ''He's very subtle,'' said Ms. Giles, sitting behind the wheel of the research vessel Moja as Tucker, an 8-year-old black Lab mix, paced at the prow on a recent afternoon.
One thing to get out of the way quickly: orca scat really does not smell that bad. Perhaps because the animals eat mostly Chinook salmon -- the tastiest kind, many human seafood lovers agree -- the scent is more fish than foul.
But unlike, say, a narcotics-sniffing dog that can lead its human around by a leash, the research boat itself is, in effect, Tucker's legs when he has picked up the aroma. He cannot physically go where the sample is to be found, but must somehow signal where he wants the boat to go, with the feces somewhere out there on the water.
Like a Delphic oracle whose every nuanced expression must be interpreted by acolytes -- Tucker might lean to one side of the boat, then another, then suddenly sink back onto his green mat with his head between his paws, the scent lost -- his nose for scat leads on, and all must follow.
''The slightest twitch of his ear is important,'' said Elizabeth Seely, a trainer who has worked with Tucker for four years at a nonprofit group called the Conservation Canines, which specializes in dog-assisted research on behalf of endangered species. She stood at his side on a recent scat-search session, signaling to Ms. Giles behind the wheel with tiny finger motions -- a bit to the right, a bit more to the left, circle back -- that Tucker was suggesting by his posture and level of attention.
Out on these waters, though, it seems that every creature is learning new tricks. Salmon have taken to hiding under commercial whale-watch boats when they are being hunted by the orcas. The boats, in turn, are filled with people -- upward of 500,000 during the peak season from May to October -- who have paid to see whales and who in many cases, boat operators and scientists say, return home wanting somehow to help the animals. Whale-loving visitors in turn reinforce a local economic engine that hinges more and more on having whales to see.
The whales are becoming, in a strange way, more in sync with the rhythms of their human watchers -- resting less during daylight and more at night than they used to in the 1980s or '90s. As part of her dissertation at the University of California, Davis, Ms. Giles is examining reduced prey availability and increased vessel presence as potential causes.
For Tucker, though, it mostly comes down to his ball toy, which he plays with in exuberant, wild abandon, tossing it into the air and staging crouched bouts of tug of war with Ms. Seely. When a fecal sample is found, the researchers carry it toward him and then substitute the ball at the last second, reinforcing the connection between work and reward.
Another scat dog in training, a flat-coated retriever named Sadie, was donated to the program by an owner who could not deal with her ball fixation. In frustration, the owner put Sadie's ball on top of the fridge. Eight hours or so later, she returned and found Sadie still sitting there, staring up at the object of her desires.
''When the owner told me that story, my immediate response was, 'We'll take her,' '' said Prof. Samuel K. Wasser, the director of the Center for Conservation Biology at the University of Washington and the director of the orca scat research project.
The research, financed by Washington Sea Grant of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is raising new questions about how to protect the orcas. Professor Wasser said that when he started the project four years ago, he thought boat activity would be a crucial element of whale stress, reflected through stress hormones in their scat. But it turned out, he said, that food supply was more important, with fewer salmon -- because of overfishing by humans or habitat degradation or both -- emerging as a main stress variable. Knowing to focus on fish supply, he said, means knowing where to focus public policy efforts on the animals' behalf.
Through the scat, biologists can tell, for example, which whale pods spend the winter off the coast of Southern California, because their feces can contain higher trace elements of DDT, the pesticide that was banned in 1972. The poison still echoes through the decades in the fish the whales eat before returning north. Other orca groups have concentrations of dioxins or PCBs traced to industrial activity around Seattle.
But for all his hundreds of hours on boats, Tucker will not get wet. He hates to swim, Ms. Seely said. She is not sure why. A trauma from puppyhood, she supposes. It is one thing about which he cannot communicate.

HEADLINE: Report Shows Chinese Manufacturing Contracted in August

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Chinese manufacturing contracted in August as new orders fell, but the slowdown shows signs of bottoming out, an industry group said Saturday.
The report by the state-authorized China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing added to mixed signals about whether China was starting to recover from its deepest downturn since the 2008 global financial crisis. It is a delicate time for the Communist Party, which is preparing to hand power to younger leaders this year. 
The federation said its purchasing managers index fell to 49.2 in August, from 50.1 in July, on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show a contraction. It was the group's weakest reading to date.
''It shows the economy is moving downward,'' the report said, ''but is bottoming out considering changes in the major subindexes.''
An analyst, Zhang Liqun, said government policies were taking effect, with domestic investment and consumption growing steadily since June.
China's economic growth fell to a three-year low of 7.6 percent in the quarter that ended in June, and corporate profits and other indicators have fallen despite government stimulus measures.
Analysts expect an economic recovery late this year or early in 2013 but say it will be too weak to drive global growth without improvement in the United States and Europe.
A preliminary version of a separate purchasing managers index by the HSBC Corporation also showed August manufacturing weakening, falling to 47.8 points from 49.3 in July.
The logistic federation's survey showed all indexes -- except for manufacturing -- were either at or below 50.
The new order index was 48.7, down 0.3 from July. The new export order index remained at 46.6, the same as in July.
Beijing has cut interest rates twice since June 1 and is pumping money into the economy by encouraging investment by state companies. But the government is moving cautiously after China's stimulus in response to the 2008 crisis fueled inflation and a wasteful building boom.

HEADLINE: Feel the Loathing on the Campaign Trail

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

 BODY:
Sometime early last May, I began to have this goofy notion, which turned into a daydream and eventually became a recurring fantasy. It went like this: One morning, I would wake up to the news that the previous evening, with no advance warning to the media, Mitt and Ann Romney stopped by the White House at the invitation of Barack and Michelle Obama. No one was certain what happened while they were there or what they talked about or how it came together, though eventually some details would trickle out. The couples told funny stories from the campaign trail and shared pictures of their families. Mitt drank lemonade, and Michelle led a moonlit tour of her garden. Everyone ate hot dogs loaded with toppings, which inspired a cable christening of the ''Sauerkraut Summit.'' 
I knew this would never happen. It was dumb, naïve, unsophisticated and frankly out of character for me, someone with little patience for the Kabuki pleasantries of politics. It wasn't immediately clear what drove the fantasy -- a desire for less free-floating hostility in the campaign, I suppose, but that seemed too easy. Whatever the case, I was yearning for something that felt big, or at least different, even if it was just a social visit. Something that messed with what the political know-it-alls refer to as the Narrative. This spring, for the first time since I started writing about politics a decade ago, I found myself completely depressed by a campaign. ''How am I ever going to get through it?'' is not the question you want to be asking yourself as you enter what are supposed to be the pinnacle few months of your profession.
But that's what I was doing to an alarming degree. Maybe it had to do with how bad off the country felt and how outmatched our politicians were by the severity of our problems and how obvious it was that the proverbial ''tone'' of Washington wouldn't change no matter who won. Or maybe it was because my daughters were getting older and starting to tune in more. When I drop them off at school, I sometimes watch them stare wondrously at the vice president's motorcade as it sirens past en route to the White House. It is a moment of fascination and reverence and one of the cool things about raising a family in what is otherwise the most disappointing city in America. I had also just been through a rough winter in which my 11-year-old suffered a head injury that brought some terrifying and unexplained side effects that incapacitated her for months. There's something about wondering whether your kid will ever be able to go back to school and live a normal life that makes a steady ingestion of super-PAC poison, talking-point Novocain and fund-raising spam a little harder to take.
I couldn't shake the idea of this Obama-Romney evening at the White House. I found myself talking about it to people I have actual professional or quasi-professional relationships with. The first was Alex Castellanos, the Republican media strategist and CNN contributor, whom I ran into at a wedding over Memorial Day weekend (yes, the kind of incestuous small-town encounter that also goes with living here). He said he liked it, and then he went immediately into analyst mode, saying it would be ''helpful'' to whoever made the invitation and was thus ''seen as magnanimous.'' A week or so later I mentioned the idea to a top Obama aide, who called it ''interesting'' and then listed all the reasons Obama does not like to mix personal time with work (see: golf invitation made to John Boehner after a full two and a half years in the White House). I started bringing it up casually to people I met at campaign events. They seemed more enthused. ''It would be a sign that something nice is possible,'' said Bob Grandison, a retired technician for Ohio Edison whom I met at an Obama rally in Akron.
This isn't all a setup for one of those gauzy laments about how ''our politics have never been meaner'' or how ''we've lost our civility as a society'' and it would all be so much better if our leaders could just emulate the oft-invoked after-hours salons of Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill (a tradition way overstated). Nor am I a member of the ''deeply saddened and troubled'' club, like John McCain (or whoever tweets for him), who recently called this campaign the ''worst I've ever seen.'' This from someone who in 2000 had to field the race-baiting accusation that he fathered his adopted Bangladeshi daughter, out of wedlock, with a black woman.
I am as cynical as any political reporter. And perhaps my recent craving for uplift was a sublimation of my own anger at being a small cog in a giant inanity machine. But I write and read and talk about politics because beneath that cynicism I understand that the stakes are high. On top of which, oddly, the job also keeps me patriotic, a byproduct of seeing -- as I did at a Romney event in Ohio in July -- things like a Korean War veteran in a wheelchair removing his insignia cap and struggling to his feet to salute the flag during the national anthem. (Immediately after which, I looked down at my BlackBerry to learn that the Democratic National Committee had just released a new ad ridiculing Ann Romney's dressage horse.)
But what's been completely missing this year has been, for lack of a better word, joy. Yes, it's always kind of fun to follow Joe Biden around and wait to hear what will come out of his mouth next, and who knows what Paul Ryan has hidden under his oversize jacket. But the principals don't seem to be experiencing much joy as they go through their market-tested paces. A kind of faux-ness permeates everything this year in a way that it hasn't been quite so consuming in the past. The effect has been anesthetizing and made it difficult to take any of the day's supposed gaffes, game-changers and false umbrages seriously. The campaigns appeared locked in a paradigm of terrified superpowers' spending blindly on redundant warfare. How many times do they have to blow up Vladivostok?
Where were the surprises, the pleasures of discovery and the true emotion of the newly vitalized? The volunteers who decided to get involved because so-and-so inspired them, not because the other guy (the socialist or the plutocrat) scared them? They seemed in such short supply. This might or might not be the most important election of our lifetime -- as we are told it is every four years -- but it really did feel like the most joyless.
I wanted to find a moment in the muck that proved me wrong. So in mid-July I started circulating through campaign rallies and headquarters on a mission to find something that might make me feel, if not joyful, at least more at peace with the joylessness.
My first stop was a Romney town-hall gathering at a community center in Bowling Green, Ohio. An orderly, almost entirely white procession filed through metal detectors to Bob Seger's ''Ramblin' Gamblin' Man,'' which of course immediately brings Mitt Romney to mind. The traveling media, which often refer to Romney among themselves as Mittens, was at the back of the room, ignored by the rest of the crowd, with the one sensational exception of Carl Cameron, the oval-headed reporter for Fox News. As is customary for any recognizable Fox personality at a Republican event, Cameron was a popular fuss-object -- waved to and asked for photos and autographs, requests which he obliged with the flair of a seasoned senator. ''Thank God for Fox News,'' one man yelled.
Romney is better on the stump now than he was five or six months ago, and surprisingly better in person than he is on TV -- more human-seeming, somehow, when seen head to toe. On screen, his hurried asides (''I'm running for office, for Pete's sake'') and staccato laugh seem weirder and more pronounced. In person, there's a slightly awkward charm about him. But he still emits a kind of pretraumatic gaffe anxiety at all times. This is understandable, given today's hair-trigger media, but you sense that it runs deeper. His father and idol, the former governor of Michigan George Romney, saw his presidential hopes blown apart after he claimed to have been ''brainwashed'' into supporting the Vietnam War (inspiring a classic insult by Senator Eugene McCarthy, who said that with Romney ''a light rinse would have been sufficient''). The episode supposedly had a searing effect on Mitt, and people who know him say it sank a hypervigilance in him that has shaped his public demeanor for decades.
As Romney took questions, a self-described ''angry mom'' went on a rant about how her son's apparel business has suffered under Obama -- ''that monster,'' as she called the president. Some in the crowd laughed, and Romney closed his eyes and ducked his head, assuming a look of either pained meditation or quiet panic. I imagined the data-processing spasm in his brain as he weighed whether to disavow the remark immediately or risk seeming to have endorsed it. Romney clasped his hands at his waist and, after a few seconds, chose action. ''That's not a term I would use,'' he said, and then, ''but, but, but, uh, uh,'' before Kathye Zaper of suburban Toledo told her party's presidential nominee that, because of her status as a mother who was angry, she could call the president a monster if she wanted to.
In his speech, Romney asked everyone in the room who had started their own businesses to please stand. A few dozen people did, some holding signs that said things like ''I opened my own business'' and ''I created a business. Not the government.'' ''These are fun; these are fun signs!'' Romney gushed. ''For those who made those signs, thank you for reminding us who it is in America that creates jobs.''
After the event, I met one of these business owners, Wayne Michaelis, standing outside the auditorium. I knew he had opened a business, because his sign said so. He is a retired orthodontist. ''I build smiles,'' he said proudly. But he did not build his own ''I opened my own business'' sign. That was handed to him, as were many others, by the campaign.
Michaelis admitted this to a reporter traveling with Romney and word spread fast within the press corps -- a morsel of gotcha chum bobbing in the water. Other reporters approached Michaelis, seeking verification. ''This is all the media is going to focus on for this event,'' Dick Motten, a financial planner who was standing next to Michaelis, said. He watched with some disgust as the reporters surrounded his friend. ''You can see what's happening here,'' Motten said. ''They don't care what Wayne has to say. They just want to know that he didn't make his own sign. And then they'll make a big deal of it.'' About that, he was right. The homemade-sign revelation was online within hours.
The political media are engaged in their own silly arms race. The treadmill existence of having to file articles around the clock, tweet nonevents as they happen and listen to the same canned speeches and campaign conference calls day after day, waiting for something, anything, to bust up the script so that you can pretend there's news here; this can be the definition of joylessness. Politics operates in ''cycles'' -- news cycles, election cycles -- one of those words that has come into fashion in recent years. There's even a political show on MSNBC called ''The Cycle'' (which, as The Washington Post's Karen Tumulty pointed out in a tweet, was obviously not named by a woman).
President Obama talks a lot now about how his hair is going gray. It's a useful tool of self-deprecation (the ''my big ears'' of 2012) and a functional symbol of what his team calls the ''grind it out'' election, as opposed to the Hope and Change of 2008. In early August, I went to see him speak at a midday rally in the center of Mansfield, in north-central Ohio, in front of the faded brick exterior of an out-of-business department store. Obama does his best to stir the old magic -- droppin' his g's and talkin' straight about how his opponents think we ''should be goin' back to what we were doin' that got us into this mess in the first place.'' But his appearances can give off the slightly musty air of Van Halen in the Sammy Hagar years.
After he spoke, the president quickly worked the crowd near the front of the stage. He does a decent meet-and-greet but clearly lacks Bill Clinton's or Biden's draw-energy-from-the-adoring-throng gene. As with Romney, you can picture him grabbing for the Purell as soon as he escapes the rope line. His retail-politicking chores completed, Obama disappeared behind a thick black curtain next to an empty storefront, into something called the ''Good News Center'' -- a place I was not allowed to go.
I originally planned to see Obama at two events in Florida the previous week, but made it only as far as Atlanta, where I missed a connection and stayed in a Motel 6 and woke early the next morning to the ghastly news of the Colorado movie-theater massacre. The campaigns pressed pause. Sitting in the dark motel room, I got a sentimental yearning again -- for something that might break with the predictable regiment that followed a Sobering National Tragedy. I knew there would be statements from the candidates and talk of national unity during this difficult time, and then some member of Congress would say something inflammatory (cue Louie Gohmert, the Texas Republican, who blamed the massacre on a lack of prayer) and then some reporter would wrongly say the shootings were politically motivated (cue ABC's Brian Ross, who initially suggested that the suspect was linked to the Tea Party); a cluster of Democrats would call for tougher arms restrictions, and the president would barely touch the issue, because to do otherwise would be to bang his head against political concrete. I craved something more this time, some real joint action, the two candidates meeting in Aurora as a show of unity that went beyond pro forma expressions of condolence and a brief ceasing of hostilities. Maybe they could issue a statement saying that while the shooting was not politically motivated, there is a lot of anger out there and they wanted to address it together. As the hiatus proceeded -- a ''highly choreographed détente,'' as Zeke Miller from Buzzfeed called it -- the campaigns were quick to advertise all the campaigning they were not doing. ''We have asked affiliates to pull down our contrast advertising for the time being,'' Jen Psaki, an Obama spokeswoman, said.
By Monday, three days later, they were back to pulling down each other's Garanimals. David Axelrod ended the cease-fire with a pair of early-morning tweets about Romney's being ''secretive'' regarding his tax returns and business career and etc.
''I guess it's back on,'' Romney's communications director, Gail Gitcho, said when told of the truce-busting tweet.
I was sitting in a bar later that day in Boston's North End with Gitcho and Eric Fehrnstrom, Romney's longtime press secretary. ''Over the weekend, we were constantly assessing when we could return to campaign activities,'' said Fehrnstrom, a former Boston Herald reporter with chubby cheeks and a jittery bearing. He goes to bed every night at 11:30, wakes at 3, checks his BlackBerry and then tries to get another hour or so of ''not exactly quality REM sleep'' before starting the day. He and Gitcho described how restless they felt during the Aurora armistice, and like a couple sharing the same pheromonic response to the news cycle, they both began quivering their knees under the table at precisely the same time.
Romney's campaign staff is known in political shorthand as ''Boston,'' and Obama's is ''Chicago'' -- like the Russians used to be ''Moscow'' and the Americans were ''Washington.'' Owing to valid security concerns, Romney's North End headquarters feel like a fortress, with no external signifiers that a presidential campaign is being run there. (Obama's headquarters in Chicago are like this, too.) Receptionists in the lobby greet visitors from behind thick glass similar to what you'd find at a gas station in a rough neighborhood. Inside, big framed pictures of Ronald Reagan and George Romney dominate walls, along with prominent renderings of Mitt and Ann. A lone photo of George W. Bush hangs crooked next to a darkened office in a far corner. (The former president and Laura Bush would stop by the headquarters on a visit to Boston the day after I was there, and I imagined young campaign workers scrambling to put up more Bush pictures.)
Gitcho is a forcible presence who wakes most mornings before 5 for ''boot camp'' training at a North End gym. She referred to the Obama staff as ''the defending champs'' three times in a half hour and kept pointing out that as of that day, the Obama re-election campaign had 778 people on its payroll to Romney's 272 (though the Romney staff grew considerably when Paul Ryan joined the ticket). Stuart Stevens, Romney's chief strategist, said the media's trivial focus on things like Romney's gaffes and his tax returns wouldn't amount to anything next to the ravages of the Obama economy. He wanted me to understand that none of the news-cycle fodder amounted to anything. ''If Steinbeck was alive today,'' Stevens said, ''you think he would be writing about tweets?''
Officials in each camp like to praise one another in the classically backhanded language of politics. ''Obama is a good salesman trying to push a defective product,'' Fehrnstrom said, to which Gitcho replied, ''Oh, that's a good one.'' Fehrnstrom looked pleased. ''You see where I mixed in something nice with something bad?''
Fehrnstrom accuses Axelrod of having ''an entire staff of people who tweet for him'' (not true), and he makes sneering references to the foosball table at Obama HQ (it's a Ping-Pong table). The intention is of course to contrast the lean, no-nonsense approach of Boston with the indulged, big-government-like behemoth of Chicago. Fehrnstrom was on a roll, seeming eager to dispense a little wisdom about how the political magic happens. ''I used to work for an ad agency,'' he said, ''and I always thought the best place to be was on the creative side, because they could get away with anything.'' He added, smirking: ''It's all part of the creative process, I guess. If someone happened to be taking a nap under their desk in the afternoon, you weren't supposed to disturb them, because it's all part of the process.''
As it did four years ago, Team Obama often pats itself on the back for basing its campaign in Chicago, far away from the silliness of Washington. The implication is that they are situated among real Americans with real concerns -- in the heartland of Michigan Avenue. (Whereas ''Chicago'' is used as an epithet by the Romney folks, who like to refer disdainfully to Obama's ''Chicago-style politics.'') For the Obama staff members, ''Chicago'' has an almost talismanic connection to the full-swagger days of 2008, time that political followers, especially those with press credentials, have spent a good part of this campaign longing for. The Ghost of the Last Campaign looms heavy over this one like a dearly departed sibling. One of the more anticipated cultural events of the Washington winter was the premiere of ''Game Change,'' the HBO adaptation of the best seller about the 2008 ''campaign of a lifetime,'' by the journo-pundits Mark Halperin and John Heilemann. The red-carpet opening featured the executive producer, Tom Hanks; the star, Julianne Moore (who played Sarah Palin); Brangelina (i.e., Halperin and Heilemann); Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski; and swarms of White House officials, Congress members, lobbyists and journalists parading into the Newseum on Pennsylvania Avenue, where they grazed a buffet of salmon and marinated hanger steak with Maui onions. ''You don't get to go back in time,'' said McCain's chief strategist, Steve Schmidt (played by Woody Harrelson), in the film. ''You don't get to have do-overs in life.'' No do-overs, indeed, but you can help shape events retroactively: Schmidt, who presided over the dysfunctional McCain campaign and is credited/blamed with encouraging the candidate to pick Palin, has emerged fine from the fiasco in the proud political tradition of failing upward. He scored a pundit gig on MSNBC and a TV studio outfitted in his home on Lake Tahoe, and he was portrayed as a tortured hero in the film. (One of my recurring suspicions is that every operative I talk to this year is secretly contemplating how he'll come off and who will play him in the next ''Game Change'' -- which of course Halperin and Heilemann are busy reporting.)
The film also sent Palin into a tizzy, complaining about its ''false narrative.'' The complaint brought to mind a line I highlighted years ago -- in 1993 -- from a profile in this magazine of David Gergen by Michael Kelly. ''Politics is not about objective reality, but virtual reality,'' Kelly wrote. ''What happens in the political world is divorced from the real world. It exists for only the fleeting historical moment, in a magical movie of sorts, a never-ending and infinitely revisable docudrama.''
Like their opponents in Boston, Obama's team prides itself on being grounded in ''objective'' campaign realities rather than the ''virtual'' ones spat forth by the news cycle. They knew Romney would be their opponent all along, they said. They knew the economy would be rough and they would be facing ''headwinds.'' They also knew that they would have to ''give some definition to Romney,'' as Axelrod put it, which is another way of saying they would have to caricature the former Massachusetts governor as a cold private-equity vulture with a penchant for secrecy and an indifference to the needs of the middle class as well as the gastric distresses of his long-dead dog. There is very little ''play in the electorate,'' Axelrod told me, meaning far fewer persuadable voters than there were four years ago.
When I visited the Obama headquarters in late July, I was asked to present two forms of identification before entering the offices, which are in a downtown office building on a floor the campaign asked me not to divulge, for security reasons. The nerve center is a sprawling room filled with hundreds of campaign workers, most of them under 25, many sitting under their college pennants. Like many campaigns -- and tech companies -- it is also something of a sweatshop (this is even more pronounced in the swing-state field offices), where 100-hour weeks are expected, outputs are closely monitored and discipline enforced. For every kid organizer whose political fervor is ignited on the Obama campaign, there is another -- and probably more -- who is not making his phone bank numbers, lagging behind ambitious co-workers bucking for administration jobs and resenting the revenge-of-the-nerds arrogance of his bosses. Still, the feel of youthful political energy was palpable as I passed row after row of desks en route to the men's room -- an unauthorized foray, it turned out, as all visitors require chaperones at all times. In a far corner was an area dedicated to the memory of Alex Okrent, a 29-year-old staff member who died earlier this summer after collapsing at his desk. Okrent, a veteran of two previous Obama campaigns -- 2004 and 2008 -- was a beloved figure here, and many of the Post-its affixed to the shrine were in the vein of ''Win It for Alex.'' Okrent's death hit the campaign hard; Obama called the staff from Washington, and Romney tweeted a message of condolence.
On this day, the Obama team was particularly giddy over Romney's mishaps on his recent tour of Europe and the Middle East. (''Mitt the Twit!'' the press secretary Ben LaBolt read aloud from his BlackBerry, quoting a London tabloid headline.) I met with four top officials in the office of the campaign manager, Jim Messina. They included Messina, LaBolt, Axelrod and the deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter. On a few occasions, I looked up to see all four simultaneously typing on their BlackBerries. They are wary of speaking on the record, for fear of compromising their message of discipline. ''I don't want to be telling Matt Rhoades everything we're doing,'' Messina told me, referring to his counterpart on the Romney campaign. When he did speak on the record, it was often with a mouthful of string cheese, around which he spewed a litany of poll data (''Univision says we're up 70-22 with Hispanics''), tech stats (''Facebook was one-ninth the size in 2008 than it is now'') and demographic trends (''the fastest growing population on Facebook is people over 50'').
I then headed down the hall for a brief separate interview with Cutter, whom I've known for years, going back to when she was John Kerry's spokeswoman. ''How are you?'' I asked.
''Are we on the record?'' she replied.
Nine days after Romney announced his selection of Paul Ryan, his aides were marveling at how much ''looser'' he had become. It was as if ''rapport'' was their approved theme of the week, and everyone was on message at all times. When I attended a joint Town Hall meeting on the quad of St. Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., a week before the start of the Republican Convention, Romney looked as if he was enjoying himself rather than following some ''look as if you're enjoying yourself'' stage direction. He sat in a chair a few feet away and cast an adoring gaze upon his new running mate. ''We're going to elect leadership,'' Ryan said, and then the bells of the campus church tolled to signal it was 11 a.m. ''At the 11th hour,'' Ryan quipped, a deft ad-lib that had the crowd laughing and cheering for several seconds. A few minutes later, Ryan said what will no doubt be a standard part of his stump repertory: when he and Romney win, he said, they will have ''the moral authority and the mandate'' to enact their agenda. ''Moral authority'' is one of the most depressing terms in politics, made more so by the fact that whoever wins will likely do it with barely more than 50 percent of the vote.
When I asked Obama's top aides in Chicago how the president's re-election would make Congressional Republicans any more likely to work with them, their response was: ''Our winning will teach them a lesson. It will make them look at themselves and realize that their positions are untenable. It will, finally, break the fever.''
I thought about this as I walked through the St. Anselm parking lot after the Romney event, past gridlocked cars, several of which loudly played the affirming sounds of conservative hosts on their radios. On this day, the feedback loop was atwitter over remarks by the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri, Todd Akin, and his bizarre comments about ''legitimate rape,'' plus the report in Politico about the drunken, skinny-dipping escapades of a congressman in the Sea of Galilee. A few days later, the evangelist Rick Warren would cancel his ''civil forum,'' after neither campaign would sign on to participate. Two days after that, Romney would trot out the old birther canard in front of a cheering crowd in Michigan. So much for the campaign of ''big ideas'' we were promised when Ryan was announced as Romney's running mate.
My best moment in New Hampshire came when I met Jim Preisendorfer, a semiretired salesman from Concord. He had a white Fu Manchu and wore a big crucifix dangling over a ''Pro-life to the max'' T-shirt. I waited for him to get in my face about liberal media bias, something that happens a fair amount at Republican events, but he could not have been nicer or more thoughtful -- a Catholic, active in his church, completely despairing about politics. I couldn't help it, and trotted out my ridiculous Sauerkraut Summit idea (which a few minutes earlier I proposed to a longtime Romney spokesman, Kevin Madden, who looked at me as if I had sauerkraut between my ears). Preisendorfer liked the idea. But of course Obama and Romney would never do it, he said. Why? ''It's pride in themselves and fear in one another,'' Preisendorfer said. I think I knew what he meant. But if it did happen? ''It would be awesome,'' he said. ''Just for them to sit down and be human beings. It would give me hope. That would make me so proud.''

HEADLINE: Canadian Cousins With Fleur-de-Lis And Mixed Genes

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
OTTAWA
TO Americans, they look familiar, yet strange. Their brand names don't ring a bell: Mayfair, Frontenac, Acadian, Meteor, Monarch, Fargo, Laurentian, Beaumont.
These are among the cars once created specifically for Canada, and usually built in Canada, by the Detroit-based automakers. In their heyday, from the end of World War II until the late 1960s -- a period of true mechanical distinctions between, say, Chevrolets and Pontiacs -- the Canadianized cars shamelessly borrowed parts and styling from their sister divisions.
Once common on Canadian roads, such cars have become, even here, largely forgotten historical footnotes.
When Denise Côté, a retired government secretary in Ottawa, went to register her 1957 Monarch Lucerne, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation would have no part of it. Until Ms. Côté commissioned an auto historian to provide the government a history of Ford Canada's Monarch brand, the license bureau would register her car only as a Mercury Monarch, a model that wasn't produced until the late 1970s and was sold on both sides of the border. 
''It is a Monarch Lucerne; it is not a Mercury,'' said Ms. Côté, a longtime car fancier. Referring to the bureaucrats, she said, ''They wouldn't change it for the world, and they eventually had to call Toronto to do it.''
A variety of factors inspired the Canadian subsidiaries of Ford, General Motors and Chrysler to create Canada-only models. But the sometimes oddball results came into being, and then faded away, largely because of import tariffs.
Until the United States and Canada signed an agreement in 1965 creating cross-border free trade in cars and auto parts, vehicles imported to Canada from the United States were subject to duties of as much as 35 percent. To avoid the duties, automakers struggled to find economical ways to squeeze a wide range of models onto single assembly lines in their Canadian factories.
The models were not adapted to Canadian roads, which aside from the snow and ice, were generally poorer, at the time, than American roads.
''Was there any design or engineering done?'' said Sharon Babaian, curator of transport at the Canada Science and Technology Museum. ''No, not really. It was very, very cosmetic. I think they probably put more money into the marketing than they did into the actual changing of the style of the vehicle.''
Canadians' disposable income has generally lagged that of Americans, but the gap was particularly wide in the 1950s and '60s. So automakers created less costly premium models for Canada even as they sold more or less the same base models in both countries.
General Motors of Canada and Ford Canada often took the same approach: they would drop a mildly redesigned body of a more costly Pontiac or Mercury onto the chassis of a similar Chevrolet or Ford. The less expensive car's engine and drivetrain would be kept, along with most of its interior.
Chrysler Canada often went with a hybrid approach, grafting the front end of a Dodge, then considered a more premium model, onto a Plymouth.
American Motors and Studebaker largely dealt with the situation by offering fewer models, although Studebakers continued to be made and sold in Canada after the company ended American production in 1963.
The mix-and-match approach had some disadvantages. Starting with 1959 models, the wheels of American-market Pontiacs were set further apart in what was heavily promoted as ''wide track'' design. As a result, Todd St. Clair of Ingersoll, Ontario, who runs Canadian Poncho, a site for Canadian Pontiac enthusiasts and collectors, said that when Pontiac body shells were placed on Chevrolet chassis in Canada, the cars' wheels were noticeably, and awkwardly, inset.
Mr. St. Clair added, however, that although Chevy powertrains were seen as more prosaic, Canadian Pontiacs offered a wider range of engines, including high-performance versions. And Canadianized Pontiacs often outsold Chevrolets in Canada.
''We had better choices than buyers of American Pontiacs,'' said Mr. St. Clair, who grew up in a Pontiac household but is now a service consultant at a Chrysler dealership.
Pontiac dealers also carried a separate Acadian brand, comprising compact Chevys that had been slightly reworked. Joe Lizon, a collector in Ortonville, Mich., owns two Acadians and bought two others for his adult children. He said the absence of a Pontiac badge meant that ''I can go to Pontiac shows and the Chevrolet shows'' to exhibit them.
While the Canadian models were primarily a product of trade restrictions, they also helped the American automakers counter a sentiment in postwar Canada that the United States held too much sway over the national economy.
A television commercial heralded the 1960 Mercury Meteor Montcalm, a modified Ford Galaxie, as ''Canada's idea car of the year.'' An announcer repeatedly boasted that it was ''distinctively Canadian,'' without further explanation.
For most manufacturers, making a car ''distinctively Canadian'' amounted to screwing on some token symbols. In an apparent homage to the nation's British roots, the exterior door locks on Ms. Côté's Monarch Lucerne have covers shaped like tiny gold crowns; there are more crowns on the hood ornament, steering wheel and trunklid. Other favored additions to hubcaps or steering wheels were maple leaves or the fleur-de-lis symbol of Quebec. Grilles were often redesigned and headlamps got distinctive, though not necessarily prettier, housings.
Where those designs originated is unclear. But R. Perry Zavitz, the author of ''Canadian Cars, 1946-1984'' (Bookman Publishing/Motorbooks International), said most of the design and engineering changes came from the head offices in the United States.
Mr. Zavitz said that several of the designs seemed based on styling cues from concept cars that were ultimately rejected for the American market. That seemed particularly true, he said, of the 1960 Frontenac, a reworked Ford Falcon with a bizarre grille: it featured a circular bull's-eye, two chrome spears and lozenge-shaped sections with, of course, an ample scattering of maple leaves.
''The Frontenac only lasted a year, which is some credit to Canadian consumers,'' said Ms. Babaian, the curator.
Canadianization was not limited to cars. Chrysler revived the Fargo name from its distant past to rebadge Dodge trucks for Canada's Plymouth dealers; Ford offered a line of Mercury trucks that were not sold in the United States.
After the auto trade agreement was signed, Canadian auto plants were integrated with their American counterparts and gradually began producing just a single line of vehicles, most of them destined for the United States.
Many Canadian models, however, persisted long after the trade agreement came into effect, if in ever less distinct forms. Eventually, Mr. Zavitz said, Ford started rebadging some Mercurys as Meteors and shipping them north from American factories. ''I don't know the reason why,'' Mr. Zavitz said. ''It seems kind of silly to ship a Canadian model from the United States.''
Because the Canadian models were generally budget versions of American cars, Mr. St. Clair, the Canadian Pontiac admirer, said they were long ignored by collectors, particularly in the United States, who viewed them as inferior. Ms. Babaian said that like many economy cars, they were more likely to be scrapped than saved, so they are relatively scarce today.
The paucity of surviving Canadian models and their novelty factor has led many collectors to re-evaluate Canadian models, Mr. St. Clair said.
''In the years past, the Canadian Pontiacs were kind of shunned,'' he said. ''Now we're starting to see more interest.'' Interest is also coming from collectors in Australia and Britain, where Canadian models were often exported.
Scarcity is a significant attraction for Mr. Lizon, the American collector of Canadian cars. His two 1965 Acadian Beaumonts were fitted with optional 350-horsepower V-8s. G.M. Canada's records indicate that only 23 such cars were built, he said. But even more mundane models were produced in relatively low numbers, reflecting Canada's smaller population, making surviving Canadianized cars quite scarce.
Ms. Côté bought her Monarch in 2006 because she had fond memories of the 1957 model she had bought secondhand after she got her first job. Through the Internet, she found one in Saskatchewan.
Though the days of Canadianized styling and borrowed powertrains are long gone, automakers have more recently made occasional exceptions to the rule of cross-border commonality. After General Motors introduced the Buick LaCrosse for 2005, it abruptly changed the car's name in Canada to the Buick Allure; in Québécois slang, ''la crosse'' is a vulgar expression.
But by the 2010 model year, when Buick introduced an all-new LaCrosse, it didn't bother to rebadge the car in Canada, perhaps reasoning that its French-speaking customers could withstand the potential embarrassment.

HEADLINE: Museum Shows With Moving Parts

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA LA ROCCO

 BODY:
HAD you stood in the middle of the Museum of Modern Art's atrium this summer and cast your eyes up, you might have seen a small mirrored square peeking from the base of a glass guardrail amid the scrupulously pristine architecture.
''We've joined the Ellsworth Kelly exhibit,'' the choreographer Dean Moss said, laughing, his voice sounding strange in the empty museum as he described how the Mylar prop had gotten wedged there during a rehearsal. It now seemed like the perfect punch line for a joke about the performing arts infiltrating the visual arts citadel: How did the choreographer sneak into the collection? ''A small mark of our passing,'' Mr. Moss wrote recently in an e-mail. ''I haven't checked lately, but perhaps it's still there.'' 
The square can't hold on forever. But dance just might. In recent years the form has become a high-profile fixture in museums, galleries and international exhibitions. What at first seemed like a run-of-the-mill trend has developed into a thoughtful integration. In New York, visual arts curators are increasingly scouting contemporary theaters; museums are examining how to collect ephemeral work and strengthen their performance departments. (The Whitney Museum of American Art just named Jay Sanders, who organized the performance-heavy biennial with Elisabeth Sussman, as its first curator of performing art and is creating its new building with an eye toward live art.) And performance series are being incorporated into historical surveys.
Next month Mr. Moss will be one of six choreographers commissioned by MoMA to present work in the atrium for what promises to be a marquee -- and well-named -- series: Some sweet day. Jérôme Bel, Deborah Hay, Faustin Linyekula, Sarah Michelson and Steve Paxton are the other illustrious artists chosen by the guest curator, the choreographer Ralph Lemon, who has, perhaps more than any other contemporary figure, managed a career that moves fluidly between genres and disciplines. (He performed in the atrium last year, during ''On Line: Drawing Through the Twentieth Century.'') Museum staffers have been pleased with recent performance experiments in the atrium, a challenging space; and should this series succeed, it will likely be followed by more.
''There's been great performance work at MoMA, but it's been on the side,'' said Jenny Schlenzka, an associate curator at MoMA PS1. ''We don't want to go back to the '60s, when dance was an alternative to the institution.''
The visual art world's current explorations in dance ''all speak to a certain acknowledgment that is unreliable but also real,'' Mr. Lemon said. ''We're now being given a different sort of real estate. This is not dance being placed in some back gallery as a tangential event. MoMA is giving me the atrium space with a very reasonable budget.'' (MoMA declined to release Mr. Lemon's budget.)
Dance and art have a rich history of mutual influence, of course, including the unruly experimentation within the Dada movement, the influential nexus of interdisciplinary collaborations galvanized by the Merce Cunningham Dance Company and, 50 years ago in New York, the radical developments in the performing and visual arts around the Judson Dance Theater.
While parallels are inevitably drawn between now and the Judson era, a time when hybrid and interdisciplinary investigations also abounded and political unrest was in the air, these broad-stroke comparisons gloss over essential differences. The art and dance worlds are much bigger and more commercial now, and more institutionalized. There is less space than there was 50 years ago, when Trisha Brown sent a harnessed dancer down the side of a SoHo building. These days her dancers are ensconced inside the museum.
''This is a moment when we've kind of tried to blow open the definitions of what and who belong in these places of culture,'' said MoMA's associate director, Kathy Halbreich. She is one of several galvanizing figures to have come from Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, a forward-thinking outlier that has long integrated live art into its vision. ''Which is interesting, because politically I think things are closing down,'' she added, referring to the ''recalcitrant positions'' that now curdle much debate in American society.
''Performing arts raise such profound questions about what we in the visual arts are doing,'' said Adam Weinberg, the Whitney's director. ''So what are the boundaries, if any? What is the role for museums in general, and what is the role for the Whitney particularly? It's thrilling.''
The question ''Why now?'' is also profound. Answers include the pragmatic: blockbuster performance-art shows like Marina Abramovic's retrospective at MoMA in 2010 invigorated museums just as a new generation of curators was becoming seduced by the tradition of body-based work. There are also more sweeping theories linking the rise of live art with the shift from an industrial economy (in which objects are privileged) to one centered around interaction and experience.
''We're reaching a moment that is a good decade in development, if not more,'' said Tim Griffin, the former editor in chief of Artforum who became executive director and chief curator of the Kitchen last year. ''People who are making work, regardless of their discipline, want to be in culture as it exists, responding to changing conditions. And, on the other hand, no doubt there is an appeal to interactivity. It's more attractive to audiences on some level.''
Though dance has long been in museums, events have often been haphazardly organized under the purview of public programming rather than as curatorial offerings on par with exhibitions. This marketing ploy has engendered a skepticism among many in the performance world about the latest round of interest.
''It's about the economy, simple as that, not that we are so amazing as choreographers,'' the Swedish choreographer Marten Spangberg said last spring, in a lecture given as part of MoMA PS1's Sunday Sessions. The Sunday Sessions, begun last year and typically taking place in the Performance Dome in the courtyard, do not comfort the skeptically minded.
''If you're really interested in performance, you're going to have to give it a better container,'' said Brian Rogers, the artistic director of the Chocolate Factory, who declined the invitation to be a session curator because, he said, he was uncomfortable with the tiny budget ($1,000) and the limited turnaround time of two weeks. ''When I talk to people from the visual art world, because they don't deal with these issues on a day-to-day basis, they don't understand what it means to support this kind of work and provide the space and time and frame it needs.''
Many in the visual arts agree with Mr. Rogers's assessment and readily acknowledge that a steep learning curve comes with figuring out how to compensate choreographers and dancers adequately and even provide them with basic amenities like water and dressing rooms. During the Abramovic retrospective, for example, dancers negotiated for better pay and working conditions. More recently Ms. Abramovic's involvement in a Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art gala caused a controversy, drawing accusations of performer exploitation from key Judson figures like Yvonne Rainer. (Of course the dance world itself is perennially short of funds, and artists bear the brunt of this.)
But curators also stress a willingness to learn and collaborate. Ms. Schlenzka welcomed Mr. Spangberg's critique, adding that the Performance Dome's hasty beginnings did not indicate future practices. ''The exhibition is in a crisis,'' she said. ''The object that doesn't move, in a show for three months, in a white cube: that format is also 150 years old, and it doesn't really work anymore. The magic got lost. That's why we as curators look to performance.''
''I would never pretend that I'm a specialist,'' she added. ''The thing that attracts me the most is that it is foreign.''
For Ms. Schlenzka and many others one of the most exciting aspects of placing dance within a visual-art context is what this often fraught transaction reveals about these two insular cultures.
The showings of Ms. Michelson's ''Devotion Study #1 -- The American Dancer'' at the Whitney Biennial (it won the show's Bucksbaum Award) were fascinating for the consternation they caused among visual-arts audiences, who seemed ill-prepared for the exacting, severe intensity of Ms. Michelson's work. People walked out, in droves. This excited her.''I do feel extremely grateful to watch the work translate outside its home into another environment, or watch my intention translate,'' she said. For others this very idea of translation is worrisome.
''I have encountered more and more people who are coming into visual arts, being newly hired in past few years in museums, that do seem to have some real openness to performance and are looking at it on its own terms,'' said Sarah Maxfield, a dance and theater artist and performance curator. ''It concerns me a little bit that those people also sometimes have a lot less context for performance, so the way the work gets framed is still in terms of visual art. And visual art is so much better at codifying its history.''
Those who share Ms. Maxfield's concerns of having their history co-opted are heartened that Mr. Lemon, one of dance's own, is the architect of Some sweet day.
''It's important we all go in being really knowledgeable about what's at stake,'' he said. ''So it doesn't just go away. It should leave some kind of mark, right?''

HEADLINE: 'The Waltons' Meets 'Modern Family'

BYLINE: By JENNIFER CONLIN

 BODY:
I AM now a statistic. Earlier this summer, the United States Census Bureau reported that the number of adult children living in their parents' households had increased by 1.2 million between 2007 and 2010. Shared households accounted for 18.7 percent of all American households in 2010, up from 17 percent in 2007. Most of those children were between age 25 and 34, but I had suddenly joined their ranks at a considerably older age.
In August 2010, as my husband, Daniel Rivkin, and I approached our 50th birthdays, we were suddenly forced to move into my parents' home in Michigan with our three teenage children and dog. Never mind that my older brother, who had lost his job the previous year, was already in residence in one of their basement bedrooms -- my parents' three-story rambling colonial home quickly accommodated us all.
Every family has different reasons for deciding on shared family living: ours, however, were somewhat out of the ordinary. Having left Egypt just months before the Mubarak government fell, we found ourselves back in an America that was in the middle of a recession, without any steady income or job prospects awaiting us. 
It is hard to say what was most disheartening about this development: losing our fiercely independent lives after having lived the previous 20 years in Brussels, Paris, London and then Cairo; burdening my parents with our large amounts of baggage, both mental and physical (shortly after we arrived, a 30-foot container of global possessions followed); or trying to start over at an age when my husband and I, both of us journalists, thought we would be on career cruise control.
We had lived, in the eyes of our friends, a charmed international life: showing our children the world, vacationing in the south of France and the Italian Alps, taking family trips to visit the ruins in Greece and the graves at Normandy. More recently, we took a cruise down the Nile with a huge gathering of family and friends, a weeklong trip that I would later write about for this newspaper and that would provide a memorable introduction to our new home.
It was an amazing way to live. Until it came to a sudden halt.
''Don't come back next week,'' Daniel said to me over the phone. I was standing before a wall of windows in a museum in Washington, D.C., on a Sunday morning in the middle of that August two years ago, admiring the Mall's national monuments below me. I was there on a final mother-daughter pre-college trip with my oldest. Daniel was back in Cairo dealing with new government press restrictions being enforced on local broadcast companies.
''This place is going to blow up,'' he mumbled to me. ''I think you should stay in America with the kids,'' he said, filling me in on the most recent rumors concerning President Hosni Mubarak's ailing health. As one journalist had recently told us, ''You will know the minute he dies, as there will be tanks in the street to stop any unrest.''
''I'm going to quit,'' he said firmly of his job managing global broadcast services for a news agency. Besides the political situation, he had been in several business disputes with his boss in the last year.
''And where am I supposed to go exactly?'' I asked hesitantly, knowing the answer he was about to give.
''It's time to implement the escape plan,'' he said, not using the heavily accented faux-C.I.A. voice he usually did to make me laugh when we discussed cutting short this latest posting.
The ''escape plan,'' something anyone facing financial troubles keeps in the back of his or her mind, was a strategy we had come up with over our last few months in Egypt. But it was also a scenario I never actually imagined implementing, as it not only involved moving from the Middle East back to my hometown in the Midwest, but also residing with my parents for an indeterminate amount of time.
It was one thing to go visit my folks in Michigan every summer. Their house in the countryside, complete with a swimming pool, was made for summer guests and, more important, for us. When my children were toddlers, my parents had generously converted the basement into an annex of three bedrooms and a family room for my growing, expatriate family.
But the notion of living with them beyond our normal Labor Day departure was incomprehensible. Having lived a three-movie plane ride away from my nearest relative for most of my married life, it was not unappealing to think of living ''near'' family. But living ''with'' them was something else entirely.
I thought of how strange it would be for our three children (Harriet, Florence and Charles, then 18, 14 and 13, respectively) to live in the United States for the first time.
I pictured my mother and father, preparing their lunch back in Michigan, totally unaware of what was about to happen to their quiet existence: the influx of a family of five, refugees from abroad with no jobs, no furniture and no money. All we had were a few suitcases of summer clothing.
As I drove up my parents' driveway with the children four days later, I watched as my mother, father and brother emerged from the house looking nervously excited by this sudden shift of events.
I tried my best to look cheerful as I stepped out of the car but felt physically ill. Here I was, back in the town where I was born and raised and had met and married my husband, but for the first time in my nomadic life I felt completely and utterly homeless.
OUR first week ''back'' in America was more than challenging. I soon understood why so many recent unemployed college graduates move back in with their folks and why new immigrants rely on extended family when they first come to America. They have little choice.
I had to scrounge the Internet for family health insurance, something we never had to worry about in Europe, where we always had government-provided health care. (In Cairo, we were given expatriate medical insurance.) The kids needed to see a pediatrician for physicals so they could play preseason sports, but finding an affordable plan was not easy. I signed up for a cheap one with a huge deductible, hoping none of us would get sick before we could afford a better one.
A couple of days after arriving in Michigan we headed to a department store to buy Florence new field-hockey cleats (hers were in Cairo), a couple of lunchboxes (until now, the kids had always had a school cafeteria) and some clothes (this would be their first time without a uniform). When I went to pay, I learned we faced another huge hurdle.
''I'm sorry,'' the woman at the checkout said, ''but you've been turned down for a store card.'' I pulled out my British credit card quickly, embarrassed at a rejection I had not even asked for (she had urged me to apply for a card to get a discount on that day's purchases). When I went to open a bank account the next day, I found out why.
We had no credit history in the United States, having lived abroad for so long, which meant that we could not take out a car loan, get a credit card or even rent a modest home.
Any family moving into new surroundings -- parents in with children, or children in with parents -- has to deal with an array of adjustments, from personality issues to domestic differences to living in a new part of the country. We had all of that, but were also suffering from extreme culture shock.
My children had never attended an American school, only British and French. Right before I dropped Charles off for his first day of school, he asked me, ''Mummy, how much are a dime and nickel worth?'' Florence and I needed new wardrobes. In Egypt, as women, we couldn't show our shoulders or knees or even the outline of our crotches. (Hence, the need for long shirts or a dress with leggings.)
Daniel, who had already been driving for 30 years, had to take a nerve-racking road test to get an American driver's license. And in the post office one day, I realized I did not know how much an American stamp cost.
Without the emotional support of my extended family (I also have more than a dozen cousins who live in town), I don't know how we would have readjusted. But I also found it extremely awkward initially when new friends learned of our living arrangement.
The first time was several weeks after we had moved back. One day the mother of a new friend of Florence's came to the front door to drop off her daughter. Before I could answer the bell, my mother was there offering her a lemonade.
Seconds later, as I was introducing myself, I saw her hand extend yet again. ''Hello, you must be Florence's father,'' she said, shaking my brother's hand.
''Actually, I am Florence's uncle,'' he said, breaking into a big grin. Behind her, I could see my father coming up the walk, his arms full of letters from the mailbox.
''Excuse me, young lady,'' he said as he wiggled his way past her.
It felt to me like this poor woman had just entered the set of a Noël Coward play, one of those weekend farces in which a stranger innocently arrives at a country estate and suddenly has to deal with the eccentric relatives.
''This is my parents' house,'' I blurted out. As if on cue, my mother and father introduced themselves, along with my brother.
''So where do you live?'' she asked me.
I felt my face go red.
IT'S been two years since that sudden move back to Michigan and into my parents' basement. But in spite of much upheaval for us all, a situation ripe for family melodrama (think ''Dallas,'' without the money) has become more of a modern-day Waltons (minus the group echo of good night in the hallways as we fall asleep in reverse generational order: oldest to youngest).
Our domestic arrangement, which was supposed to be temporary, has ended up becoming an unexpected test case of multigenerational living that we now have grown to accept. Though we initially tried to tiptoe around my father and mother (now 81 and 78, respectively), we soon realized it was impossible with our noisy teenagers leaving a chaotic trail of sports equipment and backpacks.
And though we tried at first to give each other ''space'' -- with my immediate family moving into the basement rooms, and my older brother moving upstairs to the second-floor guest room near my parents' room -- it quickly proved a futile exercise.
Why eat separately if we could save time and money dining together? Why buy an extra car if my father could do the post-school pickup? Why live separately, we all asked one by one, as we found more permanent employment, if we could live much more cheaply and better as an extended family?
Suddenly, Daniel and I, after experiencing built-in teenage supervision and dog sitting, couldn't imagine once again hiring help when we had to travel for work, which in both our careers can be quite often. My parents and brother routinely offered to pick up the children from the myriad American extracurricular activities they had enthusiastically signed up for, allowing Daniel and me more time for work and less for chauffeuring.
As for my parents, who were starting to feel lonely and overwhelmed by the upkeep on their underutilized house, our living together has given them not only a cheerier future but also a way they can stay in their beloved home. As we weighed the options, a bit of research helped us decide to stay put. It turns out that the traditional family has, in fact, been dying a slow death long before we thought of pulling the plug.
A Pew Research Center study, ''The Return of the Multi-Generational Family Household,'' published long before the most recent, even higher census figures, revealed that in 2008 a record 49 million Americans, or 16.1 percent of the country's population, lived in a family household that contained at least two adult generations or a grandparent and at least one other generation.
Those figures, according to that Pew report, represented a significant trend reversal that started right after World War II. In 1940, about a quarter of the population lived in a multigenerational home (my mother-in-law, in fact, grew up sharing a house with her aunt, uncle and cousins), while in 1980, only 12 percent did.
Seeing that the future for all of us looked far bleaker financially and emotionally apart than together, we managed to come up with a way to buy my parents' home last December, and now plan to add on, with any luck, a master suite on the ground floor with a study and separate entrance, all with wheelchair access, anticipating that they will not always be as spry as they are now, nor will we.
My children did not want to leave their grandparents, who give them firsthand accounts on history homework and a nonjudgmental shoulder to lean on. Nor did my parents want to lose the tech support (the children have taught them to use e-mail and Skype) or their link to the latest lingo (I almost died when my mother said ''junk'' instead of ''privates'' when discussing the Anthony Weiner scandal with me).
I don't know if my confirmed-bachelor brother will stay indefinitely, but I also don't see why he would leave. Like a Victorian-age family, we cook and clean for the oldest male sibling, while he contributes to the household bills, calmly teaches my children how to drive and plays basketball with them in the driveway on weekends. I now see how smart multigenerational immigrant families have been throughout history.
So when we watch family shows like ''Modern Family'' and ''Parenthood,'' we wonder why they don't just all move in together and get on with it. They are with one another all the time anyway, and it makes a lot of sense in these trying times.

Prehistory
1. MASTODON TUSK, ABOUT 11,000 B.C.
The bedrock of Manhattan formed a billion years ago, much later guiding the development of downtown and Midtown. Outcroppings of ancient schist, marble and gneiss are still visible, and other markers of the city's prehistory occasionally surface, too. The first recorded discovery of mastodon remains was in 1858, during the digging of the Baisley Pond reservoir in Queens. In 1891, laborers on the Harlem Ship Canal unearthed this yardlong mastodon tusk near Dyckman's Creek in the Bronx.
2. MUNSEE ARROWHEAD, PRE-1700
Humans arrived in New York at the end of the last ice age. Scattered prehistoric cultural artifacts, including hearths and spear points, found on a bluff overlooking Raritan Bay in Tottenville, Staten Island, attest to the presence of Paleo-Indians there about 8,000 years ago. The same site, known as Burial Ridge, was used as a graveyard thousands of years later by the Munsee and other branches of the Lenape, who witnessed Henry Hudson's approach in 1609. Evidence of later contact with Europeans was excavated, along with arrowheads made of bone, antler, stone and metal. One of Hudson's crew was killed, reportedly by an Indian arrow, in what was the first recorded homicide in New York City. 
1600s
3. THE SCHAGHENBRIEF, 1626
The Dutch settled on Governors Island and then in Lower Manhattan. The closest history comes to recording the supposed sale of Manhattan Island for $24 is the Schaghenbrief, a Nov. 5, 1626 letter from Pieter Schaghen, a Dutch representative of the West India Company, to his ''High and Mighty Lords.'' Schaghen reported the arrival in Amsterdam, on Sept. 23, of a ship from New Netherland. He dutifully cataloged the ship's cargo -- 7,246 beaver skins, 178 ½ otter skins, 48 mink skins, 36 lynx skins, 33 minks, 34 muskrat skins and oak timbers and nutwood -- and, incidentally, wrote that ''they have purchased the island Manhattes from the Indians for the value of 60 guilders,'' marking the beginning of European dominion. Schagen added: ''Our people are in good spirit and live in peace.'' Peace did not last, though. In 1640, the Dutch launched an unprovoked attack on the Indians, from which the Indians never recovered.
4. THE FLUSHING REMONSTRANCE, 1657
Despite repressive official policies, New Amsterdam earned a reputation for tolerance. On Dec. 27, 1657, Flushing residents challenged the fiat of the settlement's director-general, Peter Stuyvesant, against practicing Quakers and the public torture of a convert to Quakerism. Their missive, which became known as the Flushing Remonstrance, is considered a vital antecedent of the provision for freedom of religion in the Bill of Rights. The residents promised the Quakers, ''If any of these said persons come in love unto us, we cannot in conscience lay violent hands upon them, but give them free egress and regress unto our town.'' Six years later, the Dutch West India Company warned Stuyvesant against further religious persecution.
5. PAINTING OF NEW AMSTERDAM, 1665
Dutch New Amsterdam endured for four decades. In the 1640s, a French priest reported that Manhattan and its environs had grown to ''four or five hundred men of different sects and nations.'' Published views of the settlement date from at least 1651, but perhaps the most famous was a 1665 watercolor by Johannes Vingboons, adapted from another illustrator's earlier rendition of the colony in the waning days of Dutch rule. Vingboons's painting depicts a windmill and, ominously, gallows near shore.
6. THE OYSTER, LATE 1600S
If you are what you eat, then beginning in the 17th century no food epitomized New York more than oysters. The Dutch were initially chagrined that the local variety, which grew to nine inches and longer, did not produce pearls. But New Yorkers embraced them anyway. By the 19th century, New York Harbor had become the largest source of oysters in the world. They were baked into oyster pie, served raw (later popularized by Delmonico's) and hawked by street vendors. Oyster shells were so ubiquitous they were used to pave Pearl Street and to make mortar for Trinity Church. Concerns about over-harvesting date to at least 1658; pollution finally prompted the closing of the city's oyster beds in 1927.
1700s
7. ENGLISH-DUTCH DICTIONARY, 1730
Fed up with Stuyvesant's capriciousness and intolerant intransigence, in 1664 New Amsterdam surrendered to the enemy it didn't know: an English naval squadron of four warships. The victors renamed the settlement in honor of the Duke of York, who had sponsored the mission. The British took a laissez-faire approach to governing, but language differences got in the way of innovations like the jury system and divided the population. An English and Low-Dutch dictionary published by a New Jersey schoolmaster in 1730 addressed the problem. Coleslaw, cookie, pickle, waffle, stoop and Yankee are among the Dutch words that endured.
8. BEADS FROM THE AFRICAN BURIAL GROUND, 1700S
Slavery existed in New York through 1827, although free blacks also lived in the city, which later became a locus of the abolitionist movement. For about a century, until 1792, blacks were buried at a site that was then out of town, a few blocks north of City Hall, which was unearthed in 1991 during construction of a federal court house. Archaeologists found the remains of a middle-aged woman buried with hundreds of beads around her waist, suggesting, according to Steven Laise, the National Park Service's chief of cultural resources for Manhattan sites, that she was accorded ''considerable honor and prominence.'' Excavated objects were reburied at the site, now a national monument.
9. A HORSE'S TAIL, 1776
A raucous public rendition of the Declaration of Independence on July 6, 1776, inspired New Yorkers to converge on Bowling Green, the city's first public park, where they not only hacked off the crown-shaped finials on a wrought iron fence (it's still there) but toppled and beheaded the gilded equestrian statue of King George III, erected only seven years earlier. Much of the lead was melted to make bullets for the Continental Army. But a 19-inch remnant of the horse's tail survives in the collection of the New-York Historical Society. By some measures, this was the first official act of rebellion after independence was declared. 10. WASHINGTON'S BALCONY, 1789
George Washington stepped here: the second-floor balcony of 26 Wall Street, the nation's first Capital. He was inaugurated here on April 30, 1789. After Congress decamped for Philadelphia and ultimately for the banks of the Potomac, the century-old building was demolished in 1812 and sold for $450 in scrap. Among the few relics that were salvaged was a brownstone slab, 9 feet by 4 feet, on which Washington stood during the ceremony. It is on display at the Federal Hall National Memorial, on the original site.
Did Alexander Hamilton shortchange the city when he sold the capital city to the South? ''New York became the mercantile and financial capital first of the nation and then the world,'' said Prof. Kenneth T. Jackson, the Columbia historian, ''and maybe its excitement and vitality derive from the fact that it lacks the boring buildings and boring people who are part of the permanent bureaucracy.''
1800s
11. WOODEN WATER PIPES, ABOUT 1800
Capital or not, New York needed water. Even then, Albany worked in mysterious ways, which is how Hamilton's nemesis, Aaron Burr, wrangled a charter to supply the city with water in 1799, forming the Manhattan Company. Burr was more interested in other liquid assets, though. Invoking an overlooked clause in the company's charter, he spent sparingly on pumps and pipes and invested a surplus instead to create the Bank of the Manhattan Company. The company's abject failure to supply the city with sufficient potable water through its wooden pipes led to the city's construction in 1842 of the innovative Croton Reservoir system. The bank would evolve into Chase Manhattan, which, fearful of jeopardizing its charter, would continue to pump water from its downtown well until the 1920s.12. RANDEL'S MAP, 1811
Arguably, it was the map that made New York. In 1811, John Randel Jr. plotted a visionary geometric street grid, showing the future locations of the major avenues and numbered cross streets, from 1st through 155th. At the time, most Manhattanites lived below Houston Street, tellingly known as North Street. Randel, the great leveler, spent the next decade charting Manhattan's terrain to produce 40 leather books of field notes and 92 maps dividing most of Manhattan into flat 25-by-100-foot lots. Randel's matrix, which helped Manhattan absorb its growing immigrant population, made many landowners irate at the prospect of streets being plowed through their property -- though he later noted that many of their descendants ''have been made rich thereby.''
13. LAKE ERIE KEG, 1825
Since Dutch rule, New York's commercial ascendancy depended on its development as a port. On Oct. 26, 1825, the canal boat Seneca Chief left Buffalo carrying seemingly modest cargo: three green kegs specially adorned with painted eagles, but containing only water from Lake Erie. Eight days later Gov. DeWitt Clinton ceremoniously emptied them into the Atlantic Ocean in a majestic ''marriage of the waters'' to celebrate the completion of the Erie Canal. Clinton, one of the canal projects's great supporters, confidently predicted to city officials that their exclusory connection between the Atlantic and the Great Lakes would mean ''no limit to your lucrative extensions of trade and commerce.''
14. SINGER SEWING MACHINE, 1851
In the 19th century, New York became the nation's manufacturing capital. Buoyed by Isaac M. Singer's marketing of the first commercially successful sewing machine in the 1850s, and the demand for mass-produced clothing -- first for slaves and later for soldiers -- the garment industry began to boom in New York just before the Civil War. It became the city's biggest employer, an incubator for union organizers and eventually transformed Midtown West into the world's densest and most fashionable garment district. In recent years, high Manhattan rents and cheaper nonunion labor elsewhere have siphoned off most of the manufacturing. The Fashion Center Business Improvement District is even considering a name change. 15. PATENT FOR OTIS ELEVATOR BRAKE, 1861
United States Patent No. 31,128, issued less than three months before its inventor, Elisha G. Otis, died in 1861, made Manhattan's transformation into a vertical city possible. Otis did not invent the elevator, but he perfected the safety latch that made it practical for passengers and freight. In 1854, during the World's Fair, he introduced ''the first elevator wherein provision was made for stopping the fall of the car in the contingency of the breaking of the hoisting cables'' in a death-defying demonstration at the New York Crystal Palace, built in what is now Bryant Park. In 1870, the 130-foot-high, steel-framed and elevator-equipped Equitable Building, at 120 Broadway, ushered in the skyscraper era.
16. THE LEFFERTS' COOKBOOK, 1800S
Brooklyn was one of the nation's first middle-class suburbs. And from wedding cake to oyster pie, the recipe books of the Lefferts clan offer a look into a prominent Flatbush family's 19th century domestic life. The mostly handwritten recipes probably belonged to Gertrude Lefferts Vanderbilt and Maria Lott Lefferts. Vanderbilt's papers at the Brooklyn Historical Society include bills of sale for slaves and accounts of her family's experience during the draft riots in 1863. Her social history of Flatbush is a reminder to newcomers that Brooklyn had a social history before gentrification.
17. CHECKS OF BOSS TWEED, 1866-1870
William Magear Tweed had a ring to his name. He was briefly a congressman. But he wielded political power as the grand sachem of Tammany Hall, the corrupt machine that controlled mid-19th century New York and reliably delivered the votes of Irish and other Western European immigrants to Democratic candidates. In return for helping Jay Gould and James Fisk Jr. retain control of the Erie Railroad, Tweed was named a railroad director and further enriched himself by following their investment advice (sending checks from his account to buy stock). Once city fathers concluded that his financial machinations, exposed by The New York Times, threatened the city's credit, Tweed was arrested and imprisoned for a year. He escaped, was rearrested and died in 1878 in the Ludlow Street Jail.
18. EDISON'S DYNAMO, 1882
The electric age was born in 1882 on Pearl Street in Lower Manhattan when Thomas Edison began operating the city's first central power station. One jumbo dynamo helped generate enough direct current to power 800 light bulbs, and within a year Edison's company had more than 500 customers. Dynamo No. 9 survives at the Henry Ford Museum in Deerfield Village in Michigan.
19. BROOKLYN BRIDGE TOLL TICKET, ABOUT 1883-1898
The Brooklyn Bridge opened in 1883 after nearly a quarter-century of lobbying and impressive feats of mechanical and political engineering. Its trustees first considered free passage for pedestrians but, just 10 days before the formal opening on May 24, they set ticket fares: 1 cent for people on foot, 5 cents for railway passengers, and other rates that ranged from 2 cents for a sheep to 10 cents for a horse and wagon. Tolls were abolished by 1911.
20. MANUSCRIPT OF 'THE NEW
COLOSSUS,' 1883
In 1830, fewer than 1 in 10 New Yorkers were foreign-born. By 1850, nearly half were. But when the Statue of Liberty was dedicated in 1886 (six years before Ellis Island opened), no teeming masses were invoked. Miss Liberty was later recast almost single-handedly into the ''Mother of Exiles'' by Emma Lazarus, a fourth-generation American and a descendant of Alexander Hamilton. Her poem was commissioned to raise money for the statue's pedestal; a plaque with its words wasn't affixed until 1903. Its memorable appeal to ''give me your tired, your poor'' came to define the city's special appeal to immigrants and a motivating force that continues to reinvigorate New York and the nation. ''Letters were written home,'' said Barry Moreno, a historian of the statue for the National Park Service. ''Word of mouth taught people that you would see this wonderful goddess in New York Harbor when you arrived in America to welcome you.''
21. SCULPTURE OF THE 1898
CONSOLIDATION
If New York had not overcome considerable ambivalence and merged into what became the five boroughs in 1898, Los Angeles (with 3.8 million people) might be the nation's largest city today, followed by Chicago (2.7 million) and Brooklyn (2.5 million). By itself, Manhattan would rank fifth, behind Houston. That portentous consolidation was celebrated in Albert Weinert's allegorical white marble sculpture, installed in 1904 in the Surrogate's Court building on Chambers Street. A youth -- the new city? -- is flanked by Miss Brooklyn reaching out to Miss New York. The Brooklyn Bridge is in the background. The courtship and eventual union, Michael Miscione, the Manhattan borough historian, said, ''was easier to render in marble than in real life.''
1900s
22. CHILD'S SHOES FROM THE GENERAL SLOCUM, 1904
By the mid-19th century, New York was home to more Germans than any other city except Berlin and Vienna. On the morning of Wednesday, June 15, 1904, the General Slocum, a wooden passenger steamboat, caught fire with about 1,300 German-Americans aboard, mostly women and children. They were on a church excursion to a picnic from Kleindeutschland, or Little Germany, on the Lower East Side. More than 1,000 people died either in the fire or in the water after the boat sank off the Bronx. Among them was 3-year-old Anna Liebenow, whose body was recovered several days later. Her black leather shoes were kept by her sister Adella, who was among the 321 known survivors, who mostly clung to rotted life preservers or swam to shore. Subsequent regulations improved passenger safety. But Little Germany was devastated by the disaster -- the city's worst until 9/11 -- and most of its residents moved elsewhere to escape the memory.
23. TIFFANY SUBWAY THROTTLE, 1904
Underground rapid transit originated in Europe and, in 1897, a 1 ½-mile subway tunnel opened in downtown Boston. New York's much-delayed subway followed on Oct. 27, 1904. Mayor George B. McClellan, son of the Civil War general, was only supposed to pose for pictures with his hand on the throttle of a train, made by Tiffany & Company of sterling silver, steel and ebony. But McClellan declared, ''I'm running this train,'' and drove the subway on its maiden trip from City Hall all the way to 103rd Street, even skipping some local stops (the trip took 22 minutes). An estimated 150,000 passengers bought tickets that day (each cost a nickel) and boarded the subway between 7 p.m., when it opened to the public, and midnight. Daily ridership now tops 5 million.
24. BATTLE'S BADGE, 1911
The intersection of race and crime was being hotly debated a century ago. Samuel Battle moved to New York for good in 1901 when the city's 60,000 or so blacks accounted for less than 2 percent of the population. He worked as a houseboy at a hotel and as a red cap at Grand Central Terminal. A decade later he became the first black person appointed to the New York City police force. Battle, who was sworn in in 1911 and wore Badge No. 782, went on to become the first black sergeant and the first black lieutenant on the force. He was sometimes snubbed or worse by his white colleagues, but they were won over in 1919 when he rescued a white officer from a crowd of rioters in Harlem. ''The white officers worked in an all-Negro neighborhood, practically,'' he recalled, ''and they needed me as much as I needed them and sometimes more.''
25. THE AUTOMAT MACHINE, 1912
As a magnet for blue- and white-collar commuters, industrial New York all but invented the quick lunch to replace dinner, the old leisurely midday meal. No innovation hastened that transformation more than the Automat, the nickel-nourished chrome and brass vending emporiums that arrived in New York in 1912 (the vending machines survive, mostly in antique stores). The establishments were cheap and egalitarian (open seating, no tipping). The average man, an Australian observer wrote, became a ''manipulator of destiny'' in the Automat, suddenly finding himself ''before Ali Baba's cave. He whispers 'Open sesame!' and lo! a ham sandwich or a peach dumpling is his for the taking, also for a nickel.''26. THE BAGEL, EARLY 1900S
The first known mention of the bagel dates from 1610 in the community regulations of Krakow, Poland. The world's biggest bagel factory is in Illinois. Still, no other food is so associated with New York as the ''Jewish English muffin,'' which spread from the Lower East Side in the early 20th century. ''Pizza belongs to America now,'' Josh Ozersky, a food writer, said, ''but the bagel was always the undisputed property of New York.''
27. 1913 ARMORY SHOW STAMP
It was billed modestly as an International Exhibition of Modern Art, but the one-month show in 1913 at the 69th Regiment Armory on Lexington Avenue proved to be nothing short of revolutionary. What became known universally as the Armory Show introduced the works of 300 avant-garde artists, including Mary Cassatt, Wassily Kandinsky and Pablo Picasso, to city audiences. The show had the desired effect: Spectators were scandalized, captivated and confused -- a reaction captured by the quizzical couple depicted in a 1998 postage stamp celebrating the century's second decade.
28. FIRST YANKEE STADIUM PROGRAM, 1923
A record crowd of more than 74,200 fans -- the biggest crowd in baseball history at the time -- turned out on April 18, 1923, to celebrate the opening of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. An additional 25,000 were turned away. The commissioner of baseball came by subway. John Philip Sousa himself led the Seventh Regiment Band. Gov. Alfred E. Smith defied the typical opening day program by throwing the first pitch flawlessly. In the third inning, Babe Ruth redeemed his disappointing 1922 season by delivering a decisive homer into the bleachers. Initiating a tradition that defined the Bronx and will be nine decades old next year, the Yankees beat the Red Sox, 4-1.
29. RIVOLI AIR CONDITIONING
ADVERTISEMENT, 1925
In 1902, Willis Carrier, a junior engineer for a furnace company, installed a maze of fans, ducts and pipes in a printing plant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to lower the humidity that made the paper expand and to dry the ink faster. Two decades later, the company's centrifugal chiller heralded modern air-conditioning. When the Rivoli Theater, a Times Square movie palace, installed the ''refrigeration'' system in 1925, advertisements promised ''the manufacturing of ideal weather.'' Office workers also benefited. And life across the American South and Southwest became less unbearable. As a result of population shifts to that region, New York State's Congressional delegation will have shrunk to 27 of the total 435 seats when the new House session convenes in January 2013, from 45 in the 1940s.
30. TICKER TAPE, 1929
For better or for worse, Wall Street has been synonymous with American finance -- and has defined New York to the rest of the world -- since 1792, when 24 brokers convened under a buttonwood tree outside 68 Wall and agreed to regulate the stock market. Arguably, Wall Street's worst moment was Tuesday, Oct. 29, 1929. When the market closed at 3 p.m., it had lost $14 billion -- more than $300 billion in today's dollars. A record 16.4 million shares had been traded. The last ribbon of ticker tape, which could accommodate 285 words a minute, ran hours late.
31. THE ARTICHOKE, 1933
Long before ordinary New Yorkers had ever heard of the Black Hand or the Mafia, Ciro Terranova imported the latest incarnation of ethnic crime from Corleone in Sicily. He also imported artichokes from California, cornering the market, terrorizing merchants and earning the sobriquet ''the Artichoke King.'' In 1935, going to the heart of the matter, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia barred the sale, display and possession of artichokes in New York City in an attempt to topple Terranova's empire. Terranova (played by Jack Weston in the TV series ''The Untouchables'') might also have been the only person threatened with arrest if he ventured into the city from his home in Westchester County. The threat was fulfilled when he was charged with vagrancy in 1937. The charge became self-fulfilling a year later when he died penniless.
32. TREE OF HOPE, 1934
Don't mess with show business superstitions. In the midst of the Harlem Renaissance, Ralph Cooper Sr. began the weekly Wednesday Amateur Night at the Apollo Theater, which would become a springboard for generations of musical stars, including Ella Fitzgerald, James Brown, Diana Ross and Stevie Wonder. Good luck, it was said, would come to performers who paused under the branches of an elm tree that stood on Seventh Avenue between the Lafayette Theater and Connie's Inn. When the tree was removed so the avenue could be widened, Cooper bought an 18-inch diameter piece of the trunk, which was mounted on a pedestal at stage right. Contestants still touch it for good luck before they perform.
33. TIME CAPSULE FROM 1939
WORLD'S FAIR
Tomorrow came early to New York in 1939. The World's Fair, which drew an estimated 44 million visitors over two years, officially celebrated the 150th anniversary of George Washington's inauguration, but was also motivated by a more immediate goal: to help lift the city and the nation out of the doldrums of the Great Depression. A copper time capsule, containing seeds, a newsreel, a pack of cigarettes, coins and ''all the principal categories of our thought, activity and accomplishment,'' was buried 50 feet below Flushing Meadows on Sept. 23, 1938. It is to be opened in 6939.
34. LEVITTOWN HOUSE, 1947
William J. Levitt did not invent suburbia. But his prototype mass-produced developments fostered its growth and, consequently, an exodus of white would-be homeowners from New York City in the postwar years. (New York City had 7.1 million white residents in 1950, and 3.7 million in 1980.) Before the first foundations were even finished and a month after construction was announced, Levitt & Sons said that all 2,000 of the cookie-cutter four-room homes it was building in a former potato field in the Town of Hempstead, on Long Island, had been spoken for. Rent was $60 a month, with an option to buy at $6,990. The original lease barred nonwhite renters. One of the few original houses that has not been expanded, 52 Oak Tree Lane, was designated a town landmark in the 1990s.
35. 1955 WORLD SERIES BANNER
The Brooklyn Dodgers earned their nickname in the 1890s because the team's fans had to dodge the borough's omnipresent trolleys (the name did not appear on uniforms until 1932). Brooklynites' quixotic cry of ''Wait 'til next year'' was finally redeemed in 1955 when their beloved team rebounded from a two-game deficit to win the World Series -- against the Yankees, yet! It was ''Da Bums' '' first and last World Series win before the team decamped for Los Angeles.
36. CHECKER TAXICAB, 1952-1986
More people use mass transit in New York than in any other American city. But no other city is so dependent on taxis. From 1952 to 1986, Checker Motors in Kalamazoo, Mich., manufactured the A8/Marathon. Thousands of the bulky cabs clogged New York's streets. They came in all colors until 1967, when city officials required that taxis be painted yellow. During the Depression, when drivers outnumbered passengers, many owners could not afford to renew their medallions for $10. Last year, when taxis made about 500,000 trips daily and carried 240 million passengers in total, a medallion traded for more than $1 million.
37. DIPLOMATIC PLATES,
1960S ONWARD
The opening in 1952 of the 17-acre United Nations complex on Manhattan's East Side validated the city's claim as the world's capital. Today the city is home to 35,000 diplomats and staff and family members attached to 193 permanent missions, which contribute an estimated $2.5 billion to the city's economy. Any other city would be proud of that distinction, but New Yorkers are typically blasé. Mentioning the United Nations mostly conjures up the ideas of traffic congestion and parking challenges, although the city says that 95 percent of the tickets issued to the 2,476 diplomatic license plate holders in the city are paid.
38. 'TONIGHT SHOW' AUDIO TRACK, 1962
The first commercial television licenses were issued to NBC and CBS stations in New York in 1941 and the city quickly became America's television capital. ''Persuading the nation to stay up late and hear some more commercials is apparently going to be a manageable and agreeable task for Johnny Carson,'' Jack Gould, the television critic for The Times, concluded after Carson, 37, made his debut on Oct. 1, 1962, as Jack Paar's replacement as host of ''The Tonight Show'' on NBC. Greeted by thunderous applause after he was introduced by Groucho Marx, Carson deadpanned: ''Boy, you would think it was Vice President Nixon.'' Even after ''Tonight'' moved to Burbank, Calif., in 1972, New York and its crime and grime remained the butt of many of Carson's opening monologues.
39. GREEK COFFEE CUP, 1960S
Before Starbucks and other national chains, takeout coffee was invariably delivered in a blue and white paper cup featuring a Greek vase -- as many as 500 million were sold annually as recently as two decades ago. The Anthora, as the cup was called, was created in the early 1960s especially for the New York market and its ubiquitous Greek diners and delicatessens by Leslie Buck, a Holocaust survivor who was sales manager of the Sherri Cup Company in Connecticut. Demand for the distinctive design -- as characteristic of New York as yellow cabs -- declined as newer immigrants, including Koreans and Bangladeshis, succeeded Greek restaurateurs who moved to the suburbs.
40. BERNSTEIN'S BATON, 1969
Like so many New Yorkers, Leonard Bernstein was born somewhere else: in Lawrence, Mass. After graduating from Harvard, he was named assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic in 1943 (at age 25), music director in 1958 and laureate conductor after his farewell concert with the Philharmonic on May 17, 1969. He introduced millions of young people to music through special concerts and was famed a both a conductor and a composer (he wrote the music for ''West Side Story''). In the farewell concert, he conducted Mahler's Third Symphony with a favorite baton, uniquely designed with a cork, ball-shaped bottom that allowed him to fling his arms without losing his grip.
41. SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL, 1960S ONWARD
As many as 750,000 cheap handguns were flooding the United States annually from abroad until import laws were tightened in 1968, spawning a cottage industry that produced millions of pot-metal weapons -- made from an alloy of copper and lead -- that sold for as little as $5. They were dubbed ''Saturday night specials'' because they were often brandished in weekend domestic disputes as well as in other crimes. They became emblematic of rampant violence, which peaked in the city in 1990, when 2,245 murders were recorded.
42. 'FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD'
HEADLINE, 1975
The City of New York never formally defaulted on its debts (although the Legislature imposed a debt moratorium). And the president never actually told anyone to ''drop dead.'' But the famous headline in The Daily News captured the spirit of Washington's snub and the gravity of the city's fiscal crisis. Without a last-minute infusion from the teachers' union, the city would have run out of cash. The effects of mass layoffs and cuts in vital services would, within a decade or so, precipitate social, financial and political crises that, arguably, were even more severe than the fiscal crisis itself.
43. AIDS BUTTON, 1980S
In 1982, 752 cases of a mysterious and fatal illness that would be called Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome were reported in New York City. By 2010, nearly 170,000 cases had been diagnosed. Over 30 years, the illness devastated whole communities even as it served as a focal point for the gay rights movement, especially Act Up, which campaigned vigorously against the government's slow response to the epidemic. The city's health department describes New York as the nation's epicenter of H.I.V./AIDS. Today, about 100,000 New Yorkers are living with the disease, thanks to advanced medicines. But it is still the third leading cause of death for New Yorkers between the ages of 35 and 54.
44. LOISAIDA AVENUE SIGN, 1987
It was called the Lower East Side, the East Village, Alphabet City. But in Nuyorican, the local Latino vernacular, it is Loisaida. Popularized by the poet Bittman Rivas in 1974, the name became official when the city sanctioned Loisaida Avenue as another name for Avenue C in 1987. By 2000, a surge in immigration and higher birthrates nudged Hispanic New Yorkers past blacks as the city's second-largest racial or ethnic group.
45. THE BOOM BOX, 1980S
When bigger was better, the suitcase-size boom box was a necessity for big-city teenagers. In the 1980s, sales nationwide topped $20 million a year. In Spike Lee's ''Do the Right Thing,'' Radio Raheem carried his everywhere, playing Public Enemy's ''Fight the Power.'' By the '90s, the battery-powered bass-heavy boxes equipped with radios and cassette players were supplanted by Walkmans and smaller devices, even as hip-hop and rap -- born in New York City -- came to dominate musical culture worldwide. 46. THE PHANTOM'S MASK, 1988
Broadway was dubbed ''The Great White Way'' (accounts differ as to whether the name was originally inspired by the bright lights or a 1902 snowstorm) early in the 20th century, when a critical mass of new theaters established Midtown West as the theater district. Musicals have been popular since at least 1915 (Jerome Kern and Guy Bolton's ''Very Good Eddie''), but none ran as long, made as much money or attracted audiences as successfully as ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' by Andrew Lloyd Webber, which was imported from London and opened in New York in 1988. Because of policies initiated by Mayors Edward I. Koch, David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani, a resurgent Times Square came to symbolize a city that broke population records and is booming again with businesses and tourists.
47. THE METROCARD, 1994
In the 1970s, the subway system was decrepit and riddled with crime, graffiti and rundown equipment until its chairman, Richard Ravitch, successfully lobbied for a cash infusion. That was the beginning of a turnaround that would deliver new cars and amenities, like the MetroCard, which was introduced in 1994 and replaced the token altogether nine years later. The cards became emblematic of a modernization program that included signs alerting riders to waiting times, progress on a Second Avenue subway and the extension of the Flushing line on the West Side. Ridership in 2011 was the highest in a half-century.
48. 9/11 DUST, 2001
Sept. 11, 2001, began beautifully, a stunning day on which New Yorkers were voting on mayoral nominees. Within 104 minutes, two jet planes hijacked by terrorists toppled both towers of the World Trade Center, defining a decade and leaving a grim legacy that took many forms. Among them, a jar of dust collected by museum curators at ground zero.
49. MAST BROTHERS CHOCOLATE BAR, 2007 ONWARD
Brooklyn never hit bottom as deeply as the Bronx, but it began hemorrhaging its population in the 1950s in a mostly white, middle-class exodus. Today, the borough is booming again, inching toward its peak population of nearly 2.7 million in 1940, as young couples gentrify neighborhoods that not long ago were considered marginal at best. Brooklyn has also become a global brand, most identified with artisanal businesses, like Mast Brothers Chocolate of Williamsburg, which opened in 2007.
50. MENG POLITICAL SIGN, 2012
Mark another notch for ethnic succession. When City Councilman John C. Liu of Queens was elected comptroller in 2009, it was the first time an Asian-American won citywide office. In June, Grace Meng proved it was no fluke by winning a Democratic Congressional nomination in Queens. The 2010 census found that the number of New Yorkers of Asian origin had surpassed one million for the first time. New York, easily the nation's biggest city, began the second decade of the 21st century with another growth spurt, adding more people than any other city in the country in the 15 months ending July 1, 2011, and, for the first time in decades, even outpacing population gains in the neighboring suburbs.

HEADLINE: Who Wears the Pants in This Economy?

BYLINE: By HANNA ROSIN

 BODY:
Patsy Prater's office looks like something between an executive's and a teacher's, her large desk crowded with neat piles of grant applications and daily logs but also with dishes of candy and other freebies for the young and old who pass through. On the bulletin board behind her head are big, colorful signs designed to remind her public-housing clients of what they are eligible for: cellphones, computer classes or prescriptions that she makes sure they have even if she has to drive them to the pharmacy herself. At the front of her desk is a photo of her ''grandbaby,'' who lives in Madison, Ala., three hours away. She wishes she could be there, taking care of the infant now that her daughter is back at work. ''I love this job,'' she said. ''I know it's where I'm supposed to be. But I am not a women's-rights-type person. My place is in the home, and I'm fine with that, so long as my husband is earning the bacon. 'Course, that hasn't been happening so much lately.'' 
Patsy, who is 50 and works as a family-services director, and her husband, Reuben, 52, met on a blind date in 1979, and that very night he asked her to marry him -- the first line of what he calls their ''Cinderella'' story. ''What would you have done if I were a terrible kisser?'' she likes to ask him, and he always answers, ''I would have taught you how.'' In 1981, Reuben was ready for a wedding, but Patsy was in her first year of college. Reuben told her he was madly in love, and if she did not quit school and marry him, he wouldn't wait, ''and I was stupid enough to believe him,'' she says.
For the greater part of her marriage, the setup worked just fine for Patsy. Because Reuben stopped her from going to college, she could do what she wanted, which was to raise their three daughters without feeling guilty about not working. Reuben, who had a bachelor's of science degree from Auburn University, was one of the longest-running service contractors for the Russell Corporation, the maker of athletic wear and the town's largest employer. He ran a lucrative business cleaning the special pine floors at some of the mills and also had private clients in town. He made enough money for a very comfortable life: a house on a quiet, rural road here in Alexander City, Ala., four cars and multiple church missionary trips for his family to places like Africa and Brazil. Because he owned the business, Patsy could help him out with payroll and accounting on her own time and always be free to pick up the girls from school.
The mills supplied enough steady employment to keep most people in Alexander City out of poverty -- until the mid-'90s less than a quarter of schoolchildren qualified for free or reduced-price lunch -- and allow many families in town to live well. Here, a man with a degree in textiles or engineering could make $70,000 or even $100,000, enough to afford a house on the lake and a motorboat. He could drive a Lexus S.U.V. and take his family on a vacation to Disneyland and go to church, where, if he needed it, he would be prayed for by name.
In 1996, at the height of its success, Russell employed 7,000 of the town's 15,000 residents. But the company soon faced competitors that undercut its prices. Like many textile companies in the area, Russell began shifting its plants to Mexico and Honduras, where clothes could be made cheaply. A decade later, only 3,200 people were still working for Russell in Alexander City, and the company was bought by Berkshire Hathaway. Now, at the facilities that remain open, that number is down to about 900, leaving many families in town in financial straits. The percentage of students at the high school receiving free lunches rose to 50 percent.
Reuben tried shifting his business focus to private homes, but ''people don't spend money on carpet and floor cleaning when they need it to buy groceries.'' Within a few years the Praters went from comfortable to shaky. They relied on revolving accounts: refinancing the house to pay the credit-card bill, using the credit card to pay the electricity bill before the power went out. The phone frequently rang, and the person on the other end would ask, ''Can you make that payment today?'' The family stopped answering the phone.
Reuben said he realized that he would never have his old work life back and tried to remake himself. He found a job as director of mall operations in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and then one at a conference-call company in West Point, Ga., and next at a tire plant in Dothan, Ala. None lasted long. One ''crazy thing or another,'' as Patsy puts it, always doomed him: his long commutes, his health, family obligations, constant reminders that he was no longer his own boss. Over time, he became discouraged. He wasn't ''making the money I need to be making.''
As Reuben's paychecks became less dependable, Patsy began ''stressing'' and wondered what she could do to help. Over the years she taught music at day-care centers, sometimes taking their youngest daughter, Jordan, with her. She had been ''scared to death'' to go back to college, but she studied at night with the aim of becoming a special-education teacher. Around 2006, a friend cornered her in a hallway at church and said she knew of a job that sounded perfect for her. Patsy was known as a helper by nature, driving seniors to church, assisting the youth choir, organizing mission trips. The friend recommended an opening at the city housing authority as a family self-sufficiency coordinator, which meant helping families in public housing become independent by connecting them with services.
Being a self-sufficiency coordinator involved a maternal touch, like encouraging single mothers to continue their education, obtain prenatal care and find reliable child care. Patsy had little experience in the work force and did not think of herself as a professional or a manager, but the friend told her she could possibly make as much as $20 an hour, which sounded better than the $5.50 she made at day care. It might not have been enough for Reuben, but to Patsy, who never had a steady paycheck, it sounded incredible. In three years she was promoted twice and is now director of family services. ''I can only say it was God's hand that did it,'' she says. ''I wasn't searching for a job like that, not with my skills.''
In the last decade, men, especially working-class and middle-class men, have had very different experiences in this economy from the women around them. The manufacturing sector has lost almost six million jobs, nearly a third of its total work force, and has taken in few young workers. Across eastern Alabama, the old textile mills closed one after another, badly shaking up the economy. In Tallapoosa County, which contains Alexander City, the unemployment rate at the time I first visited last year was 13.3 percent -- pretty standard for the region during the height of the recession. The housing bubble masked this new reality for a while, creating work in construction and related industries. But then that market crashed as well. Some jobs are trickling back now that Alabama is shifting its focus to ''advanced manufacturing,'' meaning jobs in industries like automobiles and aeronautics that require a higher degree of skills and training, says Joe Sumners, director of the Economic and Community Development Institute at Auburn University. But traditional manufacturing is unlikely to play the same role in the economy it once did.
While millions of manufacturing jobs have been lost over the last decade, jobs in health, education and services have been added in about the same numbers. The job categories projected to grow over the next decade include nursing, home health care and child care. Of the 15 categories projected to grow the fastest by 2016 -- among them sales, teaching, accounting, custodial services and customer service -- 12 are dominated by women. These are not necessarily the most desirable or highest-paying jobs. But they do provide a reliable source of employment and a ladder up to the middle class. It used to be that in working-class America, men earned significantly more than women. Now in that segment of the population, the gap between men and women is shrinking faster than in any other, according to June Carbone, an author of ''Red Families v. Blue Families.''
In Alexander City, while the men were struggling, women either continued on with their work or found new jobs as teachers, secretaries or nurses or in the service industry. Like many states, Alabama has cut government services over the last few years, but the jobs that remain are relatively stable, Sumners said. More important than the particular jobs available, which are always in flux, is a person's willingness to adapt to a changing economy. These days that usually requires going to college or getting some job retraining, which women are generally more willing to do. Two-thirds of the students at the local community college are women, which is fairly typical of the gender breakdown in community colleges throughout the country.
''An important long-term issue is that men are not doing as well as women in keeping up with the demands of the global economy,'' says Michael Greenstone, an economist at M.I.T. and director of the Hamilton Project, which has done some of the most significant research on men and unemployment. ''It's a first-order mystery for social scientists, why women have more clearly heard the message that the economy has changed and men have such a hard time hearing it or responding.''
As the usual path to the middle class disappears, what's emerging in its place is a nascent middle-class matriarchy, in which women like Patsy pay the mortgage and the cable bills while the men try to find their place.
The former Russell men are sometimes categorized by people in town as one of three types: the ''transients,'' who drive about an hour to Montgomery for work and never make it home for dinner; the ''domestics,'' who idle at the house during the day, looking for work; and the ''gophers,'' who drive their wives to and from work, spending the hours in between hunting or fishing.
In the years since his business declined, Reuben Prater seems to have played all three of these roles. Last fall, Reuben finally landed a good job in town as an information-technology specialist at a bank. But this year the bank was bought by another, and dozens of local employees, including Reuben, were laid off, and he was looking for a job again. Most mornings Reuben still wakes up at 5:30, goes to the gym and is back by 7:15 to have a quick breakfast with Patsy and their 18-year-old daughter, Jordan, who just graduated from high school. He sometimes receives texts from Patsy during the day, asking him to do one thing or another. Reuben does the laundry and runs the dishwasher and vacuums, but he doesn't really make dinner. He goes to Walmart to buy groceries or pick up something for Jordan if he has to, but shopping is his least favorite chore. ''I'm the househusband,'' he says, half-joking. Sometimes he helps Patsy with work, doing research or helping set up an event for clients, just as she used to help him. Or he does volunteer work at church. In between these tasks, he trolls monster.com and other job sites, although some days he is so busy with the housework that he doesn't get to the job search until 10 at night, when it's peaceful in the house and no one is texting and asking him to run errands. In the last two months, he sent out 252 résumés to as far away as Toronto and Sacramento, but hasn't heard anything. ''My wheel's just not rolling right now,'' he says. ''I got to find a new wheel or a new way to inflate the old one.''
One Wednesday morning this summer, after saying goodbye to Patsy, Reuben went to Burger King to have breakfast with his best friend, Tim, his ''twin brother by a different mother'' as he calls him. (They have the same birthday.) They usually meet every Saturday morning, but Tim, who had been working at Russell Medical Center, a large hospital, lost his job when his position in the marketing department was eliminated, and the previous day was his last at work. Tim's wife is among the remaining employees at Russell, largely because she's ''willing to do anything -- payroll, balance the books, do shipping,'' he says. But Tim, like Reuben, has had trouble finding steady work and found himself idling at what Reuben called their ''pity party.''
There were only men at the Burger King that morning: men in baseball hats talking. A candidate for mayor dropped by, as did a few men they knew from church.
''Hey, Reuben, what you up to?''
''Not doing anything, just playing. If you find anything for me to do, call me.''
Reuben has a college degree and doesn't seem especially preoccupied with machismo, so I asked him why, given how many different kinds of jobs he has held, he couldn't train for one of the jobs that he knew was available: something related to schools, nursing or retail, for example. One reason was obvious -- those jobs don't pay as much as he was accustomed to making -- but he said there was another. ''We're in the South,'' he told me. ''A man needs a strong, macho job. He's not going to be a schoolteacher or a legal secretary or some beauty-shop queen. He's got to be a man.'' I asked several businesswomen in Alexander City if they would hire a man to be a secretary or a receptionist or a nurse, and many of them just laughed. It's not hard to imagine a time when the prevailing dynamic in town might be female bosses shutting men out of the only open jobs.
Downtown Alexander City still sustains a wine store, a couple of restaurants, a quaint soda-fountain pharmacy, a real-estate office that looks like a SoHo loft and a trendy jeans-and-dress store that expanded this spring, among other businesses. But as with other once-prosperous towns, Alex City, as it is called, is straining to keep up appearances. A few storefronts are empty, and a few more look as if they're barely hanging on. Cecil's Public House, the one fancy restaurant, burned down in March and hasn't been replaced, and a new gourmet bakery closed. People worry that one day the downtown might go the way of Goodwater, a city with a string of abandoned gray buildings 15 miles to the northwest.
The center of Alexander City is dominated by the steeple of the First Baptist Church, a thriving evangelical community, with packed pews every Wednesday and Sunday and events nearly every day of the week. There are several other churches in town, but First Baptist has always been the destination for much of the Alex City establishment, including some members of the Russell family, plant managers, doctors, lawyers and prominent couples like Charles and Sarah Beth Gettys. I met the couple, who are in their mid-50s, at a Wednesday-evening church supper last year -- I noticed them because Sarah Beth was one of the few people at church wearing a suit. She is an executive at Russell Medical Center and, as I would learn over several visits, often the only person at Wednesday supper who so obviously raced over straight from the office and still had pressing business on her iPhone. Charles has more time on his hands but not necessarily fewer worries. ''Probably no one has had their wife move up the ladder as far as I've moved down,'' he told me the first night we talked, in his blunt and wry way. ''For years I was the major breadwinner, and this has flipped the family around. Now she is the major breadwinner.''
Charles started out at Avondale Mills, in Pell City, Ala., hauling 80-pound rolls of cotton as a teenager; Avondale paid for him to attend nearby Auburn University to study textiles and engineering. He eventually moved to Russell, and for 23 years, Charles rose up the ranks at the plant, becoming a manager in the dyeing-and-finishing department and later head of national sales for the fabrics division. He sent three children to college and built a much-admired house on the lake. Even now, he carries the air of a comfortable patriarch; he is trim, with white hair and clear blue eyes. At church he looks as if he is about to go golfing, in khakis and a button-down shirt. He is usually self-deprecating, so he doesn't quite put it this way, but it's clear that he experienced his time at Russell as his glory days, when as the head of sales, he took trips to New York and stayed at the company's Midtown apartment and saw Broadway plays and ate delicious rolls that don't quite compare with the crumbly corn bread served at church suppers.
About 10 years ago Charles said he began to feel as if ''I was on a horse that wasn't going to make it. So do you just push the horse and hope for the best or get off?'' Russell was no longer the place he had known. The company was hiring more women in managerial jobs, and while he had no problem with that in general, he said that some of these women hadn't started out hauling cotton as he had and didn't know the business from the ground up. But the company felt pressure to hire them, Charles told me, ''to keep up with the times.'' Russell was also shutting down plants, and Charles knew his position couldn't last much longer. At one point he was offered a job running one of Russell's local plants, but he declined. He was 45 at the time, young enough, he thought, to start over.
Unlike Patsy Prater, Sarah Beth has always worked. ''If I had to sit at home, I would lose my mind,'' she told me one morning as we talked in her office. Sarah Beth started as a nurse on the third shift at what was then just a small-town hospital. To the family, her salary was ''fun money.'' She would use it to shop for herself and, if the children complained about her working overtime, she would give them a choice: she could work less or pay for a family ski vacation.
As the hospital grew, Sarah Beth rose steadily up the ranks. In 2003, when Charles finally decided to quit, Sarah Beth had already been promoted into management, so he thought she could support them until he found his footing. Charles was always pretty handy, so he considered starting a construction company, even though he had never run a business. Working with trucks and piles of wood was a ''humbling experience,'' especially after having been a head of national sales. He said that he knew he would be competing with men who were in the business a long time or with younger men who once worked for him. When he had his broody moments, Sarah Beth said she would tell him: ''Build a bridge and get over it. Don't just sit and whine and carry on.'' He finally started the business in 2004 and for a time it was ''mildly successful,'' but then the housing crisis hit in 2008 and construction work largely dried up.
Sarah Beth, meanwhile, was moving up the institutional ladder the way Charles once had, advancing from nurse manager of the medical-surgical unit to vice president in charge of patient services. She now spends her days in an office sandwiched between the chief executive and the chief financial officer of the hospital. She has a secretary and an endless series of meetings and conferences across the country. Her salary is now the money that the family relies on to pay the mortgage and the basic household expenses. One Wednesday evening I was tiptoeing my way toward asking Charles how he felt about his wife's achievements -- nervous that I might wound his pride -- when he said: ''I know what you're asking. How does it feel to go from being the major breadwinner to the secondary breadwinner?''
He told me: ''It used to bug me, but now I've gotten used to it.'' What helped was realizing that he wasn't alone in this upside down world he was living in. Shortly after he left Russell, Charles called the unemployment office in Montgomery to ask a question. The voice on the phone sounded familiar, and after a few minutes he realized he was talking to a woman who had worked with him at Russell. She transferred him to her supervisor, who turned out to be another woman who had worked with him. ''You're gonna laugh at this,'' Charles told me, ''but it was harder on the men than the women. It seems like their skills were more, what's the word, transferable? I was born in the South, where the men take care of their women. Suddenly, it's us who are relying on the women. Suddenly, we got the women in control.''
Often at the Wednesday-evening church suppers, the men would talk to me about their new situations, and after a few such conversations, I realized one reason the men were having such a hard time finding that new wheel. For the entirety of their adult lives, Russell, a 110-year-old company, played the role of dominant father: kind, generous and protective, but also overbearing, sometimes bullying and just capricious enough to keep them fighting for its affection. Even without a union, Russell made its men loyal for life by embracing the operational philosophy of the American manufacturing age: becoming a textile man was the same as becoming a man. Russell taught men how to work hard, how to support a family, how to live a good life, how to have the American dream their way.
When that structure disappeared, ''there was no place for us to go,'' Charles says. But more than that, there was no way for them to be. The town so revolved around Russell that when the company left, the men were virtually stripped of their identities. And there was barely anyplace left in America where being an expert on textiles could elevate you in that same way. When Charles first left Russell, all those words that used to mark his status -- ''dyeing,'' ''finishing,'' ''textile training'' -- suddenly seemed part of an ancient world, like speaking Shakespearean English, saying ''thou'' or ''thee'' out loud at the family dinner table, he said. And he thought, ''Here I am, out in the world, trying to be a typewriter salesman.''
Many women worked at Russell -- as seamstresses and occasionally as managers -- but they were never allowed to be part of its ruling fraternity. For most women, Russell was never a way of life; it was just a job, and jobs are, as Charles says, transferable. Once it all started to fall apart, some women in town took out loans or used savings to go to school to become nurses, human-resources managers and legal secretaries. Many were willing to take low-paying jobs because they hadn't spent their lives expecting to be the primary breadwinner. They did not find the available jobs humiliating or beneath them; they found it thrilling to be making steady money. After years of receiving promotions while their husbands looked for work, many women ended up in Patsy Prater's or Sarah Beth Gettys's position as the main source of support for their families. ''Without Patsy's job,'' Reuben says, ''we'd be sunk puppies.''
About two years ago, Gerald Hallmark, then the pastor of First Baptist, saw a man, who had been a plant manager, selling shirts at J. C. Penney. The man tried to avoid him, but Hallmark did his best to make him feel comfortable, by walking up and asking him how the new job was working out. After that, Hallmark had to make slight adjustments in what he had preached for nearly 20 years. Instead of reminding the men that the Bible instructs them to be the head of the household, he tells them, ''Your manhood shows in your reaction to hard times.''
The changes in gender dynamics are forcing a rethinking of a basic philosophy in Alex City, and in the broader evangelical community. As R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., wrote in a blog a few years ago: ''Christians committed to a biblical model of marriage and gender relations must look to this social revolution with a deeper level of concern.'' What Christians should worry about, he argues, is ''the long-term consequences of a new matriarchal world order.''
Like everyone of their generation I spoke to, Charles and Sarah Beth Gettys both insisted that Charles was still the ''head of the household.'' I often asked couples why the men got to retain the title if they weren't fulfilling most of the attending duties. Sometimes they answered by redefining ''head'' as ''spiritual head,'' meaning biblically ordained as the leader. Often it came down to the man as the ultimate protector, the domestic superhero: if someone broke into the house, if the children were in trouble or out of control, if the roof caved in, if there was a tornado, if we needed him, he would rescue us. One man I met, Rob Pridgen, even discussed this in vaguely apocalyptic terms. If the country was self-destructing, and if we could no longer import food or rely on our government to protect us, then we would all remember what men were for.
The women never credit their newfound dominance to feminism (''bra burning'' is still the shorthand definition for that social movement among women I met of all ages). Instead they see the changes in women's roles as ''social evolution,'' the polite, neutral term I heard from Barbara Young, the town's first female mayor, elected in 2004. ''It's just the way things have moved along,'' she said.
But you can sense among the women some impatience under the surface, some capitulation to the obviously shifting reality. ''I'm very headstrong,'' Patsy Prater says. ''I probably don't give in to him like I should'' -- which may have always been true as a private joke between them but is now uncomfortably magnified by the single paycheck. When I talked with Patsy in the family room at their house, she forbade Reuben to come downstairs, because he can sometimes dominate conversations. She quarantined him on the second floor, and I caught glimpses of him carrying a basket of laundry. Sarah Beth told me that she now asks her Sunday-school group of high-school girls to reflect on what being ''submissive'' means in today's world. Theoretically, as head of the household, Charles could decide that he and Sarah Beth should move somewhere else, and Sarah Beth would follow. They both insist that's how it would unfold. But given Sarah Beth's success at her work, that scenario seems very theoretical.
Rob Pridgen's wife, Connie, sometimes used the word ''submissive'' but usually put it in air quotes. Rob and Connie started dating in November 2009. A couple of months after that, Rob found out that his position at Russell as a network analyst would be phased out. They were in their 40s and each was divorced, and Rob said he knew right away that he wanted to marry Connie, but without a job, he could not bring himself to ask. Connie was in her second decade teaching English at Benjamin Russell High School, making a dependable salary, and Rob was struggling week to week, trying to start a network-consulting business. The situation was becoming awkward, they said, with neither of them knowing how to introduce the other to friends at church. Connie said she would sometimes just say, ''This is my . . . Rob.''
When I first met them in the spring of last year, they had been married but were still working out their roles. Connie told me: ''He is absolutely the guy who says: 'I provide for my family. I'm the man of the house.' ''
Rob said then: ''You're saying that as if I'm the dictator. It's not the whole sit-in-the-kitchen-with-your-apron thing. But the way I was brought up, it's a man's responsibility to take care of his family.'' Rob turned to me and added, ''I don't want to make the queen analogy, but my job is to make her the queen.''
''Honey, you know I would teach anyway.''
''But the point is, you shouldn't have to,'' he said.
''It bothers him a lot,'' Connie said to me.
''I pretty much internalize it. It's like, if I can't take care of her, then I'm not a man.''
At that point, Connie's daughter from her first marriage, Abby, who was then 19, piped up with her own perspective on this Southern code of chivalry, which she said sounded like nonsense to her, given how the boys she knew actually behaved -- hanging out in the parking lot, doing God knows what, or going home and playing video games instead of bothering to apply for college. Abby turned to Rob, who had just proclaimed his ideas about marriage, and said, ''That's so cute, it's gross.''
One Saturday afternoon a few months later, the Pridgens gave me a tour of Lake Martin, which is a source of pride in Alex City. Rob was still trying to get his network-consulting business going. From Rob's boat we saw million-dollar houses on the lake and a gourmet market nearby. Afterward we hung out in the living room of the much smaller house that Connie and Rob were then renting on the lake.
Abby had finished a year at a community college in Alex City and transferred to another community college outside Auburn, where she was now living with friends. She spent the day with Rob and Connie before she had to go to her evening shift at a local restaurant. Abby is striking, with long blond hair and full, frowny lips. She is reserved and prefers the company of intimates to the usual teenage crowds. As an English teacher, Connie likes to closely dissect all kinds of texts -- Shakespeare's plays, Bible verses, classic feminist essays. Each year Connie draws out fresh meaning from them, depending on what's going on in her own life. That afternoon, while Rob sat nearby, Connie and Abby were mulling over a passage from Proverbs that is sometimes read at church for Mother's Day and that had come up in a Bible-study group.
The passage describes the ''wife of noble character,'' who works with the wool and flax, brings the food from afar, who ''gets up while it is still dark,'' buys a field, plants a vineyard, turns a profit, and ''her lamp does not go out at night'' because she's still sewing clothes for the poor and generally being industrious while everyone else sleeps. Her husband, meanwhile, ''is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land.''
Traditionally the passage has been viewed as an elaboration of the proper roles of husband and wife. The husband sits in the dominant, protective role, watching his wife's efforts on behalf of the family and taking pride. But in a town in which many men aren't working steadily anymore, the words have taken on new meaning. There are people who have noticed that the passage never mentions what the husband is doing or what role he's playing in providing food for his family, tilling the fields or turning a profit. What was dawning on Connie these last few months became obvious to Abby and Rob as she read the passage out loud. That noble wife is working from dawn to dusk. And the husband?
''Sounds like he's sitting around with his buddies shooting the breeze, talking about the ballgame and eating potato chips,'' Rob said.
Abby wasn't surprised. Around Alex City, she said it seemed that it was the girls who were full of energy and eager to see the world. Her own brother, Alex, who was 17, seemed to want to stay in town forever and raise his family here. But Abby was enrolled in Southern Union State Community College, attending on a show-choir scholarship. Her plan was to go there for a year, as many girls in Alex City do, to save money, and then head to Auburn University.
Ambitious teenagers in the area, who want a life that is not defined by hot, noisy factories, often think the first stop is Auburn, about a 45-minute drive southeast on U.S. 280. This is the way it has always been, even before Russell closed, because in the limited geography of a teenager's mind, Auburn is the closest place with a multiplex and a mall, not to mention a university with an excellent football team.
Across eastern Alabama, Auburn is considered the one city that got it right, a lucky college town that avoided the pitfalls of the rest of the region, a place that took advantage of its strengths to survive in the modern economy. Surrounding counties had unemployment rates in the double digits during the recession, and one had gone as high as 19.3 percent. Lee County, which contains Auburn and its sister city, Opelika, had spells of high unemployment but weathered the recession and now has an unemployment rate of 8.1 percent, close to the national average. Auburn University has anchored the economy for more than 150 years. City officials scrupulously avoided becoming dependent on a single large manufacturer like Russell. Instead, the city courted many smaller manufacturing companies. Auburn has become a reflection of the modern, feminized economy: a combination of university, service and government jobs.
Auburn has enough stately mansions lining the main streets to signal prosperity and enough untamed wildness -- a herd of cattle graze near the latest research park -- not to tip over into suburbia. In 2009, the town was on U.S. News & World Report's list of Top 10 best places in the United States to live.
Auburn is also an especially good place for young women. James Chung, a market researcher for Reach Advisors, analyzed census data showing that in most of the United States, young, single, childless women in their 20s working full time have a higher median income than equivalent young men. A handful of regions in the Southeast stand out as having a particularly big disparity, including Auburn, where the median income of these women is estimated at 129 percent of the median income of similar men.
In July, when I visited Connie and Rob again, Abby was home for the summer. She had been accepted to Auburn and was making plans to transfer to her new school. She was dressed in a maxiskirt and a tube top and was sunk down in a chair, trying to wake herself up so she wouldn't be late for her shift at an Auburn restaurant. Compared with her high-school friends, the Auburn kids are ''more focused,'' she told me. ''They are much more goal-oriented, more careful.''
Abby was interested in being an actress or singer, she said. We watched a DVD of her performing an impressive version of ''Don't Rain on My Parade'' at the community college. She had been dating a guy who moved to New York to look for acting jobs and was thinking about moving there herself someday soon. Since going to college, Abby was starting to come up with her own ideas about courtship. ''Personally I don't like a guy paying for everything,'' she said. ''I'll buy the popcorn, you pay for the movies.'' Her future excluded the conventional aspiration of the Southern belle: ''I've heard other girls say, 'I want to stay home,' and I'm thinking, Why? What would you do? Vacuum four times a day?''
Abby is not the only one questioning the old rules. At a Sunday Bible-study group I attended for teenage girls, the mother who was teaching had the girls hold hands, march in a circle and say: ''My husband will treat me like the princess that I am. He will be the head of my household.'' But the girls' own ambitions seemed at odds with that vision. One girl earlier confessed that her biggest earthly temptation during her college years was likely to be ''pursuing too many higher degrees.'' Another was known to her friends in the group as the ''future president.'' I got the sense that relying on a man was not what they considered their best option.
Connie said she really wants Abby to settle down and find a nice man -- not necessarily to completely take care of her but to keep her safe in a strange city. She said she hoped that Abby's desire to go to New York was just a phase, that maybe she would end up in Atlanta, working at a theater and married with children. But there was her daughter on TV, singing back an urgent, defiant answer: ''Don't tell me not to fly./I've simply got to./If someone takes a spill/it's me and not you./Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade?''
A few months ago Rob Pridgen finally found a full-time job as the information-technology director for Alex City. Still, the family decided that it couldn't afford to send Abby to Auburn after all, and instead she is attending the University of South Alabama in Mobile. Reuben Prater continues to send out about 10 résumés a night. Charles Gettys started a new company, with a friend, that builds docks and customizes structures for jet skis or boats for vacationers at the lake. He has become part of what economists call the ''artisan economy,'' an option for men who have been abandoned by the manufacturing sector. They use their skills and knowledge of the local landscape and materials to do work that can't be easily ordered from China or executed by machine. Charles says he's doing O.K. In a good year he now makes a quarter of what he once did, and Sarah Beth makes significantly more than he did in his best days at Russell.
As the economy fails to fully recover, it's unclear what will happen to traditionally male or female jobs generally. Some sectors seem undeniably strong: health care, for example, and technology, although there aren't many tech jobs in places like Alexander City. Manufacturing survives mainly in new and highly specialized forms. Local government jobs, especially ones in low-tax states like Alabama, have gone through severe cuts in the last decade and are unlikely to be cut much further. Jobs like Patsy's, which rely on federal financing, could be vulnerable given the current political fixation on budget cuts. An important quality for anyone trying to survive in this economy is one that Reuben, in his own limited way, is trying to embody -- the one that seems to come more easily to his wife -- the capacity to ''remake myself again, find my new niche.''
In the meantime, new legends are starting to take hold in Alex City. One morning when I was talking to Reuben and his friend Tim, they were overtaken by a wave of nostalgia. They traded stories of the legendary Russell patriarchs: the engineer so brilliant that people followed him around at trade shows; the chief executive held in such awe that the ''waves parted'' when he walked into a room. But those were the ''bygone days,'' they agreed. Now, there is a fresh cast of characters who can draw an admiring crowd. These local luminaries are no longer the patriarchs but the wives. When they go to dinner, Reuben says, so many people come up to Patsy to thank her or praise her for things she has done for them that the Praters sometimes have to move to a back table for privacy. ''I've looked at her so many times and thought, She's just this amazing woman,'' Reuben says. ''She's a miracle within herself.''

HEADLINE: Who Wears the Pants in This Economy?

BYLINE: By HANNA ROSIN

 BODY:
Patsy Prater's office looks like something between an executive's and a teacher's, her large desk crowded with neat piles of grant applications and daily logs but also with dishes of candy and other freebies for the young and old who pass through. On the bulletin board behind her head are big, colorful signs designed to remind her public-housing clients of what they are eligible for: cellphones, computer classes or prescriptions that she makes sure they have even if she has to drive them to the pharmacy herself. At the front of her desk is a photo of her ''grandbaby,'' who lives in Madison, Ala., three hours away. She wishes she could be there, taking care of the infant now that her daughter is back at work. ''I love this job,'' she said. ''I know it's where I'm supposed to be. But I am not a women's-rights-type person. My place is in the home, and I'm fine with that, so long as my husband is earning the bacon. 'Course, that hasn't been happening so much lately.'' 
Patsy, who is 50 and works as a family-services director, and her husband, Reuben, 52, met on a blind date in 1979, and that very night he asked her to marry him -- the first line of what he calls their ''Cinderella'' story. ''What would you have done if I were a terrible kisser?'' she likes to ask him, and he always answers, ''I would have taught you how.'' In 1981, Reuben was ready for a wedding, but Patsy was in her first year of college. Reuben told her he was madly in love, and if she did not quit school and marry him, he wouldn't wait, ''and I was stupid enough to believe him,'' she says.
For the greater part of her marriage, the setup worked just fine for Patsy. Because Reuben stopped her from going to college, she could do what she wanted, which was to raise their three daughters without feeling guilty about not working. Reuben, who had a bachelor's of science degree from Auburn University, was one of the longest-running service contractors for the Russell Corporation, the maker of athletic wear and the town's largest employer. He ran a lucrative business cleaning the special pine floors at some of the mills and also had private clients in town. He made enough money for a very comfortable life: a house on a quiet, rural road here in Alexander City, Ala., four cars and multiple church missionary trips for his family to places like Africa and Brazil. Because he owned the business, Patsy could help him out with payroll and accounting on her own time and always be free to pick up the girls from school.
The mills supplied enough steady employment to keep most people in Alexander City out of poverty -- until the mid-'90s less than a quarter of schoolchildren qualified for free or reduced-price lunch -- and allow many families in town to live well. Here, a man with a degree in textiles or engineering could make $70,000 or even $100,000, enough to afford a house on the lake and a motorboat. He could drive a Lexus S.U.V. and take his family on a vacation to Disneyland and go to church, where, if he needed it, he would be prayed for by name.
In 1996, at the height of its success, Russell employed 7,000 of the town's 15,000 residents. But the company soon faced competitors that undercut its prices. Like many textile companies in the area, Russell began shifting its plants to Mexico and Honduras, where clothes could be made cheaply. A decade later, only 3,200 people were still working for Russell in Alexander City, and the company was bought by Berkshire Hathaway. Now, at the facilities that remain open, that number is down to about 900, leaving many families in town in financial straits. The percentage of students at the high school receiving free lunches rose to 50 percent.
Reuben tried shifting his business focus to private homes, but ''people don't spend money on carpet and floor cleaning when they need it to buy groceries.'' Within a few years the Praters went from comfortable to shaky. They relied on revolving accounts: refinancing the house to pay the credit-card bill, using the credit card to pay the electricity bill before the power went out. The phone frequently rang, and the person on the other end would ask, ''Can you make that payment today?'' The family stopped answering the phone.
Reuben said he realized that he would never have his old work life back and tried to remake himself. He found a job as director of mall operations in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and then one at a conference-call company in West Point, Ga., and next at a tire plant in Dothan, Ala. None lasted long. One ''crazy thing or another,'' as Patsy puts it, always doomed him: his long commutes, his health, family obligations, constant reminders that he was no longer his own boss. Over time, he became discouraged. He wasn't ''making the money I need to be making.''
As Reuben's paychecks became less dependable, Patsy began ''stressing'' and wondered what she could do to help. Over the years she taught music at day-care centers, sometimes taking their youngest daughter, Jordan, with her. She had been ''scared to death'' to go back to college, but she studied at night with the aim of becoming a special-education teacher. Around 2006, a friend cornered her in a hallway at church and said she knew of a job that sounded perfect for her. Patsy was known as a helper by nature, driving seniors to church, assisting the youth choir, organizing mission trips. The friend recommended an opening at the city housing authority as a family self-sufficiency coordinator, which meant helping families in public housing become independent by connecting them with services.
Being a self-sufficiency coordinator involved a maternal touch, like encouraging single mothers to continue their education, obtain prenatal care and find reliable child care. Patsy had little experience in the work force and did not think of herself as a professional or a manager, but the friend told her she could possibly make as much as $20 an hour, which sounded better than the $5.50 she made at day care. It might not have been enough for Reuben, but to Patsy, who never had a steady paycheck, it sounded incredible. In three years she was promoted twice and is now director of family services. ''I can only say it was God's hand that did it,'' she says. ''I wasn't searching for a job like that, not with my skills.''
In the last decade, men, especially working-class and middle-class men, have had very different experiences in this economy from the women around them. The manufacturing sector has lost almost six million jobs, nearly a third of its total work force, and has taken in few young workers. Across eastern Alabama, the old textile mills closed one after another, badly shaking up the economy. In Tallapoosa County, which contains Alexander City, the unemployment rate at the time I first visited last year was 13.3 percent -- pretty standard for the region during the height of the recession. The housing bubble masked this new reality for a while, creating work in construction and related industries. But then that market crashed as well. Some jobs are trickling back now that Alabama is shifting its focus to ''advanced manufacturing,'' meaning jobs in industries like automobiles and aeronautics that require a higher degree of skills and training, says Joe Sumners, director of the Economic and Community Development Institute at Auburn University. But traditional manufacturing is unlikely to play the same role in the economy it once did.
While millions of manufacturing jobs have been lost over the last decade, jobs in health, education and services have been added in about the same numbers. The job categories projected to grow over the next decade include nursing, home health care and child care. Of the 15 categories projected to grow the fastest by 2016 -- among them sales, teaching, accounting, custodial services and customer service -- 12 are dominated by women. These are not necessarily the most desirable or highest-paying jobs. But they do provide a reliable source of employment and a ladder up to the middle class. It used to be that in working-class America, men earned significantly more than women. Now in that segment of the population, the gap between men and women is shrinking faster than in any other, according to June Carbone, an author of ''Red Families v. Blue Families.''
In Alexander City, while the men were struggling, women either continued on with their work or found new jobs as teachers, secretaries or nurses or in the service industry. Like many states, Alabama has cut government services over the last few years, but the jobs that remain are relatively stable, Sumners said. More important than the particular jobs available, which are always in flux, is a person's willingness to adapt to a changing economy. These days that usually requires going to college or getting some job retraining, which women are generally more willing to do. Two-thirds of the students at the local community college are women, which is fairly typical of the gender breakdown in community colleges throughout the country.
''An important long-term issue is that men are not doing as well as women in keeping up with the demands of the global economy,'' says Michael Greenstone, an economist at M.I.T. and director of the Hamilton Project, which has done some of the most significant research on men and unemployment. ''It's a first-order mystery for social scientists, why women have more clearly heard the message that the economy has changed and men have such a hard time hearing it or responding.''
As the usual path to the middle class disappears, what's emerging in its place is a nascent middle-class matriarchy, in which women like Patsy pay the mortgage and the cable bills while the men try to find their place.
The former Russell men are sometimes categorized by people in town as one of three types: the ''transients,'' who drive about an hour to Montgomery for work and never make it home for dinner; the ''domestics,'' who idle at the house during the day, looking for work; and the ''gophers,'' who drive their wives to and from work, spending the hours in between hunting or fishing.
In the years since his business declined, Reuben Prater seems to have played all three of these roles. Last fall, Reuben finally landed a good job in town as an information-technology specialist at a bank. But this year the bank was bought by another, and dozens of local employees, including Reuben, were laid off, and he was looking for a job again. Most mornings Reuben still wakes up at 5:30, goes to the gym and is back by 7:15 to have a quick breakfast with Patsy and their 18-year-old daughter, Jordan, who just graduated from high school. He sometimes receives texts from Patsy during the day, asking him to do one thing or another. Reuben does the laundry and runs the dishwasher and vacuums, but he doesn't really make dinner. He goes to Walmart to buy groceries or pick up something for Jordan if he has to, but shopping is his least favorite chore. ''I'm the househusband,'' he says, half-joking. Sometimes he helps Patsy with work, doing research or helping set up an event for clients, just as she used to help him. Or he does volunteer work at church. In between these tasks, he trolls monster.com and other job sites, although some days he is so busy with the housework that he doesn't get to the job search until 10 at night, when it's peaceful in the house and no one is texting and asking him to run errands. In the last two months, he sent out 252 résumés to as far away as Toronto and Sacramento, but hasn't heard anything. ''My wheel's just not rolling right now,'' he says. ''I got to find a new wheel or a new way to inflate the old one.''
One Wednesday morning this summer, after saying goodbye to Patsy, Reuben went to Burger King to have breakfast with his best friend, Tim, his ''twin brother by a different mother'' as he calls him. (They have the same birthday.) They usually meet every Saturday morning, but Tim, who had been working at Russell Medical Center, a large hospital, lost his job when his position in the marketing department was eliminated, and the previous day was his last at work. Tim's wife is among the remaining employees at Russell, largely because she's ''willing to do anything -- payroll, balance the books, do shipping,'' he says. But Tim, like Reuben, has had trouble finding steady work and found himself idling at what Reuben called their ''pity party.''
There were only men at the Burger King that morning: men in baseball hats talking. A candidate for mayor dropped by, as did a few men they knew from church.
''Hey, Reuben, what you up to?''
''Not doing anything, just playing. If you find anything for me to do, call me.''
Reuben has a college degree and doesn't seem especially preoccupied with machismo, so I asked him why, given how many different kinds of jobs he has held, he couldn't train for one of the jobs that he knew was available: something related to schools, nursing or retail, for example. One reason was obvious -- those jobs don't pay as much as he was accustomed to making -- but he said there was another. ''We're in the South,'' he told me. ''A man needs a strong, macho job. He's not going to be a schoolteacher or a legal secretary or some beauty-shop queen. He's got to be a man.'' I asked several businesswomen in Alexander City if they would hire a man to be a secretary or a receptionist or a nurse, and many of them just laughed. It's not hard to imagine a time when the prevailing dynamic in town might be female bosses shutting men out of the only open jobs.
Downtown Alexander City still sustains a wine store, a couple of restaurants, a quaint soda-fountain pharmacy, a real-estate office that looks like a SoHo loft and a trendy jeans-and-dress store that expanded this spring, among other businesses. But as with other once-prosperous towns, Alex City, as it is called, is straining to keep up appearances. A few storefronts are empty, and a few more look as if they're barely hanging on. Cecil's Public House, the one fancy restaurant, burned down in March and hasn't been replaced, and a new gourmet bakery closed. People worry that one day the downtown might go the way of Goodwater, a city with a string of abandoned gray buildings 15 miles to the northwest.
The center of Alexander City is dominated by the steeple of the First Baptist Church, a thriving evangelical community, with packed pews every Wednesday and Sunday and events nearly every day of the week. There are several other churches in town, but First Baptist has always been the destination for much of the Alex City establishment, including some members of the Russell family, plant managers, doctors, lawyers and prominent couples like Charles and Sarah Beth Gettys. I met the couple, who are in their mid-50s, at a Wednesday-evening church supper last year -- I noticed them because Sarah Beth was one of the few people at church wearing a suit. She is an executive at Russell Medical Center and, as I would learn over several visits, often the only person at Wednesday supper who so obviously raced over straight from the office and still had pressing business on her iPhone. Charles has more time on his hands but not necessarily fewer worries. ''Probably no one has had their wife move up the ladder as far as I've moved down,'' he told me the first night we talked, in his blunt and wry way. ''For years I was the major breadwinner, and this has flipped the family around. Now she is the major breadwinner.''
Charles started out at Avondale Mills, in Pell City, Ala., hauling 80-pound rolls of cotton as a teenager; Avondale paid for him to attend nearby Auburn University to study textiles and engineering. He eventually moved to Russell, and for 23 years, Charles rose up the ranks at the plant, becoming a manager in the dyeing-and-finishing department and later head of national sales for the fabrics division. He sent three children to college and built a much-admired house on the lake. Even now, he carries the air of a comfortable patriarch; he is trim, with white hair and clear blue eyes. At church he looks as if he is about to go golfing, in khakis and a button-down shirt. He is usually self-deprecating, so he doesn't quite put it this way, but it's clear that he experienced his time at Russell as his glory days, when as the head of sales, he took trips to New York and stayed at the company's Midtown apartment and saw Broadway plays and ate delicious rolls that don't quite compare with the crumbly corn bread served at church suppers.
About 10 years ago Charles said he began to feel as if ''I was on a horse that wasn't going to make it. So do you just push the horse and hope for the best or get off?'' Russell was no longer the place he had known. The company was hiring more women in managerial jobs, and while he had no problem with that in general, he said that some of these women hadn't started out hauling cotton as he had and didn't know the business from the ground up. But the company felt pressure to hire them, Charles told me, ''to keep up with the times.'' Russell was also shutting down plants, and Charles knew his position couldn't last much longer. At one point he was offered a job running one of Russell's local plants, but he declined. He was 45 at the time, young enough, he thought, to start over.
Unlike Patsy Prater, Sarah Beth has always worked. ''If I had to sit at home, I would lose my mind,'' she told me one morning as we talked in her office. Sarah Beth started as a nurse on the third shift at what was then just a small-town hospital. To the family, her salary was ''fun money.'' She would use it to shop for herself and, if the children complained about her working overtime, she would give them a choice: she could work less or pay for a family ski vacation.
As the hospital grew, Sarah Beth rose steadily up the ranks. In 2003, when Charles finally decided to quit, Sarah Beth had already been promoted into management, so he thought she could support them until he found his footing. Charles was always pretty handy, so he considered starting a construction company, even though he had never run a business. Working with trucks and piles of wood was a ''humbling experience,'' especially after having been a head of national sales. He said that he knew he would be competing with men who were in the business a long time or with younger men who once worked for him. When he had his broody moments, Sarah Beth said she would tell him: ''Build a bridge and get over it. Don't just sit and whine and carry on.'' He finally started the business in 2004 and for a time it was ''mildly successful,'' but then the housing crisis hit in 2008 and construction work largely dried up.
Sarah Beth, meanwhile, was moving up the institutional ladder the way Charles once had, advancing from nurse manager of the medical-surgical unit to vice president in charge of patient services. She now spends her days in an office sandwiched between the chief executive and the chief financial officer of the hospital. She has a secretary and an endless series of meetings and conferences across the country. Her salary is now the money that the family relies on to pay the mortgage and the basic household expenses. One Wednesday evening I was tiptoeing my way toward asking Charles how he felt about his wife's achievements -- nervous that I might wound his pride -- when he said: ''I know what you're asking. How does it feel to go from being the major breadwinner to the secondary breadwinner?''
He told me: ''It used to bug me, but now I've gotten used to it.'' What helped was realizing that he wasn't alone in this upside down world he was living in. Shortly after he left Russell, Charles called the unemployment office in Montgomery to ask a question. The voice on the phone sounded familiar, and after a few minutes he realized he was talking to a woman who had worked with him at Russell. She transferred him to her supervisor, who turned out to be another woman who had worked with him. ''You're gonna laugh at this,'' Charles told me, ''but it was harder on the men than the women. It seems like their skills were more, what's the word, transferable? I was born in the South, where the men take care of their women. Suddenly, it's us who are relying on the women. Suddenly, we got the women in control.''
Often at the Wednesday-evening church suppers, the men would talk to me about their new situations, and after a few such conversations, I realized one reason the men were having such a hard time finding that new wheel. For the entirety of their adult lives, Russell, a 110-year-old company, played the role of dominant father: kind, generous and protective, but also overbearing, sometimes bullying and just capricious enough to keep them fighting for its affection. Even without a union, Russell made its men loyal for life by embracing the operational philosophy of the American manufacturing age: becoming a textile man was the same as becoming a man. Russell taught men how to work hard, how to support a family, how to live a good life, how to have the American dream their way.
When that structure disappeared, ''there was no place for us to go,'' Charles says. But more than that, there was no way for them to be. The town so revolved around Russell that when the company left, the men were virtually stripped of their identities. And there was barely anyplace left in America where being an expert on textiles could elevate you in that same way. When Charles first left Russell, all those words that used to mark his status -- ''dyeing,'' ''finishing,'' ''textile training'' -- suddenly seemed part of an ancient world, like speaking Shakespearean English, saying ''thou'' or ''thee'' out loud at the family dinner table, he said. And he thought, ''Here I am, out in the world, trying to be a typewriter salesman.''
Many women worked at Russell -- as seamstresses and occasionally as managers -- but they were never allowed to be part of its ruling fraternity. For most women, Russell was never a way of life; it was just a job, and jobs are, as Charles says, transferable. Once it all started to fall apart, some women in town took out loans or used savings to go to school to become nurses, human-resources managers and legal secretaries. Many were willing to take low-paying jobs because they hadn't spent their lives expecting to be the primary breadwinner. They did not find the available jobs humiliating or beneath them; they found it thrilling to be making steady money. After years of receiving promotions while their husbands looked for work, many women ended up in Patsy Prater's or Sarah Beth Gettys's position as the main source of support for their families. ''Without Patsy's job,'' Reuben says, ''we'd be sunk puppies.''
About two years ago, Gerald Hallmark, then the pastor of First Baptist, saw a man, who had been a plant manager, selling shirts at J. C. Penney. The man tried to avoid him, but Hallmark did his best to make him feel comfortable, by walking up and asking him how the new job was working out. After that, Hallmark had to make slight adjustments in what he had preached for nearly 20 years. Instead of reminding the men that the Bible instructs them to be the head of the household, he tells them, ''Your manhood shows in your reaction to hard times.''
The changes in gender dynamics are forcing a rethinking of a basic philosophy in Alex City, and in the broader evangelical community. As R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., wrote in a blog a few years ago: ''Christians committed to a biblical model of marriage and gender relations must look to this social revolution with a deeper level of concern.'' What Christians should worry about, he argues, is ''the long-term consequences of a new matriarchal world order.''
Like everyone of their generation I spoke to, Charles and Sarah Beth Gettys both insisted that Charles was still the ''head of the household.'' I often asked couples why the men got to retain the title if they weren't fulfilling most of the attending duties. Sometimes they answered by redefining ''head'' as ''spiritual head,'' meaning biblically ordained as the leader. Often it came down to the man as the ultimate protector, the domestic superhero: if someone broke into the house, if the children were in trouble or out of control, if the roof caved in, if there was a tornado, if we needed him, he would rescue us. One man I met, Rob Pridgen, even discussed this in vaguely apocalyptic terms. If the country was self-destructing, and if we could no longer import food or rely on our government to protect us, then we would all remember what men were for.
The women never credit their newfound dominance to feminism (''bra burning'' is still the shorthand definition for that social movement among women I met of all ages). Instead they see the changes in women's roles as ''social evolution,'' the polite, neutral term I heard from Barbara Young, the town's first female mayor, elected in 2004. ''It's just the way things have moved along,'' she said.
But you can sense among the women some impatience under the surface, some capitulation to the obviously shifting reality. ''I'm very headstrong,'' Patsy Prater says. ''I probably don't give in to him like I should'' -- which may have always been true as a private joke between them but is now uncomfortably magnified by the single paycheck. When I talked with Patsy in the family room at their house, she forbade Reuben to come downstairs, because he can sometimes dominate conversations. She quarantined him on the second floor, and I caught glimpses of him carrying a basket of laundry. Sarah Beth told me that she now asks her Sunday-school group of high-school girls to reflect on what being ''submissive'' means in today's world. Theoretically, as head of the household, Charles could decide that he and Sarah Beth should move somewhere else, and Sarah Beth would follow. They both insist that's how it would unfold. But given Sarah Beth's success at her work, that scenario seems very theoretical.
Rob Pridgen's wife, Connie, sometimes used the word ''submissive'' but usually put it in air quotes. Rob and Connie started dating in November 2009. A couple of months after that, Rob found out that his position at Russell as a network analyst would be phased out. They were in their 40s and each was divorced, and Rob said he knew right away that he wanted to marry Connie, but without a job, he could not bring himself to ask. Connie was in her second decade teaching English at Benjamin Russell High School, making a dependable salary, and Rob was struggling week to week, trying to start a network-consulting business. The situation was becoming awkward, they said, with neither of them knowing how to introduce the other to friends at church. Connie said she would sometimes just say, ''This is my . . . Rob.''
When I first met them in the spring of last year, they had been married but were still working out their roles. Connie told me: ''He is absolutely the guy who says: 'I provide for my family. I'm the man of the house.' ''
Rob said then: ''You're saying that as if I'm the dictator. It's not the whole sit-in-the-kitchen-with-your-apron thing. But the way I was brought up, it's a man's responsibility to take care of his family.'' Rob turned to me and added, ''I don't want to make the queen analogy, but my job is to make her the queen.''
''Honey, you know I would teach anyway.''
''But the point is, you shouldn't have to,'' he said.
''It bothers him a lot,'' Connie said to me.
''I pretty much internalize it. It's like, if I can't take care of her, then I'm not a man.''
At that point, Connie's daughter from her first marriage, Abby, who was then 19, piped up with her own perspective on this Southern code of chivalry, which she said sounded like nonsense to her, given how the boys she knew actually behaved -- hanging out in the parking lot, doing God knows what, or going home and playing video games instead of bothering to apply for college. Abby turned to Rob, who had just proclaimed his ideas about marriage, and said, ''That's so cute, it's gross.''
One Saturday afternoon a few months later, the Pridgens gave me a tour of Lake Martin, which is a source of pride in Alex City. Rob was still trying to get his network-consulting business going. From Rob's boat we saw million-dollar houses on the lake and a gourmet market nearby. Afterward we hung out in the living room of the much smaller house that Connie and Rob were then renting on the lake.
Abby had finished a year at a community college in Alex City and transferred to another community college outside Auburn, where she was now living with friends. She spent the day with Rob and Connie before she had to go to her evening shift at a local restaurant. Abby is striking, with long blond hair and full, frowny lips. She is reserved and prefers the company of intimates to the usual teenage crowds. As an English teacher, Connie likes to closely dissect all kinds of texts -- Shakespeare's plays, Bible verses, classic feminist essays. Each year Connie draws out fresh meaning from them, depending on what's going on in her own life. That afternoon, while Rob sat nearby, Connie and Abby were mulling over a passage from Proverbs that is sometimes read at church for Mother's Day and that had come up in a Bible-study group.
The passage describes the ''wife of noble character,'' who works with the wool and flax, brings the food from afar, who ''gets up while it is still dark,'' buys a field, plants a vineyard, turns a profit, and ''her lamp does not go out at night'' because she's still sewing clothes for the poor and generally being industrious while everyone else sleeps. Her husband, meanwhile, ''is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land.''
Traditionally the passage has been viewed as an elaboration of the proper roles of husband and wife. The husband sits in the dominant, protective role, watching his wife's efforts on behalf of the family and taking pride. But in a town in which many men aren't working steadily anymore, the words have taken on new meaning. There are people who have noticed that the passage never mentions what the husband is doing or what role he's playing in providing food for his family, tilling the fields or turning a profit. What was dawning on Connie these last few months became obvious to Abby and Rob as she read the passage out loud. That noble wife is working from dawn to dusk. And the husband?
''Sounds like he's sitting around with his buddies shooting the breeze, talking about the ballgame and eating potato chips,'' Rob said.
Abby wasn't surprised. Around Alex City, she said it seemed that it was the girls who were full of energy and eager to see the world. Her own brother, Alex, who was 17, seemed to want to stay in town forever and raise his family here. But Abby was enrolled in Southern Union State Community College, attending on a show-choir scholarship. Her plan was to go there for a year, as many girls in Alex City do, to save money, and then head to Auburn University.
Ambitious teenagers in the area, who want a life that is not defined by hot, noisy factories, often think the first stop is Auburn, about a 45-minute drive southeast on U.S. 280. This is the way it has always been, even before Russell closed, because in the limited geography of a teenager's mind, Auburn is the closest place with a multiplex and a mall, not to mention a university with an excellent football team.
Across eastern Alabama, Auburn is considered the one city that got it right, a lucky college town that avoided the pitfalls of the rest of the region, a place that took advantage of its strengths to survive in the modern economy. Surrounding counties had unemployment rates in the double digits during the recession, and one had gone as high as 19.3 percent. Lee County, which contains Auburn and its sister city, Opelika, had spells of high unemployment but weathered the recession and now has an unemployment rate of 8.1 percent, close to the national average. Auburn University has anchored the economy for more than 150 years. City officials scrupulously avoided becoming dependent on a single large manufacturer like Russell. Instead, the city courted many smaller manufacturing companies. Auburn has become a reflection of the modern, feminized economy: a combination of university, service and government jobs.
Auburn has enough stately mansions lining the main streets to signal prosperity and enough untamed wildness -- a herd of cattle graze near the latest research park -- not to tip over into suburbia. In 2009, the town was on U.S. News & World Report's list of Top 10 best places in the United States to live.
Auburn is also an especially good place for young women. James Chung, a market researcher for Reach Advisors, analyzed census data showing that in most of the United States, young, single, childless women in their 20s working full time have a higher median income than equivalent young men. A handful of regions in the Southeast stand out as having a particularly big disparity, including Auburn, where the median income of these women is estimated at 129 percent of the median income of similar men.
In July, when I visited Connie and Rob again, Abby was home for the summer. She had been accepted to Auburn and was making plans to transfer to her new school. She was dressed in a maxiskirt and a tube top and was sunk down in a chair, trying to wake herself up so she wouldn't be late for her shift at an Auburn restaurant. Compared with her high-school friends, the Auburn kids are ''more focused,'' she told me. ''They are much more goal-oriented, more careful.''
Abby was interested in being an actress or singer, she said. We watched a DVD of her performing an impressive version of ''Don't Rain on My Parade'' at the community college. She had been dating a guy who moved to New York to look for acting jobs and was thinking about moving there herself someday soon. Since going to college, Abby was starting to come up with her own ideas about courtship. ''Personally I don't like a guy paying for everything,'' she said. ''I'll buy the popcorn, you pay for the movies.'' Her future excluded the conventional aspiration of the Southern belle: ''I've heard other girls say, 'I want to stay home,' and I'm thinking, Why? What would you do? Vacuum four times a day?''
Abby is not the only one questioning the old rules. At a Sunday Bible-study group I attended for teenage girls, the mother who was teaching had the girls hold hands, march in a circle and say: ''My husband will treat me like the princess that I am. He will be the head of my household.'' But the girls' own ambitions seemed at odds with that vision. One girl earlier confessed that her biggest earthly temptation during her college years was likely to be ''pursuing too many higher degrees.'' Another was known to her friends in the group as the ''future president.'' I got the sense that relying on a man was not what they considered their best option.
Connie said she really wants Abby to settle down and find a nice man -- not necessarily to completely take care of her but to keep her safe in a strange city. She said she hoped that Abby's desire to go to New York was just a phase, that maybe she would end up in Atlanta, working at a theater and married with children. But there was her daughter on TV, singing back an urgent, defiant answer: ''Don't tell me not to fly./I've simply got to./If someone takes a spill/it's me and not you./Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade?''
A few months ago Rob Pridgen finally found a full-time job as the information-technology director for Alex City. Still, the family decided that it couldn't afford to send Abby to Auburn after all, and instead she is attending the University of South Alabama in Mobile. Reuben Prater continues to send out about 10 résumés a night. Charles Gettys started a new company, with a friend, that builds docks and customizes structures for jet skis or boats for vacationers at the lake. He has become part of what economists call the ''artisan economy,'' an option for men who have been abandoned by the manufacturing sector. They use their skills and knowledge of the local landscape and materials to do work that can't be easily ordered from China or executed by machine. Charles says he's doing O.K. In a good year he now makes a quarter of what he once did, and Sarah Beth makes significantly more than he did in his best days at Russell.
As the economy fails to fully recover, it's unclear what will happen to traditionally male or female jobs generally. Some sectors seem undeniably strong: health care, for example, and technology, although there aren't many tech jobs in places like Alexander City. Manufacturing survives mainly in new and highly specialized forms. Local government jobs, especially ones in low-tax states like Alabama, have gone through severe cuts in the last decade and are unlikely to be cut much further. Jobs like Patsy's, which rely on federal financing, could be vulnerable given the current political fixation on budget cuts. An important quality for anyone trying to survive in this economy is one that Reuben, in his own limited way, is trying to embody -- the one that seems to come more easily to his wife -- the capacity to ''remake myself again, find my new niche.''
In the meantime, new legends are starting to take hold in Alex City. One morning when I was talking to Reuben and his friend Tim, they were overtaken by a wave of nostalgia. They traded stories of the legendary Russell patriarchs: the engineer so brilliant that people followed him around at trade shows; the chief executive held in such awe that the ''waves parted'' when he walked into a room. But those were the ''bygone days,'' they agreed. Now, there is a fresh cast of characters who can draw an admiring crowd. These local luminaries are no longer the patriarchs but the wives. When they go to dinner, Reuben says, so many people come up to Patsy to thank her or praise her for things she has done for them that the Praters sometimes have to move to a back table for privacy. ''I've looked at her so many times and thought, She's just this amazing woman,'' Reuben says. ''She's a miracle within herself.''

HEADLINE: Franklin Delano Romney

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
THE last time the United States held a presidential election amid the mass unemployment left in a financial crisis's wake, the challenger offered only a partial glimpse of what he would actually do in office. Mostly, he played the opportunist, attacking the incumbent party for spending too much and helping too little, for being indifferent to human suffering and for failing to balance the budget, for overtaxing and undertaxing and everywhere in between. He claimed to be offering a bold contrast of visions, but mostly he just relied on the unemployment rate to do his work for him.
That challenger was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His 1932 convention speech -- the first ever delivered by a nominee in person -- was more detailed than the parade of generalities Mitt Romney offered last Thursday. But mostly it was a sprawl of unpersuasive economic analysis and highly convenient criticisms of the hapless Herbert Hoover. Hearing it or reading it, you would have known that F.D.R. intended to govern as some sort of liberal, as you would know from Romney's speech that he intends to govern as a conservative. But you would be able to anticipate only the broadest outlines of the policy experimentation that ultimately defined the New Deal. 
Romney's version of Roosevelt's campaign strategy is far less certain to succeed. Roosevelt was running with unemployment in the mid-20s; Romney is running with 8 percent. Hoover had actually presided over the financial crisis; Barack Obama merely inherited it -- and from a Republican president, at that. F.D.R. cruised to a landslide; Romney's play-it-safe strategy seems designed to win 51 percent at most.
But if Romney does win, his studied vagueness and generic Republican rhetoric may leave him with much more room to maneuver in office than either the left or right currently expects.
On the left, it's an article of faith that the Republican nominee is effectively a hostage to the most ideological elements in his party, and that he'll be forced to march in lock step with them even if his own instincts suggest a different path.
Among conservatives, the choice of Paul Ryan persuaded many Romney doubters that the candidate has definitively embraced the Congressional Republican agenda as his own.
Both assumptions may be wrong. Of course a President Romney would have to operate within the broad framework of conservatism. But the left probably understates how much power he would have to shape and even redefine that framework, and how invested his fellow Republican officeholders (as opposed to movement activists) would be in making his first term a success.
The right, meanwhile, may be misreading the import of the Ryan pick. It's no doubt a sign that Romney intends to pursue at least some of Ryan's entitlement reform proposals once in office. But it's also a move that brings a potential critic and rival inside the administration's camp, transforming a spokesman for conservatism into a salesman for the Romney White House's agenda -- whether that agenda fits movement orthodoxy or not.
None of this is to say that Romney has a detailed ''secret plan,'' as Bloomberg View's Josh Barro has provocatively suggested, to bail out underwater homeowners or play the right-wing Keynesian on deficits or raise taxes in some sort of bipartisan grand bargain.
Rather, it's more likely that the Republican nominee is behaving like an executive being considered for a C.E.O. job at a high-profile but mismanaged company. He's trying to tell his job interviewers (both conservative and independent) roughly what they want to hear, while leaving enough flexibility to be able to do things his way once he sees what's actually under the company's hood.
If there was a persistent and persuasive theme in his convention address, and in Ann Romney's as well, it didn't have anything to do with deficits or taxes or Medicare reform or foreign policy. It was the promise of hard work -- work on behalf of ''you and your family,'' work in pursuit of ''jobs, lots of jobs,'' work that would ''solve the problems that others say can't be solved'' and ''fix what others say is beyond repair.''
One can hear in this rhetoric a kind of right-of-center rhyme to Roosevelt's campaign promise of ''bold, persistent experimentation,'' his exhortation to ''above all, try something,'' without necessarily specifying what that something might be.
This parallel is not necessarily an advertisement for Romney. Liberal nostalgia notwithstanding, Roosevelt flailed as often as he flourished, and boldness and experimentation untempered by principle and modesty have been responsible for many more recent presidential failures as well.
But if you're looking for a best-case scenario for a Romney presidency, you have to hope that his Mr. Fix-It impulses will work out for the best -- and that rather than being a model of moderation or a paragon of purity, he'll be a president who tries, and tries, and ultimately gets things right.

HEADLINE: The Other Power in the West Wing

BYLINE: By JO BECKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama was in a bind, and his chief of staff could not figure out how he had ended up there.
Leaders of the Roman Catholic Church were up in arms last fall over a proposal to require employers to provide health insurance that covered birth control. But caving in to the church's demands for a broad exemption in the name of religious liberty would pit the president against a crucial constituency, women's groups, who saw the coverage as basic preventive care.
Worried about the political and legal implications, the chief of staff, William M. Daley, reached out to the proposal's author, Kathleen Sebelius, the health and human services secretary. How, he wondered, had the White House been put in this situation with so little presidential input? ''You are way out there on a limb on this,'' he recalls telling her.
''It was then made clear to me that, no, there were senior White House officials who had been involved and supported this,'' said Mr. Daley, who left his post early this year. 
What he did not realize was that while he was trying to put out what he considered a fire, the person fanning the flames was sitting just one flight up from him: Valerie Jarrett, the Obamas' first friend, the proposal's chief patron and a tenacious White House operator who would ultimately outmaneuver not only Mr. Daley but also the vice president in her effort to include the broadest possible contraception coverage in the administration's health care overhaul.
A Chicagoan who helped Mr. Obama navigate his rise through that city's aggressive politics, Ms. Jarrett came to Washington with no national experience. But her unmatched access to the Obamas has made her a driving force in some of the most significant domestic policy decisions of the president's first term, her persuasive power only amplified by Mr. Obama's insular management style.
From the first, her official job has been somewhat vague. But nearly four years on, with Mr. Obama poised to accept his party's renomination this week, her standing is clear, to her many admirers and detractors alike. ''She is the single most influential person in the Obama White House,'' said one former senior White House official, who like many would speak candidly only on condition of anonymity.
''She's there to try to promote what she understands to be what the president wants,'' the former aide said. ''Ultimately the president makes his own decisions. The question that is hard to get inside of, the black box, is whether she is really influencing him or merely executing decisions he's made. That's like asking, 'Is the light on in the refrigerator when the door is closed?' ''
Yet if that answer remains elusive, interviews with more than two dozen former and current administration officials offer a portrait of a woman wielding a many-faceted portfolio of power.
Partly it is her ubiquity, the guiding hand in everything from who sits on the Supreme Court to who sits next to whom at state dinners, the White House staff memos peppered with ''VJ thinks'' or ''VJ says.'' When the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett showed up for a private lunch with the president last July, the table was set for three.
Ms. Jarrett often serves as a counterweight to the more centrist Clinton veterans in the administration, reminding them and her innately cautious boss that he came to Washington to do big things. Some of his boldest moves, on women's issues, gay rights and immigration, have been in areas she cares about most. If Karl Rove was known as George W. Bush's political brain, Ms. Jarrett is Mr. Obama's spine.
She is also his gatekeeper, sometimes using that power to tip the balance in internal debates. After the financial crisis, as the administration grappled with how to rein in Wall Street, Ms. Jarrett made sure that Paul A. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman whose voice was being drowned out, got a meeting with the president. The result: tougher measures than the president's top economic advisers were advocating.
And she is the president's protector in chief, or as Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner put it, the person who must be as ''omniscient as possible'' in spotting trouble on the way. Those whom she deems to have failed Mr. Obama tell of scolding late-night calls and her trademark accusation of betrayal: ''You are hurting the president.''
But she has also steered him toward controversy, as in the contraception debate. And some of Mr. Obama's most senior advisers worry -- perhaps not entirely without jealousy -- that her direct access to the president has at times led to half-baked decision making and unclear lines of authority.
Mr. Obama's first two chiefs of staff, Rahm Emanuel and Mr. Daley, clashed with Ms. Jarrett over strategic direction and over who had greater authority to interpret and carry out the president's wishes, several officials said.
''He's got a real mess in the West Wing,'' said one close presidential adviser. ''Valerie is effectively the chief of staff, and he knows, but he doesn't know. She's almost like Nancy Reagan was with President Reagan, but more powerful.''
Two Who 'Clicked'
The week after the 2008 election, Mr. Obama implored Ms. Jarrett to join him at the White House. She was contemplating putting her name forward for the Senate seat he had just vacated, but she quickly put those aspirations aside.
Together they carved out her wide-ranging job description: senior adviser to the president and chief liaison to the business community, state and local governments and the political left.
''For him, I think it was more important that she be there than that she have any specific job or set of issues,'' said Susan Sher, Michelle Obama's second chief of staff and a longtime friend of Ms. Jarrett.
Ms. Jarrett declined to be quoted for this article, beyond a statement: ''My role is to ensure that a wide and diverse range of perspectives are heard to inform the president's decision making process,'' she said, and to ''give the president candid advice.''
Parsing the psychology of the president's bond with Ms. Jarrett has become something of a West Wing pastime: is she some sort of mother or sister figure to an only child whose own parents variously abandoned him?
Close friends say that in Ms. Jarrett, the introverted president simply found someone who understands what makes him tick better than most.
They met more than two decades ago, when Ms. Jarrett -- a lawyer, like both Obamas -- offered Mrs. Obama a job in the Chicago mayor's office.
Ms. Jarrett was a single mother who had come up the ranks of city government, the daughter of a prominent African-American family. Her grandfather, Robert Taylor, built much of Chicago's public housing, her father was a pioneering doctor, and her mother had a Chicago street named after her for her work in early childhood education. Mr. Obama was a rootless but ambitious Harvard law graduate, looking to make a political name.
At their first dinner, they talked about a ''philosophy of empowerment'' for the downtrodden. ''That's where we clicked,'' she later told Ms. Sher, and from then on she was determined to introduce Mr. Obama, almost five years her junior, to the activists and donors he needed to move first to the legislature and then to the United States Senate.
In their small social circle, Ms. Jarrett, who would go on to run a Chicago real estate company and sit on numerous civic and corporate boards, ''was always seen as the adult in the room,'' the one looked to for guidance, said John W. Rogers Jr., a longtime friend of both Ms. Jarrett and the president.
Replicating that role in the White House, however, has not been easy.
To some extent, Ms. Jarrett is part of a White House tradition. Bill Clinton brought along his fellow Arkansan Bruce Lindsey as his Mr. Fix-It. Mr. Bush had his Texas confidantes, Karen Hughes and Harriet Miers.
But few have had the stature -- and the ability to step outside traditional White House protocol -- of Ms. Jarrett. She is the only staff member who regularly follows the president home from the West Wing to the residence, a practice that has earned her the nickname ''the Night Stalker.'' By day, Mr. Obama is ''Mr. President'' to her, but in social settings, he is just ''Barack.'' When the Obamas take an out-of-town break, she often goes along.
After a ratings agency downgraded the nation's debt last year, it was not the Treasury secretary at the president's side, helping map out how to manage the market's reaction. According to a participant in the discussion, it was Ms. Jarrett, who had joined Mr. Obama and a few close friends at Camp David for his birthday.
''There is an inherent challenge in managing anyone, this is not particular to Valerie, who is a senior adviser and part of a structure, and also close personally with the family,'' said David Axelrod, the president's chief strategist. ''Obviously it's cleaner and less complicated if everyone is discussing things at the same meetings. But it's a manageable problem.''
Aides say she never uses her private time with the president to relitigate decisions. Even so, the White House is organized around the principle that the president's time is an administration's most valuable commodity, not to be spent on low-priority matters or those not fully vetted. Yet several officials say that is what happened with one of Ms. Jarrett's pet projects, Chicago's bid for the 2016 Olympics.
Based on her assurances that his personal appeal to the Olympic committee could clinch the deal, the president flew to Copenhagen. During the flight back, CNN reported that Chicago had not survived the first round of voting.
''There was total silence,'' one official recalled. ''It was a long trip home.''
Ms. Jarrett cuts an elegant figure in the West Wing, with her pixie haircut and designer clothes. Aides say she can be thoughtful in little ways that matter, enlisting the president to rally staff members after political or personal setbacks. But she can also be imperious -- at one event ordering a drink from a four-star general she mistook for a waiter -- and attached to the trappings of power in a way some in the White House consider unseemly for a member of the staff.
A case in point is her full-time Secret Service detail. The White House refuses to disclose the number of agents or their cost, citing security concerns. But the appearance so worried some aides that two were dispatched to urge her to give the detail up.
She listened politely, one said, but the agents stayed.
A Sometimes Testy Link
Working from a cozy office previously occupied by Mr. Rove, with a staff of nearly three dozen, Ms. Jarrett is the president's link to the world outside the White House bubble.
Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice occasionally uses Ms. Jarrett, with whom she has become friendly, as an informal back channel to pass along foreign policy views, officials said.
And Bob Riley, a former Republican governor of Alabama, remembers the way Ms. Jarrett responded to his pleas for equipment to contain the BP oil spill in 2010. ''Within 24 hours, what we had been told was an impossible task was done,'' he said.
Often, though, Ms. Jarrett seems to be more of a lightning rod for complaints of White House insularity and a thin-skinned response to detractors.
She is widely blamed for the president's soured relationship with the business community. (To judge by donations, Wall Street has switched its allegiance to Mitt Romney.) But Ms. Jarrett's White House defenders say that the criticism is fundamentally misplaced and that she is merely an available target for the financial community's anger over administration policies it dislikes. Behind the scenes, they say, Ms. Jarrett has advocated pro-business policy changes like a regular review of existing regulations.
Less well known is her testy relationship with certain elements of the president's base.
She serves as the front door to the donors who helped elect the president, reviewing guest lists to White House parties and candidates for patronage positions. But she has snubbed some early supporters, among them the financier George Soros, ignoring his pleas for a substantive meeting on the economy with the president. The message she delivered, according to one person familiar with the exchanges, was that she felt Mr. Soros was ''already on the team, and that while he might want to talk to the captain, the captain was very busy.''
Mr. Soros, who has spent tens of millions of dollars on Democratic candidates and causes, is largely sitting on the sidelines this presidential election.
With Ms. Jarrett's unquestioning belief in the president has come a tendency to take political criticism personally, ''even when it would be more useful not to,'' said Marilyn Katz, a Chicago friend of both Ms. Jarrett and the president. Another friend compared her to a mother whose son can do no wrong: ''Even when the neighbors call, she says, 'No, no, that can't be.' ''
So when the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, Anthony Romero, publicly criticized some of the president's antiterrorism policies, she swiftly shoved back. ''Great harm has been done,'' she warned in an e-mail he shared with colleagues. ''There has been a material breach of trust.''
A White House spokeswoman said Ms. Jarrett does respond aggressively when she feels that the president has been attacked.
But in an interview, Mr. Romero said that ''she needs to understand that we don't work for the White House, and our job is to criticize any president who is not doing the right thing.''
Ms. Jarrett was similarly ''livid,'' one former White House official said, with members of the Congressional Black Caucus who accused the president of paying insufficient attention to the particular economic woes of blacks. When the writer and academic Cornel West joined in, calling Mr. Obama the ''black mascot of Wall Street,'' Ms. Jarrett's response was ''ruthless,'' Dr. West said.
He recalled a phone call in which she dismissed his criticism as sour grapes for not receiving a ticket to the inauguration, and said he later heard from friends that she was putting out the word that ''one, I was crazy, and two, I was un-American.''
''It was a matter of letting me know that I was, in her view, way out of line and that I needed to get in line,'' he said in an interview. ''I conveyed to her: 'I'm not that kind of Negro. I'm a Jesus-loving black man who tells the truth, in the White House, in the crack house or in any other house.' She got real quiet. It was clear that she was not used to being spoken to that way.''
Driving the Agenda
When a seat on the Supreme Court opened up just months into Mr. Obama's term, he immediately thought of Sonia Sotomayor. It would be a historic choice, making her the first Hispanic justice. But some advisers were worried by reports about her judicial temperament. Given the tough Senate votes coming up on health care and the economy, why not go with a safer pick?
Ms. Jarrett, dismissing the reports as sexist, argued that appointing Ms. Sotomayor would send an important signal, recalled Anita Dunn, who was then the president's communications director.
It was quintessential Valerie Jarrett, according to Ms. Dunn. It is not so much that she is Mr. Obama's liberal id. Rather, her voice is often the one at the table reminding everyone of the president's aspirational ''first principles,'' that he ''didn't just come to the White House to hold the office, but to make change,'' Ms. Dunn said.
That has been particularly true when it comes to diversity and issues she considers matters of civil rights.
Gay rights advocates say they considered Ms. Jarrett their ''secret weapon'' in the White House on issues like repealing the military's policy of ''don't ask, don't tell.'' And while aides said Mr. Obama found his own way toward supporting same-sex marriage, Ms. Jarrett ''reinforced his instincts,'' Mr. Axelrod said. This is consistent with who you are, she told the president.
On immigration, Ms. Jarrett successfully urged the president to stop deporting certain illegal residents who arrived as children. And while some of his advisers worried about the political perils of legally challenging Arizona's tough immigration law, Ms. Jarrett argued that its central provision -- requiring the police to check the immigration status of people taken into custody -- amounted to racial profiling, a civil rights issue ''right in the president's wheelhouse,'' recalled Pete Rouse, another senior Obama adviser. (Ultimately, the Supreme Court upheld that provision, but struck down most of the law.)
Perhaps no policy area better shows how Ms. Jarrett can drive the White House agenda than the contraception mandate. Ms. Jarrett has a fiercely loyal following among those she backed for key positions throughout government, drawn mainly from a White House women's network she helped build and nurture. The director of the Domestic Policy Council, for instance, previously worked for her, and she counts Ms. Sebelius, the health and human services secretary, among her good friends.
Through that network, Ms. Jarrett made clear her position that a broad exemption for religious employers like hospitals and universities could leave as many as one million women without the benefit. Ms. Sebelius was of like mind, announcing last August that only churches themselves would get a pass.
The resulting outcry prompted Mr. Daley to confront Ms. Sebelius. (Through a spokeswoman, she said she recalled a conversation with Mr. Daley but not the particulars he described.)
Catholics, a group Mr. Obama won in 2008, make up more than a quarter of the electorate. Though most personally support birth control, Mr. Daley and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. worried about how forcing church-affiliated organizations to pay for it would play.
Moreover, they felt that the rule put important Catholic allies in the health care fight in a tough position, and potentially violated a law banning regulations that impose a substantial burden on religious expression.
Mr. Biden arranged for Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York to meet with the president and express the church's view. With the support of some of the president's political advisers, Ms. Jarrett pushed back in her own meeting with Mr. Obama, aides said. And she signaled Ms. Sebelius to ''keep fighting -- I'm with you on this,'' said one former official with knowledge of the matter.
But by January, even friendly voices were accusing the president of throwing ''his progressive Catholic allies under the bus.'' Democratic members of Congress were fielding calls from constituents who felt, in the words of one, that this was a ''big blunder.'' In a senior advisers meeting, the president, exasperated, ordered his senior staff to ''figure it out,'' one participant said.
But if some expected significant backtracking, they were mistaken. In phone calls the next week, the president outlined his compromise: the burden for the coverage would shift from employers to insurers, but women who worked for religious organizations could still avail themselves of the benefit.
''When the president called me,'' said Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, ''I could practically hear Valerie's influence.''
Today, many of the issues Ms. Jarrett championed are being replayed in the campaign. In recent ads, for instance, Mr. Romney has accused the president of using ''his health care plan to declare war on religion.'' The president, for his part, has accused Mr. Romney of wanting to take women ''back to the 1950s.''
And Ms. Jarrett has added another role to her portfolio, traveling to swing states to campaign, sometimes at Mr. Obama's side.
''Homestretch,'' she keeps telling him.
''Homestretch?'' he'll reply.
''Yes, almost there,'' she says. ''We've just got the convention, then three debates.''

HEADLINE: Scaring the Voters in the Middle

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
THE claims of Representative Todd Akin that women don't get pregnant from ''legitimate rape'' now live in infamy. But a few things you may not know:
¶If an American woman in uniform is raped and becomes pregnant, Congress bars Tricare military insurance from paying for an abortion.
¶If an American woman in the Peace Corps becomes pregnant, Congress bars coverage of an abortion -- and there is no explicit exception even if she is raped or her life is in danger. 
¶When teenagers in places like Darfur, Congo or Somalia survive gang rapes, aid organizations cannot use American funds to provide an abortion.
¶A record number of states have curbed abortions in the last two years. According to the Guttmacher Institute, which follows reproductive health, 55 percent of American women of reproductive age now live in one of the 26 states deemed ''hostile to abortion rights.''
¶The Republican campaign platform denounces contraceptive education in schools. Instead, it advises kids to abstain from sex until marriage.
All this boggles the mind. Republican leaders in 2012 have a natural winning issue -- the limping economy -- but they seem determined to scare away centrist voters with extremist positions on everything from abortion to sex education.
Most Americans do not fit perfectly into ''pro-choice'' or ''pro-life'' camps. Polls show that about one-fifth want abortion to be legal in all situations, and another one-fifth want abortion to be illegal always. The majority fall somewhere between, and these voters are the ones who decide elections.
Bill Clinton won their support with his pragmatic formula that abortion should be ''safe, legal and rare.'' Then social conservatives won ground with a shrewd strategic decision to focus the abortion debate where they had the edge.
They fought battles over extremely rare procedures they called ''partial-birth abortion.'' They called for parental consent when a girl seeks an abortion, and for 24-hour waiting periods before an abortion. In polls, around two out of three Americans favor those kinds of restrictions.
But change the situation, and people are more in favor of abortion rights. Four out of five Americans believe that a woman should be able to get an abortion if her health is endangered, or if the pregnancy is the result of rape.
So it's astonishing that Republicans would adopt an absolutist platform condemning abortion without offering an exception even for rape.
Mitt Romney insists that his position on abortion is crystal clear. In fact, his policy is so muddled that he doesn't seem to know it himself. So, Mr. Romney, let me help you out.
On your campaign Web site, you say that life begins at conception and that you favor overturning Roe v. Wade. As with the Republican Party platform, you give no indication there that you favor an exception for rape or to save a woman's life.
Likewise, you seemed to endorse a ''personhood'' initiative like the one in Mississippi last year that would have treated a fertilized egg as a legal person. It failed because of concerns that an abortion, even to save a woman's life, could be legally considered murder. It might also have banned in vitro fertilization and some forms of birth control.
These days, Mr. Romney, as you seek general-election voters, you insist that you do, in fact, accept abortion in cases of rape, incest or a pregnancy that endangers a woman's life. In an interview with CBS the other day, you added another exception, for the health of the mother.
Mr. Romney, if you don't know your own position on abortion, how are we supposed to understand it?
More broadly, you've allied yourself with social conservatives who are on a crusade that scares centrists and mystifies even many devout evangelicals.
''Representative Akin's views don't represent me,'' Richard Cizik of the New Evangelical Partnership for the Common Good told me. ''They also don't reflect the theological and ethical, not to mention scientific, view of evangelical leaders, who understand the rationale for exceptions: God's grace and mercy. Akin and company are the political and theological minority, but they have captured the G.O.P.'s platform process.''
Americans are deeply conflicted on abortion, but I think most are repulsed by the Republican drive to impose ultrasounds -- in some cases invasive ones -- on women before an abortion. Five states now require a woman, before an abortion, to endure an ultrasound that may use a probe inserted into her vagina. Four of those states make no exception for a rape.
And if the Republican Party succeeds in defunding Planned Parenthood, the result will be more women dying of cervical cancer and fewer women getting contraception. The consequence will probably be more unintended pregnancies -- and more abortions.
Or there's sex education. Today in America, more than one-third of teens say that when they began having sex, they had not had any formal instruction about contraception. Is this really the time for a Republican Party platform denouncing comprehensive sex education?
Some Americans don't even seem to have had any sex education by the time they're elected to Congress. Like Todd Akin.

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton's Asia Mission

BYLINE: By CAROL GIACOMO

 BODY:
Mitt Romney has identified Asia as one place where he wants to focus more attention if elected, but the truth is that President Obama has already staked out a forceful position there with his commitment to rebalance American interests from the Middle East to the Pacific. 
The administration will have a chance to re-emphasize that as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton makes her third trip to the region this year. She will be in Beijing this week, and her final stop will be the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' meeting in Vladivostok.
There is no lack of weighty topics on her agenda. Chief among them are the disputes among China, Japan, South Korea and several others over numerous islands in the East China and South China Seas, and the mineral, oil and gas rights to these specks of land. While the conflicts date back many years, they have begun to escalate and carry the risk of war, by mistake or by design. The tensions are sowing mistrust, as well as slowing regional cooperation and economic development. Mrs. Clinton plans to warn leaders at the forum against provocative acts.
She's likely to have the toughest time in China, where the state-run news agency Xinhua just published a commentary saying Washington ''intends to benefit from stirring up disputes among nations.'' Beijing is very anxious that the United States is asserting itself more robustly in the region, including reviving and reinforcing alliances with Pacific Rim nations.
Administration officials deny trying to foment trouble. Instead, they are urging that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations adopt a binding framework for dispute resolution, which could be used to manage competing claims to the islands. The conflict over the islands is a symptom of the growing competition in the region and the fears about China's rise. Washington could play a constructive role, working with both the smaller nations and Beijing.

HEADLINE: Financial Firms Face Subpoenas On Tax Strategy

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE, JULIE CRESWELL and DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI; Michael Luo contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The New York attorney general is investigating whether some of the nation's biggest private equity firms have abused a tax strategy in order to slice hundreds of millions of dollars from their tax bills, according to executives with direct knowledge of the inquiry.
The attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, has in recent weeks subpoenaed more than a dozen firms seeking documents that would reveal whether they converted certain management fees collected from their investors into fund investments, which are taxed at a far lower rate than ordinary income.
Among the firms to receive subpoenas are Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, TPG Capital, Sun Capital Partners, Apollo Global Management, Silver Lake Partners and Bain Capital, which was founded by Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for president. Representatives for the firms declined to comment on the inquiry.
Mr. Schneiderman's investigation will intensify scrutiny of an industry already bruised by the campaign season, as President Obama and the Democrats have sought to depict Mr. Romney through his long career in private equity as a businessman who dismantled companies and laid off workers while amassing a personal fortune estimated at $250 million. 
Some executives at the firms said they feared that Mr. Schneiderman, a first-term Democrat with ties to the Obama administration, was seeking to embarrass the industry because of Mr. Romney's roots at Bain. Others suggested that the subpoenas, which were issued by the attorney general's Taxpayer Protection Bureau, might be part of an effort to recover more revenue for New York under state tax law. The attorney general's office does not have the power to enforce federal tax laws.
A spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman declined to comment.
The tax strategy -- which is viewed as perfectly legal by some tax experts, aggressive by others and potentially illegal by some -- came to light last month when hundreds of pages of Bain's internal financial documents were made available online. The financial statements show that at least $1 billion in accumulated fees that otherwise would have been taxed as ordinary income for Bain executives had been converted into investments producing capital gains, which are subject to a federal tax of 15 percent, versus a top rate of 35 percent for ordinary income. That means the Bain partners saved more than $200 million in federal income taxes and more than $20 million in Medicare taxes.
The subpoenas, which executives said were issued in July, predated the leak of the Bain documents by several weeks and do not appear to be connected with them. Mr. Schneiderman, who is also co-chairman of a mortgage fraud task force appointed by Mr. Obama, has made cracking down on large-scale tax evasion a priority of his first term.
As a retired partner, Mr. Romney continues to receive profits from Bain Capital and has had investments in some of the funds that documents show used the tax strategy.
The campaign issued a statement saying that Mr. Romney did not, however, benefit from the practice. ''Investing fee income is a common, accepted and totally legal practice,'' said R. Bradford Malt, a lawyer for Mr. Romney who manages his family's investments and trusts. ''However, Governor Romney's retirement agreement did not give the blind trust or him the right to do this, and I can confirm that neither he nor the trust has ever done this, whether before or after he retired from Bain Capital.''
Managers at a typical private equity firm or hedge fund collect from their investors management fees based on the size of the fund. But most of their compensation comes as a share of the profits earned by the fund. The Internal Revenue Service allows those profits to be considered ''carried interest,'' taxed at the capital gains rate typically reserved for investments.
The tax strategy used by Bain and other firms to convert management fees -- the compensation normally taxed as ordinary income -- into capital gains is known as a ''management fee waiver.'' The strategy is widely used within the industry: 40 percent of the 35 buyout firms based in the United States surveyed in 2009 by Dow Jones said their partners used at least some of the firm's fees to make investments in their funds.
But some prominent firms appear to avoid the practice. The Carlyle Group and Blackstone Group have stated in regulatory filings that their partners have not diverted management fees into investments in their funds.
In the varied world of private equity, some firms may have lawyers who are not aware of the strategy or have steered their clients away from it, said a lawyer at one firm who has used the strategy for his clients. Others, he said, may not have the operational capabilities to handle the complex transactions.
Apollo Global Management, the buyout firm co-founded by Leon Black and now publicly traded, is among those that use the conversion strategy. Between 2007 and 2011, Apollo converted more than $131 million in fees into investments in its funds, according to S.E.C. filings. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.
Likewise, K.K.R. converted more than $180 million in fees between 2007 and 2009, according to its filings. Kristi Huller, a spokeswoman for the firm, declined to comment about any regulatory matter, but said in an e-mail that K.K.R. had not used the tax strategy ''for the past few years.''
Other firms that received subpoenas include Clayton, Dubilier & Rice; Crestview Partners; H.I.G. Capital; Vestar Capital Partners; and Providence Equity Partners. Representatives for all these firms declined to comment.
Tax lawyers have justified the arrangements by arguing that converting the management fees into carried interest, which could lose some or all of its value if a fund does poorly, entitles the managers to the lower capital gains rate, which is intended to help mitigate the risks taken by investors.
''They're risking their management fee -- they're giving up the right to that management fee in any and all events,'' said Jack S. Levin, a finance lawyer whose firm has represented Bain on some matters. Mr. Levin said he did not consider the practice risky or even aggressive.
''The I.R.S. has known that private equity funds have been doing this for 20 years,'' he said.
In 2007, the agency began taking a closer look at suspected tax abuses at hedge funds and private equity firms. In a statement at the time, an I.R.S. spokesman said that management fee conversions were among several ''areas of possible noncompliance.'' But no formal ruling appears to have emerged.
Some private equity firms take what tax experts consider a less aggressive approach to the conversions, waiving fees on all of a given fund's investments over the lifetime of the fund, which can be 10 years.
But other firms choose which funds or even which particular investments to waive fees on frequently, like every year or every quarter. Such arrangements may allow the executives to apply the waiver only when they believe their funds are more likely to appreciate in value, substantially reducing their investment risk.
Mr. Schneiderman is also looking at whether private equity executives treated management fees as a return of invested capital -- potentially escaping taxation entirely -- or deferred payouts of the converted fees in ways that improperly reduced their tax liabilities.
Executives at three of the firms subpoenaed by Mr. Schneiderman, who asked for anonymity because they were bound by confidentiality agreements, said that disclosures to their investors clearly stated that the waived fees were allocated equally to all the investments in a fund.
The leaked documents show that Bain has in recent years waived management fees in at least eight private equity and other funds, including one formed as early as January 2002. The documents stated that Bain executives had the right to decide either annually or each quarter whether to waive some or all of their management fees; they also had the ability to convert the waived fees into investments in particular companies held by the funds.
Victor Fleischer, a law professor and finance expert at the University of Colorado who has been critical of the tax rules for private equity firms, said he believed Bain had waived management fees into investments with so little risk that the arrangement would not qualify for the capital gains rate if challenged by the I.R.S.
''There is a tension between economic risk and tax risk that is supposed to be inversely proportional,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''The way Bain set it up there's not much risk at all, so it's hard to see how this income should receive capital gains treatment.''

OBAMA VS. POVERTY
Having spent seven years working as a legal-services attorney in public-housing developments throughout Chicago, I recognize the chaos described by Paul Tough in his article about Roseland. But what I also saw in my work was a working mother who, despite her extreme poverty, kept her apartment spotless and rose before dawn to get her family ready for school and work; and a tenant leader who, despite her organization being dissolved by the housing authority, went to her office each day to continue to help residents. We must not further disempower people by failing to acknowledge the work already under way from within their community. NICKI BAZER, Evanston, Ill.
Poor people who want to get ahead soon realize there are forces arrayed against them -- from payday lenders to a rapacious justice system. While bankers can rob the country blind with impunity, poor people go to jail for life after three strikes on a misdemeanor. If the game is rigged, you just stop playing. ARNESSA M. GARRETT, Lafayette, La., posted on nytimes.com 
It doesn't matter what economic class you come from -- there will be ''accidents'' of pregnancy by foolish young people. So we fight this with education and love. We don't say, ''You're too poor: no kids for you.'' Instead we attack this by providing free day-care centers and early-childhood education, and we help the young understand birth control and support family planning. ARLEN JOHNSON, Troy, N.Y., posted on nytimes.com
I was surprised there was no mention of the high incarceration rate experienced by African-American men in Paul Tough's account of urban poverty in Chicago. The prison population has risen to more than 2.3 million in 2008 from roughly 200,000 in 1970. Any attempt to devise and implement government policies to combat poverty in Roseland without acknowledging the relationship between our current criminal-justice system and social collapse seems futile. JOHN H. STEED Santa Barbara, Calif.
The Republicans will use any mention of poverty to remind the public of how bad the economy is doing under Obama's watch. Until he is re-elected, expect the president to do everything he can to shift attention away from economic suffering and toward renewal and growth. MATT VELKER, Minneapolis, posted on nytimes.com
Paul Tough writes that 50 years ago, rich and poor Americans ''lived in relatively stable, mixed-income communities'' and ''their children often attended the same public schools.'' Housing and school segregation underlie the hopelessness of today's ghettos. Education may be ''the answer,'' but trying to ''fix'' schools without desegregating will fail. DR. NICHOLAS CUNNINGHAM, Emeritus professor of clinical pediatrics and clinical public health at Columbia University, Springfield Center, N.Y.
IMRAN KHAN
The profile dwells on rallies that draw crowds. As an old man, I have seen crowds who came to listen to Mohammed Ali Jinnah, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto and now Imran Khan. Ali Bhutto gave a constitution but imposed a state of emergency. Benazir Bhutto married Asif Ali Zardari and never got rid of him. It was time a ''messiah'' came along in the shape of Khan. All his promises are impractical, but the crowds don't care. SHAFAAT RASOOL, Syosset, N.Y., posted on nytimes.com
For all his intellectual shallowness, the great advantage Khan brings to Pakistani politics is the absence of dynasty. He is neither the scion of a political family nor is it likely that his sons will ever enter politics. In a region awash with nepotism, he does represent change.

HEADLINE: Romney Stakes Hopes on Ohio, A Tactical Test

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY; Jim Rutenberg reported from Cincinnati, and Jeff Zeleny from Charlotte, N.C.

 BODY:
CINCINNATI -- Fresh off his nominating convention, Mitt Romney is cranking up a well-financed political machine that will now bring its full force to bear on President Obama with a hailstorm of ads and nonstop campaigning.
But little of it may matter if Mr. Romney cannot win here in Ohio, where a loss would severely narrow his path to the White House.
That explains why the state has seen more presidential campaign ads than any other in the last three months, why it has assumed such a prominent place in the legal battles over voting rules, and why Mr. Romney, Mr. Obama and their running mates campaigned here over the Labor Day weekend.
''It's possible to win without Ohio,'' Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, the chairman of the Romney campaign here, said in an interview. ''But I wouldn't want to risk it.'' 
Mr. Portman and John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House, joined Mr. Romney and thousands of cheering supporters at Union Terminal here on Saturday for a rally that had the distinct high energy of a newly engaged general election campaign. Reprising a theme from his convention speech, that Mr. Obama had failed to live up to sky-high promises, Mr. Romney drew laughs from the crowd by saying, ''He famously said that he was going to slow the rise of the oceans,'' then thundering, ''Our promise to you is this: we're going to help the American people.''
Mr. Romney is running closely with Mr. Obama in most national polls, but the story is different in several states that will decide the race for the necessary 270 electoral votes. Many polls in those states show Mr. Obama holding an advantage over Mr. Romney as the Democrats prepare to open their convention on Tuesday in Charlotte, N.C. In a Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll released just over a week ago, Mr. Obama had a six-point advantage over Mr. Romney in Ohio for the second month in a row.
To give a sense of Mr. Romney's challenge: he could win Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Virginia -- all carried by Mr. Obama in 2008 -- and still fall short without Ohio and its 18 electoral votes.
The state, which has been doing better than the nation as a whole by some economic measures, will test whether Mr. Obama can successfully point to selective improvements in the economy, and whether Mr. Romney can make the case that with a Republican governor, in this instance John R. Kasich, conservative policies like reductions in government spending are already promoting job growth.
Democratic ads attacking Mr. Romney's refusal to release more tax returns and accusing him of presiding over the outsourcing of jobs while at Bain Capital have made it more difficult to gain the trust of voters here, his advisers said. The president has an edge of 18 percentage points over Mr. Romney in Ohio when voters are asked who cares more about their problems, according to the Quinnipiac/Times/CBS poll.
The campaign here also brings to life a key matchup of the race: the intensive get-out-the-vote organization of the Obama campaign versus Republicans who are racing to catch up and remain reliant on the energy of grass-roots conservatives.
''Ohio is a microcosm of this campaign,'' said Jim Messina, the campaign manager for Mr. Obama, pointing to increases in manufacturing and expansion in the automobile industry across the state, which have given the president a positive story to tell here.
No Republican in modern times has reached the White House without carrying Ohio, and the alternatives strike fear into Mr. Romney's quickly expanding team in the state.
In 2008, Mr. Obama won Ohio by four percentage points. At the Republican National Convention last week, Mr. Romney sought to appeal to voters who backed Mr. Obama but are now wavering, a strategy critical here in Ohio, where suburban women and independent voters around Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati are a main focus.
This county, Hamilton, has been reliably Republican, with Mr. Obama becoming the first Democrat to carry it since Lyndon Johnson.
''This is ground zero right here,'' said Rose Pietras, 66, as she worked the phones in Mr. Romney's volunteer office on the edge of town. ''This is about turnout.''
Mr. Portman said the Republican base is not enough. ''You're not going to get there without attracting Obama voters,'' he said.
The roster of deeply competitive states has remained virtually unchanged for months, with Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio and Virginia narrowly divided. Wisconsin has become more competitive since Representative Paul D. Ryan joined the Republican ticket, offering a stronger appeal to voters in his home state.
While Mr. Obama still has far more paths to 270 electoral votes, given how he expanded the Democratic map four years ago, he is facing considerable resistance in some of those states.
He visited Iowa on Saturday for the third time in two weeks and mocked the Republican convention as a throwback to old ideas, saying: ''You might as well have watched it on a black-and-white TV.'' He will also make his second trip in a week to Colorado on Sunday before coming to Ohio.
On the eve of the Republican convention, a senior strategist with a Republican ''super PAC,'' who would share the group's strategic thinking only on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Romney would need a ''real surge'' and ''a reset to the dynamics there'' to gain an edge over Mr. Obama in Ohio.
With many automobile manufacturers and parts makers, Ohio's economy has benefited from the administration's bailout of the industry. The state's unemployment rate of 7.2 percent in July was more than a percentage point lower than the national average. And while Mr. Obama's aides do not feel overconfident, they are pleased to see that Democrats remain in command of the race, in a state where Republicans dominated in the 2010 elections.
Mr. Romney appeared to struggle with the blue-collar workers of this state during the primary campaign in March, just narrowly defeating former Senator Rick Santorum. Still, he performed well in most suburban areas, where turnout is expected to be greater in November.
In the last three months, Mr. Obama's campaign spent roughly $20 million to run commercials nearly 40,000 times here, according to the media analysis firm Kantar Media/CMAG. Mr. Romney spent more than $8 million to run more than 14,000 ads during the same period, but pro-Romney groups including American Crossroads helped Republicans match Mr. Obama ad for ad, according to CMAG.
With the formal start of the general election season, Mr. Romney's campaign has enough money to combine with the super PACs to flood television screens with anti-Obama advertising.
But the Republicans had a setback on Friday when a federal judge reversed a new state law that halted early voting on the weekend before Election Day. In 2008, that final weekend was seen as giving Mr. Obama an advantage, especially as African-American churchgoers organized trips to the polls on Sunday.
The early voting accounted for 100,000 ballots in 2008, roughly 2 percent of the total cast. That is no small number in such a hard-fought swing state, especially this year. Republicans said they would appeal the judge's ruling.
For now, Mr. Romney's aides can take heart that their convention, which featured personal testimonials from friends and acquaintances, appeared to give him a lift.
Arriving too late at Union Terminal to see Mr. Romney, Elizabeth Cartagena, 54, said: ''He helped people -- a lot of people. I saw his speech on the TV.'' She said she planned to vote for him also because ''he's of God, too. I'm Christian.''

HEADLINE: In Colorado, Obama Takes Page From Unexpected Democratic Victory

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
DENVER -- As President Obama navigates the battleground states that will determine whether he wins a second term, his campaign strategists have unfolded a road map for one in particular. And they are following it closely as the best route to their destination.
Desperate to win Colorado and its nine electoral votes, the Obama campaign is trying to assemble the same coalition that Senator Michael Bennet built in 2010, when he managed to win a full term against a conservative Republican in a year in which Democrats struggled both in Colorado and nationally. 
Mr. Bennet, a surprise pick to fill a Senate vacancy in 2009 who was considered to be at great peril of losing the seat, capitalized on a yawning gender gap and strong support among Hispanics to win. In the process, he showed the way for the Obama campaign to try to pull off a victory in the state despite his lagging popularity among white men.
''We did stitch together a winning coalition in 2010, and I think that coalition is part of the basis of what they are doing here in Colorado,'' said Mr. Bennet, who works closely with the White House and is assisting in the president's re-election effort.
Colorado, which will host the first presidential debate on Oct. 3, is unmistakably a top Obama target. The president has been to the state 11 times since being elected, and a visit on Sunday will be his seventh this year alone.
The campaign has opened more than 50 field offices in Colorado, compared with about a dozen for his Republican rival, Mitt Romney. It has also brought on members of Mr. Bennet's team, including his chief political strategist, Craig Hughes, to provide their local expertise.
At the moment, Colorado is considered a pure tossup. Most iterations of the electoral map show it to be essential not only for the president to win but also to provide a foundation of support in the West.
The Obama campaign believes that it has the advantage, given its edge in registering voters in the state and Mr. Romney's positions on immigration and women's issues.
''You'd rather be us than them,'' said Jim Messina, the president's campaign manager and a Denver-born former aide to Senator Max Baucus of Montana, who is widely recognized for his knowledge about what works for Democrats in the difficult political terrain of the Mountain States.
Republicans say they think Mr. Romney can carry Colorado because of dissatisfaction over the economy among its voters -- even those who supported Mr. Obama in 2008 and Mr. Bennet two years later. They expect social issues to play less of a role in the race. Still, they concede, it is very close.
''It could go either way,'' said Dick Wadhams, a former head of the state Republican Party and a Colorado campaign strategist. ''It is a game of inches.''
Democrats and Republicans believe that the outcome will be decided by voters in the suburban Denver counties of Arapahoe and Jefferson, particularly women but also Hispanics -- the same voters who were so crucial to Mr. Bennet in 2010.
He was up against Ken Buck, a state prosecutor who had won a primary against Jane Norton, a former lieutenant governor, despite some notable flubs, including his saying that he was a stronger candidate because ''I do not wear high heels.'' Remarks like that, and his opposition to abortion in the case of rape or incest, provided an opening for Mr. Bennet to reach out to Republican and independent women who were conservative on economic issues but were wary of tough social stances -- a hallmark of Colorado swing voters.
To gain ground, Mr. Bennet hammered Mr. Buck on the abortion issue and a rape case that he had declined to prosecute, which he explained by saying the victim might have had ''buyer's remorse.''
Mr. Bennet also ran an ad with a Denver obstetrician-gynecologist accusing Mr. Buck of being too extreme on the issue of women's health. Mr. Bennet's wife, Susan, and their three young daughters campaigned heavily for him.
The strategy paid off. Mr. Bennet won narrowly, by about 15,000 votes, but he piled up about twice as many votes as Mr. Buck among Hispanics and ended up with a 17-percentage-point edge among women -- the best showing in all of the Senate races that year.
The Obama campaign was clearly paying attention. Mr. Obama recently campaigned in the state with Sandra Fluke, the Georgetown University law student who got caught up in a battle over resistance to administration efforts to require health insurers to provide contraception. And the campaign is running ads in an effort to appeal to women.
One features two women discussing their fears about Mr. Romney being too extreme and out of touch on women's health issues and his opposition to Planned Parenthood. ''I think Mitt Romney would definitely drag us back,'' one of the women says.
No one expects Mr. Obama to rack up the kind of margin with women that Mr. Bennet did. But the campaign is hoping to make up that difference with an ambitious outreach to younger voters, who did not vote in large numbers in 2010.
Mr. Wadhams, the Republican strategist, said he thought that Democrats were overplaying their hand on abortion in Colorado and that socially moderate Republican women and independents who were willing to support the president and Mr. Bennet were open to Mr. Romney if he delivered the right appeal.
''They want to vote for Mitt Romney if he can give them the sense that he will make the economy better,'' Mr. Wadhams said. ''In this election, I think they are far more anxious -- absolutely terrified -- about the future of the economy.''
Mr. Bennet said he was convinced that women in Colorado would strongly favor the president, given the record of Republicans in Washington and Mr. Romney's views on issues they see as crucial.
''I am not sure there has been an election where women have a clearer choice,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Road Shows Get Rolling For Romney And Obama

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS and JACKIE CALMES; Jeremy W. Peters reported from Cincinnati, and Jackie Calmes from Urbandale, Iowa. Trip Gabriel contributed reporting from Columbus, Ohio.

 BODY:
CINCINNATI -- Big crowds cheered both of the presidential candidates on Saturday as Mitt Romney began a cross-country campaign swing here testing his momentum coming out of the Republican convention, and President Obama started his own tour heading into his convention this week.
A line of people that stretched for five city blocks awaited Mr. Romney as his motorcade pulled into Union Terminal here. 
And inside there were so many people that the campaign had to redirect a few hundred of them into a small overflow room, where they crammed in shoulder to shoulder.
Later, thousands in Jacksonville, Fla., filled a courtyard and gave Mr. Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, a spirited reception.
Mr. Romney has often failed to spark much of a connection with his audiences, and along the campaign trail enthusiasm has sometimes been in short supply.
But inside a soaring Art Deco-style rotunda here, the candidate, joined by John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House, and Senator Rob Portman, delivered a vigorous and sharply focused speech -- complete with fresh punch lines -- that sent the audience into earsplitting roars.
Echoing a criticism of the president that he has been making more powerfully lately, Mr. Romney denounced Mr. Obama's first term as one of betrayed promises and failed leadership.
''One of the promises he made was he was going to create more jobs. And today, 23 million people are out of work or stopped looking for work or underemployed,'' Mr. Romney said. ''Let me tell you, if you have a coach that's zero and 23 million, you say it's time to get a new coach. It's time for America to see a winning season again, and we're going to bring it to them.''
Mr. Romney also confronted head-on a subject that he had been more reluctant to wade into: chastising Republicans for running up the deficit when they controlled Washington.
The more popular and convenient story line for many Republicans has often been to lay the blame for record deficits at the feet of the Obama administration.
''We're going to finally have to do something that Republicans have spoken about for a long time, and for a while we didn't do it,'' he said. ''When we had the lead we let people down.''
As Mr. Romney roused the crowd here, Mr. Obama sought to drum up momentum for his convention, which begins Tuesday. He started a four-day, four-state campaign trip on Saturday in Iowa, the state where he opened his quest for the presidency five years ago. In front of a crowd of 10,000 outside Des Moines, he said the Republican convention was a reminder of how backward-looking their vision for the country is.
''You might as well have watched it on a black-and-white TV,'' said Mr. Obama, to the applause and amusement of his audience. He offered a summary, ''Everything's bad, it's Obama's fault and Governor Romney is going to be the one who knows the secret to creating jobs and growing the economy.''
''There was a lot of talk about hard truths and bold choices, but nobody ever actually bothered to tell you what they were,'' Mr. Obama added. ''And when Governor Romney had his chance to let you in on his secrets, he did not offer a single new idea -- just retreads of the same old policies that have been sticking it to the middle class for years.''
It was Mr. Obama's seventh visit to the state this year and his 13th as president, reflecting the importance of this swing state's six electoral votes to his prospects of winning the necessary 270 votes in a close, unpredictable election.
On Monday, Mr. Obama will take a detour from campaigning to tour the storm damage in Louisiana, a solid Republican state, and then visit Virginia, a swing state, on Tuesday before arriving for the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., on Wednesday.
Mr. Ryan also had a separate campaign stop of his own, visiting Ohio State University in the morning for the football team's season opener. He joined tailgaters and flipped some burgers on a grill, a skill that his mother, Betty, noted he had acquired working at McDonald's as a young man.
Since Mr. Romney picked Mr. Ryan as his running mate last month, the former Massachusetts governor has used his younger and spryer No. 2 to add some energy to campaign rallies. But the speech in Cincinnati nevertheless lit a fire in the audience while Mr. Ryan was in another part of the state.
The setting for Mr. Romney's speech had been the backdrop for another major political event. On Oct. 7, 2002, George W. Bush delivered a televised address from Union Terminal to make his case for the Iraq war.
Mr. Romney's speech hit some of the same notes that Mr. Romney made in Tampa, Fla., where he accepted his party's nomination on Thursday night. He accused the president of putting teachers' unions, not students, first. He said the president would raise taxes on successful small business owners. And he pledged to repeal the president's health care overhaul, which he called a ''big cloud'' raining over small businesses.
''America's going to come roaring back,'' Mr. Romney said as he concluded. ''We're going to get America strong again, for you, for your children, for the future.''
The language in the speech, complete with sports team metaphors and the ''roaring back'' line recalled the message delivered by a Romney campaign supporter in a Super Bowl car commercial that stirred considerable controversy when it aired: That supporter was Clint Eastwood.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Now Trotting In: The Democratic Herd

BYLINE: By BILL MARSH. 
A graphics editor at The New York Times.

 BODY:
Since Barack Obama's 2008 victory, Democrats have watched with dismay as the president has been vilified by opponents and as Washington, already polarized, has become downright toxic.(Republicans have their own ideas about when the polarization began.)What had been a complicated patchwork of Democratic voting blocs before Obama has coalesced into fewer groups that are more unified. They're not exactly moving in lock step -- they never do -- but their allegiance to the president has softened the usual party divisions. His embrace of gay marriage is instructive: it was a galvanizing moment for supporters, and it didn't seem to hurt him with the large blocs of Democrats who are socially conservative. The 2012 Democratic herd is charted here along a left-to-right continuum of party loyalty, based chiefly on the Pew Research Center's Political Typology as well as the views of political experts.The size of the donkey icons approximates the relative strength of each bloc. (Our guide to the 2006 Democratic herd is at nytimes.com/opinion.) Pew's tracking of party affiliation shows that a growing number of Americans identify as independent:
37% Independent 
32% Democrat
24% Republican
With party loyalists on both sides largely decided, ''the race will move at the margins,'' said Tad Devine, a longtime Democratic consultant. That's why the campaigns are focused on identity groups: women, Latinos, older voters. Peeling off even slivers of these could well determine who wins the election.
Staunch Liberals
WHO One of the two biggest blocs and the party's most loyal voters, from students, academics and bloggers to Hollywood icons. The activist subset grew with the vocal addition of the Occupy movement, fueled by disgust with inequality and a system seen as unfairly tilted toward the wealthy.
STANDARD-BEARER Elizabeth Warren is a rock star for championing consumer protections and taking on the finance industry.
MOTIVATING ISSUES
Inequality.
Protect the environment.
Expand the safety net.
Pro-abortion rights.
Pro-gay marriage.
Pro-immigrants.
Pro-renewable energy.
Cut defense spending.
Gun control.
Simpatico subgroup:
Gay voters
Bootstrap Optimists
WHO A growing majority-minority bloc: roughly equal parts African-American, Hispanic and white; many immigrants and children of immigrants. Though largely low-income and financially stressed -- about half make less than $30,000 -- they believe hard work will get them ahead.
STANDARD-BEARERS Julián Castro, Cory Booker.
MOTIVATING ISSUES
The economy.
Protect safety net.
Pro-immigration.
Gun control.
They are religious and socially conservative.
Blue Collar Block
WHO The other big bedrock wing. They're beaten down and pessimistic -- half make less than $30,000 -- with the highest unemployment of all blocs. They blame both government neglect and Wall Street greed. But many also see immigrants as competition for work -- a major fault line within the party.
STANDARD-BEARERS Joe Biden, Sherrod Brown.
MOTIVATING ISSUES
The economy.
Expand safety net.
Big business doesn't care about
the little guy; nor does government.
They are religious and socially
conservative (for Democrats).
Limit immigration.
Anti-corporate welfare.
Younger Independents
WHO This smaller group only leans Democratic, and they're doing quite well. They're mostly white and liberal (though notably not on entitlements and affirmative action). About one-third are under age 30; nearly as many have no religious affiliation. Half live either in the Northeast or in the West.
STANDARD-BEARERS None, as few younger politicians make the national stage. But Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart are beacons.
MOTIVATING ISSUES
Protect the environment.
Pro-abortion rights.
Pro-gay marriage.
Pro-immigrants.
Pro-renewable energy.
Cut defense spending.
Prefer a smaller federal government that provides fewer services.
Southern and Rural Democrats
WHO A small, shrinking remnant of what used to be a mainstay of the party. They can be heard muttering that elites in California and Manhattan don't understand them. They're open to compromise, and they've been known to vote Republican.
STANDARD-BEARER Joe Manchin.
MOTIVATING ISSUES
The economy.
Drill, mine and frack: they favor energy development over environmental protection.
They are religious and socially conservative.
Pro-defense spending.

CHART (SR6); GRAPHICS: A Unifying Theme: Fairness: It has different meanings for different blocs -- some examples are noted in thought balloons -- but the broad notion of fairness animates just about all of these voters.

HEADLINE: Bronx Community College Gets a Library, and Building, Truly Its Own

BYLINE: DAVID W. DUNLAP


HIGHLIGHT: The library is the first big new building on the 43-acre University Heights campus in the Bronx, since 1970, when it was the uptown division of New York University. 

 BODY:
The new North Hall and Library at Bronx Community College had scarcely been open a day when Dorian Whyte, 21, and Jang Sung Soo, 22, sat down last week to study physics on the light-filled balcony wrapping around an enormous central reading room. Neither had any books in front of him. But they were evidently enjoying the place.
"Having this come into the Bronx is such a great idea, especially at a community college," Mr. Whyte said. "It gives you a great initiation into what a real school is."
North Hall is the first big, new building on the 43-acre University Heights campus since 1970, when it was the uptown division of New York University. It is also the first academic building that the college, a unit of the City University of New York, has had constructed for its own, instead of inheriting as a hand-me-down.
There is a generosity to the building's features and finishes that communicates a message: the Bronx matters. North Hall was designed by Robert A. M. Stern Architects, known for its interpretations of Classical design. The main reading room was modeled on the double-barreled Bibliothèque Ste.-Geneviève in Paris, by Henri Labrouste.
The North Hall project benefited from having been put to bid as the economic crisis scuttled a lot of private development, thereby depressing prices for labor and materials. Many amenities were possible within the original $104 million budget, with enough money left over, almost $30 million, to improve old campus infrastructure like heating, electrical and water systems, which no one ever notices until ruptured pipes erupt like geysers.
"Contractors were hungry," said Iris Weinshall, the CUNY vice chancellor for facilities planning, construction and management. "We were able to keep elements that, under ordinary circumstances, we probably would have had to value-engineer out of the building." 
The list of extras includes marble and slate floors, Guastavino tile vaults, pendant light fixtures and custom-designed study carrels. The ceiling vaults are bordered in a Greek key pattern that was hand-stenciled by a painter named Cid Mendez - "a modern-day Michelangelo," Ms. Weinshall said, evoking an image of Charlton Heston in the Sistine Chapel.
Actually, at 40 feet, the ceiling of the main reading room is only three-fifths the height of the Sistine ceiling. But the library's other dimensions are no less notable. The third floor, where the stacks are situated, is 209 feet long by 100 feet wide. The opening in the third-floor slab that creates the balcony around the reading room is 91 feet long by 47 feet wide (a bit wider than the chapel, if you're still keeping score at home).
On the first floor are 15 much-needed large classrooms, each for 35 to 45 students, said Anton Wolfshorndl, the assistant director of design, construction and management at CUNY. There are about 11,450 students at Bronx Community College, which grants associate degrees. It opened in 1959 in the former Bronx High School of Science at Creston Avenue and East 184th Street.
In those days, New York University had an uptown campus at University Avenue and West 180th Street. The original buildings, constructed from 1894 to 1912, were designed by Stanford White of McKim, Mead & White. They included the Gould Memorial Library and the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, architectural treasures and official city landmarks.
During a period of tremendous unrest nationwide, the Gould library was firebombed in April 1969. A month later, protesting students at Bronx Community College briefly occupied their building.
Though the books there were spared harm, New York University soon moved the stacks to the basement of a new building known as Technology II, designed by Marcel Breuer. It is now called Meister Hall.
As New York University's deficits grew in the early 1970s, it faced increasing pressure to close its uptown division. That happened in 1973, after which the campus was transferred to the Bronx Community College.
The Gould building remains largely empty to this day, in a state of minimal repair though far from complete abandonment. Daunting structural and logistical issues face any attempt to rehabilitate the building. Now, the library at Meister is empty, too. College officials hope to reuse it as a one-stop student service center, including the bursar and registrar, said David A. Taylor, the dean of administration and finance. But that is probably at least three years off.
A visitor on Wednesday who kept his ears open could hear grumbling about all the space on campus that being used while CUNY spent tens of millions of dollars building new structures with marble finishes. But the overall mood seemed celebratory.
"I'm enjoying the great beauty of this building," Prof. Teresa L. McManus, the chief librarian, told the college president, Carole Berotte Joseph, as Dr. Joseph paid a visit. "It puts forward that Bronx Community College is about academics."
"Students need a place to be, to study, to learn," Professor McManus said. "And guess what? They love the books."

HEADLINE: Parties Do Some Convention Spin on Sunday Talk Shows

BYLINE: BRIAN KNOWLTON


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama's aides say accuse the Republicans of "lies" after their convention, but Republicans say Mitt Romney "a home run" with his speech. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It would probably be safe to say, based on the reviews of the Republican convention offered Sunday by some of President Obama's top advisers, that the gloves are official off as Democrats look forward to their own turn on the convention stage in Charlotte.
"I don't think we've ever seen a presidential campaign - ever -- that's built on a foundation of absolute lies," David Plouffe, a senior White House adviser, said of the Romney campaign, "and I think ultimately they're going to pay a price for it." He was speaking Sunday on ABC's "This Week."
Mr. Plouffe accused the Romney team of lying about Obama administration cuts to Medicare (aides to the president say cuts would come from savings and not affect benefits for the elderly), lying about a change in welfare policy that Mr. Romney's backers say would end a work requirement (the administration flatly denies this), and distorting the president's "You didn't build that" comment (he was arguing that government-financed infrastructure supports every company). Most independent fact-checkers support the Democrats' interpretations on these issues.
Mr. Plouffe also called it a "huge omission" for Mitt Romney to have failed to mention the war in Afghanistan, or those fighting in it, in his 37-minute acceptance speech Thursday in Tampa, Fla. He called that "an amazing thing for someone who wants to be, 66 days from now, elected as our commander in chief."
It apparently was the first time in decades that a presidential candidate, in a convention speech, had failed to mention an ongoing war. 
Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, was asked about that on CNN's "State of the Union." He noted that Mr. Romney had addressed the war, and his support for the military, a day earlier in a major speech to an American Legion group in Indianapolis.
 "Governor Romney's convention speech was an opportunity for him to introduce himself to millions of voters," Mr. Fehrnstrom said, adding that "he accomplished what he set out to do, which was to talk about his better vision for America," to critique the Obama presidency and to provide a fuller personal portrait of himself.
"We thought that speech was a home run," Mr. Fehrnstrom said.
The president's advisers, not surprisingly, did not share that view.
David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior campaign strategist, said he did not see the Republicans getting any real bounce from their storm-shortened convention.
Several opinion surveys showed at least a small upward movement; Nate Silver, the polling analyst whose work appears on The New York Times's site, Nate Silver, said that the convention produced a "modest" bounce in the polls.
Mr. Axelrod, brushing off the Tampa convention as full of "snarky attacks and bromides for the base," added, "I think the race is exactly where it was before they walked in, and now it's our turn." While the polls may be close, he added on "Fox News Sunday," "I'd much rather be us than them."
But Mr. Fehrnstrom suggested that voters will continue to keep a firm focus on one thing: the lagging economy.
"I think the biggest news next week will not be the three nights of the Democrats' convention, but will be on Friday, when we hear again about the monthly jobs report."
He added, "We're all hoping for good news, but the odds are high that unemployment will remain above 8 percent."
For those not inclined to fast-forward to Friday, another senior Obama adviser, Robert Gibbs, offered a preview of the Democrats' convention in Charlotte.
He said that Mr. Obama would not duck uncomfortable realities but would "acknowledge that we live in incredibly tough economic times" and would talk not just about himself and Mr. Romney but "about the 300 million people that live in America."
Mr. Gibbs added, "He's going to focus on how we move this country forward, laying out plans for strengthening the security of the middle class, investing in research and innovation, paying down our debt responsibly, and honoring those who serve overseas."

HEADLINE: The Cost of Living Blues

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: How our political and economic problems look through the lens of country music. 

 BODY:
Last year, on Feb. 10, in the kind of pronouncement that has become all too familiar, Richard Kramer, the chairman and C.E.O. of Goodyear Tire & Rubber, announced the closing of a plant in Union City, Tenn:
While we are committed to manufacturing in North America, all of our plants must be cost-competitive and be able to demonstrate sustainable, world-class productivity. That is not the case with this plant, and as a result, the market has moved beyond what the factory is able to build.
The actual shutdown took place on July 10, 2011, when 1,983 workers lost their jobs. The last item posted on the web site of Union City Steelworkers Local 878L, which represented the workers at the plant, reads:
Attention USW Local 878L Members
At 11:00 pm CDT last night (07/10/2011), our Sisters and Brothers at Local 878L in Union City, TN, were given WARN notice and told by Goodyear that their services were no longer needed.
"The Cost of Livin' " - written by Phillip Coleman from Union City, revised and recorded in 2011 by the country singer Ronnie Dunn - memorializes the Goodyear plant shutdown:
Everything to know about me
Is written on this page
The number you can reach me
My social and my age
Yes I served in the army
It's where I learned to shoot
Eighteen months in the desert
Pourin' sand out of my boots
No I've never been convicted of a crime
I could start this job at any time.
(Chorus)
I got a strong back
Steel toes
I'm handy with a wrench
There's nothing I can't drive
Nothing I can't fix
I work sun-up to sun-down
Ain't too proud to sweep the floors
Bank has started calling
And the wolves are at my door
Three dollars and change at the pump
Cost of livin's high and goin' up.
In its exploration of real, and often troubled, social conditions, "Cost of Livin' " is part of a long history in country music that includes Tennessee Ernie Ford's "Sixteen Tons," Merle Haggard's "Working Man's Blues," Johnny Paycheck's "Take This Job and Shove It," Gillian Welch's "Hard Times," and Dolly Parton's "9 to 5." Like them, it holds nothing back:
I put Robert down as a reference
He's known me all my life
We attend the same church
He introduced me to my wife
Gave my last job everything
Before it headed south
Took the shoes off of my children's feet
The food out of their mouths
Yesterday my folks offered to help
But they're barely getting by themselves
(Chorus)
I got a strong back 
I'm sure a hundred others have applied
Rumor has it you're only takin' five
(Chorus)
Ronnie Dunn, it turns out, is part of that rare but potentially crucial segment of the electorate, the man on the fence.
In 2004, Dunn was one of the most outspoken supporters of President George W. Bush's re-election. "The major reason of me being overboard with Bush was the terrorist attacks. Bush stepped up," Dunn told me in a phone interview from Santa Fe.
Since then, Dunn has shifted gears.
"It'll kill me," he said, referring to the likely angry response from his country and western fans, many of whom have abandoned the Democratic Party, but in 2008, Dunn says, he voted for Obama.
"I was initially attracted to Obama's charisma," he said. "Now I would say charisma does not an effective leader make."
But Dunn is no fan of Mitt Romney's.
"Romney, I'm afraid, there's a voice going back in my mind: 'Is this another cold, play-by-numbers C.E.O. type stepping into American Inc. USA?' "
When Dunn and Coleman put together the documentary-style music video for "Cost of Livin,' " they interviewed laid-off workers near the closed Goodyear plant in Obion County, Tenn., where Coleman grew up. The men and women in the film are worried about what will come next. In the film, their faces and voices are interspersed with the song's verses:
"My name's Toni Bryant, I've been working at the tire plant for 13 years and today is my last day." She smiles. "Cleaned out my locker, throwed out those steel-toed shoes."
An unidentified middle-aged man with a baseball cap sitting on his front porch with his wife and daughter says: "Went to work that day, and there it was. They were closing the plant." He pauses and looks at the camera. "Scared. Think about your kids, what are they going to do? What are we going to do?"
The video is testament to the depth of the trauma inflicted on millions across the country who are out of work. It is, coincidentally, strikingly similar to the ads attacking Romney and Bain Capital that have been put together by the Obama campaign and its allied super PAC, Priorities USA Action.
There are high hurdles for Democrats trying to make the case for Obama in Obion County where the unemployment rate has risen over the past year from 10.6 percent to 14.8 percent. The sense of betrayal and grievance in the county is echoed in states key to the election - Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and New Hampshire.
The past four years have been hard on voters across the nation. This chart from the Pew Research Center documents the sharp decline in median household income since 2008, and an even worse drop in median net worth, which plummeted 39 percent -- from $152,950 in 2008 to $93,150 last year.
Obviously, these are not good figures for an incumbent president seeking re-election:
Unemployment, the most direct measure of the human cost of a weak economy, remains high, at 8.3 percent. Just under 12.8 million men and women are out of work. 5.2 million of them have been without a job for six months or longer. Another 5.3 million people want to work full time but can only find part-time jobs, and 852,000 have given up looking for a job, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In all its forms, worklessness breeds financial insecurity, family strife, downward mobility and a pervasive sense of anguish. Those with jobs sense the precariousness of their livelihoods.
Voters in a Pew survey released on Aug. 22 place more of the responsibility for the nation's economic problems on Congress, on financial institutions, on corporations, on the Bush administration and on foreign competition than they do on the Obama administration:
The central goal of the Romney campaign over the next nine weeks will be to try to shift more of the blame, by any means necessary, to Obama.
When Dunn and Coleman were finishing work on "Cost of Livin,' " both men were convinced they had a hit on their hands. "It's just one of those rare cases where it's an honest account of an issue going on in real time," Dunn told me.
Music industry executives were surprised when "Cost of Livin' " stalled at number 19 on the billboard charts last November. No song, they thought, could have been more topical. In a lengthy examination of the sales history of "Cost of Livin,' " Pierce Greenberg of the Nashville City Paper raised the question: "Is the country radio climate still conducive to a strong, realistic representation of American struggles? Or has the notion of 'feel-good' songs hampered a core principle of country music's past?"
Dunn may be on the fence, but Hank Williams Jr. is not. Son and namesake of perhaps the most beloved country singer of all time, Williams Jr. has produced a very different reflection of the bitter and belligerent political mood of heartland America. Williams's album, "Old School, New Rules," is an explicit rejection of the narrative of displacement and loss on view in "Cost of Livin.' " Instead, Williams' hard-edged collection of 12 songs projects an unabashedly conservative message targeted directly at the 2012 election. On July 19, Williams's album reached number four on Billboard's country-and-western chart.
On "Takin' Back the Country," the album's first track, Williams, who infamously likened Obama to Hitler on Fox TV, sings:
Hey, are you ready for the good news. We're gonna take back this country. Hey, Barack pack your bags head to Chicago. Take your teleprompter with you so you'll know where to go. So move it on over. Move it on over. Move over little dog cuz the big dog's moving in.
The competing moods of "Cost of Livin' and "Taking Back the Country" will influence the Nov. 6 election. "Cost of Livin' " has a pessimistic cast. "Taking Back the Country" relies more on naked aggression. With 62 percent of respondents believing that the country is on the wrong track, according to a recent CBS News poll, pessimism will color this year's outcome no matter what. Americans express grave doubts about both candidates.
Voters in a fighting frame of mind - those for whom hatred of the enemy is key - are likely to gravitate to the candidate they see as more assertive. Voters moved by a promise "to help you and your family" may be drawn to the man who appears to offer compassion. Whoever succeeds in persuading those still sitting on the fence that he will stand with them in the trenches will almost certainly win the election.

HEADLINE: Cloud Helps Change Emerging Economies

BYLINE: By QUENTIN HARDY

 BODY:
For companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft that sell cloud computing services, the most drastic changes may be in places most of us do not see. Already, places without clean water, decent sanitation or steady electricity are using supercomputers. 
Cheki is a used-car classifieds business that serves about a million people a month, mostly in Kenya and Nigeria. Most of the one million people using the site are looking at it with Android-based smartphones that cost about $70, according to Thomas Shaw, the company's information technology manager. Imagine things in a few years, when Huawei, which makes most of the devices, gets those phone prices even lower.
This appears to be changing markets in several other countries as well. ''There are people in Malawi, Rwanda and Ethiopia looking at the cars, too,'' he says. Tariffs on cars are often high in these places, and a big market in another country may be a better way for them to buy.
Unlike the developed world, where speed, agility and cost are factors that make Amazon Web Services attractive, in the developing world it's good to be on battery-powered phones and servers in California, instead of relying on an often-brittle electric grid. ''For Westerners,'' Mr. Shaw says, ''the whole thing is a little bizarre.''
Jobberman.com, Nigeria's largest jobs and careers Web site, also runs on Amazon Web Services. So does M-Pesa, the mobile payments division of Safaricom, a mobile phone provider based in Kenya. Mobile money has become so big that the African Development Bank says the new money may be causing inflation. In South Africa, a luxury goods company called 36Boutiques uses Amazon's service for e-commerce.
In India, there is an online nationwide cab-booking service called GetMeCab that uses Amazon servers, though the closest ones are in Singapore. There are consultants who teach other businesses to use Amazon.
Amazon itself holds seminars for start-ups in India, Indonesia and many other countries, hoping to foster more consumption of advanced technology among the developing economies. So does Google, for its business applications, and it will very likely do more once its cloud computing offering, part of Google Cloud Platform, gains traction.
It's quite possible that there are even Amazon Web Services being used in the Amazon. The company operates several large data centers in Brazil.

HEADLINE: Tap-Tap-Tapping Into a National Obsession

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA LA ROCCO

 BODY:
On a Sunday morning in February -- Super Bowl Sunday, as a matter of fact -- out past the strip malls and the auto dealerships and worlds away from nearby Seattle, families streamed into the Highline Performing Arts Center in Burien, Wash., for a traditional American orgy of razzmatazz and rivalries.
There was no football paraphernalia in sight. The prodigious war paint instead revolved around hot-pink tulle and rhinestones, and the day's diminutive contestants could be easily identified by their proclivity for high-pitched, synchronized squealing and bare (at times bejeweled) midriffs. They traveled in fast-moving packs, trailed by gusts of glitter, feathers and serious-looking, rhinestone-unadorned women. At Starpower, the men were largely afterthoughts.
Four months later, at the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Queens, you could find the same color-coordinated herds of little girls motoring around the chaotic lobby in astoundingly garish makeup and sparkly headbands, their demeanor an unnerving combination of excited preteenager and blasé professional. Great screechy cheers rose up from inside the concert hall, accompanied by the thump of bass. A sign among the merchandise tables offered ''Dance videos $30 all routines.'' ''Professional Video!'' ''Excellent Quality!'' Welcome to Dancers Inc. 
Starpower and Dancers Inc. are just two of the myriad companies producing the hundreds of dance competitions across America, tapping into an abiding national affection for pageantry and contests. The industry is unregulated, and there is no single set of accepted guidelines or standards.
Typically unfolding over a few long days in auditoriums, halls and hotels -- and sometimes attached to educational activities as part of a larger convention -- these events revolve around individual and group dance numbers rehearsed by youngsters (mostly girls, though this is changing) at participating studios.
''You're going to see a lot of kids that can shuffle step for Jesus,'' Dan Barris, the executive director of Dancers Inc., said, laughing. ''But then you're going to see some kids who can quadruple pirouette, and they're well placed. And you'll see kids in transition.''
These competitions form their own distinct subculture. Yet they are also distinctly American, not so different, underneath the false eyelashes, from Little League games, and raising a host of issues revolving around class, gender and parents' aspirations for their children. As they have proliferated in recent decades, in an age when many public schools dedicate few resources to dance, they've created opportunities for youngsters who might otherwise have few chances to get onstage.
''What we do is also a performance art,'' said Joe Lanteri, the founder of New York City Dance Alliance, which operates a respected convention, offers scholarships and workshops and whose alumni perform with many prestigious companies and Broadway shows. ''You can only do it in the classroom for so long. From an educational standpoint, when the actual competition of an event is handled properly, ideally you're being adjudicated by some very talented, reputable people, who are there more as educators than adjudicators.''
Still, most competitions are strictly pay-to-play. Costs can run into the thousands per month for parents of seriously involved children.
''Competitions are a business, first and foremost,'' said Abby Lee Miller, a western Pennsylvania dance instructor and the star of the reality television show ''Dance Moms'' on Lifetime, whose portrayal of studio and competition culture, replete with petty dramas, badly behaving adults and young children driven hard to win, has prompted much hand wringing in the industry. ''If somebody was going to pay them to get onstage, hallelujah, we would do that first.''
Ms. Miller, who directs the Abby Lee Dance Company and Reign Dance Productions studio, recounted how her mother's dance students in Florida in the 1950s would get paid gigs as backup dancers when entertainers like Sammy Davis Jr. would come through town.
''Those things are not available in every small town in this country,'' Ms. Miller said. Now ''a dance competition is going to come in and charge you $80 to do a solo,'' she continued. ''And three out-of-work dancers are going to judge you.''
''Dance Moms'' has shined a spotlight on these competitions. It is among a number of popular reality shows that have brought dance into mainstream culture, attracting large audiences (averaging 2.2 million total viewers), many of whom might otherwise have little exposure to dance. The proliferation and appeal of dance on television is even, in certain cases, shifting practices within the dance world, further muddying the class divide between entertainment and art. While some choreographers have bemoaned the perceptions about their art form fostered by flashy, populist fare like the Fox show ''So You Think You Can Dance,'' dance studios have largely benefited from the increased interest in classes.
But ''Dance Moms'' typically produces cringes from the world it documents, even calls to boycott the show, particularly after an episode, eventually pulled by Lifetime, in which Ms. Miller's pupils wore showgirl outfits to a competition. This seems a Quixotic cause: Lifetime has announced that Ms. Miller will be headlining a new show, ''Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition,'' this fall, pitting 12 kids and their mothers against one another for a $100,000 prize and a scholarship to the Joffrey Ballet School. Bring on the histrionics and hair spray.
''Dance Moms'' is ''a real hot potato in the dance studio world,'' Karen White, an associate editor and writer for Dance Studio Life magazine, wrote in an e-mail, adding in an interview that owners were afraid, especially during tough economic times, that parents would send their children into other activities.
''The great majority of dance studios are nowhere near that intense,'' said Ms. White, a teacher herself whose teenage daughter dances in competitions.
But many who have come up through competition culture say that the Lifetime show captures the experience.
Jess Gersony, a Columbia University student who performs with the tap company CPD Plus, danced in competitions from junior high through her sophomore year in high school, dominating New York region contests and medaling at national events. (Unlike athletics, there is no single national champion.) She recalled mustering the courage to tell one instructor, whose classes consistently left her in tears, that she was leaving the studio.
''She locked me in a room and was just yelling at me,'' Ms. Gersony said. ''I'm in sixth grade at this point.''
Though Ms. Gersony, like many former competitive dancers, said the pressure of competitions helped her to be confident and technically strong, she views most aspects of the experience as unhealthy.
''At the time I was totally into it, totally into winning and performing for people and making people happy,'' she said, adding that she excelled at understanding what adult teachers and judges wanted. ''That's a weird thing to be learning when you are 12.''
And Ms. Gersony never had a parent pushing her. (Her mother, Jennifer Mason, said she was relieved when her daughter told her she wanted to stop.) Watching some of the choreographic routines at these competitions, it is difficult to believe that the children are in the driver's seat.
There are egregious examples of this, like a routine at a California competition in 2010 in which preadolescent girls performed highly sexualized moves to the Beyoncé hit ''Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It).'' But even in less lurid numbers there is often the disquieting sense of children being made to ape pop-culture stereotypes of adult behavior: boys as macho men, girls as sassy flirts. These portrayals seems even more bizarre when you consider that their audience is comprised largely of peers and family members. What motivates these adults?
''I do think they want what is best for their kids, or what they think is best,'' said Rob Sharenow, Lifetime's executive vice president for programming. ''I think a lot of the people who do competitive dance and get into it do see it as a way of improving the lives of their children, and there is a little bit of classist attitude toward it, for that reason, among people who are overly critical.''
Mr. Sharenow also wondered why the fathers of boys in sports didn't face such sharp scrutiny. But if there is a sexist element to the criticism against dance moms, it seems there is often far greater sexism involved in the archetypes these mothers allow their children to embody.
These issues make competitions easy targets for ridicule. Dancers who move into areas of their art form viewed as more respectable often distance themselves from their childhood pastime.
''People don't really want to talk about it,'' said Karen Schupp, an assistant professor in dance at Arizona State University. Incoming freshmen are ''proud of what they've accomplished, but yet they also feel that's something they have to put away.''
Ms. Schupp, who attended competitions as a child and is now researching a work based on those experiences, is critical of the culture but also values the camaraderie of growing up surrounded by kids who adore getting onstage. This enthusiasm and devotion are not so easily discounted. Coming off a routine at the Dancers Inc. competition in May, 13-year-old Gianni Lo Porcaro's eyes were shining beneath heavy blue makeup. Her dress was sparkly blue.
Asked what she liked about the experience, she answered without hesitation, in between high-fives with beaming family members:
''The pressure.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Firms Ready If Greeks Decide To Drop the Euro

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Even as Greece desperately tries to avoid defaulting on its debt, American companies are preparing for what was once unthinkable: that Greece could soon be forced to leave the euro zone.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch has looked into filling trucks with cash and sending them over the Greek border so clients can continue to pay local employees and suppliers in the event money is unavailable. Ford has configured its computer systems so they will be able to immediately handle a new Greek currency.
No one knows just how broad the shock waves from a Greek exit would be, but big American banks and consulting firms have also been doing a brisk business advising their corporate clients on how to prepare for a splintering of the euro zone.
That is a striking contrast to the assurances from European politicians that the crisis is manageable and that the currency union can be held together. On Thursday, the European Central Bank will consider measures that would ease pressure on Europe's cash-starved countries. 
JPMorgan Chase, though, is taking no chances. It has already created new accounts for a handful of American giants that are reserved for a new drachma in Greece or whatever currency might succeed the euro in other countries.
Stock markets around the world have rallied this summer on hopes that European leaders will solve the Continent's debt problems, but the quickening tempo of preparations by big business for a potential Greek exit this summer suggests that investors may be unduly optimistic. Many executives are deeply skeptical that Greece will accede to the austere fiscal policies being demanded by Europe in return for financial assistance.
Greece's abandonment of the euro would most likely create turmoil in global markets, which have experienced periodic sell-offs whenever Europe's debt problems have flared up over the last two and a half years. It would also increase the pressure on Italy and Spain, much larger economic powers that are struggling with debt problems of their own.
''It's safe to say most companies are preparing,'' said Paul Dennis, a program manager with Corporate Executive Board, a private advisory firm.
In a survey this summer, the firm found that 80 percent of clients polled expected Greece to leave the euro zone, and a fifth of those expected more countries to follow.
''Fifteen months ago when we started looking at this, we said it was unthinkable,'' said Heiner Leisten, a partner with the Boston Consulting Group in Cologne, Germany, who heads up its global insurance practice. ''It's not impossible or unthinkable now.''
Mr. Leisten's firm, as well as PricewaterhouseCoopers, has already considered the timing of a Greek withdrawal -- for example, the news might hit on a Friday night, when global markets are closed.
A bank holiday could quickly follow, with the stock market and most local financial institutions shutting down, while new capital controls make it hard to move money in and out of the country.
''We've had conversations with several dozen companies and we're doing work for a number of these,'' said Peter Frank, who advises corporate treasurers as a principal at Pricewaterhouse. ''Almost all of that has come in over the transom in the last 90 days.''
He added: ''Companies are asking some very granular questions, like 'If a news release comes out on a Friday night announcing that Greece has pulled out of the euro, what do we do?' In some cases, companies have contingency plans in place, such as having someone take a train to Athens with 50,000 euros to pay employees.''
The recent wave of preparations by American companies for a Greek exit from the euro signals a stark switch from their stance in the past, said Carole Berndt, head of global transaction services in Europe, the Middle East and Africa for Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
''When we started giving advice, they came for the free sandwiches and chocolate cookies,'' she said jokingly. ''Now that has changed, and contingency planning is focused on three primary scenarios -- a single-country exit, a multicountry exit and a breakup of the euro zone in its entirety.''
Banks and consulting firms are reluctant to name clients, and many big companies also declined to discuss their contingency plans, fearing it could anger customers in Europe if it became known they were contemplating the euro's demise.
Central banks, as well as Germany's finance ministry, have also been considering the implications of a Greek exit but have been even more secretive about specific plans.
But some corporations are beginning to acknowledge they are ready if Greece or even additional countries leave the euro zone, making sure systems can handle a quick transition to a new currency.
In Europe, the holding company for Iberia Airlines and British Airways has acknowledged it is preparing plans in the event of a euro exit by Spain.
''We've looked at many scenarios, including where one or more countries decides to redenominate,'' said Roger Griffith, who oversees global settlement and customer risk for MasterCard. ''We have defined operating steps and communications steps to take.'' He added: ''Practically, we could make a change in a day or two and be prepared in terms of our systems.''
In a statement, Visa said that it too would also be able to make ''a swift transition to a new currency with the minimum possible disruption to consumers and retailers.''
Juniper Networks, a provider of networking technology based in California, created a ''Euro Zone Crisis Assessment and Contingency Plan,'' which company officials liken to the kind of business continuity plans they maintain in the event of an earthquake.
''It's about having an awareness versus having to scramble,'' said Catherine Portman, vice president for treasury at Juniper. The company has already begun moving funds in euro zone banks to accounts elsewhere more frequently, while making sure it has adequate money and liquidity in place so employees and suppliers are paid without disruption.
FMC, a chemical giant based in Philadelphia, is asking some Greek customers to pay in advance, rather than risk selling to them now and not getting paid later. It has also begun to avoid keeping any excess cash in Greek, Spanish or Italian bank accounts, while carefully monitoring the creditworthiness of customers in those countries.
''It's been a very hot topic,'' said Thomas C. Deas Jr., an FMC executive who serves as chairman of the National Association of Corporate Treasurers. Members of his group discussed the issue on a conference call last Tuesday, he added.
American companies have actually been more aggressive about seeking out advice than their European counterparts, according to John Gibbons, head of treasury services in Europe for JPMorgan Chase.
Mr. Gibbons said a handful of the largest American companies had requested the special accounts configured for a currency that did not yet exist.
''We're planning against the extreme,'' he said. ''You don't lose anything by doing it.''

HEADLINE: A 'Love Song to the South' Claws Its Way Back From the Brink

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Among the many magazines that were battered by the recession, few survived such a precarious financial state as Garden & Gun.
In 2009, the two-year-old Southern lifestyle magazine lost financial support from its first publisher. Its employees, many of whom had relocated from New York City to work here, were left with dwindling buyout packages and the promise of freelance pay. Real estate developers could no longer afford to buy advertisements, and some new prospects said they would not give a cent to the magazine until the owners took ''gun'' out of its title.
David DiBenedetto, the editor in chief, recalled that when the magazine's color printer broke, the staff did not have the money to replace it for two months. They had to print out proofs at a nearby Kinko's.
''You didn't know if you would be there the next week,'' Mr. DiBenedetto said as he picked over a lunch of peach soup, fried green tomatoes and catfish at Charleston's Husk restaurant. He and his wife moved here from New York so he could work at Garden & Gun. ''You just didn't know if the lights would be on.'' 
It did not help that Garden & Gun's spare layouts and meandering prose differed radically from the shorter, flashier articles many magazines were moving toward to compete with Facebook and Twitter.
But now, its provocative name and contrarian approach seem to be paying off in a struggling magazine industry. The bimonthly won a 2011 American Society of Magazine Editors award for general excellence, and its editors have a three-book deal with HarperCollins to publish a Southern guide, a collection of dog columns and a cookbook.
With advertisers like Audi, Le Creuset and Brooks Brothers on board, the magazine's owners forecast that it could be profitable for the first time this year. While circulation is slipping across the magazine industry, Garden & Gun's circulation grew to 237,837 subscribers in December 2011 from 210,172 the year before, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
The magazine, based out of a 200-year-old former pharmacy on Charleston's historic King Street, was founded as what Jessica Hundhausen Derrick, its vice president and brand development director, described as ''a love song to the South.''
It included articles about backyard gin makers, woodworkers crafting chairs from whiskey barrels, and Southern produce like Georgia rattlesnake watermelon. Among the lighter pieces by authors like Roy Blount Jr., there were richly detailed articles like the one from a lifelong friend of Eudora Welty describing how the author feared that if her dead mother saw her cook, ''she'd weep with shame.''
And to feed advertisers' anxieties, nearly every issue featured unapologetic articles in praise of hunting. There were essays on quail hunts, hunting clubs and hunting dogs, often written with an emphasis on land preservation and basking in sumptuous photo spreads to rival Vogue or National Geographic.
But the magazine has also taken a very modern approach to publishing. It began the Garden & Gun Club, which offers subscribers retail discounts and access to private concerts and talks. So far, 3,000 subscribers are paying $35 to $500 a year for one of three membership levels.
The magazine is holding 30 events this year, including a ''Lowcountry Field Feast'' in South Carolina, a golf event in Georgia and a New Orleans beer festival this fall. It also sells its own merchandise, like a limited-edition Garden & Gun hunting tie and, for the coming holidays, a Le Creuset dish in gunmetal gray.
These kinds of initiatives depend heavily on loyal readers, which Garden & Gun has in abundance. Subscribers knock on the door daily to introduce themselves. Readers write in about how they tested the Southern road trips and dive bars the magazine recommended. One reader even threatened to hunt down the editors and shoot them if they stopped publishing -- which the editors emphasize was in jest.
During Mr. DiBenedetto's lunch at Husk, he attracted more attention from diners and kitchen staff than the senior officials from the Homeland Security Department noisily taking up the restaurant's back corner.
''It is probably my favorite magazine,'' said Andrew Hastings, a 28-year-old hunter and fisherman from Little Rock, Ark., who, while dining at Husk, recognized Mr. DiBenedetto from his editor's note photo.
The magazine grew out of a conversation between two parents in a Charleston kindergarten class. The first parent, Rebecca Wesson Darwin, was a native of Columbia, S.C., and a former New Yorker publisher who relocated to Charleston in 2004 because her husband accepted a job as senior pastor at the Second Presbyterian Church.
The second parent was Pierre Manigault, chairman of the Evening Post Publishing Company, which publishes the local paper. Mr. Manigault's ancestors were Huguenots who moved to Charleston in the 17th century and shifted their fortunes into the newspaper business with the decline of rice farming.
At first, Ms. Darwin talked to Mr. Manigault about starting a local magazine. But she quickly decided there was a greater need for ''a national magazine about a region.''
Mr. Manigault's friend and Garden & Gun's first editor in chief, John Wilson, suggested the title after taking a date to Hank's Restaurant in Charleston and learning that it used to be a gay bar called the Garden and Gun Club.
Ms. Darwin had never hunted and no longer had time for gardening after moving to Charleston. But as she sat behind her desk in her sunlit office on King Street, framed by photographs of her children, she said she liked that Garden & Gun was ''a bold name'' and ''a metaphor for the sporting life.'' The title reminded her of working at GQ, and she said she might someday shorten it to G&G.
The first issue made its debut on newsstands in spring 2007, days before the shootings at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va. But Garden & Gun's popularity grew steadily that year, and readers wrote long, impassioned letters to the editor.
By fall 2008, newspaper executives said they could no longer afford the magazine. Ms. Darwin and Mr. Manigault negotiated a deal to buy it from them and started making trip after trip to banks for temporary loans.
Ms. Darwin, who ran the daily operations, told employees they could stay and come to work as freelancers. She did not have the money to print or mail an October/November issue and instead wrote an apology letter to readers. She avoided asking private equity groups for help because she feared they would sell the magazine quickly.
The employees who remained worked together to keep the magazine afloat, taking out the trash because they could not afford support staff and finding backup editing jobs to pay their own bills. They relied on readers' e-mails and letters for emotional support.
''There was no guarantee that the magazine was going to survive,'' said Sid Evans, who was Garden & Gun's editor in chief from 2008 to 2011 before moving to Time Inc. ''But there are a lot of people out there who love a good read. They love being in the hands of a good writer and the insights those writers have.''
By May 2010, J. Edward Bell III, a lawyer from Georgetown, S.C., had become a major investor and the third co-owner along with Ms. Darwin and Mr. Manigault. Mr. Bell, who discovered the magazine when a country songwriter gave him a copy to read on a flight back from Colorado, said he was ''instantly hooked'' because ''it reminds me of growing up in the South.''
Since then, Garden & Gun has had a slow but steady rise. Ms. Darwin brought back most of her staff. In early 2010, she hired Barbara Bing, an Atlanta-based publisher who had worked on sales for magazines like The New Yorker and Esquire, to build a national sales team. Ms. Bing refused requests by advertisers to change the name and said she hoped to increase circulation to 500,000.
She said she thought there were plenty more readers out there. While 55 percent of the magazine's readers come from the Southeast, the rest come from other parts of the nation. Judging by the letters page, many of them are displaced Southerners or people who have married Southerners and fallen in love with the places their spouses have described.
''You don't have to be Southern and you don't have to live in the South to appreciate Garden & Gun,'' Ms. Bing said. ''But you do have to have the time to read.''

HEADLINE: A Free Online University Tests the Waters

BYLINE: By D. D. GUTTENPLAN

 BODY:
After a lifetime in business and academia, Shai Reshef finally found something he could not do: retire.
So in 2009, Mr. Reshef, an Israeli-born entrepreneur, founded University of the People, an online school offering a four-year U.S.-style undergraduate education for free. The institution, based in Pasadena, California, has admitted 1,500 students from 132 countries.
While most of its initial financing came from Mr. Reshef, it has since drawn the support of organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and corporations like Hewlett Packard.
The teachers, many from top universities, are all volunteers. The provost, David Harris Cohen, was vice president of Columbia University. Last year, New York University agreed that students who successfully finished their first year at University of the People would be eligible to apply to N.Y.U. Abu Dhabi, where they would complete their education free if accepted. 
Mr. Reshef described his campaign to ''open the gates of higher education to those who cannot afford it.''
Q. How did you get started?
A. I looked around and saw that everything that was needed was already available for free. All I had to do was bring it together.
I mean open source technology, available for anyone to use for free; open educational resources; content that people produce and put on the Internet for everyone to use. And the new Internet culture of social networking, where people share, teach and learn from each other for free.
Q. Can students study any subject?
A. No. We offer only business administration and computer science degrees. These are the two programs that are most likely to help people find a better job, and that's what our students want. They want a better chance for the future.
But also, which is just as important for us, these two programs are global. Our program is 40 courses long. And every time a student takes a class they are put together with 25 students from 25 countries.
Imagine what happens when students from India and Pakistan study together. They learn to know each other, to respect each other. Instead of being enemies outside of the class, they become friends. We believe that by doing so we make peace a bit closer.
Q. What about the instructors?
A. For our 1,500 students we have 2,900 volunteer professors who jumped on board to help our students -- a ratio of about two professors for every student. I don't think there are many universities with this ratio.
Q. What do students pay?
A. When they apply, students have to pay an application fee, which ranges from $10 to $50 depending on the gross domestic product of their country of residence. For example, the United States would be $50. So would the United Kingdom and Japan.
Q. What are some $10 countries?
A. South Sudan, Ethiopia, Nepal. If they don't have it, we waive it. But starting in September we are also asking our students to pay for exams. While we waive 95 percent of the cost of higher education, we want the program to become financially sustainable. An exam costs us $100 to administer and grade. But if a student can't afford that, he or she can go to our micro-scholarship portal.
Q. Explain the micro-scholarship portal.
A. We are the second largest university on Facebook after Harvard, which obviously means we should try harder, right? What we are trying to do there is to tell them, ''Please help our students, some of them can't even afford the $100 for an exam.'' Let's say a student needs $500. This will come from small amounts of $5 or $10 rather than a single donation. Also there will be a direct connection between the students and the donors.
Q. How does the teaching work?
A. When students sign up for a class they are put together with students from 20 or more different countries. They study together for 10 weeks. When they go into the ''classroom,'' the first thing that they see is the profile of their fellow students, which is very similar to a Facebook profile. Then they find the lecture notes for the week, the reading assignment for the week and the homework assignment. They also find the discussion question of the week.
The discussion question is the core of our studies. Let's say the first student is Chinese. Just because the morning starts earlier in China, so he will go into the classroom, read the material, see the discussion question and post his own original contribution to the discussion. Let's say that the second student is Indonesian and she does the same thing. But she decides to comment on what the Chinese student said.
Every week each student is expected to make one original contribution. The instructor reads everything going on in the classroom, but gets involved only if the peer-to-peer learning doesn't work as well as it should. For example, if a student asks a question and none of their fellow students was able to answer it. Or a student says something wrong and nobody corrected him or her.
At the end of the week the students take a quiz to see if they have mastered the material. They hand in their homework, which is assigned randomly to peers and graded by them, under the supervision of an instructor. They get a grade, start a new topic next week. At the end of 10 weeks they take a final exam and go on to the next course
Currently, you are in the process of applying for accreditation from an agency recognized by the U.S. government. What difference will being accredited make?
A. We are talking about students from the entire world. Having said that, most of our students, be they American or from developing countries, appreciate the American higher education system. They want to study in an American university. And our students want us to be accredited. Accreditation means, for a student, both that it's a legitimate institution and that they will find a job. All over the world people are worried about this phenomenon of diploma mills. And people are afraid of institutions which are not legitimate. And I think that they are right. Because accreditation is a stamp of quality.
Q. What distinguishes University of the People from other online universities like P2P University ?
A. That's a good question, but I would even broaden it to include the new phenomenon where Harvard and M.I.T. give away their courses for free online to hundreds of thousands of people.
We are not doing this just for the sake of the knowledge. We are offering a degree program. P2P is a great thing for people who are seeking knowledge. People can study any subject they want. But that is not a diploma. The same goes for Harvard and Stanford putting their courses online. These are courses that hundreds of thousands of people take, and great professors teach them. But people do not get credit for them.
Q. What are some of the factors behind limiting the number of students?
A. It's less than three years since we started teaching our first students. So while we are done developing all the courses, we're still working on strengthening our academic quality. We want to make sure that the quality is there. And that whatever is needed to give good service to our students is also there before we start to grow faster.
Every 10 weeks we accept another 100 students. We'll do that for the next few terms, until we feel completely confident about our academic base, and about our ability to grow, and at that point we'll start to grow much faster.

HEADLINE: Aliens With Dance Moves And the Midas Touch

BYLINE: By ANDY WEBSTER

 BODY:
There might be a utopian vision inside Shirish Kunder's ''Joker,'' a Bollywood comedy about establishing contact with extraterrestrials. But if so, it's buried under a mountain of static. 
In California the scientist Agastya (Akshay Kumar) has spent years employing a kind of high-tech radio to send communications signals into space, but no aliens are biting. Now his backers threaten to pull the plug.
Then Agastya is called to his hometown, Paglapur, a fictional place on the Pakistan-India border never claimed by either country because it was founded by insane-asylum escapees. His father is said to be ill, but it turns out that Agastya, accompanied by his girlfriend, Diva (Sonakshi Sinha), is needed to save Paglapur from economic hardship.
In the hopes of attracting investment to his home, he makes up several ploys to draw news media attention, abetted by the locals, a gallery of overdrawn caricatures (including Shreyas Talpade as his brother, Babban, literally speaking in gibberish). The stratagems -- fake crop circles; dressing as aliens and putting on a show for the camera crews; and, apparently, musical production numbers -- grow desperate, much like the humor.
Three countries want business with Paglapur, and for a second the suggestion of a free Kashmir comes to mind, with a secular philosophy. (''This is my god,'' Agastya says of his quest.) But that's where the idealism ends. When a real alien visits (one with dance moves), it solves Paglapur's problems by finding oil there. Another global hot spot generating fossil fuels? I thought Bollywood comedies had happy endings.
Joker
Opened on Friday nationwide.
Written, directed and edited by Shirish Kunder; directors of photography, Sudeep Chatterjee and Anay Goswami; music by G. V. Prakash Kumar and Gaurav Dagaonkar; choreography by Farah Khan; production design by Samir Chanda and Shashank Tere; costumes by Rick Roy and Uma Biju; produced by Ms. Khan; released by the Hari Om Entertainment Company and UTV Motion Pictures. In Hindi, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 40 minutes. This film is not rated.
WITH: Akshay Kumar (Agastya), Sonakshi Sinha (Diva), Shreyas Talpade (Babban) and Minissha Lamba (Anya).

HEADLINE: Rev. Sun Myung Moon, Founder of the Unification Church, Dies at 92

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
The Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the Korean evangelist, businessman and self-proclaimed messiah who built a religious movement notable for its mass weddings, fresh-faced proselytizers and links to vast commercial interests, died on Monday in Gapyeong, South Korea. He was 92.
His death was announced on his church's Web site, which said he had been battling complications from pneumonia, including kidney failure.
Mr. Moon courted world leaders, financed newspapers and founded numerous innocuously named civic organizations. To his critics, he pursued those activities mainly to lend legitimacy to his movement, known as the Unification Church, although his methods were sometimes questionable. In 2004, for example, he had himself crowned ''humanity's savior'' in front of astonished members of Congress at a Capitol Hill luncheon.
Mr. Moon was a leading figure in what Eileen V. Barker, a professor emeritus of sociology at the London School of Economics, called ''the great wave of new religious movements and alternative religiosity in the 1960s and 1970s in the West,'' a time when the Hare Krishna and Transcendental Meditation movements were also gathering force. 
Mr. Moon, said Professor Barker, an expert on new religious movements, was ''very important in those days -- as far as the general culture was concerned -- in the fear of cults and sects.''
Building a business empire in South Korea and Japan, Mr. Moon used his commercial interests to support nonprofit ventures, then kept control of them by placing key insiders within their hierarchies. He avidly backed right-wing causes, turning The Washington Times into a respected newspaper in conservative circles.
An ardent anti-Communist who had been imprisoned by the Communist authorities in northern Korea in the 1940s, he saw the United States as the world's salvation. But in the late 1990s, after financial losses, defections and stagnant growth in the church's membership, he turned on America, branding it a repository of immorality -- ''Satan's harvest'' -- and repositioned his movement as a crusade for moral values.
As Mr. Moon approached 90, not long after he survived a helicopter crash in 2008, three of his sons and a daughter began assuming more responsibility for running the church and his holdings.
In its early years in the United States, the Unification Church was widely viewed as little more than a cult, one whose polite, well-scrubbed members, known derisively as Moonies, sold flowers and trinkets on street corners and married in mass weddings. In one of the last such events, in 2009, 10,000 couples exchanged or renewed vows before Mr. Moon at Sun Moon University near Seoul.
A Focus on Marriage
Such weddings were the activity most associated with Mr. Moon in the United States. They were in keeping with a central tenet of his theology, a mix of Eastern philosophy, biblical teachings and what he called God's revelations to him.
In the church's view, Jesus had failed in his mission to purify mankind because he was crucified before being able to marry and have children. Mr. Moon saw himself as completing the unfulfilled task of Jesus: to restore humankind to a state of perfection by producing sinless children, and by blessing couples who would produce them.
Marriage was a key part of achieving salvation, and for a couple the marriage was as much a commitment to the church as it was to each other.
In a ceremony involving 2,075 couples at Madison Square Garden in 1982, for example, the men wore identical blue suits and the women lace and satin gowns. Mr. Moon was said to have made the matches, based on questionnaires, photographs and the recommendations of church officials.
Often the couples had met only weeks earlier or could speak to each other only through an interpreter. Many had to remain separated for several years, doing church work, before they were allowed to consummate the unions.
Mr. Moon struggled against bad publicity. He was sent to prison on tax evasion charges and accused of influence-buying and of maintaining ties to the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. He denied both allegations. In the late 1970s he was caught up in a Congressional investigation into attempts by South Korea to influence American policy. There were battles with local officials over zoning for church buildings and tax-exempt status.
As his church grew more prominent in the 1970s and '80s, it became embroiled in lawsuits over soliciting funds, acquiring property and recruiting followers. Defectors wrote damaging books. From 1973 to 1986 at least 400 of the church's flock were abducted by their family members to undergo ''deprogramming,'' according to an estimate by David G. Bromley, a professor of sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University and an expert on Mr. Moon. The church denied that it had brainwashed its followers, saying members joined and stayed of their own free will.
Mr. Moon said he was the victim of religious oppression and ethnic bias because of his Korean heritage. Established churches were angered, he said, because they felt threatened by his movement.
''I don't blame those people who call us heretics,'' he was quoted as saying in ''Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church'' (1977), a sympathetic account by Frederick Sontag. ''We are indeed heretics in their eyes because the concept of our way of life is revolutionary: We are going to liberate God.''
Prominent people were paid to appear at Moon-linked conferences. The first President George Bush did so after he left office. Others, like former President Gerald R. Ford, Bill Cosby, Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Jack Kemp, attended banquets and gatherings, sometimes saying later that they had not known of a connection between Mr. Moon and the organizations that invited them.
Personal setbacks marked Mr. Moon's later years. In 1984, a son, Heung Jin, died at 17 from injuries sustained in a car crash. Another son, Young Jin Moon, who was 21, committed suicide in 1999 by jumping from a 17th-story balcony at Harrah's hotel in Reno, Nev. In 1995 Nansook Hong, the wife of his eldest son, Hyo Jin Moon, who at one time was Mr. Moon's heir apparent, broke from the family and wrote a book characterizing her husband as a womanizing cocaine user who watched pornographic movies and beat her, once when she was seven months pregnant.
Ms. Hong portrayed the entire Moon family as dysfunctional, spoiled and divided by intrigue and hypocrisy. (She also wrote that the church believed that the spirit of Heung Jin had returned for a time in the body of a Zimbabwean man who traveled the world and, with Mr. Moon's sanction, beat straying church members.)
From early on Mr. Moon was revered by his followers as the messiah, and in 1992 he conferred that title on himself. He also declared that he and his second wife, Hak Ja Han, were the ''true parents of all humanity.''
Mr. Moon founded the Unification Church in South Korea in 1954 and began organizing it on a large scale in the United States in the early 1970s. It eventually claimed up to three million members worldwide, but historians of religion dispute that number, estimating a membership of 50,000 at the church's height in the late 1970s, with only a few thousand in the United States. Membership has been difficult to evaluate more recently; church officials give different estimates and often define membership differently, according to an individual's level of involvement.
Building an Empire
Mr. Moon's organizations established connections with African-American religious leaders, and he made forays into culture and education, establishing a ballet company in South Korea and financing a ballet school in Washington. In 1992 an organization with ties to Mr. Moon rescued the University of Bridgeport, in Connecticut, from bankruptcy, pouring in $110 million in subsidies over a decade and taking effective control. Mr. Moon received an honorary degree.
The university's administration denied that the church had influence, but critics of the arrangement contended that students were being lured into church training with the promise of scholarships, noted that the church had opened a boarding school on campus for members' children, and said that the church had used the university to import money, in the form of tuition, as well as followers, in the form of the many foreign students who attended.
For a time Mr. Moon lived in an 18-acre compound in Irvington, N.Y., which Ms. Hong described as having a ballroom, two dining rooms (one with a pond and waterfall), a kitchen with six pizza ovens and a bowling alley upstairs. The church owned another estate, Belvedere, in nearby Tarrytown. Farther north along the Hudson River, the church founded the Unification Theological Seminary in Barrytown, N.Y. On its Web site, it sometimes is referred to as ''U.T.S.: The Interfaith Seminary.'' Mr. Moon's business ventures in South Korea at one time or another included construction, hospitals, schools, ski resorts, newspapers, auto parts, pharmaceuticals, beverages and a professional soccer team. He also had commercial interests in Japan, where right-wing nationalist donors were said to be one source of financing.
In the United States, Mr. Moon had interests in commercial fishing, jewelry, fur products, construction and real estate. He bought many properties in the New York area, including the New Yorker Hotel in Midtown Manhattan and the Manhattan Center nearby.
At one time or another he controlled newspapers including Noticias del Mundo and The New York City Tribune; four publications in South Korea; a newspaper in Japan, The Sekai Nippo; The Middle East Times in Greece; Tiempos del Mundo in Argentina; and Últimas Noticias in Uruguay. In 2000, a church affiliate bought what was left of United Press International.
The extent of his holdings was somewhat of a mystery, but one figure gives a clue: Mr. Moon acknowledged that in the two decades since the founding of The Washington Times in 1982, he pumped in more than $1 billion in subsidies to keep it going.
The church said its various operations earned tens of millions of dollars a year worldwide.
In their book ''Cults and New Religions'' (2006), Mr. Bromley and Douglas E. Cowan wrote that according to church doctrine, a member ''recognizes Moon's messianic status, agrees to contribute to the payment of personal indemnity for human sinfulness, and looks forward to receiving the marital Blessing and building a restored world of sinless families.''
Self-Proclaimed Messiah
Sun Myung Moon was born on Jan. 6, 1920, in a small rural town in what is now North Korea, according to his official biography. When he was 10, his family joined the Presbyterian Church. When he was a teenager, around Easter 1935, according to Unification Church lore, Jesus appeared to him and anointed him God's choice to establish the kingdom of heaven on earth.
A secular education beckoned, and in 1941 Mr. Moon entered Waseda University in Japan, where he studied electrical engineering. Two years later he returned to Korea and married Sun Kil Choi, who bore him a son. In 1946, leaving them behind, he moved to Pyongyang, now the capital of North Korea, to found the Kwang-Ya Church, a predecessor of the Unification Church. He was imprisoned by the Communist authorities, and later said that they had tortured him.
He was freed in 1950 -- by United Nations forces, his official biography says -- and was said to have walked 320 miles to Pusan, on the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula. There, as the account goes, he built a church with United States Army ration boxes and lived in a mountainside shack.
Despite the centrality of marriage in his developing theology, Mr. Moon divorced Ms. Choi in 1952 (something that was glossed over in the official biography) and the following year moved to Seoul, where he founded the Unification Church in 1954. Within a year, about 30 church centers had sprung up.
Before the decade was out, he published ''The Divine Principle,'' a dense exposition of his theology that has been revised several times; in her book, Ms. Hong, his daughter-in-law, said it was written by an early disciple based on Mr. Moon's notes and conversation. He sent his first church emissaries to Japan, the source of early growth, and the United States, and began building his Korean business empire.
Rumors of sexual relations with disciples, which the church denied, dogged the young evangelist, and he fathered a child in 1954. In 1960, Mr. Moon married the 17-year-old Hak Ja Han, who would bear him 13 children and be anointed ''true parent.''
He embarked on world tours over the next decade and in 1972 settled in the United States, seeing it as the promised land for church growth. ''I came to America primarily to declare the New Age and new truth,'' he is quoted as saying in the book ''Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church.''
He took an interest in politics, urging that President Richard M. Nixon be forgiven for his role in the Watergate crisis. Church leaders plotted a strategy to defend the president and held rallies in support of Nixon that drew thousands to Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden and the National Mall.
Mr. Moon's interests expanded into film when a church-linked company backed the 1982 movie ''Inchon,'' a $42 million Korean War epic notable for bad reviews and the casting of Laurence Olivier as Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
A Litany of Scandals
In the late 1970s, Mr. Moon came under the scrutiny of federal authorities, mainly over allegations that he was involved in efforts by the South Korean government to bribe members of Congress to support President Park Chung-hee. A Congressional subcommittee said there was evidence of ties between Mr. Moon and Korean intelligence, and that the church had raised money and moved it across borders in violation of immigration and local charity laws.
Then, in October 1981, Mr. Moon was named in a 12-count federal indictment. He was accused of failing to report $150,000 in income from 1973 to 1975, a sum consisting of interest from $1.6 million that he had deposited in New York bank accounts in his own name, according to the indictment.
''I would not be standing here today if my skin were white and my religion were Presbyterian,'' Mr. Moon said after the charges were announced. ''I am here today only because my skin is yellow and my religion is Unification Church.''
He called the case a government conspiracy to force him out of the country.
Mr. Moon was convicted the next year of tax fraud and conspiracy to obstruct justice and sentenced to 18 months in prison. He was assigned to kitchen duty.
As his church's fortunes declined in the United States, Mr. Moon revised his pro-American views. In a 1997 speech, he said America had ''persecuted'' him. He also attacked homosexuals and American women.
Mr. Moon and his church largely dropped from public view in the late '90s and 2000s, but once in a while they attracted attention. In 2001, a Roman Catholic archbishop from Zambia, Emmanuel Milingo, married a Korean woman in a multiple wedding performed by Mr. Moon. The archbishop then renounced the union.
One of the more bizarre moments in Mr. Moon's later years came on March 23, 2004, at what was described as a peace awards banquet, held at the Dirksen Senate Office Building in Washington. Members of Congress were among the guests. At one point Representative Danny K. Davis, an Illinois Democrat, wearing white gloves, carried in on a pillow one of two gold crowns that were placed on Mr. Moon and his wife.
Some of the members of Congress said they had no idea that Mr. Moon was to be involved in the banquet, though it was hosted by the Interreligious and International Federation for World Peace, a foundation affiliated with the Unification Church.
At the banquet, Mr. Moon said emperors, kings and presidents had ''declared to all heaven and earth that Reverend Sun Myung Moon is none other than humanity's savior, messiah, returning lord and true parent.''
He added that the founders of the world's great religions, along with figures like Marx, Lenin, Hitler and Stalin, had ''found strength in my teachings, mended their ways and been reborn as new persons.''

HEADLINE: Football's Future Rests on Parents as Much as Players

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Sherman Howard, 87, played professional football for five years and was a longtime high school coach in Chicago. ''The biggest problem you have now is in coaching,'' he said. ''I don't think the kids now have the best of coaching.''
Crystal McCrary, 42, an author and television producer, will not let her 12-year-old son play football. ''I'm not a football fan, I don't come from football country, I have not been brought up in an environment where football, culturally, means a great deal to me,'' she said.
Troy Vincent, 42, who competed in the N.F.L. for 15 seasons, has three sons who play football with his blessing. ''I encourage them to play,'' he said. ''Any male in my household plays football.'' 
Howard, McCrary and Vincent have little in common except concern about the safety of young people playing football. But their divergent points of view reflect intensifying debates on that issue and a larger issue for the N.F.L.: continuing to attract the raw material for a multibillion-dollar industry as health and safety concerns become increasingly pronounced.
When Howard began playing football as a senior at Wendell Phillips High School in Chicago in 1941, and even when he was my coach at Harlan High from 1964 to 1968, he knew little about concussions and the long-term health effects of repeated collisions. Few people did, and if they did, they weren't talking.
Howard and his wife, Jeanette, have a son, Sherwin, now 29, who played in high school and then at Louisville for a year. Asked whether he would allow his son to play football if he knew then what he knows now, Howard said, ''I'd be hesitant.''
Howard, who emphasized even in the 1960s that tacklers should use their shoulders and not lead with the head, said he would pay ''more attention to who is coaching him.''
''The coaching at the youth level is often terrible,'' he said.
Howard said that if he were able to play now, he probably still would.
''I'd be like everybody else,'' he said. ''If I was 22 years old and they offered me a contract for two and a half-million dollars, I wouldn't be thinking of what's going to happen to me in 20 years. I wouldn't care about the future.''
Howard played for the New York Yankees, the New York Yanks and the Cleveland Browns from 1949 to 1953. Outside of an arthritic shoulder and knee, Howard said he was in pretty good shape, although he has seen so many he played with wither away: Joe Perry, John Henry Johnson, Ollie Matson.
''In their later years, the injuries took their toll on them,'' he said. ''You watch them deteriorate. They say in his last few years, Ollie Matson didn't know who he was.''
It is becoming increasingly difficult for parents to put their children on the football field precisely because of what we know.
McCrary and her ex-husband, the former N.B.A. player and current television analyst Greg Anthony, are in lock step about refusing to let their 12-year-old son, Cole, play football. He is an accomplished basketball player and all-around athlete who coaches say would make an outstanding football player. Mother and son have gone back and forth on football.
''He says, 'I want to play football, I want to play football, and you can't stop me,' '' she recalled. ''I said: 'Oh yes I can. As long as you're in my house, you can't play football.' He said that he'll play when he goes to college. I tell him it'll be too late.''
McCrary said her unwavering refusal to allow Cole to play was based on the emerging studies about the connection between football and brain injuries.
''I know too much,'' she said, adding, ''Parents who have done the research and have read, those are the ones who have come to the conclusion that they're not letting them play football.''
If parents knew the kind of brain damage their children could sustain, McCrary said, ''they would not let their kids play.''
The more options a family has, the less attractive football may become, except where college scholarships are involved. Then there are parental ego and male vanity.
Jeanette Howard was a physical education instructor for 40 years. Three former students played pro football. She had no problem allowing her son, Sherwin, to play.
''I think most females would probably say, 'No,' while most men probably say, 'Go on and let him play,' because women are a little more fearful for their children where men have a tendency to say, 'I'm going to make a man out of him,' '' she said.
Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, knows there are concerns. During a discussion at West Point last week to announce a joint venture with the Army to explore concussions, Goodell was asked what he would tell parents who are on the fence about allowing their children to play football.
''It's a personal decision,'' he said. ''A large part of this is making sure they are properly supervised. I want to know who is supervising them, how well trained are they.''
The reality is that while coaching at the college and pro levels more often than not is competent, the quality of coaching becomes more uneven the further down the sports food chain one goes.
Very young players are willing to run through brick walls -- another reason McCrary does not want her son to play.
''If Cole started playing football, I don't doubt that he'd be an excellent player,'' she said. ''What concerns me is that he wouldn't know how to turn it off. He'd be that kid who would run down nonstop and take somebody out, no fear, and crack his neck.'''
McCrary was born and raised in Detroit and attended the University of Michigan. She likes boxing. ''I enjoy watching Floyd Mayweather fight as much as anybody else,'' she said. ''I enjoy football games.''
But the equation changes when participation hits close to home. ''It does change when it's your own child and when you know all of the facts -- at least the facts as they are emerging,'' she said.
Football, at its essence, is a collision game, with a virtually 100 percent chance of injury eventually.
''Football is not for everyone,'' said Vincent, who was a Pro Bowl cornerback and now has neck, leg and back problems.
What about the studies and research? Vincent, the N.F.L.'s vice president of player engagement and a former president of the N.F.L. Players Association, acknowledged that there were risks in football and other sports but said: ''As a football player, the rewards outweigh the risks. We're still in the research phase to show how much brain injury is related to football; that still has not yet been determined.''
Vincent said that since his retirement, he has become much more astute about injuries.
''Now I have an opportunity to educate my kids properly and develop them the way they're supposed to be developed,'' he said.
There is an economic factor as well: football has allowed many to live the materialistic version of the American dream who never would have been able to. ''It's a game that's been good to me, on and off the field; I love it,'' Vincent said.
For all of the talk about the physical toll of football, the most imposing challenge for the N.F.L. will be moral issues as parents decide whether their children should play the game. As more studies are completed and more high-profile players experience postcareer complications, the industry and parents are faced with ethical questions: How can football executives continue to sell the game? How can fans continue to watch? And how can parents continue to allow their children to play?

HEADLINE: When Capitalists Cared

BYLINE: By HEDRICK SMITH. 
Hedrick Smith, a former correspondent and Washington bureau chief of The New York Times, is the author of ''Who Stole the American Dream?''

 BODY:
Washington
IN the rancorous debate over how to get the sluggish economy moving, we have forgotten the wisdom of Henry Ford. In 1914, not long after the Ford Motor Company came out with the Model T, Ford made the startling announcement that he would pay his workers the unheard-of wage of $5 a day.
Not only was it a matter of social justice, Ford wrote, but paying high wages was also smart business. When wages are low, uncertainty dogs the marketplace and growth is weak. But when pay is high and steady, Ford asserted, business is more secure because workers earn enough to become good customers. They can afford to buy Model Ts. 
This is not to suggest that Ford single-handedly created the American middle class. But he was one of the first business leaders to articulate what economists call ''the virtuous circle of growth'': well-paid workers generating consumer demand that in turn promotes business expansion and hiring. Other executives bought his logic, and just as important, strong unions fought for rising pay and good benefits in contracts like the 1950 ''Treaty of Detroit'' between General Motors and the United Auto Workers.
Riding the dynamics of the virtuous circle, America enjoyed its best period of sustained growth in the decades after World War II, from 1945 to 1973, even though income tax rates were far higher than today. It created not only unprecedented middle-class prosperity but also far greater economic equality than today.
The chief executives of the long postwar boom believed that business success and workers' well-being ran in tandem.
Frank W. Abrams, chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey, voiced the corporate mantra of ''stakeholder capitalism'': the need to balance the interests of all the stakeholders in the corporate family. ''The job of management,'' he wrote, ''is to maintain an equitable and working balance among the claims of the various directly affected interest groups,'' which he defined as ''stockholders, employees, customers and the public at large.''
Earl S. Willis, a manager of employee benefits at General Electric, declared that ''the employee who can plan his economic future with reasonable certainty is an employer's most productive asset.''
From 1948 to 1973, the productivity of all nonfarm workers nearly doubled, as did average hourly compensation. But things changed dramatically starting in the late 1970s. Although productivity increased by 80.1 percent from 1973 to 2011, average wages rose only 4.2 percent and hourly compensation (wages plus benefits) rose only 10 percent over that time, according to government data analyzed by the Economic Policy Institute.
At the same time, corporate profits were booming. In 2006, the year before the Great Recession began, corporate profits garnered the largest share of national income since 1942, while the share going to wages and salaries sank to the lowest level since 1929. In the recession's aftermath, corporate profits have bounced back while middle-class incomes have stagnated.
Today the prevailing cut-to-the-bone business ethos means that a company like Caterpillar demands a wage freeze and lower health benefits from its workers, while posting record profits.
Globalization, including the rise of Asia, and technological innovation can't explain all or even most of today's gaping inequality; if they did, we would see in other advanced economies the same hyperconcentration of wealth and the same stagnation of middle-class wages as in the United States. But we don't.
In Germany, still a manufacturing and export powerhouse, average hourly pay has risen five times faster since 1985 than in the United States. The secret of Germany's success, says Klaus Kleinfeld, who ran the German electrical giant Siemens before taking over the American aluminum company Alcoa in 2008, is ''the social contract: the willingness of business, labor and political leaders to put aside some of their differences and make agreements in the national interests.''
In short, German leaders have practiced stakeholder capitalism and followed the century-old wisdom of Henry Ford, while American business and political leaders have dismantled the dynamics of the ''virtuous circle'' in pursuit of downsizing, offshoring and short-term profit and big dividends for their investors.
Today, we are all paying the price for this shift. As Ford recognized, if average Americans do not have secure jobs with steady and rising pay, the economy will be sluggish. Since the early 1990s, we have been mired three times in ''jobless recoveries.'' It's time for America's business elites to step beyond political rhetoric about protecting wealthy ''job creators'' and grasp Ford's insight: Give the middle class a better share of the nation's economic gains, and the economy will grow faster. Our history shows that.

HEADLINE: The Reasons for Public Ire Toward Big Banks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
William B. Harrison Jr. (''In Defense of Big Banks,'' Op-Ed, Aug. 23) dismisses commentators who ''point to the inordinate influence large banks have on the political process,'' adding, ''In the real world, this is just false.'' 
He says bankers simply bring their expertise to help regulators and politicians ''learn more about the issues.'' Anyone who has kept track of the myriad ways bankers and lobbyists have weakened or defeated new attempts to regulate the banks after the financial collapse has to laugh at this.
Senator Dick Durbin got it more nearly right when, referring to Congress, he admitted that the banks ''own the place.''
ROBERT W. GORDON Stanford, Calif., Aug. 23, 2012
The writer is a professor of law at Stanford University.
To the Editor:
The real source of public anger at large financial institutions is the deregulation-induced perversion of a once highly respected profession of honest, responsible fiduciaries into a now dubious career better known for risky speculation, overzealous greed and questionable integrity.
WILL ADAMS Atlanta, Aug. 23, 2012
To the Editor:
William B. Harrison Jr., in his defense of big banks, does not mention that the reason none of the big ''universal banks'' failed was that our government bailed them out with taxpayer money. Hence the term ''too big to fail.''
Until these giants start paying attention to the savers in this country and stop making overly risky bets, this will continue to happen.

HEADLINE: A High Line That's Good for New York

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Disney World on the Hudson,'' by Jeremiah Moss (Op-Ed, Aug. 22):
Would New York City really be better off without the High Line?
The High Line stands today thanks to a broad community of New Yorkers who rallied together to transform it from a derelict elevated railway into a beloved public space, free and open to all.
Each year, the High Line welcomes about two million New Yorkers, and our staff coordinates public artworks, youth employment opportunities, educational programs, family events and more than 450 free community activities for the park's most immediate neighbors. 
To claim, as Mr. Moss does, that the High Line was never about the neighborhood is not true and an unfortunate simplification of our past and current reality.
More than a decade ago, we founded Friends of the High Line with the goal of creating a great community amenity and an extraordinary public space. Our goal remains the same today.

Jeremiah Moss is upset that half of the 3.7 million visitors to the High Line are not from New York. And he is upset that this is somehow fostering ''some of the most rapid gentrification in the city's history.''
Cities evolve. They change and grow and shrink, and the economics and demographics of neighborhoods shift. This is healthy and normal. Freezing a city's parts into amber is not.
The garages and auto-part shops that Mr. Moss misses are part of an older way of living in the city, one that contributed to quality-of-life detractors: honking horns, idling engines, blaring car alarms and smog.
As we become smarter about how to live in cities, those businesses will disappear. They will be replaced by others that respond to people who take public transportation or walk. This is natural and what happens in vibrant cities.
The High Line is a terrific example of changing the old (railways) into the new (parks) in a way that adds amenities to the lives of people living around them.
That the High Line has become a tourist ''must see'' speaks to the attractiveness of this kind of evolution. I bet a good number of those tourists go back to their hometowns and start advocating for green spaces and public parks to be created from previously unused lots and rights of way.
KAREN BASSLER Madison, Wis., Aug. 22, 2012
To the Editor:
Jeremiah Moss's appreciation for the High Line will most certainly blossom the moment he begins to manage his expectations about living in New York.
Sharing the treasures of the city with visitors is an undeniable fact of life for those of us who call Manhattan home. Like so many other ''must sees'' in the city, New Yorkers should view the High Line with pride, eager to show it off, not require a local driver's license to enter.
ANDE LUND New York, Aug. 22, 2012
To the Editor:
I agree with some of Jeremiah Moss's points, but as a 30-year resident of Chelsea I'm thankful to have this exquisite garden and community space steps from my front door.
I have nostalgia for ''old New York,'' but I suspect that change was inevitable regardless of the High Line. It's important to remember that the park preserves a decades-old railway that would have otherwise been torn down. Thanks to neighborhood residents, this piece of the city's heritage was not only saved but also enhanced for all to enjoy.
I have been a longtime supporter of Friends of the High Line and a volunteer. I am extremely grateful to be close to a place that enriches my community. That tourists appreciate it as well is just fine with me.

HEADLINE: A Bronx College Gets a Library Building That Is Truly Its Own

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
The new North Hall and Library at Bronx Community College had scarcely been open a day when Dorian Whyte, 21, and Jang Sung Soo, 22, sat down last week to study physics on the light-filled balcony wrapping around an enormous central reading room. Neither had any books in front of him. But they were evidently enjoying the place.
"Having this come into the Bronx is such a great idea, especially at a community college," Mr. Whyte said. "It gives you a great initiation into what a real school is." 
North Hall is the first big, new building on the 43-acre University Heights campus since 1970, when it was the uptown division of New York University. It is also the first academic building that the college, a unit of the City University of New York, has had constructed for its own, instead of inheriting as a hand-me-down.
There is a generosity to the building's features and finishes that communicates a message: the Bronx matters. North Hall was designed by Robert A. M. Stern Architects, known for its interpretations of Classical design. The main reading room was modeled on the double-barreled Bibliothèque Ste.-Geneviève in Paris, by Henri Labrouste.
The North Hall project benefited from having been put to bid as the economic crisis scuttled a lot of private development, thereby depressing prices for labor and materials. Many amenities were possible within the original $104 million budget, with enough money left over, almost $30 million, to improve old campus infrastructure like heating, electrical and water systems, which no one ever notices until ruptured pipes erupt like geysers.
"Contractors were hungry," said Iris Weinshall, the CUNY vice chancellor for facilities planning, construction and management. "We were able to keep elements that, under ordinary circumstances, we probably would have had to value-engineer out of the building."
The list of extras includes marble and slate floors, Guastavino tile vaults, pendant light fixtures and custom-designed study carrels. The ceiling vaults are bordered in a Greek key pattern that was hand-stenciled by a painter named Cid Mendez - "a modern-day Michelangelo," Ms. Weinshall said, evoking an image of Charlton Heston in the Sistine Chapel.
Actually, at 40 feet, the ceiling of the main reading room is only three-fifths the height of the Sistine ceiling. But the library's other dimensions are no less notable. The third floor, where the stacks are situated, is 209 feet long by 100 feet wide. The opening in the third-floor slab that creates the balcony around the reading room is 91 feet long by 47 feet wide (a bit wider than the chapel, if you're still keeping score at home).
On the first floor are 15 much-needed large classrooms, each for 35 to 45 students, said Anton Wolfshorndl, the assistant director of design, construction and management at CUNY. There are about 11,450 students at Bronx Community College, which grants associate degrees. It opened in 1959 in the former Bronx High School of Science at Creston Avenue and East 184th Street.
In those days, New York University had an uptown campus at University Avenue and West 180th Street. The original buildings, constructed from 1894 to 1912, were designed by Stanford White of McKim, Mead & White. They included the Gould Memorial Library and the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, architectural treasures and official city landmarks.
During a period of tremendous unrest nationwide, the Gould library was firebombed in April 1969. A month later, protesting students at Bronx Community College briefly occupied their building.
Though the books there were spared harm, New York University soon moved the stacks to the basement of a new building known as Technology II, designed by Marcel Breuer. It is now called Meister Hall.
As New York University's deficits grew in the early 1970s, it faced increasing pressure to close its uptown division. That happened in 1973, after which the campus was transferred to the Bronx Community College.
The Gould building remains largely empty to this day, in a state of minimal repair though far from complete abandonment. Daunting structural and logistical issues face any attempt to rehabilitate the building. Now, the library at Meister is empty, too. College officials hope to reuse it as a one-stop student service center, including the bursar and registrar, said David A. Taylor, the dean of administration and finance. But that is probably at least three years off.
A visitor on Wednesday who kept his ears open could hear grumbling about all the space on campus that wasn't being used while CUNY spent tens of millions of dollars building new structures with marble finishes. But the overall mood seemed celebratory.
"I'm enjoying the great beauty of this building," Prof. Teresa L. McManus, the chief librarian, told the college president, Carole Berotte Joseph, as Dr. Joseph paid a visit. "It puts forward that Bronx Community College is about academics."
"Students need a place to be, to study, to learn," Professor McManus said. "And guess what? They love the books."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A House Speaker Proves A Mighty Fund-Raiser

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Derek Willis contributed reporting.

 BODY:
COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa -- Speaker John A. Boehner, tanned, relaxed and seeming slightly giddy, slid up to the microphone and tossed off some one-liners to a small group of Iowans who had paid $100 for the pleasure of 12 minutes of his company on a recent Friday evening.
''The problem is,'' Mr. Boehner boomed, ''the president's never done anything, never had a real job, never really run anything. His idea of fixing the economy is having the government spend more money.'' Mitt Romney is the guy to get the economy rolling again, he said. Oh and by the way, Representative Tom Latham, running for re-election here, is great, too.
Mr. Latham -- who is in a tough matchup with a long-serving Democratic incumbent -- is a big beneficiary of Mr. Boehner's fund-raising efforts this year, but hardly the only one. 
Mr. Boehner's August recess haul -- roughly $4 million over four weeks -- brought his fund-raising to a dizzying $84 million in just under two years, believed to be the biggest amount raised by a House speaker in a single election cycle.
Mr. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, surpassed Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the former speaker and Democratic leader whose fund-raising prowess has long been admired and envied by Republicans. Ms. Pelosi has raised $65 million for House Democrats during this period, including what aides say was $6.8 million in August; she has raised over $300 million for candidates over the last decade.
Democrats say the numbers are not apples to apples because Mr. Boehner's total was accrued through an accounting that considers direct mail appeals, money raised for multiple entities, while Ms. Pelosi's total is exclusively what she has raised for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Regardless, the prolific summer fund-raising by both lawmakers underscores the giant sums of money that are dumping from both parties into down-ballot races this year, the intensity of the stakes, and how fund-raising has become both a top responsibility of the modern speaker and a means to holding on to that power at the top.
While Democrats have an uphill fight to take back the House -- Mr. Boehner has repeatedly said that Ms. Pelosi will take back the gavel ''from my cold, dead hands'' -- Republicans remain on the defensive and want to leave nothing to chance. Further, Mr. Boehner probably expects his toil and largess will be remembered by some of the more raucous corners of his conference should they prevail this November, and will help him solidify his support among those members.
In 23 days on the road last month, Mr. Boehner spent nearly every day in an airport, zipping 9,126 miles from upstate New York to suburban Chicago to St. Louis to Salt Lake City to the central coast of California, where he told jokes and sipped merlot from a plastic cup in service to Republican House candidates. ''When it comes to our candidates,'' he said in an interview this summer, ''no one will work harder than me.''
Mr. Boehner's focus has been Republican candidates, particularly challengers, in so-called orphan states that the national party has paid little attention to because the presidential race is considered a fait accompli there. The focus has been particularly intense in New York, Illinois and California, where Republicans are both defending seats that they snapped up in the 2010 wave and looking for 23 new ones. Of the roughly 50 seats the party sees in play, 18 are in those three states.
Having the speaker in town to entertain guests over eggs (Des Moines), wine and cheese (Santa Barbara) or brats (Appleton, Wis.) can be extremely lucrative. In Salt Lake City, for instance, The Salt Lake Tribune reported that Mr. Boehner's fund-raiser for a House candidate, Mia Love, raised $150,000, some for her campaign and a portion going to the state party.
Many candidates find it provides a much needed shot in arm for their campaigns not just in terms of money but in publicity. It also shows the candidates that their races rate high for the leadership.
In the central coast area of California, where redistricting begot a competitive district for the first time in a generation, Mr. Boehner was the first prominent Republican to come and raise money for another in years, said Abel Maldonado, who is seeking a House seat in the 24th District.
''It sends a strong signal that this is a very competitive race, and that we can win,'' he said. ''It was very exciting to have him here.''
The speaker's events are often met with protests -- as was the case for the fund-raiser for Mr. Maldonado -- reflecting the unpopularity of Congress generally and the Republican-led House specifically in some quarters under his stewardship.
Events tend to range from $50-a-head small-town breakfasts to $5,000-a-head golf course extravaganzas. Mr. Boehner's money is distributed through his own network directly to the candidates and to organizations like the National Republican Congressional Committee.
Mr. Boehner -- like Ms. Pelosi -- is almost constantly cantering from airport to event to airport, often doing three fund-raisers a day.
He did take time with some staff members to go fishing for walleye and bass in Wisconsin, and was up around 4:30 the next morning to read before heading to the Wausau airport at 7 a.m. He flew to St. Louis for an event with Jason Plummer, a House candidate, in Fairview Heights, Ill., a meeting with a National Republican Congressional Committee donor in St. Louis, and an event for another candidate, Ann Wagner, on the outskirts of St. Louis. That afternoon he was on a plane to Denver, where he did an evening event for Representative Mike Coffman.
Outside of the protests and stinging editorials that can follow his fund-raising, Mr. Boehner has the occasional awkward moment. On a plane from Des Moines -- where he has been raising money for Mr. Latham, one of his best friends in the House -- back to Washington, Mr. Boehner was seated in first class right behind Representative Leonard L. Boswell, Mr. Latham's opponent in the race.
Mr. Boswell, not so innocently, inquired if Mr. Boehner had been playing some golf around town.
''If you ever need anything let me know,'' Mr. Boswell said as Mr. Boehner stared blankly ahead. ''You're my speaker, too.''

HEADLINE: Spotlight With Precedent Beckons Texas Mayor

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
SAN ANTONIO -- Mayor Julián Castro will be closely watching two elections on Nov. 6.
The first is national, and his attention is perhaps rooted in self-interest: Mr. Castro is a friend of the Obama administration, having sat with Michelle Obama in January during the State of the Union address. The second is local, and tied to his work: He has taken perhaps his biggest political gamble by asking San Antonio voters to approve a sales tax increase of one-eighth of a cent to finance full-day prekindergarten education for thousands of low-income 4-year-olds who are not receiving it.
Mr. Castro and the plan's supporters have called the higher tax a small price to pay for a program that they believe would make students less likely to need remedial instruction and more likely to graduate from high school.
As Mr. Castro prepared to take the stage on Tuesday at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., to give the biggest speech of his life -- the first Latino to give the keynote address in the convention's history -- it was hard to know what was consuming this city more: Mr. Castro's rising political cachet, or the vote on his pre-K program. 
''It recognizes that the new infrastructure of municipal progress is not just roads and electric power and water extensions and downtown redevelopment, but it's human capital,'' Henry Cisneros, the former San Antonio mayor and a friend of Mr. Castro's, said of the proposed tax increase. ''He has taken a political popularity, which he continues to have, and instead of simply being satisfied to burnish that image, he's willing to spend some of that political capital and put it on the line.''
The pre-K plan illustrates the extent to which Mr. Castro, though of a different ideological stripe, has forged an identity as Texas' version of the vice-presidential candidate Paul D. Ryan -- a youthful, ambitious and dynamic policy wonk turned political star. Since becoming mayor in 2009, Mr. Castro, 37, has immersed himself in the minutiae of running a municipality while maintaining the connections that led to the second-biggest keynote address of his career in June, when he spoke at the state Democratic convention in Houston.
In 2004, a state senator from Illinois named Barack Obama delivered the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention, which catapulted him to national prominence, and there are broad parallels in the lives of Mr. Castro and Mr. Obama. Both men were raised by single mothers, graduated from Harvard Law School and succeeded in transcending the racial politics that often pigeonhole black and Hispanic politicians.
When Mr. Castro delivers his speech on Tuesday, he will be 12 days shy of 38. In his office at City Hall, one wall is adorned with an old poster from another young candidate's campaign: his mother's unsuccessful run for City Council at age 23 in 1971. Rosie Castro, now 65, was at the time a community activist with La Raza Unida, a party that challenged the largely white political establishment and fought to expand the rights of Chicanos, or American citizens of Mexican descent.
''My mother is probably the biggest reason that my brother and I are in public service,'' said Mr. Castro, whose twin brother is State Representative Joaquin Castro. ''Growing up, she would take us to a lot of rallies and organizational meetings and other things that are very boring for an 8-, 9-, 10-year-old. What I did get from my mother was a very strong sense that if you did public policy right, and you did well in public service, that it's a positive influence on people's lives.''
Mr. Castro's mother and father split up when he and his brother were 8, and they were raised by their mother and grandmother, who had come to the United States from Mexico and worked as a maid, cook and baby sitter, in a humble home on the city's west side. When the two brothers applied to college, their mother had been laid off and had made $20,000 that year.
''We were never wealthy, for sure,'' Mr. Castro said. ''My grandmother had a Social Security check that she would get on a monthly basis, and we would look forward to that when she got it, Joaquin and I, because we would run off to the store to go buy soda or Cheetos or whatever. The income levels changed, but the one constant was that both my mother and my grandmother were always very, very supportive, and they made both of us feel like we could do anything.''
A lawyer and former city councilman, Mr. Castro represents a new generation of Hispanic-American leaders in Texas from both parties who perhaps identify more with the second half of that descriptor than with the first, and who have broad appeal among minority and white voters. Mr. Castro's chief of staff, Robbie Greenblum, speaks fluent Spanish, but the mayor of this majority-Hispanic city does not, though he has been working to improve.
''He positions himself as a politician who is Latino, rather than a Latino politician,'' said Walter Clark Wilson, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Texas at San Antonio. ''The nuance is that he wants to be seen as someone who can represent everybody.''
Last year, Mr. Castro won a second two-year term with nearly 82 percent of the vote.
His critics, particularly those who believe he is more hype than substance, are easier to find outside San Antonio than in it. ''It seems to me that he has a very light record of actual accomplishment,'' said Matt Mackowiak, a Republican political consultant in Austin. ''In a way, there's a real parallel to Obama, because this is an aspirational candidate, not a candidate who runs on a record of accomplishment. He may not have any enemies, but that's probably because he hasn't done anything.''
In many ways, Mr. Castro's moment in the national spotlight will also belong to the city he has led, which will be reintroduced to many who know it merely as the home of the Alamo.
San Antonio has become a kind of Berkeley of the Southwest, a progressive, economically vibrant and Democratic-leaning city of 1.3 million in Republican-dominated Texas. A few blocks from City Hall, mariachi singers with acoustic guitars serenade diners at Mi Tierra with old Mexican ballads, while outside sits something new: a row of bicycles ready for renting, part of the city's popular bike-sharing program. Last year, the Milken Institute, an economic policy institute in Santa Monica, Calif., named San Antonio the best-performing city in the country, based on its ability to create and sustain jobs.
The speculation lately about Mr. Castro's future has reached fever pitch; there is talk of his running for governor, earning a place in Mr. Obama's cabinet and even becoming the first Hispanic president. A Fox News Latino headline this summer read: ''Julián Castro: Son of Chicana Activist, Harvard Law Grad, Future U.S. President?''
''Do I think he could be president?'' asked Mr. Cisneros, who was secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the 1990s. ''I think he's smart enough. I think he understands the level of work and attention you have to give to politics over a lifetime to get there. He certainly has put himself in position to be among the mentionables going forward.''
Mr. Castro brushes off any notion that he is following the president's footsteps, or feeling pressure to become the next Obama. ''It's very flattering, but I wouldn't put myself in the same league as the president,'' he said. ''I'm the mayor of a city.''

HEADLINE: Democrats' Challenge In Charlotte: Repeat '08 Denver Gathering

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Democrats will gather here on Tuesday to nominate President Obama for a second term in the White House, setting in motion the final sprint to Election Day.
Mr. Obama's 2012 Democratic National Convention will be weighed down by four tough years in Washington -- political battles won and lost; wars fought overseas; relationships frayed; promises kept and broken.
The challenge for the president and his supporters this week will be to duplicate the optimism and energy that fueled his first convention four years ago, a coronation that ended in a huge rally with fireworks in Denver. 
Here are five things Democrats need to do in Charlotte:
ATTACK ROMNEY Mitt Romney tried to do two things in last week at the Republican convention in Tampa, Fla.: build a case against Mr. Obama's economic policies and put forth a picture of a diverse party that is acceptable to a broad electorate.
In three days here, Mr. Obama's team will seek to counter both. Democratic speeches will accuse Mr. Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, of favoring the rich over the middle class. Democrats will argue that progress has been made, and that Republicans would turn back the clock.
At the same time, the convention will try to portray Mr. Romney as a threat to women, immigrants, the poor and minorities. Democrats will argue that these groups would suffer under a Romney-Ryan administration.
REASSURE ON THE ECONOMY The day after Mr. Obama's convention ends, the federal government will issue the monthly jobs report for August. If history is any guide, it will show anemic employment growth, at best.
Republicans will pounce, as they have every month. So Mr. Obama's convention must build a strong enough case for his economic policies to overcome a negative report at the beginning of the fall campaign.
The advantage for Mr. Obama is that he may never again have a bigger audience than the one he will have on Thursday night. If he gives a well-received address, the chatter on Friday morning could diminish the impact of a mediocre jobs report.
AVOID MISTAKES If Mr. Obama's political team was watching the Republican National Convention (and they were), they could hardly have missed the Clint Eastwood mess.
The actor's odd, rambling remarks were a reminder that mistakes matter. Mr. Romney's well-received remarks on Thursday were hardly the main topic of Twitter or conversations on television the next morning.
Journalists deplore the slick, packaged, choreographed productions that modern conventions have become, and they are waiting to pounce when something goes wrong. Democrats will have to be disciplined to avoid a gaffe or mistake.
FIRE UP THE BASE Mr. Obama's rallies this summer have drawn smaller crowds than four years ago. The diminished enthusiasm of his supporters may provide an opening that Republicans can exploit, but there is nothing like a party to rouse the base. Look for speeches aimed directly at the Democratic constituencies: women, labor unions, college students, blacks, Hispanics and gay people. Huge turnout from these groups could assure Mr. Obama's re-election.
RECAPTURE HOPE In his acceptance speech four years ago, Mr. Obama promised a new kind of politics, shorn of red-blue partisanship. As the cameras panned across the huge crowd, the faces revealed an eagerness for something new and different.
But Mr. Obama's presidency has hardly met that expectation. His White House has gotten bogged down in an even deeper partisan morass that has ground political progress to a halt.
One three-day convention cannot change all that. But Democrats are going to try to use the speeches -- capped off by Mr. Obama's -- to remind supporters of the passion and promise they felt four years ago.
If Mr. Obama can recapture some of that sense of ''hope and change,'' he may begin the final nine weeks of the campaign in a better spot.

HEADLINE: Flawed Political Persona May Be Obama's Greatest Challenge

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- There are still Kennedy Democrats; there are Clinton Democrats. There are fewer Obama Democrats.
This reflects the president's style more than his substance; he is in the mainstream of his party, so popular that any primary challenge has been out of the question.
Yet he remains strangely unfamiliar to some core constituencies. 
If Barack Obama is re-elected, the biggest challenge will not be ideological: He is not the leftist his opponents depict. The economy will be the dominant issue, and events will shape others.
Instead, it may be personal -- his political persona. Be it Democratic politicians or members of Congress, campaign contributors or business leaders, there is a common refrain: Mr. Obama does not much identify with us or even much respect what we do.
His relationship with most Democratic members of Congress lies somewhere between correct and cold. They believe that personal political loyalties are not an Obama priority.
What makes this more than an insider's game is that successful presidents -- Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson (domestically), Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton -- cultivated and established real political relationships.
Could a re-elected Mr. Obama improve in this essential element of presidential leadership?
There is no one more knowledgeable than David Maraniss, who wrote the best biography of the 44th president, ''Barack Obama: The Story,'' which traces his family background and life through his late 20s. Mr. Maraniss has a unique appreciation of his subject's strengths and frailties, and of his psyche.
''Obama,'' Mr. Maraniss says, ''is mischaracterized as aloof. It's more a self-imposed detachment. He's not good at the visceral transactions of politics.''
The author sees two conflicting sides to Mr. Obama. There is the writer-anthropologist ''who looks at the surreal aspects of the game of politics. He doesn't want to buy into that game completely. To be fully engaged makes him uncomfortable sometimes.'' The other side is a ''fiercely competitive'' man who appreciates what it takes to succeed and understands history.
When first elected, Mr. Obama supposedly sought to secure his personal and political identity by emulating Abraham Lincoln's ''team of rivals'' approach, enlisting political opposites to his inner circle. This included making Hillary Rodham Clinton, whom he defeated in the 2008 primary contest, his secretary of state and keeping on Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, who served in that capacity under Mr. Obama's Republican predecessor, George W. Bush.
Today, the team of rivals is more appearance than reality. ''He thought it was a great idea, and ever since he's backtracked, he didn't really do it,'' Mr. Maraniss says. When top appointments are made, the paramount consideration is usually how those chosen fit into the president's comfort zone.
Congressional Republicans have been unyieldingly partisan; still the president only goes through the motions of dealing with them.
In any second term, he is likely to face divided government, split public opinion, a lack of any clear mandate and the need to make critical appointments, starting with state and Treasury. That calls for the promise of Mr. Obama, not the personal performance of late.
The historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, who wrote the book ''Team of Rivals'' on Mr. Lincoln, and has spent time with Mr. Obama, says there are precedents for presidents who have changed. Mr. Roosevelt, in his third term, facing a global war, reached out to adversarial Republicans, making Frank Knox his secretary of the U.S. Navy and Henry L. Stimson the secretary of war.
Moreover, Mr. Roosevelt, who because of his Machiavellian proclivities relished playing people off one another, was straightforward with the major figures in his third term, like the Prime Minister Winston Churchill of Britain and the top generals.
Ms. Goodwin says political polarization may make it even tougher for Mr. Obama than it was for Mr. Roosevelt. Republicans were furious that Mr. Stimson and Mr. Knox joined Mr. Roosevelt's administration; modern Republicans may hate Mr. Obama, especially if he is re-elected, even more than their forerunners hated Mr. Roosevelt.
Still, she sees possibilities. ''The president,'' she says, ''needs to use his keen analytical mind to look at what worked and what didn't work in the first term. He needs to see how and who he spent time with and how he allocated that time.''
Without predicting what he would do, she believes there can be ''an enormous sense of comfort'' that comes with a re-election that enables a president to stretch.
Historical analogies are a reach, though they are not without interest.
Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, noted recently that he had just finished reading the fourth installment of Robert Caro's epic biography of Mr. Johnson. He thought of the contrast with Mr. Obama. ''Johnson,'' Mr. Bush says, ''would have grabbed people by the shoulders, ears, head. He would have convinced John Boehner that it was his patriotic duty to step up. He would have charmed whoever was the guy who needed to be charmed, or the gal, to get the budget done.''
Mr. Obama may not be capable of the personal engagement of an L.B.J. or F.D.R. Still, Mr. Maraniss says, more than most politicians or most people, Mr. Obama has ''throughout his life shown a capacity to learn and grow and change.''

HEADLINE: After Verdict, Assessing the Samsung Strategy in South Korea

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- When a jury in San Jose, Calif., ordered Samsung Electronics to pay $1.05 billion in damages for violating Apple's patents for the iPhone and iPad, it did more than decide who had infringed upon whose intellectual property. To South Koreans, the legal battle highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of both Samsung and their economy in general.
''The ruling makes us reconsider the brand value of Samsung because it depicts Samsung as a copycat,'' said James Song, who monitors Samsung for KDB Daewoo Securities in Seoul. ''But a copycat or not, what Samsung has done with its smartphones was a brilliant move.''
''Look what has happened to companies like Nokia, Motorola and BlackBerry, which didn't do as Samsung did,'' Mr. Song added, referring to competitors whose failures to adapt quickly to the smartphone boom driven by iPhones have drastically reduced their market shares. ''Samsung may lack in innovation, but right now, no one can beat Samsung in playing catch-up.'' 
For months, the South Korean media have watched avidly as Samsung, the world's largest technology company by sales, clashes with Apple, the world's No. 1 company by market value, over patent lawsuits in various countries.
Calling Samsung South Korea's biggest, most profitable and most globally recognized brand barely explains the intense and often mixed emotions the name evokes among South Koreans. In Samsung, they see the crown jewel of their country's transformation from a war-torn agrarian society into a global technology powerhouse.
Once an assembler of clunky transistor radios, Samsung is now the world's top seller of smartphones and high-resolution television sets, as well as memory chips and flat-panel displays that allow those devices and others to store and display data.
Japanese companies have beaten rivals to the market with hardware innovations like flat-panel televisions and high-end mobile phones. Samsung waited for the others to test the market, and when it determined the time was right, it joined the fray to cash in.
Samsung's strategy was to build something similar to another company's product but to make it better, faster and at lower cost. When it pounced, it flooded the market with a wide range of models that were constantly updated with incremental improvements at a speed its rivals found hard to match -- a strategy best illustrated by its smartphone business. Heavy investments have not been a problem; it once secured low-cost loans from a government-controlled banking sector friendly to big businesses and now draws on its own coffers, which are sloshing with cash.
Several years ago, Sony, Sharp and Panasonic were the first companies to market flat-panel televisions. But they obsessed over craftsmanship or held onto the old cathode-ray tube while dithering over the rival flat-panel technologies of plasma screen and liquid crystal displays, or LCDs.
Samsung placed billion-dollar bets on mass production of television-size LCDs. Its economies of scale helped it drive down prices to create, then clinch, the LCD television market.
Five years ago, Sony was the first company to make what is widely seen as the next-generation television. It featured the OLED display -- organic light-emitting diode -- which is thinner, more vivid and more energy-efficient. Sony was never able to mass-produce or market it; it was too expensive. Samsung and its domestic rival, LG Electronics, tiptoed in, building mass-production capabilities by first making smaller OLEDs for high-end smartphones. Then last week they pounced, announcing the marketing of 55-inch OLED televisions.
''Koreans do things quicker than almost anyone,'' said Anthony Michell, author of ''Samsung Electronics and the Struggle for Leadership of the Electronics Industry.'' ''This allows them to change models, go from design to production faster than anyone at the present time. Korean companies continually set themselves challenges, like the challenge to overtake Sony in terms of brand value in the past.''
Samsung Electronics is the flagship of Samsung Group, a family conglomerate that controls more than 80 companies that build oil tankers and apartment complexes, run hotels and amusement parks and sell insurance to housewives and artillery pieces to the military. The flagship's operations are often faulted for their opacity. But analysts say that also allows Samsung to place huge bets and do so quickly.
Samsung makes not only hardware but also its components; it is Apple's biggest parts supplier and its fiercest competitor in the completed smartphone market. In a way, its rivals help Samsung compete with them. Samsung's handset business was its growth driver, raking in 20.5 trillion won ($18 billion) in the second quarter.
The strategy worked well for the latest product it dominated -- smartphones -- until Apple declared war over intellectual property in April 2011, accusing the South Korean company of ''slavishly copying'' the feel and look of its iPhone and iPad.
After the court victory, Apple lawyers sought injunctions against sales of Samsung Galaxy smartphones and tablets in the American market.
But those products had already lived through their life cycles in Samsung's fast-paced marketing plan, analysts and Samsung officials said. With characteristic speed, Samsung had already retooled its latest Galaxy S III smartphones to stay ahead of the patent battle.
Samsung appeared to consider the legal trouble a necessary cost of squeezing out a giant in yet another field it is fast dominating. Samsung's smartphone sales in the second quarter grew 150 percent to 50.5 million units, or a record 35 percent of the market, according to the research firm Strategy Analytics. Apple grew 28 percent, to 26 million units. Apple will attempt a surge back with its new iPhone model this year, but Samsung is ready to introduce the Galaxy S IV as a counter.
''The patent ruling and Samsung's copycat image will have a negative impact on Samsung's sales of cellphones and other products,'' said Kevin Lee, an analyst at Korea Investment and Securities. ''But Samsung will further widen the gap with Apple in the third quarter, though not as much as expected before the ruling.'' Samsung is appealing the verdict, which it called ''a loss for the American consumer.'' Mr. Song said that despite the verdict, the fight for the smartphone market was over and had been decided in Samsung's favor.
In South Korea, where Samsung's achievements are a source of national pride, many perceived a bias against a foreign competitor in the American jury verdict. Still, the ruling reminded South Koreans of something their country lacked, a shortcoming magnified by comparisons between Samsung and Apple.
Although the name Samsung is synonymous with sophistication among South Koreans, the company has never created a product so innovative that it has defined an era in consumer culture, like the Walkman or the iPhone.
''Copying and clever upgrading are no longer viable,'' the daily JoongAng Ilbo, The International Herald Tribune's publishing partner in South Korea, said in an editorial. ''Samsung must reinvent itself as a first-mover, despite the huge risks involved in acting as a pioneer, if it hopes to beat the competition.''

HEADLINE: Rosie Ruiz Republicans

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Remember Rosie Ruiz? In 1980 she was the first woman to cross the finish line at the Boston Marathon -- except it turned out that she hadn't actually run most of the race, that she sneaked onto the course around a mile from the end. Ever since, she has symbolized a particular kind of fraud, in which people claim credit for achieving things they have not, in fact, achieved.
And these days Paul Ryan is the Rosie Ruiz of American politics. 
This would have been an apt comparison even before the curious story of Mr. Ryan's own marathon came to light. Still, that's quite a story, so let's talk about it first.
It started when Hugh Hewitt, a right-wing talk-radio host, interviewed Mr. Ryan. In that interview, the vice-presidential candidate boasted about his fitness, declaring that he had once run a marathon in less than three hours.
This claim piqued the interest of Runner's World magazine, which noted that marathon times are recorded -- and that it was unable to find any evidence of Mr. Ryan's accomplishment. It eventually transpired that Mr. Ryan had indeed once run a marathon, but that his time was actually more than four hours.
In a statement issued by a spokesman, Mr. Ryan tried to laugh the whole thing off as a simple error. But serious runners find that implausible: the difference between sub-three and over-four is the difference between extraordinary and perfectly ordinary, and it's not something a runner could get wrong, unless he's a fabulist who imagines his own reality. And does suggesting that Mr. Ryan is delusional rather than dishonest actually make the situation any better?
Which brings us back to the real issues of this presidential campaign.
Obviously nobody cares how fast Mr. Ryan can run, and even his strange marathon misstatement wouldn't be worth talking about in isolation. What makes this incident so striking is, instead, the way it resonates with the essential Rosie-Ruizness of Mr. Ryan's whole political persona, which is built around big boasts about accomplishments he hasn't accomplished.
For Mr. Ryan, as you may recall, has positioned himself as an icon of truth-telling and fiscal responsibility, while offering policy proposals that are neither honest nor responsible. He calls for huge tax cuts, while proposing specific spending cuts that, while inflicting immense hardship on our most vulnerable citizens, would fall far short of making up for the revenue loss. His claims to reduce the deficit therefore rely on assertions that he would make up for the lost revenue by closing loopholes that he refuses to specify, and achieve further huge spending cuts in ways that he also refuses to specify.
But didn't the Congressional Budget Office evaluate Mr. Ryan's plan and conclude that it would indeed reduce the deficit? I'm glad you asked that. You see, the budget office didn't actually evaluate his plan, because there weren't enough details. Instead, it let Mr. Ryan specify paths for future spending and revenue, while noting -- in what sounds to me like a hint of snark -- that ''No proposals were specified that would generate that path.''
So Mr. Ryan basically told the budget office to assume that his plan would slash the deficit, then claimed the resulting report as vindication of his deficit-slashing claims. Sorry, but that's the policy equivalent of sneaking into a marathon near the finish line, then claiming victory.
Still, Mitt Romney, not Mr. Ryan, is the presidential candidate, although that's sometimes hard to remember. So how does Romney/Ryan differ from Ryan alone? It's worse. Like the Ryan plan, the Romney plan offers huge tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy, while pledging to offset these cuts by closing unspecified loopholes; but Mr. Romney adds to the implausibility by also demanding higher defense spending and eliminating the Medicare cost savings contained in Obamacare. Realistically, the Romney plan would explode the deficit, not reduce it.
Yet Mr. Romney boasts about his fiscal responsibility; in Tampa he accused President Obama of hurting the economy with big deficits (while also declaring that Mr. Obama was destroying jobs by cutting military spending -- go figure), then declared that ''We will cut the deficit and put America on track to a balanced budget.'' Yep, he's another Rosie Ruiz Republican.
So what is this election about? To be sure, it's about different visions of society -- about Medicare versus Vouchercare, about preserving the safety net versus destroying it. But it's also a test of how far politicians can bend the truth. This is surely the first time one of our major parties has run a campaign so completely fraudulent, making claims so at odds with the reality of its policy proposals. But if the Romney/Ryan ticket wins, it won't be the last.

HEADLINE: Obama Says Republicans Are Stuck In the Past

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
BOULDER, Colo. -- As President Obama heads into the Democratic National Convention this week, he is seizing on the just-concluded Republican convention to ramp up his argument that Mitt Romney and his party are stuck in the policies of the past and are afraid to spell out the details of their plans.
''Despite all the challenges that we face in this new century, what they offered over those three days was an agenda that was better suited to the last century,'' Mr. Obama told an estimated 13,000 people who filled a campus green on Sunday at the University of Colorado, Boulder, against a scenic backdrop of the Rocky Mountains. 
''It was a rerun -- it could have been on 'Nick at Night,' '' Mr. Obama said. Viewers might as well have watched on a black-and-white TV with rabbit-ear antennas, he joked.
And for all the Republicans' talk of the hard choices they would make to address the country's problems, Mr. Obama said, ''When Governor Romney finally had a chance to reveal the secret sauce, he did not offer a single new idea. It was just retreads of the same old policies we've been hearing for decades, the same policies that have been sticking it to the middle class for years.''
The post-Republican convention attacks on Mr. Romney and his party added a new element to Mr. Obama's usual stump speech in which he describes Mr. Romney and Congressional Republicans as backward-looking -- to Bush-era fiscal policies and 20th-century positions on issues like contraception, abortion and gay rights -- and unwilling to provide details on ideas like the use of vouchers for future Medicare recipients.
Mr. Romney took the day off from campaigning, spending time at his summer vacation home in Wolfeboro, N.H. There he attended church services, where another leading Mormon, J. W. Marriott, son of the founder of the Marriott Hotel chain, praised the Romneys for helping to lead the church ''out of obscurity'' and into the mainstream.
In Boulder, Mr. Obama criticized Republican proposals that would result in additional tax cuts for the wealthy, loosened financial and environmental regulations and an end to his health care law expanding insurance coverage and benefits for existing policyholders. And he attacked what he said were efforts to reverse clean energy and conservation measures.
Mr. Obama described his own agenda mostly as one of protecting the gains of the last four years, including on health care and increased college aid. For all of his criticism of Mr. Romney, the president faces a challenge in his own nomination acceptance speech on Thursday night to outline more specifically what his second term would look like.
The president repeated his criticism, first made in Iowa on Saturday, that Mr. Romney ''had nothing to say about Afghanistan'' in his convention speech.
Mr. Obama's weekend visits to Iowa and Colorado were the second time in a week that he had campaigned in the two states. The fact that neither has many electoral votes -- Colorado has nine, Iowa six -- underscores just how close this presidential contest is believed to be.
And as has been the case in Mr. Obama's earlier trips to the states, Sunday's venue was a college campus, reflecting his need to mobilize young voters much as he did four years ago. But this time he must do so with the handicap of an economy that leaves many of them without jobs or underemployed -- as Mr. Romney points out routinely.
This was Mr. Obama's 13th visit to Colorado as president, his eighth this year and his second to this liberal college town. In April, he spoke here about his policies to make college more affordable, an issue he focused on again on Sunday.
The state's growing Latino population and continued support from women have made Colorado friendly turf for Democrats. But while Mr. Obama won handily here in 2008, the continued weak economy has made the state competitive for Republicans.
At the same time, the independent, libertarian strain among the state's conservatives poses a challenge for Mr. Romney, as was reflected by the state's delegation to the Republican convention.
The Denver Post reported that nearly a fourth of the delegation there was still supportive of Representative Ron Paul, a libertarian and one of Mr. Romney's vanquished rivals for the nomination.
The Colorado rally was Mr. Obama's 47th since May, when he began holding political events other than fund-raisers, according to a tally kept by Mark Knoller, a reporter for CBS News.
A breakdown of the swing states where the president has held the most rallies reflects the main fields of battle with Mr. Romney as the Obama campaign strategizes to reach 270 electoral votes. First on the list is Iowa, which has had 12 such rallies, and second is Ohio, Mr. Obama's next stop; his appearance on Monday in Toledo will be his 11th campaign rally in that state this year.
Next is Virginia, where Mr. Obama will hold his ninth rally on Tuesday before heading to Charlotte, N.C., on Wednesday for the convention. Fourth in the number of campaign rallies is Colorado, with six; then Florida, with five; New Hampshire, three; Nevada, two; and Pennsylvania, one.
The Obama campaign, seeking to build on any momentum coming out of this week's convention, announced on Sunday that upon leaving Charlotte, Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, will travel on Friday with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill, to New Hampshire and Iowa. Over the weekend, Mr. Obama will campaign in Florida and Mr. Biden in Ohio.
As tickets are distributed for each event, local Obama campaign organizers and volunteers collect information on attendees and see that those who are not registered to vote -- like students from other states -- complete the process. When early voting periods begin, organizers will contact those voters again to get their votes locked up before Nov. 6.
After his event in Toledo on Monday, Mr. Obama will take a rare break from the campaign trail and fly to Louisiana, a solidly Republican state, to inspect the damage from Hurricane Isaac.

HEADLINE: In Ohio, Ryan Campaigns Like a Native Son

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Before Mitt Romney announced a running mate, many political strategists predicted he would choose Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, if for no other reason than his home state is a must-win state for the Romney campaign.
Although Mr. Portman was not picked -- the short list ''wasn't short enough,'' he joked at the Republican National Convention last week -- Mr. Romney's actual No. 2, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, is going all out to convince Ohio that he is the next best thing to a native son. 
Mr. Ryan boasts of carrying a ''lucky buckeye,'' a gift from Mr. Portman. In Powell, Ohio, a week ago he proclaimed, ''It's good to be back here in Big 10 country.'' On Saturday he attended one of the state's high holidays, the season opening football game at Ohio State here, versus Miami University in Ohio, which is Mr. Ryan's alma mater.
Mr. Ryan, who has often said he was no jock in college, had the opportunity to give an impromptu pep talk in the locker room to the Miami RedHawks before they took the field as underdogs in the midst of a sea of 100,000 red-clad fans at Ohio Stadium. (Both teams have red, or scarlet, in their colors.)
Earlier, Mr. Ryan dropped by a tailgating party to visit old fraternity brothers from Delta Tau Delta and many other Ohioans with whom he had ties. Wearing a red polo shirt and jeans, he was greeted at the entrance to a tent by Representative Pat Tiberi of Ohio, a Republican House colleague. ''This is great,'' Mr. Ryan said, introducing his wife. ''Janna, remember Pat Tiberi? We sit together on Ways and Means.''
Mr. Tiberi presented the three Ryan children with hats.
He noticed Rachel Reed, a 2009 graduate of Miami of Ohio in a school T-shirt. ''You spoke at my graduation,'' Ms. Reed told him.
Walking deeper into the enclosure, Mr. Ryan reminisced while posing with former Miami of Ohio classmates. He pitched bean bags in a game of cornhole against 11-year-old Zachary Wymer, joking when a shot missed the board, ''I missed trying to get the camera guy there,'' referring to a press photographer.
Mr. Ryan squeezed through the throngs to the grill, where he flipped a few burgers. His mother, Betty Ryan Douglas, who was also with him, said he acquired his technique working at McDonald's as a teenager.
During his first visit to battleground Ohio a couple of weeks ago after being chosen to be Mr. Romney's running mate, he held a rally on the campus of his alma mater in Oxford, lauding the state as a place ''I spent a lot of my formative years.''
At Miami of Ohio (class of 1992), the seeds of his conservative political philosophy were nourished, and he gained his earliest political experience, poking in lawn signs for a Congressional candidate named John A. Boehner, who became speaker of the House and a close colleague of Mr. Ryan's in the party leadership.
Mr. Ryan also has close ties to John R. Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio, going back to when Mr. Kasich was a congressman and Mr. Ryan a Congressional aide. At one rally where Mr. Kasich introduced the Republican ticket, Mr. Ryan needled the governor's electric green polo shirt as evidence of Mr. Kasich's thrift.
In a state with large numbers of blue-collar voters, Mr. Ryan has portrayed himself as empathetic to workers displaced by the loss of factory jobs and threatened by the global economy. It was in Ohio that he first accused Mr. Obama of breaking a promise to save a General Motors plant in Wisconsin where ''a lot of my high school buddies worked.'' The claim has been challenged because the decision to close the plant was made before Mr. Obama took office, though some work continued for a time after he was sworn in.
But Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin defended Mr. Ryan on MSNBC. ''When he talked about that promise that President Barack Obama made about that plant not closing down, the fact that it's been closed, that's the real deal,'' he said.
But attacking the president over a failure to save jobs is problematic in Ohio, because the federal bailout of G.M. and Chrysler, begun under President George W. Bush and continued by Mr. Obama, helped both companies survive, saving more than a million jobs. The industry's return to profitability has been a factor in lowering Ohio's unemployment rate to 7.2 percent, below the national average.
After tailgating, Mr. Ryan was driven to the football stadium, where he and his wife watched the game from a box. He left before the end of the first quarter, en route to a flight to another swing state, Florida. His RedHawks held an early 3-0 lead, but ended up losing 56-10.

HIGHLIGHT: Review of Shirish Kunder's 'Joker.' 

 BODY:
"There might be a utopian vision inside Shirish Kunder's 'Joker,' a Bollywood comedy about establishing contact with extraterrestrials," Andy Webster wrote in The New York Times. "But if so, it's buried under a mountain of static." 
In Shirish Kunder's comedy, a California scientist is called back to his hometown on the India-Pakistan border, where he creates ploys to save the area from economic hardship. "The stratagems - fake crop circles; dressing as aliens and putting on a show for the camera crews; and, apparently, musical production numbers - grow desperate, much like the humor," Mr. Webster wrote.

HEADLINE: Relief for Severe Asthma, at a High Price

BYLINE: ANAHAD O'CONNOR


HIGHLIGHT: A new procedure provides relief to severe asthmatics when little else works, but it's expensive and insurers are reluctant to pay for it. 

 BODY:
For two decades, Patricia DiGiusto struggled with severe asthma. Powerful medications and frequent use of her inhaler could not prevent repeated trips to the emergency room.
On one particularly bad night, Ms. DiGiusto watched from her hospital bed as doctors and nurses prepared to insert plastic tubing down her windpipe to help her breathe. Gasping for air, she was certain she would not survive.
"I'll never forget that feeling," said Ms. DiGiusto, 65, a speech pathologist in Braintree, Mass. "The feeling that I'm never going to see my kids or husband again and that asthma is finally going to get me."
Two years ago, Ms. DiGiusto's doctor told her about a new procedure called bronchial thermoplasty, the first non-drug therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration for patients with severe asthma.
During the procedure, a doctor guides a bronchoscope into a patient's airways. There, it heats the lungs to 149 degrees Fahrenheit - cooler than a cup of coffee, but warm enough to shrink the smooth muscle in the airways, which swells during an asthma attack and restricts breathing. After the procedure, the airways no longer are so prone to constricting, studies show. Asthma patients suffer fewer attacks and need fewer hospital visits.
Ms. DiGiusto had the procedure in March 2011. Since then, she has ended most of her medications and has not had a single asthma attack. "I'm a language therapist," she said, "but I can't even think of the word to describe how much better this has made my life."
Across the country, about 24 million people suffer from asthma. Every year, about 3,400 die because of it.
Avoiding allergens and using inhaled medications are enough to keep asthma under control in most patients. But for the minority with severe persistent asthma, medication and lifestyle changes are not enough. Frequent hospital trips are almost inevitable, and powerful steroids like prednisone - which can cause thinning bones, cataracts, depression and other debilitating side effects - become a necessity.
Nationwide, asthma treatment costs exceed $10 billion a year, and over half of that is spent on severe asthmatics, who make up only 10 percent of the asthma population.
Doctors say bronchial thermoplasty has given them a new weapon in the battle against severe asthma, and many patients call it life-changing. But the procedure is expensive, costing around $20,000, and insurers have been reluctant to cover it. As a result, many people who need it, doctors say, are forced to go without it.
"For those of us in the field who work with severe asthmatics and see how limited they are, it's frustrating because we have this new therapy, we've seen it work, and the data says it works," said Dr. Roy St. John, a pulmonary disease specialist at Columbus Pulmonary and Critical Care in Ohio. "But the big insurers have all denied it."
Although bronchial thermoplasty was approved by the F.D.A. only two years ago, clinical studies on it began in 2000. Since then, about 650 patients across the country have had the procedure.
It takes place in three steps, each separated by about three weeks. Each time, a different section of the lungs is treated. Some patients report temporary coughing, mucus and other respiratory symptoms brought on by irritation of airways.
But several five-year studies showed no long-term safety issues. And researchers at Washington University School of Medicine found that compared with a control group, bronchial thermoplasty patients saw their asthma attacks drop by a third, their emergency room visits fall by 84 percent, and the number of days they lost from work and school drop by 66 percent.
"This isn't a cure, but it is definitely a breakthrough," said Dr. Pratik S. Patel, director of Interventional Pulmonary Medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey. "It's not going to get rid of asthma, but it is going to reduce symptoms and hospitalizations and make patients more functional in their daily life." For now, the procedure is only for severe asthmatics, who - unlike a vast majority of asthma patients - cannot keep flare-ups at bay with standard medications, said Dr. Kyle Hogarth, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago who was involved in clinical studies of the treatment.
"There are millions and millions of asthmatics," he said. "There will not be millions of thermoplasty patients."
Still, even patients with severe asthma often are denied insurance coverage for the procedure. Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, said insurers are awaiting the results of an additional five-year clinical trial, required by the F.D.A. when it approved bronchial thermoplasty. That trial will not be completed until at least 2018.
Until then, Ms. Pisano said, many insurers are denying coverage on the grounds the procedure is experimental. "The issue here for health plans is the long-term safety and efficacy have yet to be established," she said.
But three five-year studies have already been completed. Many asthma specialists believe that insurers are taking a shortsighted approach. The one-time cost of $20,000, they say, is dwarfed by the tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills and medication costs that a severe asthmatic can easily accumulate in a single year.
One such patient, Alberto Gaulion, 68, a retired importer in Miami, estimated that for much of the last decade, his insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, spent about $50,000 a year on his medical care.
"Every two or three weeks I had to go to the hospital," he said, "and I was taking everything that was on the market. I was on a cocktail of drugs."
Blue Cross would not cover the procedure for him, so Mr. Gaulion paid out of pocket when he had it in 2010. Since then, he has had no hospital visits and no asthma attacks, and takes only one medication instead of five.
"Now I can breathe," he said, "and I'm saving my insurance company a fortune."
Dr. Charlene McEvoy, a director of an asthma center run by Health Partners, the largest health plan in Minnesota, believed in thermoplasty enough to push the insurer to start covering it. Dr. McEvoy argued that it made economic sense, and earlier this year Health Partners agreed.
"When plans look at the cost savings, I think they're going to cover it," said Dr. McEvoy, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota. "You have to show that there's a return on investment."

HEADLINE: Behind the Cover Story: Hanna Rosin on Women Who Support Their Husbands

BYLINE: RACHEL NOLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The author of this week's cover article discusses small-town women who find some empowerment as breadwinners and men who view the loss of manufacturing jobs as "a phantom limb." 

 BODY:
by Riverhead Books. Rosin is a senior editor at The Atlantic and at Slate, where she co-founded the "DoubleX" blog.
You profile three couples in Alexander City, Ala., where the wives are finding more work than their husbands. Why did you choose to focus on this small city?
I was looking for a classic manufacturing town, and I wanted to track what happened to that town when the era was over. I picked Alex City because it had been a prosperous town that had been so singularly dependent on Russell, the maker of athletic wear. You could really see the economic reverberations in an intimate way. I also chose it after calling a researcher named James Chung who had done some work showing that the median income of young women is higher than that of young men in many parts of America. I called him up and asked him if there were any places, maybe unexpected ones, where that disparity was particularly great. And he said, yes, a region called Auburn-Opelika in Alabama. So I wanted to check out that part of eastern Alabama anyway, and eventually wended my way 45 minutes outside Auburn to Alex City.

We hear a lot about the wage gap among men and women in the upper middle class, so it was interesting to hear about the ability of women squarely middle class to find jobs.
That's a tricky issue, because the wage gap doesn't necessarily tell you what is going on broadly in America. The wage gap is a singular question of fairness. Suzy and Bob are doing the exact same job. Why is Bob getting paid more than Suzy? But there might be 100 Suzies and 10 Bobs. If you look at total numbers in the working and middle class, men still on average make more than women. But what I described in the story is the brand new phenomenon of that starting to flip. Of course there are older women who have never worked and who will never work and they are measured as part of those statistics. So the longer this goes on - as women younger than the ones I wrote about are going to school in greater proportions and getting more training - the phenomenon is likely to grow.
The tone of your article is neither a lament for bygone blue-collar men's jobs nor is it a feminist cheer for the new matriarchy.
People sometimes misunderstand my "End of Men" argument as a straightforward feminist argument. In the article, I show that a lot of the places this trend is happening are not places where anyone would call themselves a feminist. It can be a question of women accepting jobs and lower wages that their husbands wouldn't - but those are the jobs available so they are the ones with the paycheck. Many of these women don't want to find themselves in the position of being primary breadwinner, but it was a question of economic realities. It's not a straightforward mark on the feminist continuum, it's just what is. The men and women strongly believe that the man should be head of the household. Having that shaken up is not comfortable for anyone. That said, when these dynamics change, the women do start to feel their power and people accept them in leadership positions more easily. Alex City has its first female mayor.

And yet a lot of early comments on your article expressed frustration that the women you talked to still think in terms of traditional gender roles.
It's funny, the attitudes of women I talked to for the article probably represent more of the women across the country than do those of the New York Times reader. It's not that these women wanted to be Southern belles, necessarily, it's that they were uncomfortable with the idea of a woman being the one to carry the family. Two of the three women I profiled had been working all along. It was the new idea of being the main earner that was uncomfortable, partly for religious reasons. I asked the mayor what were the reactions to her campaign in the town. And she answered along the lines of "I had some bra-burning types call me up and say, 'Three cheers for women's lib,' but that surprised me, because I'm not a women's libber at all." On the other hand, she was disdainful of the men who would stop her at church and say, "It's not proper for a woman to take that leadership position, are you sure you don't want to drop this?" She considered those the two fringe positions, and she would say her campaign and new job as mayor is just where life took her.
Looking forward, do you think that a way to save the middle class is for women to move between jobs in a more fluid way than men are able to?
Yes. It's hard to wrap our minds around these new dynamics, so it will take a while before it feels comfortable. But there is nothing bad about these women earning the money. You can see them being delicate around the men's feelings and giving the men enough time to adjust. The women do seem to be finding a bit of empowerment in their new roles. But with what they are earning they are also helping the men buy some time to figure out the new economy. Some of the men described the loss of manufacturing jobs as like a phantom limb. They still feel like those jobs are there. But they are adjusting to the idea that those jobs are not coming back.

HEADLINE: The Twilight of the Public Corporation

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Disillusionment with the stock market and shareholder activism are contributing to the drop in the number of Americans investing in equities and to the decline of the publicly traded corporation, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Public corporations that ordinary people can invest in and get rich from represent one of the great selling points of American capitalism - at least according to the salesmen.
Yet public corporations, which rose to dominance in the United States economy in the second half of the 20th century, are now waning in significance. 
As Gerald Davis of the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan points out, the number of public corporations in the United States in 2009 was only half what it was in 1997. The share of employment represented by the largest 25 corporations has also declined over time.

Professor Davis asserts these trends result from increased reliance on overseas contractors for manufacturing, discussed in my last post. 
Public corporations have also become less public. Professor Davis contends that share ownership has become heavily concentrated through mutual funds, such as Fidelity, which he says now holds significant blocks of 10 percent to 15 percent in many large companies. Even Fidelity's role is overshadowed by BlackRock, proprietor of iShares Exchange Traded Funds, which, Professor Davis estimates, was the single largest shareholder in one out of five corporations in the United States in 2011. 
Private companies going public often rely on "dual-class shares" that give original owners more voting rights than other investors. The founders of both Groupon and Zynga gained extra clout in this way. 
The incentives to "go public" are smaller than they once were, because the rise of private equity firms and hedge funds has made it easier to raise money outside the stock market. Private companies are less subject to government regulation and oversight. As The Economist put it in a recent article discussing this trend, "Companies are like jets; the elite go private." 
The rise of shareholder activism may be contributing to the trend. The California Public Employees Retirement System, a major pension fund investor, is now campaigning strongly against dual-class shares, threatening the viability of that strategy for maintaining minority control.
In June, many stockholders of this country's largest public corporation, Wal-Mart Storespublicly registered strong discontent with its policies. They were unable to dislodge the company's chief executive, because the Walton family stood behind him with their substantial voting shares. It seems likely, however, that both majority owners and management were discomfited by the bad publicity. 
Shareholder activism itself reflects a growing disillusionment on the part of individual investors, many of whom have quietly fled the stock market. In 2012, 53 percent of American households polled by Gallup reported that they had investments in the stock market, through individual accounts, mutual funds or retirement accounts, down from 67 percent in 2002. 
Net investments in mutual funds, variable annuities, exchange-traded funds, and closed-end funds burgeoned between 2001 and 2007 only to sag in the wake of the Great Recession. They are now lower than they were in 2001 (See Figure 1.3 of the Investment Fact Book). 
Declining real returns explain much of this change. As Professor Davis observes, the "first 10 years of the 21st century represented the single worst period of stock market performance in U.S. history." The Standard &Poor's 500 index has yet to regain its 2000 level. 
But disillusionment with the public corporation also plays a role. Accounting scandals, insider trading violations, and bailouts have taken a toll. 
Andrew Ross Sorkin reports that three-quarters of students surveyed at 18 high schools across 11 different states agreed with the statement: "The stock market is rigged mostly to benefit greedy Wall Street bankers."
This is a pretty dark view. No wonder Professor Davis refers to the "twilight" of the public corporation.

HEADLINE: In Mumbai, Open Spaces Are Rare, and Rarely Open

BYLINE: NEHA THIRANI


HIGHLIGHT: The city has just 9 square feet of open space per person, new study shows. 

 BODY:
With over 13 million residents, Mumbai has earned its reputation for being a congested city, one where being jostled in crowded spaces is part of daily life.
Other densely populated cities like Hong Kong or New York have large public spaces to compensate for the lack of personal space, but in Mumbai open space is rare. A new study shows exactly how rare: only six per cent of the city is reserved for open spaces, and of that area, some 60 per cent is neither developed nor accessible, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Environment Improvement Society found.
Of Mumbai's 30 square kilometers, or 11.6 square miles, of open space, only 10 square kilometers is actually available and being used - a minuscule 0.88 square meters, or approximately just 9 square feet, per person.
That puts Mumbai far behind other cities in India, and around the world. Delhi and Bangalore offer 15 and 6.4 square meters of open space per person, while Tokyo and New York have 6 and 2.5 square meters, according to research carried out by the real estate company Jones Lang LaSalle. 
"Open spaces in Mumbai are often either inaccessible, offer only partial access or have been encroached upon," said Ashutosh Limaye, head of research and real estate intelligence service at Jones Lang LaSalle. Mumbai is underutilizing natural assets, including its 35-kilometer western coastline, a 50-square-kilometer national park, and a natural harbor on its eastern coast, he said.
The study, prepared over three years by the city's improvement society, with the architecture firm Adarkar Associates and HCP Design Project Management, an urban planning firm, also includes an inventory of open spaces, bodies of water, coastline features and large urban green areas in greater Mumbai.
"The study is useful for all the stakeholders in the development of Mumbai, especially the municipal corporation to alert them where urgent attention is required," said Rahul Asthana, president of the improvement society and metropolitan commissioner of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. "It articulates a new methodology which includes environmental features in planning."
As the city government revises Mumbai's Development Plan, looking forward to the next twenty years, officials hope this study will contribute to the planning process. "Hopefully this study will attract the attention of civilians and authorities and form the basis of the new development plan," said D.M. Sukthankar, former chief secretary for the government of the state of Maharashtra.
Although Mumbai's total open space is tiny, the study shows that most Mumbai residents are within a five-minute walk of some open space. However, factors like insufficient visibility, poor signage and lack of access from roads restrict the use of some of these spaces.
"The aim is to utilize the full potential of the open spaces available at present to benefit all sections of the society," said Neera Adarkar of Adarkar Associates. Ms. Adarkar said that it is unrealistic to compare the per-capita open space of Mumbai to other cities with much lower populations. Still, she said, it is imperative that open spaces to be kept open to public throughout the day to benefit students, senior citizens, children and women.
Recommendations from the study include development of abandoned mill sites in central Mumbai.
Bodies of water are even more endangered in Mumbai than open spaces, the study found. Of the 143 identified, only 107 have not been encroached upon. Water bodies are not reserved features demarcated on the development plan, Ms. Adarkar explained, so they have no legal status and are vulnerable. "With a little effort and the correct planning, a water body can create a calming and soothing effect which all of us Mumbaikars crave," she said.
The study also details threats to the watercourses and coastlines of the city, including disposal of industrial waste and fishing equipment, plastic littering, oil spills and open defecation. "One of the reasons that these unique environmental features are under threat is that they are not even marked in the development plan of Mumbai," said Shirley Ballaney, an urban planner with HCP Design, Planning & Management. "These features also fall under the jurisdiction of various different agencies, and lack of coordination between the agencies is a big challenge."
Earlier this year, P.K. Das and Associates, a Mumbai architecture firm, drew up an ambitious plan to revamp the open spaces in the city called "Open Mumbai." The firm proposed numerous sites for city development and the expansion of public spaces. "We all know that Mumbai's open spaces are terribly short," Mr. Das said, and that large portions of the city's open spaces remain in private hands.
The "Open Mumbai" project culminated in an exhibition at the National Gallery of Modern Art that attracted the attention of heads of state and city governments. Earlier this month, the municipal corporation approved the 'Juhu Vision Plan', which was conceived as part of Open Mumbai. The plan, which includes development of public space in the Juhu locality, conservation of Juhu beach and improved connectivity and social amenities, is expected to be under way within a month.
Meanwhile, several citizens' groups have taken up the cause, including Save Open Spaces and CitiSpace.
CitiSpace surveyed the condition of 800 open spaces in the city and created a database that is available for purchase. "The biggest challenges to open spaces in the city are misuse, abuse and neglect," said Neera Punj, convenor of CitiSpace. Ms Punj believes that the regeneration of the city's few remaining spaces can be done, by pressuring the implementing authorities, knocking on the doors of the judiciary and coordinating the myriad civic departments.
But it will be difficult, she said. "Convincing the implementing authorities to take the straight and narrow path is not easy, because there is not much money to be made on the straight and narrow path."

HEADLINE: The Man Behind Facebook's I.P.O. Debacle

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The company's chief financial officer badly misjudged demand for Facebook's I.P.O., and will be under pressure until the stock rebounds. 

 BODY:
It is David Ebersman's fault. There is just no way around it.
Mr. Ebersman is Facebook's well-liked, boyish-looking 42-year-old chief financial officer. He's not as well known as Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive, or Sheryl Sandberg, its chief operating officer and recently appointed director.
But when it came to Facebook's catastrophe of an initial public offering - the stock reached a new low on Friday, closing at $18.06 - it was Mr. Ebersman, not Mr. Zuckerberg or Ms. Sandberg, who was ultimately the one pulling the strings.
 Now, three months after the offering, the company has lost more than $50 billion in market value. Let me say that again for emphasis: Facebook's market value has dropped more than $50 billion in 90 days.
To put that in perspective, that's more market value than Lehman Brothers gave up in the entire year before it filed for bankruptcy.
A lot of ink has been spilled over Facebook's I.P.O., with investors and pundits mostly pointing the finger at the Wall Street banks, particularly Morgan Stanley, which led the offering, and at Nasdaq, whose numerous computer glitches on Facebook's first day of trading undermined confidence in the stock. They clearly deserve blame.
Mr. Ebersman's name, however, is mentioned only occasionally, usually in passing and typically only among Silicon Valley's cognoscenti.
And yet if there is one single individual more responsible than any other for the staggering mispricing of Facebook's I.P.O., it is Mr. Ebersman. He signed off on the ever-increasing offer price, which ended up at $38 after the company had originally planned a price range of $28 to $35.
He - almost alone - pushed to flood the market with 25 percent more shares than originally planned in the final days before the offering. And since then, as the point person for investors, he has done little to articulate how or why the company's strategy will lift the stock price any time soon.
At a time when investors are looking for some semblance of accountability on Wall Street and in corporate America, it is remarkable that nobody - no bankers, no one at Nasdaq, no one at Facebook - has been fired for botching the offering.
Mr. Zuckerberg reportedly told his employees after the I.P.O., "So, you've heard we're firing David?" But it was only a joke.
Facebook's falling stock price is not just a problem for investors; it is quickly creating real questions inside the company about its ability to retain and attract talented engineers, the lifeblood of any technology company.
Employees who joined the company starting in 2010, for example, are now holding onto restricted shares that were granted at a higher price - $24.10 - than the current trading price. (It should be noted that these are restricted stock units, not underwater stock options, so they do still have real value, but not nearly what the employees had expected.)
Employees with some two billion shares will have the opportunity to begin selling them this fall, which is one reason Facebook shares have been depressed lately.
A spokesman for Facebook, Elliot Schrage, declined to comment and would not make Mr. Ebersman available.
Mr. Ebersman appears to have badly misjudged the demand for Facebook's I.P.O. He was aided by errant advice from a cadre of banking advisers, who all had an incentive to sell as many shares as possible at the highest price possible. Morgan Stanley liked $38 a share, JPMorgan Chase thought the shares could be sold for even more, while Goldman Sachs thought they should be sold for slightly less - but all of them quickly jumped on board when Mr. Ebersman made his final decision.
Determining the price of an I.P.O. is as much an art as a science. After a company's roadshow presentations, investors indicate how many shares they plan to buy. They typically ask for more shares than they expect to receive, sometimes twice as many. But in the case of Facebook, investors, anticipating huge demand, put in requests for triple or quadruple the number of shares they expected to get.
The bankers - and Mr. Ebersman - did not seem to appreciate what was happening. They seem to have believed their own hype and took those orders as real, giving them the misplaced confidence to push the I.P.O. to the highest possible price and issue more shares.
But this wasn't a traditional I.P.O. and should never have been priced that way. (People close to Mr. Ebersman say that he decided to issue additional shares with the goal of steadying the price this fall when the lockup on employee share sales expired. Consider that another miscalculation.)
Another issue that weighed on Mr. Ebersman, as well as the bank underwriters, was the example set by LinkedIn. Its shares rose 110 percent on its first day of trading. That might sound good, but it meant that the company mispriced the shares so badly that it effectively gave investors a gift of nearly $350 million. Mr. Ebersman was intent on making sure Facebook didn't "leave money on the table," according to several people close to him. But by leaving investors with little upside, he may have created additional pressure on the stock.
Both LinkedIn's and Facebook's I.P.O.'s should be considered failures - they were extreme examples of what could happen on the upside and the downside. The ideal offering lands somewhere in the middle. Still, there is no question that investors would prefer another LinkedIn over a Facebook, and they have every incentive to make an example of the company - and Mr. Ebersman - so that other companies don't try to wipe out that first-day "pop."
None of this is meant to suggest that Mr. Ebersman is dumb or unqualified. A graduate of Brown who was the chief financial officer of Genentech when he was just 34, Mr. Ebersman is bright, perhaps even brilliant. He was recruited to Facebook by Ms. Sandberg, a hire that was considered quite a coup at the time. He should clearly be given credit for negotiating favorable and extraordinarily large credit lines - $8 billion worth - with Wall Street banks, which could provide the company with an important lifeline should the economy and the company's fortunes suffer.
The disclosures in the company's I.P.O. prospectus - which were Mr. Ebersman's responsibility - were, for the most part, pretty transparent, giving investors a good sense of the business, despite all the hype. And the I.P.O., for all its failures, filled Facebook's coffers with some $10 billion.
Still, Mr. Ebersman has his work cut out for him as he tries to regain the trust of shareholders. He recently came to New York to meet with big investors, including hedge funds and institutional investors. Some invitations for meetings were oddly, and somewhat imperiously, sent out on Thursday night for meetings on Friday. Given that it was summer, some investors sent their junior analysts.
When Facebook's I.P.O. first started to appear troubled back in May, I purposely avoided weighing in. Frankly, I thought it was too soon to judge.
But we have passed the pivotal three-month mark.
Statistically, the three-month mark is a much better predictor of a company's future share price than any of the closing prices in the first week or two. According to Richard Peterson of Capital IQ, 67 percent of technology companies whose shares lagged their I.P.O. price after 90 days were still laggards after a year. Until Facebook's stock rebounds, Mr. Ebersman will be feeling the pressure.
An earlier version of this column misstated Mr. Ebersman's age as 41. An earlier version also misstated the price range for the initial Facebook offering as $29 to $34.

HEADLINE: In Looking Back Four Years, Voters Have Short Memories

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: It's probably best not to take the "better off" question literally; it's recent economic performance that appears to matter at the polls. 

 BODY:
Are you better off than you were four years ago?
The famous question that Ronald Reagan put to voters in the waning days of the 1980 election was an implicit theme of the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla. -- and it has received further play since then on the Sunday morning talk shows and on the campaign trail.
It's a smart question for Mitt Romney's campaign to be asking, and one that President Obama needs to develop a better answer to.
Still, it's probably best not to take the question literally. If voters did, Mr. Reagan might never have been elected.
Since there are so many ways to define what "better off" means, I'm going to limit the discussion to one particular measure: jobs, as tracked by the government's monthly nonfarm payrolls report. (Certainly it's worth remembering that in 1980, Jimmy Carter had a whole host of problems apart from sluggish jobs growth, including extremely high inflation and the hostage crisis in Iran.)

Here's what a voter would have been looking at on Election Day, 1980. These were the jobs numbers as they were reported in real time by the government, covering exactly four years' worth of reports from September 1976 through September 1980. (The September report, published on Oct. 3, 1980, was the last one before the election that year.)
There was actually quite a bit of jobs growth during this four-year period: about 10 million jobs were added to the economy, in fact. The first two years of Mr. Carter's term, 1977 and 1978, were particularly robust years for employment.
But the economy began to slow down in 1979 and was in acute crisis mode by 1980, having lost about 1.5 million jobs from its previous peak. The economy technically came out of recession late that year, but there was enough of a hangover from the summer that Mr. Carter was doomed to be a one-term president.
Regardless, Mr. Reagan would not have wanted voters to provide a literal answer to his question. If they had actually been considering their situation in late 1980 and comparing it with what they had experienced in late 1976, many of them would have found that they were a little better off. (Their answer may have depended on how much they weighed inflation against other factors.)
But were voters better off than they had been year ago? That question had a more straightforward answer: probably not. And that's why so many of them voted for Mr. Reagan.
Almost the opposite circumstance occurred just four years later, when Mr. Reagan was running for a second term. The next chart shows the jobs numbers from October 1980 through October 1984, as they were reported in real time to voters:
The economy certainly improved on balance under Mr. Reagan -- there were about 95 million payroll jobs in the country when voters went to the polls in November 1984, as compared with about 90 million four years earlier. 
Still, that was only about half as many jobs as were added in the four years leading up to Mr. Carter's losing election night in 1980.
What mattered, of course, was the trend: Mr. Reagan had gotten his recession out of the way early. From an employment standpoint, the recession of 1981-82 was actually more severe than the 1980 one: about 2.5 million jobs were subtracted. 
But jobs growth in 1983 and 1984 was pretty awesome; about 250,000 jobs were added to the economy each month as reported in real time. 
These two back-to-back election cycles represent the most emphatic examples of a point that macroeconomic forecasting models are absolutely agreed upon: it's recent economic performance that matters. 
The evidence here is very strong. It wasn't like Mr. Reagan just squeezed by Walter Mondale in 1984, or that Mr. Carter came all that close to winning another term. And yet, economic growth was pretty comparable as measured under their full four-year tenures. It was all about the timing. (By some measures, the correlation between economic performance in the first two years of a president's term and his election results is actually negative.)
There are other examples of this pattern. Under the tenure of Mr. Reagan's successor, George H.W. Bush, the economy added jobs. But all of that growth had been back-loaded into his first year in office, 1989. The economy went into a recession in 1990, and although other measures of it were in recovery mode by mid-1991, the jobs numbers just weren't. Instead, jobs were about two million below their peak when voters went to the polls in 1992. (Revised numbers show a bit more jobs growth, but voters making a decision in November 1992 weren't privy to those numbers.) 
Another case is 2004, when George Bush the younger was in office. Through mid-2003, the economy had actually lost quite a lot of jobs, about four million, based on the real-time numbers. But it picked up just in the nick of time, adding about 150,000 jobs per month in the final 12 reports published in advance of the election. That was enough for Mr. Bush to win a narrow re-election -- despite the economy actually having shed jobs from four years earlier (as well as from the date of his inauguration in 2001).
The last four years of jobs numbers don't look exactly like any of these cases. For one thing, it matters quite a bit exactly what you mean by "four years," since the economy was in free-fall in late 2008 and early 2009. 
As compared with July 2008, there were about four million fewer jobs in the economy as of July 2012.
Of course, Mr. Obama might object that he is being blamed for job losses under Mr. Bush. If you start his clock as of his inauguration in January 2009 instead, the economy is fairly close to having made up the jobs it lost -- the last three jobs reports before this November's election will determine whether it clears that hurdle.
Or, Mr. Obama might prefer voters to focus on jobs growth since the recession officially ended in June 2009. Since that time, about 2.5 million jobs have been added. 
Still, the job growth has been tenuous: nowhere in the ballpark of what Mr. Reagan produced, certainly. There's never even been a moment in Mr. Obama's tenure where the term "good" could aptly be applied to describe the economy.
But there has been some jobs growth: quite a bit more than under the elder Mr. Bush. 
Instead, 2004 is probably the least imperfect precedent. In the past 12 employment reports, the government estimates that an average of 153,000 jobs have been added each month, similar to the pace of jobs growth in late 2003 and 2004.
Certainly, a lot has been baked into the economic cake by now: the economy hasn't grown enough to make a landslide win for Mr. Obama a realistic possibility, but there has been just enough growth that he probably won't be blown out either. (Our forecast model evaluates the economic numbers as being just favorable enough to make him a slight favorite on that basis.)
But Mr. Obama's fate could hinge on the last three months of jobs numbers -- including the report on Friday, which will come the morning after his speech to the Democratic convention in Charlotte, N.C. 
Talk about accidents of timing: Mr. Obama's words in Charlotte are suddenly going to seem a lot more inspired if the next morning we find out that 200,000 jobs had been added in September. If the employment report is a dud instead, his speech will seem much emptier, both to pundits and to voters. 
But it will be the recent news that they are thinking about -- not what happened four years ago. The question that voters have been more inclined to ask in past elections is this one: what have you done for me lately?

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Seizes on a Question: Are You Better Off Than You Were 4 Years Ago?

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: As Democrats begin gathering for their convention, President Obama's top strategists hesitate when asked whether the country is better off than four years ago. 

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican vice presidential nominee, slammed President Obama's handling of the economy on Monday, seizing on hesitant responses by Mr. Obama's top strategists when asked whether the country was better off than it was four years ago.
"The president can say a lot of things, but he can't tell you you are better off," Mr. Ryan said while campaigning in Greenville, N.C., ahead of the opening of the Democratic convention here on Tuesday.
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. hit back quickly, telling a union audience in Detroit that the administration unequivocally believes that the country's economy has improved since Mr. Obama took over from President Bush.
"Folks, let me make something clear," Mr. Biden said. "I'll say it to the press. America is better off today than they left us."
The dueling comments from the two vice presidential rivals came as Democrats gathered in North Carolina to begin their three-day convention on Tuesday. And it came after a weekend in which several top supporters of Mr. Obama hesitated to say that the country is better off than it was.
Republicans are eager to put the Democrats on the defensive on the question at the start of the Democratic convention. Polls suggest that many people remain pessimistic about the state of the economy and their own financial future -- a fact that Republican hope will help to undermine Mr. Obama's convention message this week.
A spokesman for Mitt Romney's campaign criticized Democrats for seeming out of touch with the plight of everyday Americans.
"The middle class has been crushed under President Obama, but he doesn't seem to get it," said Amanda Hennenberg, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney. "Americans deserve a president who understands we're not better off and has a plan to fix it."
The attacks come a day after Martin O'Malley, the Democratic governor of Maryland, responded to a question by saying that America was not better off than it was when Mr. Obama was elected.
"No," he said, "but that's not the question of this election. The question, without a doubt, we are not as well off as we were before George Bush brought us the Bush job losses, the Bush recession, the Bush deficits."
Mr. O'Malley's comments on CBS's "Face the Nation" were followed by awkward responses from David Axelrod and David Plouffe, two of the top strategists for Mr. Obama's campaign. Both men sought to dodge a direct answer to the question of whether the country was better off.
On Monday, top Democrats quickly shook off their hesitation and equivocation.
At a rally in Detroit, Vice President Joseph R. Biden said, "You want to know whether we're better off? I've got a little bumper sticker for you. Osama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive."
On CNN, Mr. O'Malley sought to clarify his comments "We are clearly better off as a country because we're now creating jobs rather than losing them," he said.
 Brad Woodhouse, the communications director for the Democratic National Committee, said that the country was "absolutely" better off. 
"The truth is that the American people know, we were literally a plane, the trajectory was towards the ground," Mr. Woodhouse said on CNN. "He got the stick and pulled us up out of that decline."
The question -- which Ronald Reagan also memorably posed in a 1980 debate with President Jimmy Carter -- is central to the argument that Mr. Obama will make over the next three days and into the fall.
But answering it requires Mr. Obama's team to walk a careful line: Appear too optimistic about the country's being better off, and Democrats risk being accused of not understanding the depth of the personal crisis that many people still feel. But admit that the country is not better off -- as Mr. O'Malley did -- and the Republicans will pounce.
Aides to Mr. Obama clearly believe that they can walk that line, in part by answering a slightly different question -- is the country better off than it would have been if Republicans had been in charge for the past three and a half years.
On the "Today" show on NBC, Stephanie Cutter, the deputy campaign manager for Mr. Obama, pointed to the state of the economy when the president took over in January 2009 and to the progress that she said had been made since then.
"Let me just walk you through what life was like four years ago right now," Ms. Cutter said. "In the six months before the president was elected, we lost 3.5 million jobs, wages had been going down for a decade, auto industry on the brink of failure. Our financial system, this is just about the time you're seeing banks go under. All over America middle-class families were feeling it."
Ms. Cutter answered the question with no hesitation, also saying that the country was "absolutely" better off now than it was.
But strategists like Ms. Cutter know that they cannot risk having the rest of the presidential campaign center on that question. Instead, they hope that Mr. Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the rest of the major convention speakers can help shift the focus ahead of the final sprint to Election Day.
At a news conference on Monday, Antonio Villaraigosa, the Democratic mayor of Los Angeles, said the convention would seek to remind people what kind of economy the president inherited from Mr. Bush and what he did to respond to the financial challenges for the middle class.
"We're going to present our vision, and we're also going to affirm our values," Mr. Villaraigosa said. "We will recount the last four years and tell the story of a president who led us through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression."

HEADLINE: Obama Ad Reprises Theme That Romney Would Hurt Middle Class

BYLINE: JEREMY PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: A new Obama ad says Mitt Romney's tax plan would help the rich at the expense of the middle class. 

 BODY:
As President Obama kicks off his convention week in Charlotte, N.C., his campaign has a new ad that doubles down on his charges that Mitt Romney's economic policies would harm the middle class.
"The middle class is carrying a heavy load in America," the commercial says as images of a forlorn-looking mother and a worker in a hard hat appear on the screen. "But Mitt Romney doesn't see it." A picture of Mr. Romney flashing a wide grin is shown, along with a picture of a stately brick mansion.
"So, Romney hits the middle class harder and gives millionaires and even bigger break. Is that the way forward for America?"
The ad repeats the claim -- made often by Mr. Obama and his allies -- that Mr. Romney's economic plans would result in a tax increase for middle-class families while lowering taxes on people in the highest income brackets. A studyby the left-leaning Brookings Institution found that to be the case.
The Romney campaign has sought to discredit that study, noting that its author served on the president's Council of Economic Advisers.
A Romney campaign spokeswoman sought to shift the focus toward the state of the economy since Mr. Obama took office, noting that "the middle class has been crushed under President Obama, but he doesn't seem to get it."
"Gas prices have doubled, incomes have dropped, poverty is headed toward 50-year highs and chronic unemployment is at unprecedented levels," said the spokeswoman, Amanda Henneberg.

HEADLINE: On Labor Day, Obama Talks Up Auto Bailout in Ohio

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama pointed to his bailout of the auto industry, which Mitt Romney opposed, as a major argument for his re-election over the Republican rival as he spent a fourth Labor Day with union workers in a swing state. 

 BODY:
TOLEDO, Ohio - President Obama pointed to his bailout of the auto industry, which Mitt Romney opposed, as a major argument for his re-election over the Republican rival as he spent a fourth Labor Day with union workers in a swing state.
Without the rescue, "more than one million Americans across the country would have lost their jobs in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. In communities across the Midwest it would have been another Great Depression," Mr. Obama told an estimated 3,100 supporters, most of them African-Americans, crammed into a high school gymnasium not far from this city's Jeep plant.
The fallout also would have threatened the jobs of local teachers, small business owners, diner servers and bartenders, "who know your order before you even walk in," Mr. Obama said, his voice rising.
"I stood with American workers, I stood with American manufacturers, I believe in you, I bet on you, I'll make that bet any day of the week," he said, adding, "Three years later, that bet is paying off for America. Three years later, the American auto industry has come roaring back." 
His focus on the auto industry's comeback was layered on the stump speech Mr. Obama has delivered now for three days in swing-state campaigning before his renomination convention this week. He engaged in an extended sports metaphor, to mock Mr. Romney's recent remark that he should replace Mr. Obama as the country's coach to produce a winning season. In the case of the auto industry, the president said, Mr. Romney would have called the wrong play.
One out of eight Ohio workers are employed in jobs related to the auto industry, according to the Obama campaign, and the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler ultimately saved nearly 155,000 jobs with manufacturers and suppliers. Mr. Obama rebutted Republican criticisms since 2009 that the rescue was a bailout for pro-Democratic unions, noting to his audience's shouts of agreement that union workers had forfeited pay and benefits as part of the industry restructuring he demanded in return for the bailout.
Ohio's unemployment rate for some time has been lower than the national average, and the auto industry rescue is considered a big reason Mr. Obama has been leading in the polls in this state, which is crucial to the election outcome. The most recent nonpartisan poll from Ohio, for Quinnipiac University/The New York Times/CBS News, showed Mr. Obama in the lead with the support of 50 percent of likely voters to Mr. Romney's 44 percent.
Republicans, in their counterprogramming to the Democratic convention, have begun raising a frequent question from the out-of-power party: Are voters better off than they were four years ago?
With Mr. Romney taking a post-convention break and preparing for next month's debates with Mr. Obama, his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, took up the attack on Monday.
"Every president since the Great Depression who asked Americans for a second term could say you were better off than four years ago except for Jimmy Carter and President Barack Obama,'' Mr. Ryan said. He went on to cite a number of economic statistics from the Carter years and compare them to today's numbers, which are worse. 
Warming up the crowd for Mr. Obama were Bob King, president of the United Automobile Workers, which distributed tickets for the event; Richard L. Trumka, theA.F.L.-C.I.O. president; Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association; Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis; and Senator Sherrod Brown, who is in a tough re-election race himself. Mr. Obama had planned a second Ohio stop in Cleveland, but scrapped that to fly to Louisiana to inspect the damage and recovery effort after Hurricane Isaac caused severe flooding last week.
Before his speech here, Mr. Obama stopped at a diner for breakfast with three union members and greeted other enthusiastic patrons.
As president, his activities on Labor Day have charted the frustrating course of a term that has been defined by the slow economic recovery, which is the biggest threat to his re-election.
In his first year he also was in Ohio, at an A.F.L.-C.I.O. picnic in Cincinnati. The country was still losing jobs, though at a fast-declining rate after his stimulus package and auto rescue took effect; the unemployment rate peaked the following month at 10 percent.
In 2010 he was with union families in Milwaukee, another industrial city in a Midwestern swing state, celebrating eight months of job growth. Unemployment was 9.6 percent and with the original stimulus measures winding down, Mr. Obama called for more; his request went nowhere in Congress, and Republicans gained control of the House in midterm elections.
Last year he spent Labor Day about 50 miles north of here in the auto-manufacturing capital, Detroit, at a rally with about 13,000 union workers and families outside the General Motors headquarters. With unemployment at 9 percent, Mr. Obama previewed the jobs plan he would outline days later in a nationally televised address to Congress.
While Congressional Republicans ultimately agreed to extend the tax cuts for individuals and businesses that were part of that plan, they blocked major parts, including infrastructure spending to spur hiring, especially of construction workers, and state aid to avoid further layoffs of teachers and first-responders.
To this day, Mr. Obama assails Republicans on the stump for failing to pass his entire plan, which Moody's Analytics said would add 1.9 million jobs, lower the unemployment rate by a percentage point and raise the gross national product by two percentage points.

HEADLINE: Ryan Adds Some Loaded Examples to Question of 'Better Off?'

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL and KITTY BENNETT


HIGHLIGHT: While correct, some of Representative Paul D. Ryan's numbers seemed cherry-picked to paint the worst possible picture. 

 BODY:
GREENVILLE, N.C. -- Representative Paul D. Ryan compared the struggling economy to Jimmy Carter-era malaise, when a candidate named Ronald Reagan denied a president re-election by asking an unsettling question: "Are you better off than you were four years ago?"
"There's a little gathering going on over in Charlotte," Mr. Ryan said here in eastern North Carolina, about a four-hour drive from the site of the Democratic National Convention. "The president can say a lot of things, and he will, but he can't tell you that you're better off. Simply put, the Jimmy Carter years look like the good old days compared to where we are right now."
The Republican National Committee and the Romney-Ryan campaign sounded the charge on Monday morning with a new video, a Web site and a statistics dump attacking President Obama on what they consider his biggest vulnerability, all asking the question: "Are you better off?" 
Mr. Ryan picked up the theme speaking to 2,000 people at East Carolina University, while Mitt Romney took a break in New Hampshire from public campaigning.
 "In July of 1980, the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent," Mr. Ryan said. "For the past 42 months, it's been above 8 percent under President Obama's failed leadership." He also cited the even higher unemployment rate of 9.6 percent in North Carolina, a state that Mr. Obama won in 2008 but where the race is deadlocked, according to the latest polls. 
While correct, some of Mr. Ryan's numbers seemed cherry-picked to paint the worst possible picture and to ignore the argument by Democrats that Mr. Obama inherited a disastrous economy that continued to deteriorate during much of his first year, but that since then has turned around and slowly improved. 
It is true that unemployment in North Carolina is higher than the national average. It is also true that the rate peaked at 11.4 percent in January and February 2010 and has been dropping since then. 
Mr. Ryan also cited bankruptcy numbers to make the point that failing businesses mean fewer jobs. "In 1980 under Jimmy Carter, 330,000 businesses filed for bankruptcy,'' he said. "Last year, under President Obama's failed leadership, 1.4 million businesses filed for bankruptcy."
But he appeared to conflate business bankruptcies and much more numerous personal bankruptcies. Of the 331,264 bankruptcies in 1980, only 43,694 were for businesses, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute.
Of the 1,410,653 total bankruptcy filings last year, 47,806 were business bankruptcies, according to the institute. And, again, the numbers are falling. In 2009, there were 60,837 business bankruptcies. In July, the latest month with complete statistics, business bankruptcies were 22 percent lower than a year earlier, and personal bankruptcies were down 11 percent.

HEADLINE: People Don't Vote When No One Asks Them To

BYLINE: MATT PLATKIN


HIGHLIGHT: What I learned about the Latino vote while running a city council campaign on the south side of Juli&#225;n Castro's San Antonio. 

 BODY:
The Democrats selected Julián Castro, the mayor of San Antonio, to deliver the keynote address at their national convention - the same honor that propelled State Senator Barack Obama into the national spotlight just eight years ago - as part of its courtship of Latino voters, whom the President needs to vote in large numbers if he wants to be re-elected. As it happens, as the campaign manager for a young, outsider candidate for San Antonio's city council in 2011, I learned something simple but crucial: while younger Latinos are increasingly the focus of national political strategists, they are still largely ignored at the local level.
The issue here is that Latinos have historically voted and been represented in legislatures at disproportionately low rates. In the 2010 mid-term elections, for instance, Latinos comprised 6.9 percent of the electorate, their best showing ever in a mid-term election, but still significantly below their 10.1 percent share of eligible voters. Similarly, a 2008 study by the National Conference of State Legislatures found that Latinos represented only 3.3 percent of America's 7,382 state legislators. Despite this, because Latinos are the fastest growing population in America and are driving demographic changes in swing states, they remain obvious targets for national campaigns that are eager to exploit every potential electoral advantage.
In local elections, though, the crass conventional wisdom that I often heard from political professionals was simply, "Latinos don't vote." But uncritical adherence to this conventional wisdom often results in a self-fulfilling prophecy: young Latinos are ignored in local races because of their prior voting record, which ensures similarly low turnout in future elections. In 2011, as an inexperienced campaign manager for a young, Latino city council candidate on the south side of San Antonio - a heavily Latino area - I faced this conventional wisdom directly.
To say I was an inexperienced campaign manager at the outset would be an understatement. Both the candidate, Rey Saldaña, and I were 24 at the time of the election. I first met Rey in 2005 when we were in the same freshman dorm at Stanford. Rey was a San Antonio native, born and raised in the district in which he ran. In high school, he helped lead an initiative to attract the first bookstore to San Antonio's South Side and spent his college summers back home working for local politicians. And yet, when we started the campaign in April of 2010, Rey had been away from his hometown for nearly five years and had never run for any kind of elected office. I had never managed a campaign and had spent hardly any time in San Antonio.
Despite our inexperience, we quickly learned that running local campaigns apparently did not involve much ingenuity. We kept getting the same, recycled advice from political veterans: look at the voter rolls for the last three elections, and target those who voted in two of them.
We soon recognized a feedback loop at play: candidates and consultants continued to target those who had voted in previous elections - bombarding them with mail, phone calls and visits - while pretty much ignoring the rest of the population. Time and again, Latinos and Anglos alike stressed to us that Latino voters, particularly younger ones, would not turn out come Election Day, no matter what we did. Engaging them - and spending precious campaign dollars on them - was quite simply a waste of time.
Whether out of stubbornness, necessity or naiveté, we ignored these instructions. As a heavy underdog, we did not have much choice. Rey's main opponent, Leticia Cantu, enjoyed the support of San Antonio's political establishment, including Mayor Castro, and a fundraising advantage that would allow her to amass contributions that would more than double ours. Sticking to a traditional campaign playbook - in which we all targeted the same voters -would surely invite defeat.
Not only was a conventional campaign strategy a losing one, but it also presented an odd proposition: a young Latino candidate would be forced to ignore his own peers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the "consistent voters" that candidates generally target were disproportionately older and whiter than the general population of our district. District Four of San Antonio is large, containing nearly 125,000 residents. As the home to Lackland Air Force Base, it also has a sizable veteran population that often drives turnout in elections. But in 2010 Latinos still accounted for over 80 percent of the district's voting-age population.
Rey was a graduate of one of the district's public high schools - which had a drop-out rate that consistently hovered around 30 percent - and decided to run in order to help spark development in a district that had seen too little of it. Ignoring younger, Latino voters struck us as not only poor politics, but also as contrary to the entire purpose of our campaign.
So instead of ignoring young Latinos, we targeted them. Running a predominantly grassroots campaign, Rey spent six months knocking on more than 3,000 doors. Campaign volunteers knocked on thousands more and made even more phone calls. And while we did reach out to the consistent voters using largely traditional techniques we also registered hundreds of new voters and engaged young Latinos and their families.
Of course, it can be difficult to target voters who have never participated before, which is precisely why strategists often advise against it. Technology certainly played a critical role. Online voter data tools allowed us to identify and contact residents with whom we felt Rey's message was particularly likely to resonate. We specifically looked for young Latinos in key areas of the district who had voted in the 2008 election, but had never cast another ballot - including Mayor Castro's 2009 victory. We were told that these Obama voters would never vote in a local race.
Once we identified these voters - and everyone else where they lived - we used both traditional and nontraditional methods of reaching out to them. We called them, went to their houses and looked them up on Facebook. We spent countless hours individually reaching out to them, largely through Facebook, but also through email or text message, and asked them to not only come out and vote themselves, but to bring their family members. Rey also spent a large amount of time speaking to younger audiences: at schools, community colleges, and at a few local hangouts where we hosted events designed to attract younger residents.
While some of our communication methods may have varied, regardless of the age or race of the resident with whom we spoke, our message was remarkably consistent: we introduced Rey and asked them to share their concerns. And just as we did with the traditional voters, we dutifully logged, tracked and tried to follow up on these issues. Sometimes the most pressing issues for younger constituents did differ from those of their older neighbors - younger voters cared more about neighborhood revitalization and job development for instance. 
More often than not, though, the most common concerns centered on the doorstep issues that form a councilmember's primary responsibilities: maintaining the neighborhood's safety and infrastructure. A quick glance through our campaign log reveals that an address or neighborhood is a much better predictor of the concerns we heard than is an individual resident's age or race. It turns out that younger Latino voters really were not much different from their neighbors after all.
Fortunately, our stubbornness paid off. Our rewarding interactions throughout the campaign soundly defeated the notion that young Latinos were uninterested in local politics. As a fellow young Latino from the district, Rey connected with them in a way that others simply could not. 
One story comes to mind. As Rey answered questions from the dozen or so residents present at a local neighborhood association's candidate forum - a rite of passage for every local candidate - I stepped outside to take a call on our campaign cell phone. The caller was a woman in her mid-30s, who had voted in the past but had become disenchanted. But unlike many other calls, this woman didn't want to complain; she called to ask a favor. Her daughter was 16 and was a good student. As she had not gone to college herself, the caller was hoping Rey could offer her daughter some advice on the college application process and, in her words, inspiration. Only a few years removed from that process himself, Rey gladly called her back and spoke at length with her daughter. That woman became a strong supporter, personally delivering Rey Saldaña signs to homes throughout her neighborhood.
While not every interaction was so emotional, the results were staggering in the aggregate. By simply engaging these overlooked voters through phone calls, door-knocks and a few non-traditional campaign events, we saw an 11 percent increase in voter turnout, with roughly one-in-eight voting in a municipal election for the first time. District Four was San Antonio's only district to see an increase in turnout in 2011, which was particularly remarkable considering that the previous election cycle in 2009 featured a competitive mayoral race at the top of the ticket (when Julián Castro was first elected).
When the votes were tallied, Rey had won convincingly, leading his closest (and heavily-favored) opponent by 13 points and avoiding a runoff in the process. (A third candidate, a former neighborhood association president, received less than nine percent of the vote.) In addition, more 18- to 24-year-olds, predominantly Latino, voted in the first four days of early voting than had voted in the entire previous election cycle (consisting of eight days of early voting, Election Day and absentee ballots). Rey Saldaña is now a councilman because we asked people whom political professionals routinely ignore to come out and vote - and they did just that.
Our model wasn't particularly innovative. With some effort and a little bit of money, candidates can easily replicate this outcome across the country. Indeed, many already are. Time recently highlighted a very similar, and equally successful, campaign run by Daniel Valenzuela, a councilman in Phoenix. As technology continues to make voting data more accessible to all candidates and enhances their ability to communicate directly with voters, campaigns that break from the conventional mold and pursue more innovative strategies will become much more viable.
If more candidates do buck the conventional wisdom and engage younger Latino voters, states and localities across the country stand to witness greater Latino representation in legislatures and on the voter rolls. The benefits of increased electoral diversity are not merely abstract, either. Consciously or not, elected officials often place greater weight on the concerns of communities that actively vote. Consequently, officials often devote more attention and resources to areas with higher voter turnout. Some may view this situation cynically, but it simply reflects our representative democracy at work. If more candidates ask more young Latinos to turn out, it will demonstrate to the political establishment that the conventional wisdom is wrong, and those in the establishment will need to pay greater attention to the concerns of Latino communities as a result.
Of course, Latino communities cannot - and should not - be represented by one voice. These communities are as diverse as America itself. One need only look at the differences between Julián Castro and Ted Cruz, the Republicans' own Texan Latino star, to see the disagreement between these leaders. At the national level, the battle for the Latino vote will be won by the party that actually addresses the problems with which Latinos are concerned - not just immigration, which gets the most attention, but also health care, unemployment and economic growth and opportunity. As Antonio Villaraigosa, the mayor of Los Angeles, said pointedly last week, "You can't just trot out a brown face or a Spanish surname and expect people are going to vote for your party or your candidate."
But as national campaigns become ever more sophisticated in their exploitation of political preferences, it's important to remember that local officials often operate outside the realm of intensely partisan politics. While Rey has taken strong stances on high-profile issues - such as providing benefits to domestic partners of city employees and supporting Mayor Castro's proposed one-eighth of a cent sales tax to fund full-day prekindergarten for low-income children - he has also focused extensively on responding to individual constituents' concerns and leading lower profile countergraffiti and fitness initiatives. If Rey is a strong voice for his community, it's because he's truly a voice from that community. If more Latinos run and encourage other Latinos to come out and vote, that can become an increasingly common occurrence.
While we were campaigning in San Antonio, the brother of Willie Velásquez - the late founder of the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, which has registered millions of Latinos since the 1970s - explained voter apathy to me in simple, but poignant, terms: people don't vote when no one asks them to.

 BODY:
KRESSEL--Bertha H. The Yeshiva Family is deeply grieved by the passing of Bertha H. Kressel, a virtual Eshet Chayil - a Jewish Woman of Valor - who was educated at the Yeshiva of Crown Heights and Yeshiva University's Brooklyn High School for Girls and Brooklyn College. She was the beloved wife of Dr. Henry Kressel, a graduate of Yeshiva College, who is the first university alumnus to serve as the Chairman of Yeshiva University's Board of Trustees. Together the Kressels are Benefactors of Yeshiva University, and established a Chair in Economics and Research Fellowships for outstanding undergraduate students.

HEADLINE: Relief for Severe Asthma, at a High Price

BYLINE: By ANAHAD O'CONNOR

 BODY:
For two decades, Patricia DiGiusto struggled with severe asthma. Powerful medications and frequent use of her inhaler could not prevent repeated trips to the emergency room.
On one particularly bad night, Ms. DiGiusto watched from her hospital bed as doctors and nurses prepared to insert plastic tubing down her windpipe to help her breathe. Gasping for air, she was certain she would not survive.
"I'll never forget that feeling," said Ms. DiGiusto, 65, a speech pathologist in Braintree, Mass. "The feeling that I'm never going to see my kids or husband again and that asthma is finally going to get me." 
Two years ago, Ms. DiGiusto's doctor told her about a new procedure called bronchial thermoplasty, the first non-drug therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration for patients with severe asthma.
During the procedure, a doctor guides a bronchoscope into a patient's airways. There, it heats the lungs to 149 degrees Fahrenheit - cooler than a cup of coffee, but warm enough to shrink the smooth muscle in the airways, which swells during an asthma attack and restricts breathing. After the procedure, the airways no longer are so prone to constricting, studies show. Asthma patients suffer fewer attacks and need fewer hospital visits.
Ms. DiGiusto had the procedure in March 2011. Since then, she has ended most of her medications and has not had a single asthma attack. "I'm a language therapist," she said, "but I can't even think of the word to describe how much better this has made my life."
Across the country, about 24 million people suffer from asthma. Every year, about 3,400 die because of it.
Avoiding allergens and using inhaled medications are enough to keep asthma under control in most patients. But for the minority with severe persistent asthma, medication and lifestyle changes are not enough. Frequent hospital trips are almost inevitable, and powerful steroids like prednisone - which can cause thinning bones, cataracts, depression and other debilitating side effects - become a necessity.
Nationwide, asthma treatment costs exceed $10 billion a year, and over half of that is spent on severe asthmatics, who make up only 10 percent of the asthma population.
Doctors say bronchial thermoplasty has given them a new weapon in the battle against severe asthma, and many patients call it life-changing. But the procedure is expensive, costing around $20,000, and insurers have been reluctant to cover it. As a result, many people who need it, doctors say, are forced to go without it.
"For those of us in the field who work with severe asthmatics and see how limited they are, it's frustrating because we have this new therapy, we've seen it work, and the data says it works," said Dr. Roy St. John, a pulmonary disease specialist at Columbus Pulmonary and Critical Care in Ohio. "But the big insurers have all denied it."
Although bronchial thermoplasty was approved by the F.D.A. only two years ago, clinical studies on it began in 2000. Since then, about 650 patients across the country have had the procedure.
It takes place in three steps, each separated by about three weeks. Each time, a different section of the lungs is treated. Some patients report temporary coughing, mucus and other respiratory symptoms brought on by irritation of airways.
But several five-year studies showed no long-term safety issues. And researchers at Washington University School of Medicine found that compared with a control group, bronchial thermoplasty patients saw their asthma attacks drop by a third, their emergency room visits fall by 84 percent, and the number of days they lost from work and school drop by 66 percent.
"This isn't a cure, but it is definitely a breakthrough," said Dr. Pratik S. Patel, director of Interventional Pulmonary Medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey. "It's not going to get rid of asthma, but it is going to reduce symptoms and hospitalizations and make patients more functional in their daily life." For now, the procedure is only for severe asthmatics, who - unlike a vast majority of asthma patients - cannot keep flare-ups at bay with standard medications, said Dr. Kyle Hogarth, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago who was involved in clinical studies of the treatment.
"There are millions and millions of asthmatics," he said. "There will not be millions of thermoplasty patients."
Still, even patients with severe asthma often are denied insurance coverage for the procedure. Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, said insurers are awaiting the results of an additional five-year clinical trial, required by the F.D.A. when it approved bronchial thermoplasty. That trial will not be completed until at least 2018.
Until then, Ms. Pisano said, many insurers are denying coverage on the grounds the procedure is experimental. "The issue here for health plans is the long-term safety and efficacy have yet to be established," she said.
But three five-year studies have already been completed. Many asthma specialists believe that insurers are taking a shortsighted approach. The one-time cost of $20,000, they say, is dwarfed by the tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills and medication costs that a severe asthmatic can easily accumulate in a single year.
One such patient, Alberto Gaulion, 68, a retired importer in Miami, estimated that for much of the last decade, his insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, spent about $50,000 a year on his medical care.
"Every two or three weeks I had to go to the hospital," he said, "and I was taking everything that was on the market. I was on a cocktail of drugs."
Blue Cross would not cover the procedure for him, so Mr. Gaulion paid out of pocket when he had it in 2010. Since then, he has had no hospital visits and no asthma attacks, and takes only one medication instead of five.
"Now I can breathe," he said, "and I'm saving my insurance company a fortune."
Dr. Charlene McEvoy, a director of an asthma center run by Health Partners, the largest health plan in Minnesota, believed in thermoplasty enough to push the insurer to start covering it. Dr. McEvoy argued that it made economic sense, and earlier this year Health Partners agreed.
"When plans look at the cost savings, I think they're going to cover it," said Dr. McEvoy, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota. "You have to show that there's a return on investment."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Crops in India Wilt in a Weak Monsoon Season

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Neha Thirani contributed research from Mumbai.

 BODY:
MURUMA, India -- Vilas Dinkar Mukane lives halfway around the world from the corn farmers of Iowa, but the Indian sharecropper is at risk of losing his livelihood for the same reason: not enough rain.
With the nourishing downpours of the annual monsoon season down an average of 12 percent across India and much more in some regions, farmers in this village about 250 miles east of Mumbai are on the brink of disaster. ''If this situation continues, I'll lose everything,'' said Mr. Mukane, whose soybean, sugarcane and cotton crops were visibly stunted and wilting in his fields recently. ''Nothing can happen without water.''
Drought has devastated crops around the world this year, including corn and soybeans in the United States, wheat in Russia and Australia and soybeans in Brazil and Argentina. This has contributed to a 6 percent rise in global food prices from June to July, according to United Nations data.
India is experiencing its fourth drought in a dozen years, raising concerns about the reliability of the country's primary source of fresh water, the monsoon rains that typically fall from June to October. 
Some scientists warn that such calamities are part of a trend that is likely to intensify in the coming decades because of climate changes caused by the human release of greenhouse gases.
A paper published last month blamed global warming for a large increase in the percentage of the planet affected by extreme summer heat in the last several decades. And the World Meteorological Organization, a division of the United Nations, recently warned that climate change was ''projected to increase the frequency, intensity and duration of droughts, with impacts on many sectors, in particular food, water and energy.''
Scientists say that in addition to increasing temperatures, climate change appears to be making India and its neighbors Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh more vulnerable to erratic monsoons.
Studies using 130 years of data show big changes in rainfall in recent decades, said B. N. Goswami, director of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, a government-backed research organization. Climate models suggest that while overall rainfall should increase in the coming decades, the region can expect longer dry spells and more intense downpours -- forces that would seem to cancel each other out but in fact pose new threats.
''Heavy rains are normally short duration, and therefore the water runs off,'' said Dr. Goswami, who added that more research was needed to fully understand the impact of climate change on monsoons. ''Weak rains are important for recharging groundwater.''
India is more vulnerable to disruption from drought than countries like the United States. While agriculture accounts for just 15 percent of India's economy, half of its 1.2 billion people work on farms, and many of its poorest citizens already cannot afford enough food after price increases of 10 percent or more in the last couple of years.
''These kinds of rainfall failures have a lot of human effects,'' said Yoginder K. Alagh, chairman of the Institute of Rural Management and a former Indian minister. ''A large number of people don't get employment. There are acute drinking water problems.''
Food grain and oilseed production in India could fall up to 12 percent this year as a result of poor rain, said P. K. Joshi, director for South Asia at the International Food Policy Research Institute.
The good news is that the drought is not likely to result in widespread famine. India has more than 76 million tons of wheat, rice and other grain in storage, in part because of government support for those crops and an export ban put in place in 2008 when global food prices shot up. But analysts expect prices for dairy, meat, lentils and vegetables to rise.
Unlike the United States, where crop insurance and other government programs provide a safety net for farmers, India offers ad hoc and unpredictable government support, increasing the risk that legions of farmers will be wiped out.
If it does not rain soon, Mr. Mukane, 25, who works a field here in Muruma, said he would have to sell whatever he could to repay banks and lenders 500,000 rupees (about $9,000), much of it borrowed at an interest rate of 7 percent a month.
Weak monsoon rains were also an underlying cause of the blackouts that cut power to half of the country in July. The paucity of water lowered the supply of power from dams that account for a fifth of electric capacity, even as consumers cranked up fans and air-conditioners and farmers ran electric pumps to draw water from wells.
Across the country, rainfall has been about 12 percent below long-term averages through Sept. 2. But that broad number belies the acute pain in many parts of the country. Rainfall here in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra state is down 36 percent. In parts of the north and west, it is down 13 to 72 percent. At the same time, heavy rain and flooding have displaced tens of thousands in the eastern state of Assam.
Experts say the impact of the poor monsoon rains has been compounded by mismanagement. The chief minister of Maharashtra, Prithviraj Chavan, recently said that much of the $1.5 billion a year that the state spent on water projects appeared to have been wasted, with virtually no increase in the amount of irrigated farmland over the last decade.
Kiran Singh Pal, a government engineer who manages the irrigation system in the region, said it was poorly maintained because officials like himself had not been given enough money and staff. He also said many farmers had received no government water because so much of it was cornered by a few powerful landowners.
''We have enough water to irrigate all the fields,'' Mr. Pal said. ''The problem is we don't have any control.''
Mr. Mukane, the sharecropper, and his neighbors said their problems were heightened because they received much less water this year from a nearby reservoir, which is so depleted that it can barely provide drinking water to Aurangabad, a city of 1.2 million.
Federal and state officials have begun offering small types of relief for hard-hit areas, like fodder for cattle, cheap diesel fuel and subsidized seeds.
But Bhaurao Bhanudas Date, a 48-year-old farmer near Muruma, said that what he needed most was water. He said he expected little to no return from his sugarcane and cotton crops this year and would have to fall back on the income he earned from selling fodder and milk from his five cows.
Mr. Mukane said his father recently went to a temple to pray for rain, taking a pot of river water as an offering. The family is particularly anxious because Mr. Mukane's wife is expecting their first child, and the government usually provides relief only to landowners, not to farmers who rent land.
''We keep looking up, hoping it will rain today,'' he said on a recent afternoon as clouds covered the sky. About 10 minutes later, his prayers seemed to have been answered when a light drizzle started. But it petered out after a few minutes.

HEADLINE: Literature in Any Language: Journal Takes That Literally

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
When the first issue of its new Chinese-language edition appears next month, the London-based literary journal Granta, a publication that has existed in English since the Victorian era, will have a presence in four of the five most widely spoken languages. But plans for the globalization of a leading quarterly that proudly calls itself ''the magazine of new writing'' don't stop there.
''In five years I could see us with 15 or 17 foreign editions,'' John Freeman, the editor of Granta, said in an interview in New York this summer. ''Rather than beat our heads against the wall trying to find the one creative writing student at a university who will subscribe, I want to find the people who really want and really need the magazine, wherever they are, and that means looking at the world.''
Besides English and now Chinese, Granta is also published in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Bulgarian, Swedish and Norwegian. The foreign-language editions not only feature translated versions of articles that originally appeared in the English-language Granta, but many of the editions also commission original work by local writers, some of which has in recent years made its way into the parent magazine. (Arabic is the only language in the top five that doesn't have its own edition.) 
Regardless of the language in which Granta is published, each issue is organized around a single theme, usually a place (Britain, Chicago, Russia, Australia) or a subject (work, sex, medicine, fathers). But the chosen subject is addressed through various fiction and nonfiction genres, supplied by writers both celebrated and unknown, who also make up a significant part of the magazine's readership.
''Early in my career being in Granta not only made me feel like I was riding on the coattails of some really important writers and being welcomed into the family, but stepped up my reputation and gave me some name recognition,'' said the novelist Richard Russo, whose latest book, a memoir called ''Elsewhere,'' grew out of a recent essay he wrote for Granta. ''The world of arts and literature is changing before our eyes, but Granta continues to be extraordinarily eclectic and a great magazine. They do a lot of different things there, and do them all well.''
Granta was founded in 1889 as a literary magazine at Cambridge University, its unusual name deriving from a river that flows through the town. As a student publication it provided an early outlet for British writers who would go on to be prominent in the 20th century, including A. A. Milne, E. M. Forster, Ted Hughes, Michael Frayn, Cecil Beaton and Stevie Smith.
In its modern incarnation, though, Granta dates to 1979, when, after a period of mounting financial difficulties, the magazine retooled and began to focus on writers and readers beyond the Cambridge community. Four years later it published its first list of 20 ''Best Young British Novelists,'' now a decennial feature that has given Granta international visibility and become part of the magazine's identity.
The initial list included many of the writers who now dominate British letters, among them Martin Amis, Julian Barnes, William Boyd, Kazuo Ishiguro, Ian McEwan, Salman Rushdie and Graham Swift; a new listing of writers under 40 is due next year. In 1996 Granta published the first of what are now two sets of ''Best Young American Novelists.'' The lists gave early lifts to the careers of Madison Smartt Bell, Jeffrey Eugenides, Jonathan Safran Foer, Jonathan Franzen, Nicole Krauss, Lorrie Moore, Gary Shteyngart and others.
Recognizing the literary and marketing utility of that device, Granta's international editions have followed suit: ''The Best of Young Spanish-Language Novelists'' appeared in Spanish in 2010 and in English last year, and last month the Portuguese-language edition published ''The Best Young Brazilian Writers.'' The English-language Granta plans to devote an issue to the Brazilian list next year, as does the Chinese edition, right after its inaugural issue, whose theme is Britain.
''Granta is quite famous for these projects, and we believe such lists travel well and are just like a guide for curious Chinese readers,'' Peng Lun, editor of the Chinese edition of Granta, said in a telephone interview from Shanghai. ''The readership for foreign literature is not very big here, and Chinese people are mostly unfamiliar even with writers like Salinger and Updike. But I think there is a growing audience of young, educated people, university graduates, who want to get to know these new voices.''
Though Granta is a venerable British institution, it is run these days by people whose origins are not. Mr. Freeman, who joined the magazine in 2008, is an American; his deputy, Ellah Allfrey, was born in Zimbabwe and partly educated in the United States before becoming an editor at the British publishing house Jonathan Cape; while the magazine's publisher and chief benefactor, Sigrid Rausing, is a Swedish heiress and philanthropist.
Establishing international beachheads for literary writing in English hasn't always been easy however. Granta's first foreign-language venture was in Spanish, begun nearly a decade ago, and booksellers and critics initially did not know what to make of a magazine published in book format with content that seemed to resist classification.
''Spain has had many important literary magazines, but not one that mixed short fiction, reportage and other forms of nonfiction and new journalism in an original way,'' Aurelio Major, co-editor of Granta en Español, explained. ''And of course on more than one occasion the left-wing public has confused Granta with Granma,'' the Cuban Communist Party newspaper that acts as Fidel Castro's mouthpiece.
Mr. Freeman said that Granta's editors have come to think of the foreign-language editions ''not as franchises, but as scouts'' for literary talent all over the world. That approach has also worked to the advantage of the magazine's book publishing arm, called Granta Books, which has a history of signing up writers nurtured by the magazine and steering them through larger, more ambitious projects. Recent examples of that cross-pollination include Justin Torres's 2011 novel, ''We the Animals,'' and Chinelo Okparanta's forthcoming ''Happiness, Like Water,'' which Ms. Allfrey is editing.
''It's like having a library of the best writing to pick from,'' she said. In English, Granta's most commercially successful issue was one in 2010 devoted to Pakistan, with more than 50,000 copies sold. But book sales have also grown, putting Granta in a stronger economic position than before the Great Recession began in 2008.
''We're supported by Sigrid, and that's essential to the magazine's existence,'' Mr. Freeman said. But the amount Ms. Rausing has spent to support the magazine ''has been cut in half in the last three years,'' he continued, thanks largely to subscriber growth in the United State and more ads. ''Financially the magazine is doing better than it was,'' he added.
As Granta expands, the various foreign-language editions are making recommendations to one another directly, sometimes even bypassing London. A weekly round-robin e-mail exchange among the seven editions has been instituted, and last April, during the London book fair, Mr. Freeman brought his foreign colleagues together for a dinner at Ms. Rausing's home.
''To me the most interesting aspect of the globalization of Granta is that it's creating a forum for the exchange of great writing that is not limited to a flow of English-language writing from Granta U.K. to each of the other countries but moves in all directions,'' said Roberto Feith, editorial director of Granta's Brazilian edition and an attendee at the April gathering. ''We have yet to see where this process is going to take us, but it's going to be an interesting ride.''

HEADLINE: Italy as a Renaissance Driver

 BODY:
Regarding ''The euro crisis as ethnic conflict'' (Views, Aug. 27): Nicholas Sambanis incorrectly characterizes the euro crisis as an ethnic conflict between Southern Europeans and Germans. 
Italy was not among the enumerated nations in the pejorative porcine acronym PIGS. The original roll call comprised Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain.
Lest we forget, Dublin isn't situated in the Mediterranean. (Having feasted on E.U. largess, the former Celtic Tiger fell on hard times when its bloated real estate bubble burst.)
Recognizing his nation's structural ills, Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy made significant strides in restoring market confidence and righting Rome's ship of state.
Indeed, Olli Rehn, the E.U. commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, recently lauded Italy's efforts to bring its debt under control, hailing the Italian leader for having ''achieved many goals in little time.''
According to Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, Italy ''has made remarkable progress in the last six months.'' Mr. Schäuble also noted that once Mr. Monti's budget polices are implemented, Italy will boast the highest primary surplus (before interest payments) in the euro region.
As the third largest economy in the euro zone -- and Europe's second-largest manufacturing and industrial base (after Germany) -- the Magic Boot is part of the Continent's renaissance, not the source of its demise.

HEADLINE: Bags Made by Hand, in East Africa

BYLINE: By SUZY MENKES

 BODY:
GILGIL, KENYA -- It was a song of welcome from women turning cast-off men's shirts into handbag linings. The words rang like a hymn across the Ngong hills, echoing through the scrubby town, as small children clung to their mothers and joined in the chorus.
Among the bursts of laughter were two words that seemed unlikely to have come out of a local community in Africa: ''Stella!'' ''Vivienne!''
The poorest of the poor -- Masai women escaping polygamous menfolk or artisans from Nairobi's chaotic slums -- are making handbags for Western designers to sell to the wealthy. And that provides food for thought as yet another round of international fashion shows begins this week in New York. 
Stella McCartney, Vivienne Westwood, Ilaria Venturini Fendi and the Australian Sass & Bide are just four fashion companies engaged in making products in a way that irrigates arid lives. They may also be reflecting a new vision of luxury that involves human hands, respect for the environment and decency in employment.
At the heart of the African fashion collectives is Simone Cipriani, an Italian from his country's leather industry who has made it a mission for the United Nations to develop an Ethical Fashion Initiative at the International Trade Center in Geneva. (The I.T.C. is a joint body of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization.)
''I am passionate, I am Italian, I roar like a lion,''said Mr. Cipriani as he sorted out a business problem on his cell phone, while driving up the Great Rift Valley pass with its galloping zebras and grazing rhinos.
The essence of the I.T.C. work is summed up in a single phrase: ''Not Charity. Just Work.''
Mr. Cipriani first saw the potential of Africa as a fashion provider in Ethiopia 15 years ago, when his enthusiasm persuaded the Geneva-based organization to finance a business that connected marginalized communities with the fashion chain.
''We created a business model -- a system to organize employment and therefore give dignity to people,'' Mr. Cipriani said. ''Another kind of fashion is possible, bringing social and environmental sensibility.''
At the I.T.C. hub for fashion design and its creation, set in the GoDown arty area in Nairobi, the fruit of the work is in the designer purses, including sustainable bags made for Ms. Fendi's Carmina Campus line. The illustrious Italian company with her family name has even sent a video from its bag experts explaining how to develop technique to a luxury level.
''It's great to think that my fashion background is benefiting these people who have the possibility to become future, self-sustained micro-entrepreneurs, which is one of the program's goals,'' Ms. Fendi said. Having worked independently in Cameroon five years ago, she joined up with the I.T.C. in 2009, and now goes to Kenya at least once a season.
Mr. Cipriani examines bags made with discarded army blankets and mosquito nets and then hugs everyone in sight. That includes Jane Mary Kabura Cheg, who is in charge of the 70 people working at the hub, stitching the shapes, pressing flat worn shirts and decorating the bags; and the British designer/organizer Jeremy Brown. He not only serves as liaison for the fashion companies but also creates lower-priced pieces for mass retailers.
Working to fair labor standards, the Kenyan artisans are paid the equivalent of $5 to $11 a day, depending on the skills. An ethical fashion tote on the Westwood Web site costs £100, or $160.
Mr. Cipriani has a dream: that Hermès will one day use the hub's 100 per cent natural leather tanned by tree bark. Meanwhile, he is proud to have engaged high fashion names, such as Vivienne Westwood. The British designer posed for pictures in the Kibera slum, where the gilded orbs that are her company logo are fashioned from metal scraps and recycled brass.
That was a life-changer for Steven Adawo Kine, a determined and energetic welder. With money made by melting metal on a basic forge in a slum hovel, he has become a registered jeweler, selling metal and bone accessories from a cabin on the outskirts of Kibera.
''The economy of the slums is in a large part recycling,'' Ms. Westwood said. ''Everything is re-used or made into something else, like toys carved out of flip-flop shoe soles or jewelry from animal bones.
''My bags remind me of my time in Nairobi,'' she continued, recalling ''a kaleidoscope of materials and surfaces'' and of drawing inspiration from the lush gardens of the wealthy, from columns of people walking to work along dusty roads, kids' school uniforms from the British colonial era, fertile landscapes and an elephant plodding beneath puffy clouds.
Masai women, in their intensely colored and decorated robes, work in the hub, using embroidery skills on the 7,000 Westwood bags produced annually.
Lisa Barratt, who is overall project manager of the Kenyan I.T.C. operation, described the impact of the orders from the Ethical Fashion Initiative as ''lasting and empowering.'' Since there is traditionally no value placed in their own communities on women's skills, learned from childhood, when the work brings in money it helps whole families out of poverty. Ms Barratt says that I.T.C. impact assessment shows that one person's income supports at least 6 to 7 family members, often enabling children to have a first opportunity of education.
Since the Stella McCartney brand has always been based on strong values -- for example, no animal has ever been slaughtered for her bags or shoes -- the designer has been drawn to the cooperative.
''Working with human hands has always been the goal in our house,'' says Ms. McCartney, who dreams of bringing her four children to Kenya to see the wildlife.
''No matter where the touch is from, I cherish the thought that people are in contact with our product and that soul and love are in each quality piece,'' the designer said. ''To have the work in Kenya is important -- not only to support women and give them a much-needed income, but also to encourage this line of industry for small communities.''
Ms. McCartney described the experience as ''a two-way street -- everyone feels valid.'' She also praised the support from her parent luxury company PPR where she is involved in its Foundation for Women's Dignity and Rights.
New to the bag makers are the Australian designers Sarah-Jane Clarke (Sass) and Heidi Middleton (Bide), who are able to entice Southern Hemisphere customers through the Western winter.
''The social responsibility element is the strongest attraction to this project,'' Ms. Middleton said. ''I have always believed it is essential that compassion, generosity of spirit and business should mix. It is what we have built our business on and what I directly correlate with our success. It seems so obvious: by giving tactically, emotionally, financially or spiritually, the receiver benefits, the giver feels happier, lighter, more positive and the whole process initiates a butterfly effect of goodness.''
Behind the I.T.C. project lies a question: To go for quality or quantity?
Mr. Cipriani says that building highly developed skills is valuable and lasting. Yet he is also aware that numbers count. At a collective in Dagoretti, in Nairobi's western suburbs, women are crocheting ink-blue purses destined for a low-price, fast-fashion store. And the executive is courting big retailers like Macy's in New York and Top Shop in London.
''For the next seven years, I have a new dream,'' Mr. Cipriani said. ''I would like to have three times the people we now have at work -- from 7,000 to over 20,000 in western Africa.
By creating goods that the international world is prepared to buy -- not just ''pity purchasing'' for tourists -- Mr. Cipriani might just reach his goal of ''fair and responsible'' growth for bigger brands and a wider audience.

HEADLINE: Hoping That Art Will Continue to Pay Off

BYLINE: By SONIA KOLESNIKOV-JESSOP

 BODY:
Investors in fine art are probably happy that the first half of 2012 is over: It has been a disappointing period, especially in Asia.
But investors and dealers are hopeful that the rest of the year will see a rebound, both in supply of fine art at auction and in the prices paid, if the world economic picture becomes clearer.
After results in 2011 confirmed the Chinese art auction market as the largest in the world, total auction sales for all categories this spring from the ''Big Four'' auction houses in Asia -- Sotheby's Hong Kong, Christie's Hong Kong, China Guardian, and Beijing Poly international Auction Co. -- were $1.5 billion, a 32 percent decline from the autumn auction season of 2011, according to estimates by ArtTactic, a market research firm. 
Anders Petterson, managing director of ArtTactic, said he believed the recent cooling in Asia reflected a decline in speculative buying, as ''short-term investors realize their ability to quickly flip works at a profit is no longer viable.''
Sales of Asian art in Hong Kong, which had expanded drastically in 2011, fell significantly in the first half of the year at a time when they were rising in Europe and New York, prompting commentators to wonder whether the art bubble in China had finally been pricked.
So far this year Asian art buyers have not made their presence felt as strongly in Hong Kong and on the mainland, though they have raised their profile elsewhere around the world.
In fact, Christie's, which reported a 26 percent drop in sales volume in Hong Kong for the first half of the year compared with the period in 2011, also reported a 31 percent increase in the number of Asian clients registering to bid in New York and London.
François Curiel, president of Christie's Asia, said he believed that the Chinese art market was mainly in a consolidation phase, and that the poor performance of the Asian auction market in the first half, relative to that of Europe and the United States, was partly due to a drop in supply rather than demand.
''We had fewer works of art for sale in the first half of 2012,'' he said by telephone, ''one of the reasons being that there is so much financial uncertainty at the moment around the world, so many sellers are hanging on their property, rather than selling and having to decide how to invest the funds: in Hong Kong dollars, U.S. dollars, renminbi.''
Mr. Curiel also noted that the increase in sales volumes in 2011 over the previous year had been so strong, ''it was difficult to sustain.''
Christie's sales in Asia in the first half of 2011 totaled $488 million, but fell to $374 million in the second half of 2011 and then to $367 million in the first half of 2012. ''So we're on a par with the second half of 2011,'' Mr. Curiel said, ''and I think that's what we will see in the fall of 2012, unless a fabulous collection comes up for sale in November.''
Auction houses around the world had mixed results in the first half of the year. Even as sales in Hong Kong were falling, Christie's announced worldwide sales for the first half of 2012 of $3.5 billion, up 11 percent from a year earlier. Sotheby's reported a 16 percent decline in total revenue for the first half of the year, to $408.9 million, even with the sale of Edvard Munch's ''The Scream'' for $119.9 million, the highest price ever for any work of art at auction.
During an earnings call with analysts on August 7, Sotheby's chief executive, William Ruprecht, attributed the decline in results to economic weakness worldwide and fewer single-owner sales than in the spring of 2011, a record-breaking season.
He acknowledged that the Asian business had slowed -- Sotheby's Hong Kong sales were down about $131 million from the previous year -- but added that the auction house's business in Asia remained ''very profitable and a source of substantial opportunity with new wealthy collectors.''
He added that luxury goods companies, a barometer of spending trends among the wealthy, had posted higher first-half earnings in Asia, which was reassuring, he said.
Carson Chan, managing director of Bonhams Asia, said he thought the dip in sales to Chinese art investors reflected the economic turmoil.
''Chinese buyers may be in the art market 50 percent for the heart and 50 percent for investment,'' he said by telephone from Taipei. ''They buy because they like it, but they also want to invest.''
''I think Chinese buyers are now buying more carefully and more selectively,'' he added. ''They will only invest in pieces that have both a historical significance and art value. So you have to have extremely clean provenance and background, and this goes across the board between paintings and ceramics.''
Mr. Petterson, of ArtTactic, said the autumn sales would provide a good test of whether the art market in Asia was poised for recovery.
He acknowledged that there could be further declines if ''the slowdown is triggering a significant negative shift in market confidence.'' But he said he believed that Chinese buyers still considered art a good addition to their portfolios.
''With other investment asset classes performing poorly, art will still be viewed as an alternative investment,'' he said.
Mr. Curiel, of Christie's, echoed that sentiment. ''Art is still viewed as a good investment in the Chinese collector's mind,'' he said. ''I have yet to meet someone who buys art and think they are going to lose money.''

HEADLINE: Credit Cards Lure the Top End

BYLINE: By SONIA KOLESNIKOV-JESSOP

 BODY:
High-end services and lavish benefits are the weapons of choice of marketers hoping to attract ultra-high-net-worth individuals to their products.
With the number of wealthy still rising strongly in Asia, banks have been rolling out new credit cards over the past year to capture their attention and compete for their business.
Until recently, the high-end credit card market was served primarily by American Express and its invitation-only Centurion card. But competition has heated up.
In late 2010, Citibank reintroduced the Ultima card in Singapore, its most prestigious lifestyle card targeting those with 5 million Singapore dollars, or $4 million, of investable assets under management at the bank. The card is now also available in Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan. 
Also in Singapore, DBS Bank introduced the Insignia Visa Infinite card last year for clients with a minimum of 3 million dollars of assets under investment with the bank, or those with an annual income of at least 500,000 dollars.
The UOB Privilege Reserve Card, also introduced last year, is extended to customers with assets under management at the bank of at least 2 million dollars.
The latest to join the fray in the region will be MasterCard, which intends to introduce its World Elite card in several Asian markets soon. The card, which was introduced in the United States in 2006 and in Europe last year, is aimed at private banking clients and provides various travel benefits, like complimentary airline seat upgrades and discounts on private jet rental, along with travel services and a 24/7 concierge service.
''This card is not only about the benefits, but also about experiences and exclusivity,'' said Porush Singh, a senior vice president of MasterCard for the Middle East, Africa and the Asia-Pacific region. ''Each bank will come up with their minimum requirements for the customer to be able to get the card, but this is really for the top-tier banking customers.''
All of the cards are characterized by a high level of service, with dedicated concierges or ''lifestyle managers'' that cardholders can call at any time to get help organizing exclusive travel experiences, securing a hard-to-get luxury handbag or booking a last-minute table at a top restaurant.
''At this level, exclusivity and personalization is very important,'' said Ooi Huey Tyng, head of cards and unsecured loans at DBS Bank. ''Clients also expect a very different level of service; they expect you to know their taste and understand their needs. They want things they otherwise have no access to, or that would require them time to source.''
Sometimes the requests are for things that are more rare than costly. At UOB, one consultant helped a cardholder in Singapore locate a renowned specialty bakery in Switzerland and send a flourless, gluten-free cake to a loved one who has dietary restrictions.
Ms. Ooi said the most unusual request her bank had received was from a client who wanted to create a personalized photo album as a thank-you gift. The concierge went to the client's home to look through some old photo albums to help determine the pictures.
Despite the economic downturn in Europe and the United States, which is beginning to have a more significant impact on Asian economies, Mr. Singh said he believed the time was still right to introduce credit cards for high-net-worth individuals, who are ''typically high spending and low risk.''
The Asia-Pacific region now has the largest population of high-net-worth individuals, at 3.37 million, surpassing North America with 3.35 million, according to World Wealth Report 2012, an annual survey by the private bank RBC Wealth Management with the consulting firm Capgemini.
North America remains the largest region in terms of overall wealth, at $11.4 trillion compared to $10.7 trillion in Asia-Pacific. In Singapore, the total number of high-net-worth individuals declined 7.8 percent in 2011, to 91,200. But according to a Boston Consulting Group's report, ''The Battle to Regain Strength: Global Wealth 2012,'' the city-state retained the highest density of millionaire households in 2011, with more than 17 percent of all households having private wealth of $1 million or higher. Next came Qatar (14.3 percent), Kuwait (11.8 percent), and Switzerland (9.5 percent).
In fact, wealthy Asians have still been spending despite the crisis. Yat-Chung Koh, president for Asia of international consumer and small business services at American Express International, said the company's cardholders in Singapore were purchasing more big-ticket items this year, with the number of transactions exceeding 100,000 Singapore dollars increasing more than 50 percent in the first five months of the year from the period last year.
Jacquelyn Tan, head of cards at Citibank, said it was experiencing the same growth in spending by wealthy cardholders. ''This year, we have seen almost a 2.5 times growth in the first half of the year over the same period last year,'' she said, referring to the Ultima card. She added that the average annual amount spent on the card was ''easily more than $500,000.''
The number of these new cards issued remains relatively low: Ms. Tan said the number of clients using the Ultima card was now ''in the thousands.'' The card issuers said they were not aggressively trying to increase the number of cardholders because they wished to keep the service exclusive and maintain high standards for membership.
Ms. Ooi of DBS Bank said there were now about 1,000 people in Singapore holding its Insignia card, which comes with a spending limit of 1 million dollars. The average customer is 35 to 45 years old, was educated overseas and is well-traveled. ''So far the highest single transaction was at over 900,000 dollars for a luxury car,'' she said.
Mr. Koh said there were common traits between wealthy Asian credit-card holders and their Western counterparts. ''In general, people look for very fine dining places, the best experiences when they travel, very exclusive ones,'' he said. ''But in Asia, we do have Centurion card members making purchases with their cards of art pieces, exclusive jewelry items, collectibles in general.''
Mr. Singh of MasterCard said he believed that Western customers were looking more at the rewards and services their cards offered, and less at lifestyle benefits. ''It's the purchasing of goods versus experiential benefits,'' he said. In Asia, ''exclusive experiences are valued.''
One reward, however, is particularly popular with Asian clients: air miles to use for free airplane tickets or upgrades.
''They can never get enough of those,'' Ms. Ooi said, ''because when they travel, they may bring their whole family and have them travel in business class for free. It's not so much they can't afford it, but they feel they're already spending so much.''

HEADLINE: Preparing for Market Turbulence

BYLINE: By SONIA KOLESNIKOV-JESSOP

 BODY:
The coming months could be challenging for investors, as economic and market turmoil present risks to be managed. Chew Soon Gek, head of strategy and economic research for the Asia-Pacific region at the Credit Suisse Private Banking office in Singapore, spoke recently about how people with high net worth should be adjusting their holdings.
Q. Going into September, risk factors -- in Europe and elsewhere -- are likely to come back on the horizon. What should investors do? 
A. We're still advising clients to overweight equities because of expectations of cuts in interest rates by the European Central Bank, among others. We believe that markets are headed for a short-term consolidation at current levels, and we retain a constructive strategic view on equities as an asset class over six to 12 months. We have reduced our positions in high-yield and emerging market debt from overweight to neutral on account of the strong performance this year, and now await confirmation of an improved economic outlook in the U.S. and clarification on the implementation of E.C.B. measures, particularly its bond purchases of peripheral European countries.
We have moved from underweight government bonds back to neutral, but over all remain underweight in fixed income as an asset class. And we have also moved from overweight to neutral on commodities, as global economic momentum has not turned positive yet.
Q. Do you think Asian investors fully appreciate the seriousness of the European debt crisis?
A. Clearly, Asian investors see and appreciate the risks to their portfolios, and many of the businesses they manage are impacted by changes in demand in the developed world, as well as currency volatility. Most client questions relate to likely outcomes for the euro zone debt crisis, the timing of key political and central bank meetings, and the adequacy of the bailout funds.
That said, many countries in Asia, particularly in Asean [the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which includes Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam], have experienced strong domestic demand growth this year, and that has kept these economies and some of their stock markets well supported, in contrast to the situation in peripheral Europe.
Q. Which Asian equity markets do you favor, and why?
A. Our favored markets are China, Hong Kong and Singapore. China has been a laggard, but we believe that Chinese equities offer value and upside at this point. Uncertainties over the leadership transition and policies have added to the risk premium over the past few months but should abate with the announcements of the final members of the Politburo Standing Committee in the remaining months of the year. The effects of the policy-easing measures like cuts in interest rates and reserve ratio requirements, and the resurgence of investment demand, should become more visible towards the fourth quarter of 2012, and once earnings stabilize, the equity markets should perform better.
In Hong Kong, both the Hang Seng index and the Hang Seng China enterprises index are trading at a 15-year low, based on predictions for price-earnings ratios over the next 12 months.
Singapore stands out as the only market in Asia with upgrades in analysts' consensus earnings in the last three months. Valuation, while not as attractive as before given the run-up in prices, is in line with historical averages. The Singapore market continues to enjoy one of the highest dividend yields in Asia at 3.7 percent.
How much in bonds and other debt instruments should I be holding right now?
A. They would be kept fairly low in a portfolio of financial assets. Not only are cash yields close to zero, but two-year government bond yields in Germany and Switzerland are negative.
Q. Should I invest in commodities?
A. Investors could consider an allocation to gold of about 2 percent to 5 percent in a moderate risk portfolio. Gold is a store of value that would hold up in the event of a currency crisis and a return of inflation. Oil prices should remain supported amid strong seasonal demand and resurfacing geopolitical tensions.

HEADLINE: Elephants Dying in Epic Frenzy As Ivory Fuels Wars and Profits

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN; Isma'il Kushkush contributed reporting from Omdurman, Sudan; Mia Li from Beijing; and a Somali journalist from Mogadishu, Somalia.

 BODY:
GARAMBA NATIONAL PARK, Democratic Republic of Congo -- In 30 years of fighting poachers, Paul Onyango had never seen anything like this. Twenty-two dead elephants, including several very young ones, clumped together on the open savanna, many killed by a single bullet to the top of the head.
There were no tracks leading away, no sign that the poachers had stalked their prey from the ground. The tusks had been hacked away, but none of the meat -- and subsistence poachers almost always carve themselves a little meat for the long walk home.
Several days later, in early April, the Garamba National Park guards spotted a Ugandan military helicopter flying very low over the park, on an unauthorized flight, but they said it abruptly turned around after being detected. Park officials, scientists and the Congolese authorities now believe that the Ugandan military -- one of the Pentagon's closest partners in Africa -- killed the 22 elephants from a helicopter and spirited away more than a million dollars' worth of ivory. 
''They were good shots, very good shots,'' said Mr. Onyango, Garamba's chief ranger. ''They even shot the babies. Why? It was like they came here to destroy everything.''
Africa is in the midst of an epic elephant slaughter. Conservation groups say poachers are wiping out tens of thousands of elephants a year, more than at any time in the previous two decades, with the underground ivory trade becoming increasingly militarized.
Like blood diamonds from Sierra Leone or plundered minerals from Congo, ivory, it seems, is the latest conflict resource in Africa, dragged out of remote battle zones, easily converted into cash and now fueling conflicts across the continent.
Some of Africa's most notorious armed groups, including the Lord's Resistance Army, the Shabab and Darfur's janjaweed, are hunting down elephants and using the tusks to buy weapons and sustain their mayhem. Organized crime syndicates are linking up with them to move the ivory around the world, exploiting turbulent states, porous borders and corrupt officials from sub-Saharan Africa to China, law enforcement officials say.
But it is not just outlaws cashing in. Members of some of the African armies that the American government trains and supports with millions of taxpayer dollars -- like the Ugandan military, the Congolese Army and newly independent South Sudan's military -- have been implicated in poaching elephants and dealing in ivory.
Congolese soldiers are often arrested for it. South Sudanese forces frequently battle wildlife rangers. Interpol, the international police network, is now helping to investigate the mass elephant killings in the Garamba park, trying to match DNA samples from the animals' skulls to a large shipment of tusks, marked ''household goods,'' recently seized at a Ugandan airport.
The vast majority of the illegal ivory -- experts say as much as 70 percent -- is flowing to China, and though the Chinese have coveted ivory for centuries, never before have so many of them been able to afford it. China's economic boom has created a vast middle class, pushing the price of ivory to a stratospheric $1,000 per pound on the streets of Beijing.
High-ranking officers in the People's Liberation Army have a fondness for ivory trinkets as gifts. Chinese online forums offer a thriving, and essentially unregulated, market for ivory chopsticks, bookmarks, rings, cups and combs, along with helpful tips on how to smuggle them (wrap the ivory in tinfoil, says one Web site, to throw off X-ray machines).
Last year, more than 150 Chinese citizens were arrested across Africa, from Kenya to Nigeria, for smuggling ivory. And there is growing evidence that poaching increases in elephant-rich areas where Chinese construction workers are building roads.
''China is the epicenter of demand,'' said Robert Hormats, a senior State Department official. ''Without the demand from China, this would all but dry up.''
He said that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who condemned conflict minerals from Congo a few years ago, was pushing the ivory issue with the Chinese ''at the highest levels'' and that she was ''going to spend a considerable amount of time and effort to address this, in a very bold way.''
Foreigners have been decimating African elephants for generations. ''White gold'' was one of the primary reasons King Leopold II of Belgium turned Congo into his own personal fief in the late 19th century, leading to the brutal excesses of the upriver ivory stations thinly fictionalized in Joseph Conrad's novel ''Heart of Darkness'' and planting the seeds for Congo's free fall today.
Ivory Coast got its name from the teeming elephant herds that used to frolic in its forests. Today, after decades of carnage, there is almost no ivory left.
The demand for ivory has surged to the point that the tusks of a single adult elephant can be worth more than 10 times the average annual income in many African countries. In Tanzania, impoverished villagers are poisoning pumpkins and rolling them into the road for elephants to eat. In Gabon, subsistence hunters deep in the rain forest are being enlisted to kill elephants and hand over the tusks, sometimes for as little as a sack of salt.
Last year, poaching levels in Africa were at their highest since international monitors began keeping detailed records in 2002. And 2011 broke the record for the amount of illegal ivory seized worldwide, at 38.8 tons (equaling the tusks from more than 4,000 dead elephants). Law enforcement officials say the sharp increase in large seizures is a clear sign that organized crime has slipped into the ivory underworld, because only a well-oiled criminal machine -- with the help of corrupt officials -- could move hundreds of pounds of tusks thousands of miles across the globe, often using specially made shipping containers with secret compartments.
The smugglers are ''Africa-based, Asian-run crime syndicates,'' said Tom Milliken, director of the Elephant Trade Information System, an international ivory monitoring project, and ''highly adaptive to law enforcement interventions, constantly changing trade routes and modus operandi.''
Conservationists say the mass kill-offs taking place across Africa may be as bad as, or worse than, those in the 1980s, when poachers killed more than half of Africa's elephants before an international ban on the commercial ivory trade was put in place.
''We're experiencing what is likely to be the greatest percentage loss of elephants in history,'' said Richard G. Ruggiero, an official with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
Some experts say the survival of the species is at stake, especially when many members of the African security services entrusted with protecting the animals are currently killing them.
''The huge populations in West Africa have disappeared, and those in the center and east are going rapidly,'' said Andrew Dobson, an ecologist at Princeton. ''The question is: Do you want your children to grow up in a world without elephants?''
'We Shoot First'
Garamba National Park is a big, beautiful sheet of green, 1,900 square miles, tucked in the northeastern corner of Congo. Picture a sea of chest-high elephant grass, swirling brown rivers, ribbons of papyrus and the occasional black-and-white secretary bird swooping elegantly through rose-colored skies. Founded in 1938, Garamba is widely considered one of Africa's most stunning parks, a naturalist's dream.
But today, it is a battlefield, with an arms race playing out across the savanna. Every morning, platoons of Garamba's 140 wildlife rangers suit up with assault rifles, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. Luis Arranz, the park manager, wants to get surveillance drones, and the nonprofit organization that runs the park is considering buying night-vision goggles, flak jackets and pickup trucks with mounted machine guns.
''We don't negotiate, we don't give any warning, we shoot first,'' said Mr. Onyango, the chief ranger, who worked as a game warden in Kenya for more than 20 years. He rose to a high rank but lost his job after a poaching suspect died in his custody after being whipped.
''Out here, it's not michezo,'' Mr. Onyango said, using the Swahili word for games.
In June, he heard a burst of gunfire. His rangers did a ''leopard crawl'' on their bellies for hours through the scratchy elephant grass until they spied poachers hacking several elephants. The instant his squad shot at the poachers, the whole bush came alive with crackling gunfire.
''They opened up on us with PKMs, AKs, G-3s, and FNs,'' he said. ''Most poachers are conservative with their ammo, but these guys were shooting like they were in Iraq. All of a sudden, we were outgunned and outnumbered.''
Both of the rangers' old belt-fed machine guns jammed that day, and they narrowly escaped (11 have been killed since 2008 and some of the rangers' children have even been kidnapped). Later investigation showed that the poachers were members of the Lord's Resistance Army, a brutal rebel outfit that circulates in central Africa, killing villagers and enslaving children. American Special Operations troops are helping several African armies hunt down the group's phantom of a leader, Joseph Kony, who is believed to be hiding in a remote corner of the Central African Republic.
Ivory may be Mr. Kony's new lifeline.
Several recent escapees from the L.R.A. said that Mr. Kony had ordered his fighters to kill as many elephants as possible and send him the tusks.
''Kony wants ivory,'' said a young woman who was kidnapped earlier this year near Garamba and did not want to be identified because she was still terrified. ''I heard the other rebels say it many times: 'We need to get ivory and send it to Kony.' ''
She said that in her four months in captivity, before she ran away one night when the rebels got drunk, she saw them kill 10 elephants, wrap the tusks in cloth sacks and send them to Mr. Kony at his hiding place.
Other recent escapees said that the group had killed at least 29 elephants since May, buying guns, ammunition and radios with the proceeds. Mr. Kony may be working with Sudanese ivory traders. One ivory retailer in Omdurman, Sudan, who openly sells ivory bracelets, prayer beads and carved tusks, said the Lord's Resistance Army was one source of the ivory he saw.
''The L.R.A. works in this, too; that's how they buy their weapons,'' the shopkeeper said matter-of-factly. That made sense, American officials said, given Mr. Kony's few sources of income.
Several Sudanese ivory traders said the ivory from Congo and the Central African Republic moved overland across Sudan's vast western desert region of Darfur and then up to Omdurman, all with the help of corrupt Sudanese officials. There is a well-worn practice in Sudan called ''buying time,'' in which smugglers pay police officers and border guards for a specified amount of time to let a convoy of illegal goods slip through checkpoints.
But there are many routes. On Africa's east coast, Kenya's port city of Mombasa is a major transshipment center. A relatively small percentage of containers in Mombasa is inspected, and ivory has been concealed in shipments of everything from avocados to anchovies. Sometimes it is wrapped in chili peppers, to throw off the sniffer dogs.
On the west coast, in the Gulf of Guinea, ''there is a relatively recent phenomenon of well-armed, sophisticated poachers who load their ivory onto Chinese fishing ships,'' one senior American official said.
Chinese officials declined to discuss any aspect of the ivory trade, with one representative of the Forestry Ministry, which handles ivory issues, saying, ''This is a very sensitive topic right now.''
Several Sudanese ivory traders and Western officials said that the infamous janjaweed militias of Darfur were also major poachers. Large groups of janjaweed -- the word means horseback raider -- were blamed for killing thousands of civilians in the early 2000s, when Darfur erupted in ethnic conflict. International law enforcement officials say that horseback raiders from Darfur wiped out thousands of elephants in central Africa in the 1980s. Now they suspect that hundreds of janjaweed militiamen rode more than 600 miles from Sudan and were the ones who slaughtered at least 300 elephants in Bouba Ndjida National Park in Cameroon this past January, one of the worst episodes of elephant slaughter recently discovered.
In 2010, Ugandan soldiers, searching for Mr. Kony in the forests of the Central African Republic, ran into a janjaweed ivory caravan. ''These guys had 400 men, pack mules, a major camp, lots of weapons,'' a Western official said. A battle erupted and more than 10 Ugandans were killed.
''It just shows you the power of poaching, how much money you can make stacking up the game,'' the official said.
Businessmen are clearly bankrolling these enormous ivory expeditions, both feeding off and fueling conflict, Western officials and researchers say.
''This is not just freelance stuff,'' said Mr. Hormats, the State Department official. ''This is organized crime.''
Paul Elkan, a director at the Wildlife Conservation Society, said that the janjaweed sweeping across central Africa on ambitious elephant hunts ''goes much deeper than a bunch of guys coming in on horses. It has to do with insecurity and lawlessness.''
Perhaps no country in Africa is as lawless as Somalia, which has languished for more than 20 years without a functioning central government, spawning Islamist militants, gunrunners, human traffickers and modern-day pirates. Ivory has entered this illicit mix.
Several Somali elders said that the Shabab, the militant Islamist group that has pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda, recently began training fighters to infiltrate neighboring Kenya and kill elephants for ivory to raise money.
One former Shabab associate said that the Shabab were promising to ''facilitate the marketing'' of ivory and have encouraged villagers along the Kenya-Somalia border to bring them tusks, which are then shipped out through the port of Kismayo, a notorious smuggling hub and the last major town the Shabab still control.
''The business is a risk,'' said Hassan Majengo, a Kismayo resident with knowledge of the ivory trade, ''but it has an exceptional profit.''
'Easy Money'
That profit is not lost on government soldiers in central Africa, who often get paid as little as $100 a month, if they get paid at all.
In Garamba, the park rangers have arrested many Congolese government soldiers, including some caught with tusks, slabs of elephant meat and the red berets often worn by the elite presidential guard.
''An element of our army is involved,'' acknowledged Maj. Jean-Pierrot Mulaku, a Congolese military prosecutor. ''It's easy money.''
Congolese soldiers have a long history of raping and killing civilians and pilfering resources. According to a report written in 2010 by John Hart, an American scientist and one of the top elephant researchers in Congo, the ''Congolese military are implicated in almost all elephant poaching,'' making the military ''the main perpetrator of illegal elephant killing in D.R.C.''
The Garamba rangers and a Congolese government intelligence officer said that they also routinely battled soldiers from the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the military of South Sudan. A South Sudanese military spokesman denied that, saying that the soldiers ''didn't have time'' for poaching.
The American government has provided $250 million in nonlethal military assistance to South Sudan during the past several years. In May, the Garamba rangers said they had opened fire on four South Sudanese soldiers who had poached six elephant tusks. The rangers said they killed one soldier, though they did not seem to think too much about it.
''I've killed too many people to count,'' said Alexi Tamoasi, a veteran ranger.
But the suspected helicopter poaching is something new.
Mr. Onyango said the strange way the elephant carcasses were found, clumped in circles, with the calves in the middle for protection, was yet another sign that a helicopter had corralled them together because elephants usually scatter at the first shot.
African Parks, the South Africa-based conservation organization that manages Garamba, has photographs of an Mi-17 military transport helicopter flying low over the park in April and said it had traced the chopper's registration number to the Ugandan military.
Col. Felix Kulayigye, a spokesman for the Ugandan military, acknowledged that the helicopter was one of its aircraft. But he said that the poaching allegation was a ''baseless rumor'' and that he knew ''for sure'' that Lord's Resistance Army members were ''well known'' poachers in that area.
John Sidle, an American from Nebraska who works as a pilot at Garamba, said, ''What bothers me is that it's probably American taxpayer money paying for the jet fuel for the helicopter.''
The United States has paid tens of millions of dollars in recent years for fuel and transport services for the Ugandan Army to hunt down Mr. Kony in central Africa, while training Congolese and South Sudanese to help. But the State Department said it had no evidence that the Ugandan military was responsible for the Garamba killings, nor knowledge that any of the African soldiers involved in the Kony hunt had engaged in poaching. It did not address the broader history of poaching by American-supported militaries.
In June, 36 tusks were seized at the Entebbe airport in Uganda. Eighteen of the 22 elephants killed in Garamba in March were adults that had their ivory hacked out, which would usually mean 36 tusks. The little stubs of ivory on the dead calves had been left untouched.
In 1989, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species passed a moratorium on the international commercial trade of African elephant ivory, except under a few rare circumstances. No one knows how many elephants are being poached each year, but many leading conservationists agree that ''tens of thousands'' is a safe number and that 2012 is likely to be worse than 2011.
The total elephant population in Africa is a bit of a mystery, too. The International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global conservation network, estimates from 472,269 to 689,671. But that is based on information from 2006. Poaching has dramatically increased since then, all across the continent.
Some of the recently poached elephants had been sexually mutilated, with their genitals or nipples cut off, possibly for sale -- something researchers said they had not encountered before.
''It's very disturbing,'' said Iain Douglas-Hamilton, the founder of Save the Elephants, who recently testified at a Senate hearing on ivory and insecurity.
'Like the Drug War'
Mr. Arranz, Garamba's director, has an exhausted look in his eyes. History is against him. Garamba was founded more than 70 years ago, in part to protect the rare northern white rhinoceros, which used to number more than 1,000 here. But many people in Asia believe that ground rhino horn is a cure for cancer and other ills, and it fetches nearly $30,000 a pound, more than gold. In the past few decades, as Congo has descended into chaos, rhino poachers have moved into Garamba. The park's northern white rhinos were among the last ones in the wild anywhere, but rangers have not seen any for the past five years.
Garamba faces a seemingly endless number of challenges, many connected to the utter state failure of Congo itself. Some of the rangers are poachers themselves, killing the animals they are entrusted to protect, saying their salaries are too low to live on.
''I was hungry,'' explained Anabuda Bakuli, a ranger jailed for killing a waterbuck.
It does not help that many Garamba rangers are, by their own admission, alcoholics and run up debts at the bar not far from park headquarters. Mr. Onyango, the chief, is known to drink several liters of beer in a single sitting. He talks about ''the stress.''
Poaching rates are now the highest here in central Africa, a belt of some of the most troubled countries in the world. In Chad, heavily armed horsemen, who many conservationists say were janjaweed, recently killed 3,000 elephants in just a few years.
Garamba once had more than 20,000 elephants. Last year, there were around 2,800. This year, maybe 2,400.
Every morning, if the skies are clear, Mr. Arranz flies above Garamba in a small two-seat plane, the equivalent of a Mazda Miata with wings. The emerald green savanna stretches out below him, a breathtaking sight at dawn.
But the other day, he saw something that furrowed his brow: vultures.
The next day, after a hike through the tall grass, the stench grew unbearable and the air reverberated with the sizzle of thousands of flies. ''Poached,'' Mr. Arranz said, as he discovered a dead elephant, its face cut off.
Nearby were the ashes of a small campfire.
''These guys were out here for a while,'' he said. ''If they were willing to do this for one elephant. ...'' His voice trailed off.
''It's like the drug war,'' he said later. ''If people keep buying and paying for ivory, it's impossible to stop it.''
The Price of Ivory: Articles in this series will explore how the surge in poaching of African elephants both feeds off and fuels instability on the continent.

HEADLINE: A Redoubt of Learning Holds Firm

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

 BODY:
LONDON -- To stroll out of Carlton Gardens into the elegant confines of the Royal Society is to find a trove of centuries-old wonders, from Sir Isaac Newton's reflecting telescope to the first electric machine to fantastical illustrated catalogs of fish and birds.
Then you enter the sunlight-suffused office of the society's president, Sir Paul Nurse. With his spiky mass of white hair, broad nose, ready smile and thick work boots, he looks the part of old-fashioned knight of science ready to tramp through the fens. But this Nobel Prize winner in medicine offers a very 21st-century lament.
''Policy debate these days involves trying to rubbish the science, and that is dangerous,'' Dr. Nurse says. ''Global warming denialists, those who oppose genetically modified crops and vaccinations, or the teaching of evolution: their trick is treat scientific argument as if it's a political argument, and cherry-pick data.''
Dr. Nurse feels this danger more passionately than most, for the society he presides over was the crucible of the scientific revolution that formed the modern world. The society conducts studies, consults on government panels and has 1,450 fellows, about 80 of them Nobel winners. Yet theirs is, at times, an embattled world. 
Founded in 1660, the Royal Society is the world's oldest continuous scientific society. Newton, Christopher Wren, Robert Boyle and many more came together in a spirit of revolutionary if at times eccentric inquiry. Magic and alchemy greatly fascinated the society's founders.
King Charles II granted the society a royal charter in 1662, and for centuries it hitched a ride on the back of Britain's imperial ambitions. Explorers, scientific-minded military officers and colonial officials, and merchants -- not just British -- collected specimens, mapped unknown lands and recorded observations in every corner of the globe. And they shipped all of this, with accompanying essays, to the Royal Society.
The society no longer occupies that globe-dominating perch. The United States casts a much longer shadow, with billions of dollars spent on research and industrial might; American scientists dominate many disciplines. And other nations, not least China, are gaining.
But the Royal Society's journals, particularly The Philosophical Transactions and The Proceedings of the Royal Society, remain vibrant. And British scientists often achieve a written elegance and synthesis of argument that sometimes outstrips their American counterparts.
Ask the chemist Martyn Poliakoff, the society's foreign secretary, if it and British scientists in general are still relevant, and he gives a tight welterweight's smile. ''You conflate quantity and quality,'' he says. ''We punch above our weight class.''
The society's leaders take pains to emphasize that they are not trapped in the amber of old accomplishment. The British government pays for much of the society's work, and its leaders join the robust debates of the day, on matters like global warming and genetically modified crops, which they view as a sensible answer to global scarcity.
A 2010 report from the society urged the government to invest in science, education and innovation to fuel economic development. It generated much press. But the global economic downturn thrust a dagger to the heart of its most ambitious proposals.
Of late, too, conservative critics have attached themselves like barnacles to the society's hull. The Global Warming Policy Foundation treated the society as a nest of alarmists in a recent report, ''Nullius in Verba: The Royal Society and Climate Change.'' (The Latin expression is the society's motto; it translates roughly as ''Take nobody's word for it.'') James Delingpole, the waggishly influential conservative blogger for The Telegraph, lampoons Dr. Nurse as ''easily my favorite Nobel Prize winner after Yasir Arafat, Al Gore and Barack Obama.''It's fair to say his mortar shots have not rattled the windows of the Royal Society. Dr. Nurse hiked his eyebrows and shrugged: ''We can't sit by without exposing bunkum.''
Yet doubt of a more genteel sort lingers even among members. A current society fellow, an evolutionary biologist of fine repute who asked not to be quoted by name, says he greatly enjoys the conversation at the society's dinners (he fortifies himself for the rounds of wine and port by drinking a quart of milk beforehand). But ask if the organization has much effect on the intellectual battles that roil his discipline, and he shakes his head.
''I can't say that the society is a great presence in my field,'' he says. ''It's a challenge: How do you muck your way through and remain relevant?''
At the beginning, the question facing society fellows was more elemental: How to challenge a worldview in place for thousands of years?
Mermaids Too
''And this is Sir Isaac.''
With that, the society's librarian, Keith Moore, tall, thin with a great crown of silver hair, points to the shutter-eyed and formidable visage of Isaac Newton, an early president of the Royal Society. This is his death mask, fashioned from a cast of his face, sitting on a table in front of me.
We will pass the next hour traipsing through the society archives, an expanse of four million books and journals and maps and weather charts, along with pieces collected by merchants in Azerbaijan, 18th-century traders plying the coast of Brazil and the Gobi desert of Mongolia, and fishermen bobbing in the swelling North Atlantic.
Mr. Moore rattles off the specimens and curios that constitute the society's haul. Most are cataloged, a few lost. A whale skeleton, a mammoth tusk, a mermaid. He wants to go on, but I raise my hand.
A mermaid?
He shrugs. ''How did the mermaid get on? Where is it today? Anyone's guess.''
The society took root in the soil of revolution. More than half of its founding members favored the Parliamentary cause in the 17th-century civil war that cost Charles I his crown and then his head. During that intoxicating century, nearly everything holy, from royal rank to economics to science to the immortality of the soul, was challenged. In the early days of the Royal Society, knights and earls sat shoulder to shoulder with metalsmiths and merchants.
Though rationalists, these scientists viewed God as central to their universe and their work. As Edward Dolnick, author of ''The Clockwork Universe,'' an entertaining history of the early society, noted, the founders viewed the laws of nature and God as inseparable. They were mapping his universe.
The historian Christopher Hill termed this the ''stop in the mind.'' The scientists, philosophers and politicians of any era confront limits to their consciousness. How do you imagine a world, or even know what questions to ask, when you lack reference points?
And there is that question of magic. Society members lived in a time shadowed by apocalyptic dread, from plague to fire to war. They were fascinated by alchemy, unicorns' horns and magic salves, and they often experimented on themselves.
''They researched these phenomena a lot, and they weren't all wrong,'' Mr. Moore noted. ''They knew there was an invisible world.''
Critics attacked Newton as an occultist for theorizing about gravity, as it was unseen and not mechanical. (Over his lifetime, he would write far more pages on biblical hermeneutics and occult studies than on math and science.) Still, he dominated the society's early years.
Many members considered themselves popularizers, in the best and most important sense of the word. Not Sir Isaac. Diffident, most comfortable roaming the recesses of his own mind, he cared not a whit for vox populi. He wrote his grand work on physics, ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica,'' in Latin. A copy sits in the Royal Society archives.
''Newton thought that knowledge belonged to those who were learned enough to use it,'' Mr. Moore said.
The society's influence has waxed and waned. As the founding members and their revolutionary enthusiasms passed into history, lords and earls reasserted intellectually deadening class privileges. (Although women made important if surreptitious contributions in the 18th and 19th centuries and even earlier, the society did not elect its first two female fellows until 1945.)
But always there was a hunger to find new discoveries, to record tides and temperatures, to discover new corners of a still wondrous world.
Explorers like James Cook were ardent collectors, as were many American colonialists. Benjamin Franklin joined the society, and its archives hold many of his papers. Even the early Puritans, wary of royalty, yearned for entry.
''Cotton Mather was desperate to get in,'' Mr. Moore said. ''He sent an account of a mastodon skeleton.''
Save for the odd misplaced mermaid, most of this history is splendidly cataloged. Curiously, the era most imperiled is the late 20th century. ''The 18th-century works were written on lovely, solid rag paper,'' Mr. Moore said. ''But the 1970s and 1980s -- everything was put on those early computers, and it's a disaster.
''We have to look around hard just to find people who can still work with those floppy disks.''
Could This Happen in Kansas?
That Sir Paul Nurse spends the first 20 minutes of an interview about the Royal Society talking about the role of the United States is perhaps not surprising. He served a stretch as president of Rockefeller University in New York City. What happens to science in the United States, for good and ill, is too important to ignore.
He wonders how it is that a nation that produces the wonders of Silicon Valley and great research centers in New York, Boston, Baltimore and Rochester, Minn., to name just a few, has large stretches where the theory of evolution is not taught.
''You don't hear these debates in New York City, or indeed on either coast,'' he says. ''I wonder if American science would thrive if it were based in Kansas.''
Still, he reminds himself that he is a foreigner looking in the window. ''Americans tend to like extremes. It's either 'We are on top of the world!' or 'The world is falling apart!' ''
Some of those battles have started to jump the Atlantic with more vigor than in the past. Not long ago, it was rare to hear a political challenge in Europe to the scientific consensus around global warming. Not anymore.
Dr. Nurse is careful to emphasize that skepticism is the lifeblood of science; the verities of one age can become the superstitions of another. But he can't hide his impatience with those who deny a strong human hand in global warming. You want to argue that the evidence points to only moderate warming? Brilliant; let's examine the research. But to deny it altogether? The stakes are too high to play political games, he says.
''They say: 'Well, no one believed Galileo.' As if what? That's an arrogant argument. Galileo prevailed very rapidly, as did Newton, as did Einstein,'' he says. ''The denialists have completely lost it.''
The leaders of the Royal Society conceive of themselves as a collective Cerberus, the mythical three-headed hound, guarding the doors of British science. ''We are protected against creationism and the like by our national curriculum for now,'' Dr. Nurse said. ''But we should keep a very close eye on education. The American experience tells us that we must respond robustly to challenges.''
More broadly, he doesn't fret about American dominance. That is just the way it is. Perhaps some cultural differences even accrue to the British side of the ledger.
''The U.S.A. has a very strong work ethic, and you keep a very close eye to the cutting edge,'' he says. ''We are a bit lazier. We drink more. But sometimes the science we produce is rather quirkier and more innovative.''
To walk the halls of the Royal Society is to feel the ancient excitements of science seep into your pores. But the society's real challenge, Dr. Nurse says, is to point to the more magnificent unanswered questions that remain, and so light a spark.
He recalls, as a child in Norwich, running down a dirt road in his pajamas, looking at Sputnik 2 track a distant path in the predawn sky.
''I feel utterly privileged to be a scientist at this society,'' he says. ''To be paid to think and talk about such questions?
''Astonishing.''

HEADLINE: Secretive Shell Corporations

 BODY:
TO THE EDITOR:
''A French Shift on Africa Strips a Dictator's Son of His Treasures'' (Paris Journal, Aug. 24) highlights the need for Congress to take action to abolish anonymous shell corporations. These secretive entities helped enable President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo's son to launder more than $100 million of ill-gotten gains through American banks to finance his lavish lifestyle while ordinary Equatorial Guineans remain mired in poverty. 
In most states, less information is required to create a corporation than to obtain a driver's license, and there is no requirement to disclose who owns or controls it. Such secrecy enables terrorist cells, drug traffickers and corrupt government leaders to launder money through the United States to finance illicit activities.
Anonymous shell corporations also facilitate tax evasion, thereby reducing government revenues, which is particularly destabilizing for the world economy when foreigners use anonymous American shell companies to evade taxes in their home countries.
Congress is currently considering the bipartisan Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, which would eliminate anonymous shell corporations. Law enforcement agencies, including the Departments of Justice and Treasury and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, strongly support the bill, as do anticorruption groups, faith-based organizations, small-business associations and investors. Congress should support it, too.

HEADLINE: How Plan to Help City Pay Pensions Backfired

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Jeffrey A. Michael, a finance professor in Stockton, Calif., took a hard look at his city's bankruptcy this summer and thought he saw a smoking gun: a dubious bond deal that bankers had pushed on Stockton just as the local economy was starting to tank in the spring of 2007, he said.
Stockton sold the bonds, about $125 million worth, to obtain cash to close a shortfall in its pension plans for current and retired city workers. The strategy backfired, which is part of the reason the city is now in Chapter 9 bankruptcy. Stockton is trying to walk away from the so-called pension obligation bonds and to renegotiate other debts.
After reviewing an analysis of the bond deal, underwritten by the ill-fated investment bank, Lehman Brothers, and watching a recording of the Stockton City Council meeting where Lehman bankers pitched the deal, Mr. Michael concluded that ''Stockton is entitled to some relief, due to deceptive and misleading sales practices that understated the risk.'' 
''Lehman Brothers just didn't disclose all the risks of the transaction,'' he said. ''Their product didn't work, in the same way as if they had built a marina for the city and then the marina collapsed.''
Financial analysts and actuaries say essentially the same pitch that swayed Stockton has been made thousands of times to local governments all over the country -- and that many of them were drawn into deals that have since cost them dearly.
Since virtually all pension obligation bonds turn on the same basic strategy that Stockton followed, Mr. Michael's research could be a road map for avoiding more such problems, or perhaps for seeking redress. His analysis was part of his August economic forecast for the region, which he prepares as director of the Business Forecasting Center at the University of the Pacific.
There are about $64 billion in pension obligation bonds outstanding, and even though issuance has slowed, more of the bonds are coming to market, even now.
Officials in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., are scheduled to vote on a $300 million pension obligation bond on Wednesday, for instance. Hamden, Conn., has amended its charter to allow for the bonds to rescue a city pension fund that is wasting away. Oakland, Calif., recently issued about $211 million of the bonds, following the lead of several other California cities and counties.
The basic premise of all pension obligation bonds is that a municipality can borrow at a lower rate of interest than the rate its pension fund assumes its assets will earn on average over the long term. Critics contend that municipalities that try this are in essence borrowing money and betting it on the stock market, through their pension funds. The interest on pension obligation bonds is not tax-exempt for this reason.
Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, looked at outcomes for nearly 3,000 pension obligation bonds issued from 1986 to 2009 and found that most were in the red. ''Only those bonds issued a very long time ago and those issued during dramatic stock downturns have produced a positive return,'' Ms. Munnell wrote with colleagues Thad Calabrese, Ashby Monk and Jean-Pierre Aubry. ''All others are in the red.'' Only one in five of the pension obligation bonds issued since 1992 has matured, so the results could change in the future.
Among the places where the strategy has failed miserably is New Orleans, which sold about $170 million of such debt in 2000 to produce cash to finance the pensions of 820 retired firefighters. Until then, New Orleans had never funded their benefits and simply paid them out of pocket, leaving the retirees fearful that in a budget squeeze, the city might renege.
City officials based the deal on the expectation that the bond proceeds would be invested in assets that would pay 10.7 percent a year -- an unusually aggressive assumption, but one that made the numbers work. New Orleans's credit was weak, and its borrowing rate was expected to be 8.2 percent. To get the rate on the bonds down as much as possible, New Orleans also issued variable-rate debt, combined with derivatives in an attempt to hedge against rate increases.
But instead of earning 10.7 percent a year, the bond proceeds the city set aside for the firefighters' pensions lost value over the years, first in the dot-com crash and then in the financial crisis. And instead of hedging against interest rate increases, the derivatives failed, leaving New Orleans paying 11.2 percent interest. The city also has a $115 million balloon payment coming due on the debt in March.
''We might as well hand over the keys to the city,'' New Orleans's chief administrative officer, Andy Kopplin, told reporters in July, after meeting with the Louisiana State Bond Commission to seek permission to refinance the debt. He said the next batch of pension obligation bonds would have an investment-grade rating, because they would be backed by property taxes instead of investment returns from the firefighters' pension fund. The commission approved the new bonds unanimously.
Stockton got a similar pitch in 2007 -- that it could issue municipal bonds with a lower interest rate than the California state pension system, known as Calpers, expected its investments to return annually, on average.
The year that Lehman Brothers made the pitch to Stockton, for example, the city had a shortfall of $152 million with Calpers, which administers benefits for Stockton's retirees. The gap appeared because in 1999, Stockton increased the value of the pensions its workers were earning, without making a corresponding increase in the yearly prepayments it sent Calpers to cover the cost.
No one thought it had to; Calpers's actuary had projected that investment gains would pay for most of the increase. Then the dot-com bubble burst, blowing that expectation to bits. But Stockton's workers kept on building their retirement benefits at the richer rate, so by 2006, Stockton was $152 million short of what it should have had on hand at Calpers to pay for all of its current and future retirees' pensions.
Calpers, meanwhile, was assuming that its investments would earn 7.75 percent a year over the long term. And when a city, like Stockton, had a shortfall, Calpers treated it as if that city had borrowed from the pension fund -- and it charged that city 7.75 percent interest on the loan.
Not only that, but the Lehman bankers also explained that Calpers had recently switched to a new way of billing its member cities for these ''loans.'' It wanted to help them preserve their cash in the wake of the technology crash, so it had slowed the cities' payments to Calpers. The bad news was that it had slowed them so much that the bills were compounding before any city could pay them down. That meant Stockton's debt to Calpers was just going to get bigger and bigger over the years, the bankers said.
After laying out this daunting situation, the Lehman bankers said there was a way out: Stockton could raise the $152 million all at once in the municipal bond market, send the money to Calpers and get rid of the unpayable loan. The municipal bond market would charge Stockton just 5.81 percent interest. The city would come out way ahead.
What the bankers did not say was how seldom such pension bets ever pay off.
A recording of the Stockton City Council meeting where Lehman recommended the pension obligation bond shows that members sensed there was a catch, but they had trouble nailing down what it was.
''I don't understand the bond market,'' one said as he struggled with the projections showing that Stockton could never pay down its debt to Calpers. ''Are these projections realistic?''
Another wondered whether Calpers might lower its assumed rate of return, eating into the spread Stockton hoped to achieve between the 5.81 percent and the Calpers assumed rate.
One of the Lehman bankers agreed there were risks.
''This is not a guaranteed deal,'' he said. He explained that no one would know whether Stockton had come out ahead until all the bonds had matured, 30 years in the future. He said ''the ultimate benchmark'' for Calpers's investments was Stockton's own borrowing rate, 5.81 percent.
If Calpers's investment earnings 30 years from then did not average out to at least 5.81 percent a year, he said, the bond would have been a bad idea. But then he dismissed this possibility, saying that if Calpers could not earn that much over time, ''you have much bigger problems.''
Calpers's investments lost about 25 percent of their value in the financial turmoil that began in 2008. That meant the city had a new debt to Calpers, compounding at 7.75 percent, on top of its debt to the bondholders. Stockton was worse off than ever, with 29 more years to go.
Mr. Michael, of the University of the Pacific, said Lehman Brothers had not let on that such an outcome was possible, and had, in essence, talked the City Council into making a huge gamble with public money.
Federal regulations require municipal bond underwriters to deal fairly with cities and not mislead or deceive them.
Mr. Michael said the fact that a troubled city like Stockton was able to borrow at a rate so much lower than Calpers's assumed rate of return should have raised questions. Now that the bonds are in default, it is clear that the investors who bought them were not compensated enough for the risk they took on, he said.
The investors might thus have a case against Lehman, except that Lehman is now bankrupt.
The company that insures the bonds, Assured Guaranty, will make the bondholders whole, but the policy it issued allows it to file a claim in bankruptcy against Stockton for the money it pays the bondholders. Assured Guaranty will be an unsecured creditor for the claim. It said in a statement that Stockton was trying ''to transfer the cost of lucrative, above-market employee wages and benefits, granted when tax revenues were flush, to capital market creditors by haircutting bond principal,'' which it said was unprecedented.
In another statement, the insurer said Stockton might have avoided bankruptcy entirely if it had taken steps like restructuring its debts, selling assets and ''pension reform.'' But Calpers argues that the pensions it administers cannot be reduced for current workers or retirees -- only for workers hired in the future, and Stockton is bankrupt today.
''If the city believes that third parties misrepresented the risks of the pension obligation bonds transaction, the city should seek recourse against the persons or firms responsible,'' Assured Guaranty said in a statement.

HEADLINE: The Man Behind Facebook's I.P.O. Debacle

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
It is David Ebersman's fault. There is just no way around it.
Mr. Ebersman is Facebook's well-liked, boyish-looking 41-year-old chief financial officer. He's not as well known as Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive, or Sheryl Sandberg, its chief operating officer and recently appointed director.
But when it came to Facebook's catastrophe of an initial public offering -- the stock reached a new low on Friday, closing at $18.06 -- it was Mr. Ebersman, not Mr. Zuckerberg or Ms. Sandberg, who was ultimately the one pulling the strings.
Now, three months after the offering, the company has lost more than $50 billion in market value. Let me say that again for emphasis: Facebook's market value has dropped more than $50 billion in 90 days. 
To put that in perspective, that's more market value than Lehman Brothers gave up in the entire year before it filed for bankruptcy.
A lot of ink has been spilled over Facebook's I.P.O., with investors and pundits mostly pointing the finger at the Wall Street banks, particularly Morgan Stanley, which led the offering, and at Nasdaq, whose numerous computer glitches on Facebook's first day of trading undermined confidence in the stock. They clearly deserve blame.
Mr. Ebersman's name, however, is mentioned only occasionally, usually in passing and typically only among Silicon Valley's cognoscenti.
And yet if there is one single individual more responsible than any other for the staggering mispricing of Facebook's I.P.O., it is Mr. Ebersman. He signed off on the ever-increasing offer price, which ended up at $38 after the company had originally planned a price range of $29 to $34.
He -- almost alone -- pushed to flood the market with 25 percent more shares than originally planned in the final days before the offering. And since then, as the point person for investors, he has done little to articulate how or why the company's strategy will lift the stock price any time soon.
At a time when investors are looking for some semblance of accountability on Wall Street and in corporate America, it is remarkable that nobody -- no bankers, no one at Nasdaq, no one at Facebook -- has been fired for botching the offering.
Mr. Zuckerberg reportedly told his employees after the I.P.O., ''So, you've heard we're firing David?'' But it was only a joke.
Facebook's falling stock price is not just a problem for investors; it is quickly creating real questions inside the company about its ability to retain and attract talented engineers, the lifeblood of any technology company.
Employees who joined the company starting in 2010, for example, are now holding onto restricted shares that were granted at a higher price -- $24.10 -- than the current trading price. (It should be noted that these are restricted stock units, not underwater stock options, so they do still have real value, but not nearly what the employees had expected.)
Employees with some two billion shares will have the opportunity to begin selling them this fall, which is one reason Facebook shares have been depressed lately.
A spokesman for Facebook, Elliot Schrage, declined to comment and would not make Mr. Ebersman available.
Mr. Ebersman appears to have badly misjudged the demand for Facebook's I.P.O. He was aided by errant advice from a cadre of banking advisers, who all had an incentive to sell as many shares as possible at the highest price possible. Morgan Stanley liked $38 a share, JPMorgan Chase thought the shares could be sold for even more, while Goldman Sachs thought they should be sold for slightly less -- but all of them quickly jumped on board when Mr. Ebersman made his final decision.
Determining the price of an I.P.O. is as much an art as a science. After a company's roadshow presentations, investors indicate how many shares they plan to buy. They typically ask for more shares than they expect to receive, sometimes twice as many. But in the case of Facebook, investors, anticipating huge demand, put in requests for triple or quadruple the number of shares they expected to get.
The bankers -- and Mr. Ebersman -- did not seem to appreciate what was happening. They seem to have believed their own hype and took those orders as real, giving them the misplaced confidence to push the I.P.O. to the highest possible price and issue more shares.
But this wasn't a traditional I.P.O. and should never have been priced that way. (People close to Mr. Ebersman say that he decided to issue additional shares with the goal of steadying the price this fall when the lockup on employee share sales expired. Consider that another miscalculation.)
Another issue that weighed on Mr. Ebersman, as well as the bank underwriters, was the example set by LinkedIn. Its shares rose 110 percent on its first day of trading. That might sound good, but it meant that the company mispriced the shares so badly that it effectively gave investors a gift of nearly $350 million. Mr. Ebersman was intent on making sure Facebook didn't ''leave money on the table,'' according to several people close to him. But by leaving investors with little upside, he may have created additional pressure on the stock.
Both LinkedIn's and Facebook's I.P.O.'s should be considered failures -- they were extreme examples of what could happen on the upside and the downside. The ideal offering lands somewhere in the middle. Still, there is no question that investors would prefer another LinkedIn over a Facebook, and they have every incentive to make an example of the company -- and Mr. Ebersman -- so that other companies don't try to wipe out that first-day ''pop.''
None of this is meant to suggest that Mr. Ebersman is dumb or unqualified. A graduate of Brown who was the chief financial officer of Genentech when he was just 34, Mr. Ebersman is bright, perhaps even brilliant. He was recruited to Facebook by Ms. Sandberg, a hire that was considered quite a coup at the time. He should clearly be given credit for negotiating favorable and extraordinarily large credit lines -- $8 billion worth -- with Wall Street banks, which could provide the company with an important lifeline should the economy and the company's fortunes suffer.
The disclosures in the company's I.P.O. prospectus -- which were Mr. Ebersman's responsibility -- were, for the most part, pretty transparent, giving investors a good sense of the business, despite all the hype. And the I.P.O., for all its failures, filled Facebook's coffers with some $10 billion.
Still, Mr. Ebersman has his work cut out for him as he tries to regain the trust of shareholders. He recently came to New York to meet with big investors, including hedge funds and institutional investors. Some invitations for meetings were oddly, and somewhat imperiously, sent out on Thursday night for meetings on Friday. Given that it was summer, some investors sent their junior analysts.
When Facebook's I.P.O. first started to appear troubled back in May, I purposely avoided weighing in. Frankly, I thought it was too soon to judge.
But we have passed the pivotal three-month mark.
Statistically, the three-month mark is a much better predictor of a company's future share price than any of the closing prices in the first week or two. According to Richard Peterson of Capital IQ, 67 percent of technology companies whose shares lagged their I.P.O. price after 90 days were still laggards after a year. Until Facebook's stock rebounds, Mr. Ebersman will be feeling the pressure.

HEADLINE: Union Jobs Plummet in the Private Sector

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New York City has regained all of the jobs it lost during the last recession, but its labor unions have not, and the steep decline in the last several years may signal a lasting erosion of one of the few remaining bastions of union power, according to the authors of a report to be released this week.
The number of city residents with union jobs in the private sector has dropped by nearly 20 percent since the recession started in 2008, the report by scholars at the City University of New York shows. That amounts to a loss of about 95,000 union jobs, and a decline twice as steep as that for the rest of the nation, said Ruth Milkman, a sociology professor who wrote the report with Laura Braslow. 
''This is a big decrease,'' Professor Milkman said, and she said it was unlikely to turn around anytime soon. Indeed, as the city's private sector has added jobs at a healthy rate for much of the past two years, the number of union jobs in the public sector rose but private-sector unions did not rebound, she said.
The study coincided with a report from the Fiscal Policy Institute that found that most of the jobs that have been created in the city during the economic recovery have been in industries that tend to pay low wages, including restaurants, retail and home health care.
James Parrott, chief economist for the institute, which is supported by labor unions, noted that the deep slump in construction in the city has taken a toll on unions. According to his report, ''The State of Working New York 2012,'' the number of construction jobs in the city has declined by 23,000 in the past four years.
In the boom years that preceded the financial crisis, as many as one in five city residents who worked in the private sector belonged to a union. Since the long recession set off by that crisis took hold, that proportion has dropped to about one in eight, according to the CUNY report.
''I saw this happen in California in the 1990s,'' Professor Milkman said. Such a sharp decline is difficult to turn around because the businesses created after a recession are less likely to be unionized than the older ones that failed in the downturn, she said.
The authors of the CUNY study are affiliated with the university's Joseph S. Murphy Institute for Worker Education and Labor Studies and its Center for Urban Research.
New York remains one of the last union strongholds in the private sector, and both the state and the city have higher numbers of unionized workers than any other state or big city. But those ranks are dwindling and the weakened position of unions has been evident in some closely watched labor disputes in the past year, Professor Milkman said.
She cited the strike by Verizon employees in August 2011 that lasted two weeks but still has not led to a new contract, and the move by Consolidated Edison this summer to lock out all 8,000 members of its biggest union, Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Union of America.
Mike Filippou experienced the trend personally after years of repairing and maintaining equipment at the Stella D'oro bakery in the Bronx, where workers made $18 to $22 an hour. He lost that job in 2009 when the bakery's owners decided to shut it down following a strike that lasted almost a year.
After more than six months out of work, Mr. Filippou found another union position in a bakery, but he had to look out of state to find it. He now works in an Arnold bread bakery in Greenwich, Conn., earning about as much as he did at Stella D'oro but with a less valuable pension.
''It's terrible what's happening,'' Mr. Filippou said. ''In another 10 or 15 years, there's going to be no unions left. Every union is losing members. Every company doesn't want a union, doesn't want to pay union rates.''
Another longtime Stella D'oro employee, Eddie Marrero, is now a nonunion security guard in an office building on Park Avenue in Manhattan after two years out of work, earning less than he did at the bakery and with no benefits.
''I don't think there ever will be another job like Stella D'oro,'' Mr. Marrero, 53, said.
The union local that represented the Stella D'oro workers -- Local 50 of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union -- lost so many members that it had to merge into another local, Mr. Filippou said.
The manufacturing sector, which has been on the decline in the city for decades, shed both union and nonunion jobs during the recession, the CUNY report shows. But union membership also shrank in several industries that have added significant numbers of jobs, the report shows.
Professor Milkman cited the tourism-driven hospitality sector, which has grown throughout the city. But, she added, most new hotels do not employ union members.

HEADLINE: The Elevator Speech

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Why did God put Barack Obama on this earth? If you had asked that question between his 2004 convention address and his 2008 campaign, the answer could have been summarized in a short elevator speech.
Obama was here to heal our politics, to move us beyond the stale debates and the childish partisanship that lead to stagnation, futility and silliness.
This purpose did not survive contact with reality. But President Obama found other clear missions. In 2009, his mission was to avert the worst of the financial crisis. In 2010, it was to expand health insurance coverage. 
During this time, you knew what Barack Obama was about, where his priorities lay. But, since 2010, that has not been the case. Since then, Representative Paul Ryan has been driving the Washington policy debate with his plan to cut spending and restructure entitlements. President Obama, meanwhile, has produced a string of budgets so inconsequential that members of his own party have not even noticed them.
Obama has been reactive. He has been defined by the various negotiating positions he has taken in his confrontations with Congress. He's used a more partisan political style to mask his small-bore policy substance. It's not clear what he is passionate to do if he is elected for another four years.
The Democratic convention is his best chance to offer an elevator speech, to define America's most pressing challenge and how he plans to address it.
He has three clear options.
First, global warming. President Obama has occasionally said he'd like to do something about climate change if he gets a second term. Given the country's immediate economic and fiscal problems, this seems obtuse to me. But if this is really where Obama's passion lies, he should go for it.
He could vow to double down on green energy and green technology. He could revive cap-and-trade legislation that would create incentives for clean innovation. He could propose a tax reform package that would substitute gasoline and energy consumption taxes for a piece of our current income taxes. He could say that his No. 1 international priority will be to get a global warming treaty ratified by all the major nations.
This would be a big, intellectually serious agenda, designed to address a big problem.
Second, broken capitalism. Obama could go before the convention and say that there has been a giant failure at the heart of modern capitalism. Even in good times, the wealth that modern capitalism generates is not being shared equitably. Workers are not seeing the benefits of their own productivity gains.
Obama could offer policies broad enough to address this monumental problem. He could vow to strengthen unions. He could promise to use federal funds to pay for 500,000 more teachers and two million more infrastructure jobs. He could cap the mortgage interest deduction, cap social security benefits, raise taxes on the rich, raise taxes on capital gains and embrace other measures to redistribute money from those who are prospering to those who are not. He could crack down on outsourcing and regulate trade. He could throw himself behind a new industrial policy to create manufacturing jobs.
This agenda wouldn't appeal to moderates, or people like me, but it's huge, it's serious and it would highlight a real problem.
Third, Bowles-Simpson. Everybody pays lip service to the Bowles-Simpson plan to reduce the deficit, but neither campaign really embraces it.
Obama could use his convention to throw himself wholeheartedly behind the general Bowles-Simpson approach. He could argue that America is weighed down by rotting institutions and faces fiscal ruin. He could vow to push through tax reform that would lower rates and reduce loopholes. He could endorse a 22 percent cap on government spending. He could commit to limiting the growth of domestic and defense spending. He could double down on his health care cost containment ideas. He could restructure Social Security and make it more progressive.
This, too, is a big, serious agenda, addressing a real national need. This, too, is an agenda commensurate with the size of the problem that confronts us.
Personally, I wish Obama would use this convention to embrace Bowles-Simpson. That would lay the foundation for decades of prosperity. It would galvanize a new center-left majority.
But, mostly, I wish he'd be for something. I wish he'd rise above the petty tactical considerations that have shrunk him over the past two years. I wish he'd finally define what he stands for. A liberal populist? A Clintonian moderate? At some point, you have to choose.
Four years ago, Obama said we could no longer postpone tackling the big problems. But now he seems driven by a fear of defeat. His proposals seem bite-size. If Obama can't tell us the big policy thing he wants to do, he doesn't deserve a second term.

HEADLINE: Obama Makes Detour To Visit Hurricane Site

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Trip Gabriel contributed reporting from Greenville, N.C.

 BODY:
KENNER, La. -- President Obama took a short detour from campaigning on Monday to inspect the damage wrought by Hurricane Isaac last week and the government response, a stop that took on outsized political overtones in this campaign season.
His visit, after a Labor Day rally with union supporters in Toledo, Ohio, came three days after Mitt Romney toured the Louisiana coast on Friday a day after accepting his party's nomination in Tampa, Fla. Mr. Obama's timing was decided in consultation with local officials, White House aides said, to avoid the presidential entourage getting in the way of the cleanup. 
Even as both parties jousted about their respective responses to natural disasters, Mr. Obama sounded a nonpartisan note in remarks to reporters after his tour and discussions with officials and residents.
''When disasters like this happen, we set aside whatever petty disagreements we may have,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Nobody's a Democrat or Republican. We're all just Americans looking out for each other.''
Earlier, the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, similarly told reporters aboard Air Force One that ''disasters are apolitical.'' But he and other Democratic officials faulted Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, for his efforts as the House Budget Committee chairman to cut federal disaster aid accounts -- efforts that some Republican governors also opposed.
''When it comes to the kinds of choices politicians make in Washington about what their priorities are, it is worth noting that last year there was an effort to underfund the money that's used to provide relief for Americans when they've been hit by disasters,'' Mr. Carney said. Mr. Ryan led that effort, he added.
Reacting to the criticism, Mr. Ryan's spokesman, Brendan Buck, said in a statement: ''A Romney-Ryan administration will always ensure there is disaster funding for those in need. Period.''
As Democrats gathered in Charlotte, N.C., for their convention, Mr. Ryan tried to dampen some of their party mood with an appearance in the same state, keeping the focus on the nation's economic woes in an address that drew 2,000 people at East Carolina University in Greenville.
''There's a little gathering going on over in Charlotte,'' Mr. Ryan said. He said the Democrats could not ignore the stubborn economic difficulties still felt by many people and cited the unemployment rate of 9.6 percent in North Carolina, where Mr. Obama won in 2008 but where the race is close this year, according to the latest polls.
Mr. Ryan's presence on the trail came as Mr. Romney stayed away from campaigning for a second straight day, instead vacationing at his summer home in Wolfeboro, N.H.
In his visit to Louisiana, Mr. Obama was joined by his administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Craig Fugate. Among local officials who met with him were Gov. Bobby Jindal and Senator David Vitter, both Republicans who are frequent critics of the president. Also along was Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a Democrat who led the criticism of Mr. Ryan -- and by extension Mr. Romney -- when Mr. Romney visited on Friday.
Mr. Obama toured La Place, a community in St. John the Baptist Parish. According to the administration, post-storm flooding there was unprecedented, though none had been expected, blocking evacuation routes to Interstate 10. Problems include a demand for transportation and temporary housing for returning evacuees, as well as schools closed by damage.
The motorcade passed military Humvees and troops in fatigues and crowds of supporters and the merely curious as Mr. Obama went to a government building for briefings with local officials and first responders. Afterward he toured a neighborhood that suffered flooding.
In brief remarks to reporters, Mr. Obama noted that the levees built after Hurricane Katrina held, leaving questions about how to prevent the kind of flooding that occurred in the wake of Hurricane Isaac.
''We're going to make sure that at the federal level we are getting on the case very quickly about figuring out what exactly happened here, what can we do to make sure it doesn't happen again and expediting some of the decisions that may need to be made to ensure that we've got the infrastructure in place to protect people's property and to protect people's lives,'' he said.
In the rally earlier in Toledo, Mr. Obama pointed to his bailout of the auto industry as a major argument for his re-election as he spent a fourth Labor Day with union workers in a swing state.
Without the rescue, ''more than one million Americans across the country would have lost their jobs in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,'' Mr. Obama told an estimated 3,100 supporters, most of them African-Americans, crammed into a high school gymnasium not far from a Jeep plant. ''In communities across the Midwest, it would have been another Great Depression.'' His focus on the auto industry's comeback was layered on the stump speech he has delivered now for three days in swing-state campaigning before the convention this week. He engaged in an extended sports metaphor, to mock Mr. Romney's recent remark that he should replace Mr. Obama as the country's coach to produce a winning season. In the case of the auto industry, the president said, Mr. Romney would have called the wrong play.
One out of eight Ohio workers are employed in jobs related to the auto industry, according to the Obama campaign, and the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler ultimately saved nearly 155,000 jobs with manufacturers and suppliers in the state.

HEADLINE: Democrats Say U.S. Is Better Off Than 4 Years Ago

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- A day after fumbling a predictable and straightforward question posed by Mitt Romney last week -- are Americans better off than they were four years ago -- the Obama campaign provided a response on Monday that it said would be hammered home during the Democratic convention here this week: ''Absolutely.''
The focus on the campaign's handling of the question, after halting and contradictory responses from Democrats on Sunday, complicated the White House's effort to begin striking a set of themes the president intends to highlight here and carry through the general election.
That effort starts with an argument that Mr. Romney, the Republican nominee, would raise taxes on the middle class while cutting them for the wealthy. It seeks to pitch forward to the next four years the case that Mr. Obama and his allies have made over the spring and summer -- that Mr. Romney's business career showed him intent on profit even at the expense of workers and that his wealth has given him tax advantages not enjoyed by regular people. 
''The problem is everybody's already seen his economic playbook,'' Mr. Obama said at a campaign stop in Ohio before a Labor Day audience largely consisting of United Auto Workers union members. ''On first down he hikes taxes by nearly $2,000 on the average family with kids in order to pay for a massive tax cut for multimillionaires.''
The Obama campaign began running a new commercial making the same point, and asserting, ''The middle class is carrying a heavy load in America, but Romney doesn't see it.''
As delegates streamed in for the opening of the convention on Tuesday, Mr. Obama and his team were putting the finishing touches on a program that requires a different kind of political daring from the one they showed four years ago, when Mr. Obama gave his speech in a stadium on a stage compared by some to a Greek temple.
This week Mr. Obama is planning to undertake a tricky two-step of convincing wavering supporters being aggressively courted by Mr. Romney that they made the right decision in choosing him four years ago and that he has the country on its way to a sustainable recovery even if they do not always feel it. He will make the argument in an outdoor stadium again, on Thursday night under the threat of rain, but aides say there will be no Greek columns.
Obama campaign aides indicated they were moving into a new phase, applying their case that Mr. Romney has no history of looking out for the middle class to the question of what the next four years would look like under a Romney presidency.
But Republicans showed that they were not going to give Mr. Obama a free ride this week, with Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, coming to North Carolina to keep the focus on the last four years.
''The president can say a lot of things, and he will, but he can't tell you that you're better off,'' Mr. Ryan said on Monday at a rally in Greenville, N.C. ''Simply put, the Jimmy Carter years look like the good old days compared to where we are right now.''
Mr. Obama's aides initially appeared to stumble when television interviewers asked them to respond to Mr. Romney's charge in his nomination acceptance speech Thursday night that Americans were not better off under Mr. Obama.
On Fox News Channel, Mr. Obama's top strategist, David Axelrod, said, ''We're in a better position than we were four years ago in our economy.'' But Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, a Democrat, answered ''no'' on CBS's ''Face the Nation,'' though he blamed Republicans. Other aides equivocated.
Mr. O'Malley provided another answer on Monday on CNN: ''We are clearly better off as a country because we're creating jobs rather than losing them. We have not recovered all that we lost in the Bush recession. That's why we need to continue to move forward.''
In fact, on Monday the campaign settled on a definitive answer of, as the deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter put it, ''Absolutely.''
Followed down a hallway by a local news crew asking the ''better off'' question in the convention center here, Ms. Cutter described the economic scene four years ago -- the auto companies teetering near bankruptcy, bank failures -- and said, ''Does anyone want to go back to 2008? I don't think so.''
Speaking in Detroit on Monday, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said during a union rally, ''You want to know whether we're better off?'' He answered: ''I've got a little bumper sticker for you: Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive.''
Aides said that over the next three days they would show video testimonials of people who have been helped by Mr. Obama's policies, hammering home the success of his auto bailout and the benefits of his health care overhaul.
''We're not running from our record, which we're proud of,'' Mr. Axelrod said in an interview.
But, he added, ''We're also going to burnish the choice -- it's fair to say there will be more discussion of their ideas at our convention than there was at theirs.''
While Democrats pointed to polls showing that Mr. Romney appeared to get little polling ''bounce'' out of his convention, some Democratic strategists here conceded that Republicans had succeeded in muddying the waters on a traditional Democratic strong point, Medicare.
Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan support a plan that would change the program into one in which beneficiaries would get a fixed amount of money from the government each year to use to purchase private health insurance or traditional Medicare, a shift that Democrats say would leave the elderly vulnerable to rising health care costs. Many Democrats had assumed the issue would be a major political help to them, but some Democratic strategists said Republican claims that Mr. Obama had cut $716 billion from the program had at least partly neutralized the Democratic advantage and constrained their ability to emphasize Medicare in their campaign message.
In a brief interview, the minority leader in the House, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, seemed to acknowledge as much when she said of Republicans, ''Confusion is the name of their game,'' though she added that the Democrats could regain the advantage. ''We don't agonize over that, so we're organized to make sure the truth is known by the public.''
Democrats here expressed relief that Mr. Obama took some potentially contentious issues out of the intraparty debate here -- supporting gay marriage, ending the military policy known as ''don't ask, don't tell,'' and easing the threat of deportation for many young immigrants in the country illegally -- and those were expected to be highlighted here, as well.
Produced by the same team that put on Mr. Obama's last convention -- the strategists Jim Margolis and Erik Smith -- the program this week will include a video version of Mr. Obama's logo, now overlaid with silhouettes of people, which loomed over the empty Time Warner Cable Arena on Monday. The theme emblazoned on the hall is ''Americans Coming Together.''
In a nod to austerity, there will be no band, but, rather, a DJ -- more specifically, Deejay Cassidy, a favorite of the Obamas.
Where the main priority for Mr. Obama's team four years ago was to prove he could be president, this year it is to show that he is connected to the middle class.
So, organizers said, the stages in the arena and the Bank of America Stadium, where Mr. Obama speaks Thursday night, will be smaller and ''intimate,'' allowing speakers ''to be surrounded by delegates,'' Theo LeCompte, the chief operations officer of the convention, said in a statement.
But this convention will be less about stagecraft than about the argument Mr. Obama will make to woo back straying supporters and recast his presidency in a light of accomplishment amid often gloomy monthly job reports. The next report is to come out Friday, less than 10 hours after Mr. Obama finishes speaking.

HEADLINE: Spirit of '08 Gone, Democrats Reunite Against G.O.P. Threat

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Four years ago, Barack Obama accepted the presidential nomination of a Democratic Party that was as unified and energized as at any moment in its past: Clintons and Kennedys, labor and Wall Street, centrists and leftists, old and young, blacks, whites and Hispanics. It bristled with the excitement of history and the expectations of a new era.
But Democrats are arriving here to nominate President Obama for a second term in an atmosphere far removed from the Denver convention in 2008, driven by a different kind of urgency and with new questions about their party's direction.
Their unity at this point is defined less by faith in Mr. Obama or a robust vision for what the party should stand for than by the prospect that Republicans could control the White House and Congress next year and enact a conservative agenda that would unravel much of what Democrats have stood for since Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. Mitt Romney's selection of Representative Paul D. Ryan as his running mate has only intensified the ideological fervor. 
''It's because the Republican Party has moved completely to the right,'' Bob Kerrey, a centrist Democrat and former senator running again for the Senate from Nebraska, said of his party's newfound unity.
Caroline Kennedy, whose endorsement, along with that of her uncle Senator Edward M. Kennedy, of Mr. Obama in 2008 signaled the generational excitement that marked the last campaign, said Democrats were approaching 2012 in ''a more serious sober way, given the conditions.''
''They may not be as exhilarated as they were last time,'' Ms. Kennedy said. ''But I think they are just as committed.''
Negative campaigning, whether against Mr. Romney personally or against what he stands for, can be a powerful tool for the White House. But it raises the question of whether, if he wins, Mr. Obama will be able to claim a mandate from voters and rally the elements of his party in the service of any kind of ambitious second-term agenda of his own.
''Certain interest groups in the Democratic Party who three months ago were complaining, 'They don't like this, they don't like that' -- you don't hear that anymore,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat. ''The consequences of not winning are becoming clearer.''
In many ways the Democratic Party has reverted to form -- an unruly conglomeration of sometimes competing interests, united in a belief that government has a crucial role to play in the economy and social justice, but often divided by priorities, means and values.
In Washington, the White House and Democratic leaders in Congress have largely stuck together on legislative and political strategy, and at the grass-roots level there has been no ideological purity test of the sort that has fostered a series of disruptive primary challenges to established Republican incumbents.
Moderate Democrats are concerned that Mr. Obama has alienated business constituencies by cracking down on Wall Street. Occupy Wall Street is protesting in the streets of Charlotte over what it sees as too-lenient policies toward banks. Liberals have criticized Mr. Obama for neglecting poverty and for continuing many of the antiterrorism policies of President George W. Bush.
Centrists are open to cuts in entitlement programs to address the nation's long-term fiscal problems. Liberals want more spending on education and health and higher taxes on the wealthy.
''I don't know if I've ever found anyone who has run for high political office who has been able to capture and hold every faction of the Democratic Party for long periods of time,'' said Tom Daschle, a Democratic former Senate majority leader. ''There are some who wish he were more liberal and some who wish he was more conservative. He is what he is.''
Mr. Obama has, if slowly, taken stands that many members of his party long felt were politically risky, including support for same-sex marriage and issuing an order granting many young illegal immigrants brought to this country as children a two-year reprieve from deportation.
''They're Democrats -- they are always going to be disappointed,'' Ms. Kennedy said. ''But I think his stands on gay marriage and immigration this year changes that. I think he's accomplished some really substantive things that people gloss over.''
Many liberals credit him with achieving his health care overhaul. Still, some Democrats say Mr. Obama, consumed with crisis management in the early stages of his term and the rise of the Tea Party, has yet to rally the party to a long-term agenda that transcends the moment and would put his mark on the party beyond his presidency.
As president, Bill Clinton tried to infuse the party with pro-business, pro-personal responsibility and antideficit stances, but his impact faded during the Bush years, leaving some centrists still in search of a new philosophical approach that combines the legacy of the past with policies for a future being reshaped by technological and economic forces.
''The principles are still here, but it's a whole new world out there,'' said Gary Hart, the two-time presidential candidate and former senator from Colorado.
Mr. Hart faulted Mr. Obama for some of this. ''He's had stronger opposition than any president in my lifetime,'' he said. ''But there's still this feeling out in the country that he should rise above it. He's the president.''
The evaporation of much of the excitement of 2008 -- if perhaps inevitable, given the prolonged economic recession, partisan infighting in Washington and the reality of unmet expectations -- worries the White House, which recently sent Mr. Obama on a tour of college campuses to try to inspire young voters again.
Bill Richardson, a former New Mexico governor who broke with Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008 and endorsed Mr. Obama, said it was critical for the White House to ''re-energize the base that got him elected: minorities, young people and independents.''
''They need to get excited again,'' he said.
Mr. Kerrey said the enthusiasm was ''quite high,'' but added, ''It's not going to be the naïve enthusiasm of four years ago.''
Re-election campaigns are seldom as inspiring as election campaigns, and Mr. Obama, from the moment he moved into the White House, has had to grapple with the expectations he had raised during the campaign. David Axelrod, a senior Obama adviser, said the 2008 convention was ''a moment in time that you really can't compare anything to.''
Then the economy crashed, constraining Mr. Obama's ambitions and bleeding away political support -- but not, for the most part, turning the party against itself.
''I don't want to sound Pollyannaish, but we are a unified party, much more than the Republican Party, that had to have sideshow tents to accommodate all their factions,'' Mr. Axelrod said.
Mr. Richardson said there had been a ''political maturing in the party that has eliminated a lot of this carping and this whining.''
''I think there is a realization that we have a real threat here,'' Mr. Richardson said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Near Pact To Cut $1 Billion From Egypt Debt

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Nearly 16 months after first pledging to help Egypt's failing economy, the Obama administration is nearing an agreement with the country's new government to relieve $1 billion of its debt as part of an American and international assistance package intended to bolster its transition to democracy, administration officials said.
The administration's efforts, delayed by Egypt's political turmoil and by wariness in Washington about new leaders emerging from its first free elections, gained new urgency in recent weeks, even as the United States risks losing influence and investment opportunities to countries like China. President Mohamed Morsi chose China for his first official visit outside of the Middle East, although a spokesman said the crisis in Syria was the main issue driving the visit.
In addition to the debt assistance, the administration has thrown its support behind a $4.8 billion loan being negotiated between Egypt and the International Monetary Fund. Last week, it dispatched the first of two delegations to work out details of the proposed debt assistance, as well as $375 million in financing and loan guarantees for American financiers who invest in Egypt and a $60 million investment fund for Egyptian businesses. 
The assistance underscores the importance of shoring up Egypt at a time of turmoil and change across the Middle East, including the relatively peaceful uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia, Libya's unfinished transition, the showdown over Iran's nuclear program and the war in Syria.
Mr. Morsi has called for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to leave power and end the bloodshed there, while China, along with Russia and Iran, has been a supporter of Mr. Assad as his military assaults opposition strongholds and civilians.
Given Egypt's influence in the Arab world, the officials said, its economic recovery and political stability could have a profound influence on other nations in transition and ease wariness in Israel about the tumultuous political changes under way.
The administration's revived push came after Mr. Morsi won the presidency in June and overcame a constitutional showdown with the Egypt's military rulers.
Mr. Morsi and his Islamic movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, have since made it clear that the struggling economy is their most urgent priority, brushing aside reservations about American and international assistance and outright opposition to it from other Islamic factions.
American officials say they have been surprised by how open Mr. Morsi and his advisers have been to economic changes, with a sharp focus on creating jobs.
''They sound like Republicans half the time,'' one administration official said, referring to leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was long banned from office under the former president, Hosni Mubarak, a close American ally.
Hoping to capitalize on what they see as a ripening investment climate, the State Department and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce will take executives from nearly 50 American companies, like Caterpillar and Xerox, to Cairo beginning Saturday as part of one of the largest trade delegations ever. The officials and executives will urge the government to make changes in taxation, bankruptcy and labor laws to improve the investment climate.
''It's important for the U.S. to give Egypt a reason to look to the West, as well as the East,'' said Lionel Johnson, the chamber's vice president for the Middle East and North Africa.
From the start of the popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt in 2011, President Obama and others argued that the United States and the rest of the world needed to address the poverty and joblessness that fueled popular anger and opposition to authoritarian governments in the region.
The assistance that Mr. Obama first pledged in a speech at the State Department in May 2011 has been slow in coming, because of the political turmoil and street unrest in Egypt, the sluggish bureaucracy in Washington and anger in Congress over the prosecution by Egypt of American nongovernmental organizations that promote democracy.
The delay has frustrated officials who fear that the United States has risked missing an opportunity to reshape a relationship that for decades was focused more on arms sales and security than on economic prosperity for a broad group of Egyptians.
''Our goal is to send a very strong message to Egypt that the government understands it's not just about assistance,'' Deputy Secretary of State Thomas R. Nides, who will travel with the Chamber of Commerce delegation, said in an interview. ''It's about growth and business.''
Egypt's economy is increasingly precarious, with dwindling foreign-exchange reserves and nagging unemployment. The instability that followed the toppling of Mr. Mubarak devastated tourism, one of the country's greatest sources of foreign currency.
Saudi Arabia and Qatar have stepped in to provide emergency infusions totaling $3 billion, while China offered Mr. Morsi a $200 million loan for Egypt and signed investment contracts in agriculture and telecommunications.
The director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, took the unusual step of attending the opening negotiations for its $4.8 billion loan, underscoring the urgency of Egypt's crisis and the international community's determination to help. A year ago, when the military leaders dominated the transitional government, Egypt refused to even discuss a loan.
Egypt's new prime minister, Hesham Qandil, said he hoped the loan would be completed by the end of the year. Officials from this week's delegation have remained in Egypt to hammer out the details of the American debt assistance, which they said would be completed in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund program.
Egypt's debt to the United States exceeds $3 billion, most of it from a program called Food for Peace that offered loans to buy American agricultural products after the Camp David peace accords with Israel during the Carter administration. The $1 billion in debt relief proposed by Mr. Obama has been cobbled together from unspent money from assistance programs.
The administration is negotiating whether to waive some debt payments altogether or allow ''debt swaps,'' in which the money that would otherwise pay down the American debt is spent on training and infrastructure projects in Egypt intended to attract private investment and create jobs. Congress has attached conditions to American assistance in Egypt, requiring Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to certify, among other things, that the country continues to abide by its treaty with Israel.
American and Israeli officials, including Michael B. Oren, Israel's ambassador to the United States, have sought to assure members of Congress that assistance should proceed, despite reservations about the Muslim Brotherhood's political rise. They have argued that persistently high unemployment, especially among women and young people, could undermine Mr. Morsi's government, causing further instability in Egypt and beyond. Robert D. Hormats, the under secretary of state for economic affairs, who led last week's delegation, lavished praised on Mr. Morsi's early stewardship. ''The groundwork has been set with a new political leadership, a new level of energy and new opportunities to reform,'' he said in Cairo on Wednesday.
Egypt also had some requests for the United States. Mr. Qandil, the new prime minister, raised the State Department's longstanding travel warning for Egypt, which notes ''the continuing possibility of sporadic unrest.''
Mr. Qandil asked Mr. Hormats to emphasize that disruptions were limited to small parts of the country.

HEADLINE: The Explanation Election

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- Bill Clinton was talking to a small group of people at a private gathering the other night and said a couple of things that made a big impression on me.
The first was: ''When people are afraid, explanation beats eloquence any day.''
That's right. Americans are fearful right now -- about keeping their jobs, making the next mortgage payment, paying for college and, well, the future. They want answers. Mitt Romney provided none in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. If he was short on eloquence he was nowhere on explanation. He said he would turn things around but failed to say how. 
Even The Wall Street Journal was critical of Romney on its editorial page: ''Neither he nor the entire GOP convention made a case for his economic policy agenda. He and Paul Ryan promised to help the middle class, but they never explained other than in passing how they would do it.''
This has become the explanation election. Romney, in part through his wife, Ann, in part through some moving testaments to his kindness, and in part through a weird touchy-feely delivery, managed to soften himself a little even if the enigma endures. I don't think American en masse will buy the pitiless capitalist label the Obama campaign wants to pin on Romney. You can't change the fact that most Americans admire business success.
People are disappointed in Obama. He is not going to address that by trying to deflect ire on to ''Mittens'' of the cuddly smile.
No, the big opportunity that has opened up for the president as the Democratic National Convention begins is to do something he has not been very good at: explain in plain language how the United States came to its present pass and how he plans to set the country on a path to growth and jobs again. That in turn will explain why a second term would differ from the first.
As Clinton remarked, and this was the second phrase that made an impression, ''You've got to put the corn where the hogs can get to it.'' (That sentence alone says a lot about the differences between his presidency and the current one.) People have to understand. Politics at its best is simple.
Obama needs to deal briefly with the past: President George W. Bush's unfunded wars, at a time of unfunded tax cuts, had a lot to do with America's current fiscal woes; and it was Bush's bi-polar America (half at war, half on limitless credit at the mall) that suffered a financial meltdown in 2008 of such dimensions that it will take a decade to recover. Things are better than four years ago (even in Ohio the numbers are better), but not enough so as to lift Americans' mood or fulfill the hopes of ''change you can believe in.''
The president needs to deal with the nature of American promise: the very Republicans hostile to immigration have just gone through a week devoted largely to rags-to-riches immigrant stories supposedly illustrating what the United States stands for. The hypocrisy, even from a fact-shy crowd, was staggering. An America that turns its back on immigration turns its back on itself: end of story.
Above all Obama needs to deal with the future: The deficit-reduction plan of Romney's running-mate Paul Ryan -- at least in its current form -- does not add up, but Obama's plan is so long-winded nobody really gets it. Britain illustrates the perils of deficit-cutting without growth: so how will Obama spur growth, control spending and increase revenue, the three essential ingredients of a healthier budget?
On energy, corporate and personal taxation (both shot through with absurd loopholes), education and training, incentives to small businesses, innovation, infrastructure and finding efficiencies in health care, Obama has to offer ideas that pass the policy-wonk test. If only a policy wonk can understand, forget it.
Clinton will help. His own speech will certainly address these issues in ways that get the hogs to the corn. But the onus is on Obama to occupy the explanatory space the Romney-Ryan campaign has left wide open.
One other huge space looms. It is of lesser importance given Americans' domestic concerns, but offers Obama an opportunity. On foreign policy the Romney speech was a disgrace: a couple of flippant lines (one the fact-free allegation that the president had thrown Israel ''under the bus''), no mention of the 11-year war in Afghanistan, nothing on Europe or China.
There are things that must be said, not least that any American recovery in a globalized world will involve a smart foreign and trade policy; that wars are expensive, easy to start, hard to end; that the bravery and sacrifice of the U.S. military must be honored even if the wars fought this past decade have often tarnished America's standing; and that the tyrants of the Arab world are falling in the largest -- if still uncertain -- wave of political liberation since 1989.
The world is out there -- and, like the economy, needs explanation if there is to be an American awakening.

HEADLINE: Expectation of Stimulus Lifts European Markets

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
European stocks rose for a second day on Monday, and copper advanced on speculation that central banks would take more steps to stimulate growth, as reports signaled that the global economic slowdown was deepening. The markets in the United States were closed for the Labor Day holiday.
Government bonds rose in Spain, and emerging-market shares climbed for their best gain in two weeks. 
The Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.8 percent on Monday, and the MSCI Emerging Markets index climbed 0.6 percent. Futures for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.3 percent, and the Bovespa index in Brazil snapped three days of declines.
The yield on Spain's two-year note fell 15 basis points, to 3.51 percent. Copper gained 0.8 percent and nickel jumped 1.7 percent.
Euro area manufacturing contracted more than initially estimated in August, according to a report from Markit Economics on Monday, and China's factory output unexpectedly shrank for the first time in nine months, according to a government survey in Beijing from Saturday.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said last Friday that he would not rule out further stimulus efforts. On Thursday, the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, may unveil details of a bond purchase program after a policy meeting.
''Bernanke did say if more is needed, the Fed stands by to do more, which is good for the economy, it's good for markets,'' Markus Rosgen, chief Asian strategist at Citigroup, told Bloomberg Television. ''In terms of China, there is certainly more room to ease.''
Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank in London, said in a research note: ''The door for further quantitative easing is clearly not shut and is very much dependent on what the near-term data tells us about the labor market trend.''
He added, ''Draghi's press conference will likely be the highlight of the week with markets hoping for further guidance around the E.C.B.'s bond purchasing program.''
The Stoxx 600 rebounded from two weeks of losses, the index's first back-to-back weekly declines since May. On Monday, BHP Billiton stock gained nearly 2 percent in London, and the Rio Tinto Group rose 2.2 percent there, leading a rally in mining companies.
The China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said last week that its purchasing managers index dropped to 49.2 in August, from 50.1 in July. The index is on a 100-point scale; numbers below 50 show a contraction. It was the weakest reading to date.
Emerging-market stocks gained for a second day. The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.6 percent, rebounding from a close last week that was its lowest since February 2009. The Micex Index in Russia rose 1.2 percent, and benchmark gauges in Hungary, Indonesia and South Korea all advanced at least 0.4 percent.
The Bovespa gained 0.4 percent, lifted by bets that policy makers will cut borrowing costs after a central bank survey showed a lower growth forecast for Brazil, which is Latin America's biggest economy.
Shares of the home builder Cyrela Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes rose, while stock in Marfrig Alimentos, one of the biggest food companies in Brazil, dropped over 3 percent.
The Polish zloty was the second-worst performer among 25 emerging-market currencies, weakening 0.5 percent versus the euro, after a report showed contraction in manufacturing in Poland deepened in August more than estimated, adding to concerns about the global economy.
Copper rose to $7,679 a metric ton, and nickel climbed to $16,220 a ton. China is the world's largest consumer of both metals. Natural gas declined 0.5 percent.
The yield on Italy's 10-year bond fell eight basis points, to 5.77 percent. The yield on German 10-year government bonds rose four basis points, to 1.38 percent, and yields on similar-maturity British gilts were at 1.65 percent.
The Swedish krona depreciated 1.1 percent to 8.4287 against the euro, its weakest level since July 27, after an unexpected drop in manufacturing. Australia's dollar dropped as low as $1.0240, its lowest point since July 25, after a report showed that retail sales had declined.

HEADLINE: In Beijing, Clinton Will Push for Talks Over Disputed Islands

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ and STEVEN LEE MYERS; Jane Perlez reported from Beijing, and Steven Lee Myers from Jakarta, Indonesia. Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- As tensions mount with its neighbors over islands in nearby strategic waterways, China has scored some subtle victories, making the United States and its allies increasingly uneasy about the potential for violent confrontations.
China's dispute with Japan over potentially energy-rich islands in the East China Sea, and with the Philippines over an island that China has effectively blocked to Filipino vessels, will be central in talks between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chinese leaders in Beijing on Tuesday evening and Wednesday, American and Chinese officials said.
''We will need the nations of the region to work collaboratively together to resolve disputes -- without coercion, without intimidating, without threats and, certainly, without the use of force,'' Mrs. Clinton said on Monday evening after arriving in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta. 
As part of a 10-day, six-nation swing through Asia that may include her last visit to China as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton and her senior aides said the United States would urge China to enter discussions with its neighbors over conflicting territorial claims in the South China Sea.
The Chinese have resisted holding such talks with the regional bloc, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and since Mrs. Clinton's last visit to Beijing in May, the Chinese have acted more boldly in the maritime disputes. Mrs. Clinton received support from Indonesia's foreign minister, Marty Natalegawa, who has scrambled in recent weeks to forge a unified position among the association's members to create a code of conduct intended to avert clashes over the various claims.
''Absent a code of conduct, absent a diplomatic process, we can be certain of more incidents around the region,'' he said, appearing with her.
With recent developments, however, it is not clear that China is interested in any such code. The official news media in China has adopted an increasingly confident tone in the South China Sea disputes, asserting that the United States should accept that it is in decline.
Editorials have warned the United States not to try to benefit from territorial disputes there and in the East China Sea, where an age-old dispute over islands near rich oil and gas fields has flared anew between China and Japan, a treaty ally with Washington. These islands are known in China as the Diaoyu, and in Japan as the Senkakus.
Speaking on Monday at a regular Foreign Ministry press briefing in Beijing, a spokesman, Hong Lei, said the islands were ''inherent'' parts of China since ''ancient times.'' Without naming the United States, he warned outside parties against meddling.
In a move that was interpreted as a modest victory for China, Japan's prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, sent a letter last week to China's president, Hu Jintao, calling for ''calm handling'' by both sides.
The letter was seen as a conciliatory gesture after a group of 10 activists backed by Tokyo businessmen, who say they want to buy the islands, organized a landing on the islands on Aug. 19 without permission from the central Japanese authorities.
A second group of activists, from the Tokyo metropolitan government, went to the waters near the islands over the weekend, calling themselves a survey team. Surveys would be a first step toward buying the islands.
The dispute with the Philippines involves a cluster of reefs and rocks, the Scarborough Shoal, which is called Panatag in the Philippines and Huangyan in China. In May, the Obama administration quietly negotiated a deal that called for Filipino and Chinese vessels to leave the shoal.
But the Chinese left behind a rope that still blocks the entrance to the lagoon, said two Asian diplomats familiar with the situation, who declined to be named per diplomatic protocol.
The Philippines foreign affairs undersecretary, Laura del Rosario, said last Friday that three Chinese vessels remained just outside the lagoon, preventing any Filipino fishing vessels from entering. China has effectively established a new status quo at the shoal and appeared determined not to back down, the two diplomats said.
In a public display of displeasure with Washington over the East China Sea disputes, China reacted quickly to a comment last week by the State Department's spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, that the United States refers to the islands as the Senkakus, as the Japanese do.
She said the islands were under the administrative control of the government of Japan since they were ''part of the reversion of Okinawa'' in 1972, and thus fell under the United States-Japan defense treaty.
Pressed by a Chinese reporter on whether Washington regarded the islands as part of Japanese territory, Ms. Nuland said, ''We don't take a position on the islands, but we do assert that they are covered under the treaty.''
A Chinese specialist on Japan said Ms. Nuland's comments were unacceptable. ''Previously, the United States said it holds no position on sovereignty,'' said Hu Lingyuan, the deputy director of the Center for Japanese Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. ''Now it's contradicting itself. The Chinese people cannot accept this. The U.S. is very visibly taking sides with Japan.''
Anti-Japanese sentiment has been stoked by full coverage on national television of the Japanese landings on the islands. In small villages and in provincial newspapers, the Japanese were the subject of vilification as people gathered around television sets.
Adding to the tensions, the Japanese flag on the hood of the official car of the Japanese ambassador in China was ripped off last week as it traveled in Beijing. The Japanese press reported that four suspects had been questioned by the Beijing authorities but had not been detained. ''It is alarming for Japan that many people praised the attack, calling the suspects heroes,'' The Daily Yomiuri wrote in an editorial.
A senior State Department official who will be in Beijing with Mrs. Clinton said the main goal of the trip was to calm what has been an inflamed summer across the region. ''It is absolutely essential that cooler heads prevail in every capital,'' the official said.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bernanke's Next Task

 BODY:
It will be another week -- at a meeting of the Federal Reserve policy-making committee on Sept. 12 and 13 -- before anyone knows for sure what Ben Bernanke thinks the Fed should do, if anything, to stimulate the weak economy. What is known is that, without more help, the economy is likely to remain weak, or grow weaker, through the rest of this year. 
In his speech on Friday at the annual meeting on monetary policy in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Mr. Bernanke said that past Fed interventions had been a plus for the economy, raising growth enough to add an estimated two million jobs, but that economic conditions are still ''obviously far from satisfactory.'' Then he said that more help would be forthcoming ''as needed.''
But, by his own analysis, help is needed now.
Mr. Bernanke said that national unemployment, at 8.3 percent, is unacceptably high and that much faster growth will be needed to bring that number down. But the economy, instead of accelerating, has slowed, from 4.1 percent in the last quarter of 2011, to 2 percent in the first quarter of 2012 and to 1.7 percent in the second quarter.
Mr. Bernanke also stressed that persistently high unemployment risks bringing on irreversible economic damage as the long-term unemployed become the permanently unemployable. Even as overall unemployment has declined from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009, the share of jobless workers out of work for more than six months has remained stubbornly high.
According to Mr. Bernanke, the economy is being held back by a sluggish housing market; counterproductive fiscal policy, as both the federal government and the states cut spending in the face of weak growth; and the euro crisis, which hurts the United States because of trade and financial links to Europe.
All this is true and reflected in slumping consumer confidence, heightened business uncertainty and a recent slowdown in manufacturing. Unfortunately, meaningful progress on housing and fiscal policy requires Congress to act. Congressional Republicans, however, have long resisted efforts to revive growth on the theory that a weak economy will help them regain the White House. As for the euro crisis, there is nothing much that American policy makers can do.
That leaves the Fed the only entity with the autonomy and the power to take action. Admittedly, its tools -- various ways to reduce borrowing costs and spur lending -- are not ideal for the problems that Mr. Bernanke has identified. It would be better, for example, for lawmakers to bolster federal spending in the near term to create jobs than for the Fed to indirectly attempt to boost activity through more lending. It would also be better for Congress to provide more debt relief for underwater homeowners, as the Fed keeps mortgage rates low for new buyers.
But that is too logical for these times. Mr. Bernanke has laid out the problem, including the economic drag caused by political dysfunction. But he has also risked becoming part of the dysfunctional dynamic, exhorting and waiting for others to act when they are clearly unable or unwilling to do so.
Here's hoping that will change at the Fed meeting next week. And here's hoping that any help is not too little, too late.

HEADLINE: Flood of Conservative Money Challenges Ohio Unions' Voter Drives

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY and STEVEN GREENHOUSE; Monica Davey reported from Columbus, and Steven Greenhouse from New York.

 BODY:
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- From a line of cubicles inside a union headquarters here, phone-bank volunteers hunched over laptop computers, improvising into their headsets their own versions of an anti-Mitt Romney script, which asserted that he had played a role in factories that closed, wages that dropped, workers who were fired.
''I know, I know -- it gets maddening sometimes with all the ads out there,'' Travis Long, a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers, replied to a disenchanted voter on the line, then pressed on with the script and waited for his computer to dial another home.
As unions around the nation plunge in earnest into another election season of phone banks, door-to-door canvasses and leafleting, they find themselves confronting a political landscape that is more daunting than any they have faced in decades. 
Conservative ''super PACs,'' financed with unlimited donations from corporations and wealthy individuals, have saturated Ohio and other battleground states with ads against President Obama. Whether the labor movement and its vaunted ground game can counterbalance this flood of money and media is a question that few political observers can answer. But many believe that how this matchup plays out could determine who wins several crucial battleground states, including this one.
''It's clear now that the Republican super PACs are going to outspend Obama massively,'' said Joseph A. McCartin, a Georgetown University professor who has written extensively about unions' role in politics. ''That's where I think labor's true importance will be highlighted this time. Whether what labor can do is enough is yet to be seen.''
Labor leaders say unions will spend $400 million in this year's federal, state and local elections, about the same as in 2008. Predictions about spending by conservative groups -- including Americans for Prosperity, Restore Our Future and Karl Rove's American Crossroads -- suggest they may together spend at least $800 million on federal elections.
But precise comparisons are difficult. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, corporate PACs and corporate employees made $2 billion in political donations during the 2008 campaign, compared with $75 million from labor unions, based on Federal Election Commission filings. The union number does not include donations that union members make to individual candidates, and includes only a small fraction of what unions spend on politics, like amounts for campaign mailings to members and for political staff members who lobby Congress, state capitals and city halls.
The election commission's $2 billion figure for donations from corporate PACs and employees did not include the amount that business spends on lobbyists or business's political donations to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Some conservatives raise an eyebrow over unions' claims that they are outgunned in the money game. ''I look at them saying they're going to be outspent, and I say, I don't know, maybe that's the case, but it also sounds an awful lot to me like they're trying to manage expectations,'' said Seth Morgan, the Ohio director of policy for Americans for Prosperity. The group says it is opening seven offices in the state and has called more than one million Ohio voters. ''Think about it: they've got a built-in funding mechanism after all,'' Mr. Morgan said.
If labor cannot provide the counterpunch to the conservative super PACs, it is unclear whether anyone else can. Nationally, organized labor has long been viewed as having the most effective political operation for Democrats. President Obama's victory in 2008 here in Ohio -- no Republican in modern times has been able to capture the White House without winning the state -- was due in no small part to labor's get-out-the-vote push. People from union households represented 30 percent of all who voted in the state that election.
But over the past two years, unions have been diverting resources to a range of causes beyond presidential politics, including contract showdowns with companies like Caterpillar and legislative battles over a wave of state laws diminishing collective bargaining power. Still, union leaders argue that the battles over public employees' bargaining rights in Wisconsin and elsewhere brought new momentum and vigor to union activists, who pushed successfully to repeal a Republican-backed anti-bargaining law in Ohio in a statewide referendum last November.
''What we saw in the past two years in all these state battles across the country is members coming out of the woodwork to volunteer,'' said Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
Moreover, the same Supreme Court decision that permitted unlimited donations to super PACs has also in ways benefited unions. The ruling in the Citizens United case and subsequent court rulings opened the door to unlimited corporate and union contributions to political committees and made it possible to pool that money with unlimited contributions from wealthy individuals. It also allowed unions to campaign beyond their membership for the first time -- to call and knock on the doors of nonunion households. As a result, unions boast that they will reach a far larger universe of voters than ever in 2012.
Here in Ohio, union leaders expect that a record number of volunteers, pressing for Mr. Obama and Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat and a favorite of labor, will call or knock on the doors of 2.3 million voters by Election Day, Nov. 6, double the number they reached in the last presidential race.
''The truth is we're never going to come remotely close to matching the money on the other side,'' said Jim Lowe, a senior organizer for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''But this allows us to reach a far wider audience.''
Labor is facing another problem: Many union members are frustrated with Mr. Obama's performance, having hoped he would do more to reduce unemployment, push for stimulus and infrastructure spending and stand up to Congressional Republicans.
Union leaders are urging disillusioned members to back Mr. Obama anyway, telling them that Mr. Romney will lavish tax cuts on the rich, weaken unions and do little to discourage outsourcing. They insist that no one can do as much as unions to block his strategy of running up a large majority among white working-class workers, which many political experts say he needs to win.
Ohio, which Mr. Obama won in 2008 by four percentage points, is seen as a major battlefield for the blue-collar vote. Jobs are on nearly everyone's minds here, even as growth in the energy and auto industries has helped reduce unemployment to 7.2 percent, below the nation's 8.3 percent rate. In July and August alone, forces on both sides of the presidential race spent $43 million on commercials in Ohio, according to Kantar Media/CMAG, with supporters of the Republicans outspending Democrats by $3 million.
Union organizers are building what they say will be a groundbreaking, high-tech update on their old-school methods of canvassing neighborhoods and calling people.
They plan ''tele-town halls,'' where union leaders will address thousands of people sitting in their living rooms. They have combined forces with nonlabor groups like MoveOn.org. And volunteers no longer need to go to a central phone bank to make calls; a labor-sponsored computer program lets them call from home and match Facebook friends to targeted lists of voters so that volunteers can reach out to them on social media.
In Ohio last week, though, Kim McDonald, a special education aide and union member, said she had taken part in a traditional canvass in Cleveland Heights and would do so again. ''Talking to someone about issues, face to face, should definitely help assuage the commercial onslaught,'' she said.
Ms. McDonald said she had 28 doors to knock on that day, and found just six people at home. In the end, she said, she thought she had swayed perhaps two voters.

HEADLINE: The Ad Campaign: Sparring Over the Middle Class

BYLINE: By JEREMY PETERS

 BODY:
As President Obama kicks off his convention week in Charlotte, N.C., his campaign has a new ad that doubles down on his charges that Mitt Romney's economic policies would harm the middle class. 
"The middle class is carrying a heavy load in America," the commercial says as images of a forlorn-looking mother and a worker in a hard hat appear on the screen. "But Mitt Romney doesn't see it." A picture of Mr. Romney flashing a wide grin is shown, along with a picture of a stately brick mansion.
"So, Romney hits the middle class harder and gives millionaires and even bigger break. Is that the way forward for America?"
The ad repeats the claim -- made often by Mr. Obama and his allies -- that Mr. Romney's economic plans would result in a tax increase for middle-class families while lowering taxes on people in the highest income brackets. A study by the left-leaning Brookings Institution found that to be the case.
The Romney campaign has sought to discredit that study, noting that its author served on the president's Council of Economic Advisers.
A Romney campaign spokeswoman sought to shift the focus toward the state of the economy since Mr. Obama took office, noting that "the middle class has been crushed under President Obama, but he doesn't seem to get it."
"Gas prices have doubled, incomes have dropped, poverty is headed toward 50-year highs and chronic unemployment is at unprecedented levels," said the spokeswoman, Amanda Henneberg.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: First Lady Strives for Caring Image Above Partisan Fray

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- This is how Michelle Obama delivers a hug: The nearly six-foot-tall first lady envelops her target, her long arms often wrapping all the way around the recipient's back. She leans in close, unafraid to press her body against a stranger's. Working crowds with her husband, she sometimes falls behind him, because he is more of a hand-shaker or high-fiver, and in the second-to-second choreography of a rope line, the Michelle Obama hug takes time.
That hug, half motherly embrace and half papal benediction, has become a minor phenomenon. Many of the first lady's events end with marathon hugging sessions, because people now hope to get one. At the Olympics, the United States men's basketball team lined up for hugs, the sweaty giants waiting their turns like meek children. When Mrs. Obama gave the queen of England a mere half-hug, Britain went wild. The first lady delivers solemn, private hugs to wounded service members. And all summer she has hugged her way across the country on behalf of her husband's campaign, drawing volunteers, donors, staff and potential converts near. 
''Sometimes her staff will roll their eyes, like O.K., here we go, because if there are 50 people who need to be hugged, she will hug them all,'' said Samantha Appleton, until recently a White House photographer.
Those hugs are a useful metaphor for how Michelle Obama approaches the roles of first lady and campaign surrogate. A Harvard-trained lawyer, trying to win votes and high approval ratings, she offers intimacy without revelation. Her signature gesture is striking but safe.
That approach will probably be on display Tuesday night when Mrs. Obama addresses the Democratic National Convention, giving a speech that advisers describe as an exercise in empathy and connection.
Behind the scenes, Mrs. Obama's advocacy for her husband can be so forceful that speechwriters have had to tone it down over the years for public presentation, aides say. But despite the scathing critiques of Republicans that she had been known to deliver in private, her advisers believe that she is most potent when she does not appear overtly political and that she comes across best as a gracious noncombatant in the red-and-blue wars. So at the convention, they say, she will try to present herself as a caring, wifely figure and appear above the partisan fray.
Just as she has on the campaign trail, Mrs. Obama is expected to describe her husband as a grounded, devoted man driven to build better lives for American children, implying he knows more about economic challenges than a wealthy son of fortune like Mitt Romney ever can.
''Your president is the son of a single mother who struggled to put herself through school and pay the bills,'' she said at an event in Iowa in August. ''I remind people that Barack knows what it means when a family struggles,'' she continued. ''And that's why I love him, and that's why I will have his back forever.''
In that speech, she did not breathe Mr. Romney's name. As she campaigned this summer, she barely used the word ''Republican.'' Instead she finishes her remarks -- and begins dispensing hugs.
Mrs. Obama has told advisers she uses the hugs to make herself less intimidating despite her position and height -- to ''narrow the gap,'' said Katie McCormick Lelyveld, her former press secretary. The hug is not a political tactic, aides say, but an expression of a desire to connect.
One of the first big White House hugfests was in 2009, at the kickoff event for a mentoring program Mrs. Obama started for high school girls in Washington. Few of them had ever been to the White House, let alone at a meeting with the first lady. ''She eliminated that panic and anxiety that the girls had by hugging them,'' Ms. Appleton said.
It is hard to remember another first lady who appeared as comfortable in her own body as does Mrs. Obama, who studied dance as a girl and later served on the board of an African dance company. She has shimmied, skipped, hopscotched, hula-hooped, jumping-jacked, and potato-sack-raced her way through her tenure as first lady, using not just her position but her body to push for more exercise and better nutrition for children. (She is fighting an obesity crisis and trying to convince corporations to change products and advertising, yet she sticks to a Mom in Chief tone.)
On an official visit to South Africa last year, she dropped to the floor for push-ups with Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and during her recent Olympic foray, she allowed the wrestler Elena Pirozhkova to lift her clean off the ground. (''I thought, I can't just hug her like everybody else,'' Ms. Pirozhkova said afterward.)
The choreographer Bill T. Jones, commenting on how the first lady uses her body as an instrument of communication, said, ''She is someone you can literally feel you know.''
Her embraces and other stunts, though, make it easy to miss her ironclad discipline and tightly planned operation. She has become an expert at campaigning-without-campaigning, arriving at the London Olympics just as Mr. Romney also appeared there, sitting on late-night couches fielding gentle questions from hosts. (When she mentioned last week that her daughters attended summer camp, David Letterman asked, ''Does this need to be approved by the Senate?'') She answers with unfailing poise and comic timing, and the next day, her fans post the clips on Facebook with did-you-see-this enthusiasm.
But she has also done real political work for her husband -- stumping in 2008 and learning message discipline the hard way (though she was hugely popular, she made verbal missteps that allowed critics to cast her as aggrieved). She promoted President Obama's health care plan in 2009, though to keep her popularity high, advisers limited her association with the initiative. And for the past year, Mrs. Obama has been a central figure in her husband's campaign -- exhorting supporters to donate and volunteer, stating her husband's argument for re-election in simple, jargon-free terms.
When she's campaigning, Mrs. Obama approaches the task like an Olympic gymnast tackling a routine: she practices relentlessly and come performance time she executes according to plan. She often speaks from a teleprompter, even at small events, and her words vary little from stop to stop. (She repeated the same performance at least eight times in August, at events from New Hampshire to California.)
In the 2008 race, before she had a speechwriter, Mrs. Obama said what she felt: ''If you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House,'' she said at an event in 2007, when Mr. Obama was squaring off against Hillary Rodham Clinton. Now the prospect of her ad-libbing more than a few words seems as unlikely as Aly Raisman free-styling a floor routine.
Mrs. Obama has reason not to take risks, even beyond the fact that she was caricatured during the 2008 campaign. Throughout her time in the White House, she and her advisers have carefully protected her image; she knew her husband would need her for re-election from early on, aides say. So she has mostly avoided controversy, highly aware that any mistake on her part could cost her husband: in a sharply polarized country with close presidential contests, no other calculation makes sense.
''Who can be opposed to a hug from a tall, beautiful woman?'' said Kati Marton, author of ''Hidden Power,'' about presidential marriages. ''In this divisive climate, to be the hugger in chief is all that our first lady can do.''

HEADLINE: A Collective Eye on Social Justice

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN


HIGHLIGHT: Members of Noor, the photo collective that will observe its fifth anniversary at the Visa pour l'Image photojournalism festival in Perpignan, France, discuss their approach and practice. 

 BODY:
JE: How did Noor start?
KL: It started because Stanley and I started to speak, in New Orleans after the hurricane in 2005. We both felt that the market was changing very quickly, and that we didn't have any influence. We were correct, though we didn't know that it would happen so quickly. When we launched there were many people who felt that it was a risky idea to start an agency right now, but we proved that it was actually possible, and even a necessity.
JE: Why a necessity?
KL: A lot of other agencies, smaller agencies, went under. We saw that it was the time to unite photographers who are independent in the sense that they are initiating their own shows, initiating their own projects. and not waiting for assignments to come in. Those golden years were over. Every year, we do a group project where we work together on one theme, one issue, and we do master classes every year specifically for people not in the Western world. They're just being selected for their talent they don't have to pay for it.
JE: Jon, you were there when Noor started and you joined six months later. What made you want to join?
JL: When I saw the presentation at Perpignan five years ago, I thought Noor had the most hard-hitting and strongest photography that was committed to social justice. I thought that as a group we could really form a powerful entity to help to show what's going on in the world. One of our major strengths is how we work together as a group. I also thought I would learn a lot from the other photographers, which I have. I also liked the autonomy - the ability to have an impact within the group and be a part of something and building something.
JE: Alix, why did you join?
AF: I've been working out in the field since Bosnia, but working very quietly, before the days of social media, working for picture desks at British newspapers and on long term projects. I didn't want to go with just any agency, unless it was 100 percent perfect. Noor just had a lot more integrity and was doing more in-depth work than anybody else. I felt the effort between the group was incredibly strong. When you work as a photojournalist, you're often very much alone on the road, kind of out on a limb. And it's great to be with such like-minded people, and to have these opportunities to come together. And be stronger as a group.
JE: Alex, you mentioned being alone a lot of times, and traditionally, outside of newspapers, photographers have worked alone. Photographers often are more comfortable alone. Sometimes it feels as if working together can be antithetical to who many photographers are.
AF: Well I think in this case, we are such a tight-knit group of like-minded people compared to some of the bigger agencies. I do think it's important that after so many years of out doing this, that you have a family to go back to.
JL: A lot of people say, "Photographers can't work together," and I found, not that it's always perfect, of course and It takes work, but everybody's been really committed to Noor and to this concept of working together and making something bigger than ourselves.
KL: Jon, obviously, we are not perfect, but I think we are very different photographers but are like-minded in the way we like to work and the way we want to be published. We are very aware that the editorial market is becoming more and more difficult, but it's definitely not dead anymore. So we're not going to slaughter the sheep before it really dies. But, we do as a group, think lot about finding different ways of publishing this work. Because - for the next five years - that's going to be the question. Are we able to manage as photographers and as Noor, to survive? And to make it happen. I mean, photojournalism is not dead. I think we can agree on that. But we all know that budgets are a fraction of what they were ten years ago. It's great to do these group projects, because you can do something relatively quickly and still have an in-depth story, which can have a large impact. But it's also finding different audiences, and not just the traditional media.
JE: Well, to seize on that, what do you think the next five years hold? What were you grappling with the first five years hold and what and what's the future? What needs to be done for photographers to survive?
KL: The world is a lot bigger than 20 years ago. Ten years ago our markets were the U.S. and Europe - Western Europe - and now it's a much larger market: China, Brazil, India, Dubai, you name it.
JL: I think it's also important that Noor photographers have found different ways of funding their projects, and in conjunction with editorial outlets, they've been able to do good things, I think Kadir's Vía PanAm was amazing in finding a unique way to tell a great story and also to get funded in different ways, with granting organizations, crowd-sourcing, and editorial outlets buying the pieces.
AF: As we come to the five-year anniversary, if you look at just right this moment, what great long term projects Noor has just completed or is working on. Pep's been working for the last year on micro credit around the world, I've been working on a huge project about migration, which goes all the way from Afghanistan to Europe, Nina's been working on fracking and changes in America and we're all doing this in very creative ways.
KL: I hope we stimulate other photographers as well, to not be desperate and think that everything's dead and dying.
JL: That kind of mind-set, it actually turns into negative energy, then you don't produce as much work and you don't go out and try new ways of doing things. Stan is also doing a large project about waste around the world. To the last person in the group, everyone's working on in-depth documentary projects that are about social justice. In the face of pretty difficult economic odds.
JE: That is something that does define you. A lot of photographers are interested in social issues, but, Noor is laser-focused, as you said, Jon, on issues of social justice.
KL: But that brought us together. When we take new photographers, that's what we are looking for. It's not just being a great photographer. It's also about being able to initiate your own project and think of what's necessary and what's relevant at the moment. And I think it's still possible to sell. Because quality will not be denied.
JE: Why should photographers choose to form a collective? There are some functioning on a high level and some that are almost dormant. What do you think are the advantages for other photographers in collectives?
KL: There's an infrastructure. Which I think is very important to all of us. Because most of us are on the road constantly, so at least there's an office that can take care if images are requested or magazines need to be approached, there's an office who can do it so.
But the other thing is it's really important to be with a group which is not like a mirror for me. Sometimes you produce great work and sometimes you don't. It's very important for me that there's a group who's able to criticize in a constructive way. Who's able to ask me questions. If you're able to listen to criticism, it brings you to a higher level and I think that for me that's a very important function of Noor as well.
JL: I've learned so much from everybody at Noor over the last five years, and I think it's, helped take my work to a more global level. Collectives can be good, I think they're also a lot of work, and I think you have to form a collective where the people really are committed to it or else I think it can be a very difficult thing.
JE: Alix, what's your advice for anyone who's thinking about forming a collective?
AF: Well, I think there's a lot of people who are grouping together because, I suppose there's a kind of comfort in numbers, but of course not everybody can succeed, and it is a very tough climate that we're living through at the moment. I think there has to be a real focus and something to set that group of photographers apart. And make people sit up and listen and take notice.
JE: I know it's hard to attribute your growth from one thing to another, but how have you changed as a photographer since you've been in Noor and has Noor had anything to do with that?
KL: Well, if I wasn't with Noor and I would have been on my own, I think it would have been tougher because my colleagues like Alix and Jon and Stanley and Yuri and everybody else at Noor are the living proof that it's possible, so that's a lot of energy for me, to keep on working and keep on pushing. We're always Noor but at the same time being a photographer is sometimes a very lonely profession, and I know I can call anyone 24/7 if I have an issue, but, still, you as an individual, you are the one that has to do it. My colleagues inspire me.
JL: Definitely. It's always amazing to see the work everyone does in the group and that pushes you to push harder. Definitely.
KL: But we have issues as well, Jim. Don't worry.
JL: It's not always easy.
JE: Magnum has scores of members. Imagine trying to get 50 or 70 photographers together and even decide what to order for lunch? How do you make decisions at Noor? How do you deal with disagreements?
KL: Well, you know I often think that I would like to attend the annual meeting of Magnum, because it's so hard with our small group sometimes to have a consensus. I find it impossible to think what it's like in Magnum. We have a set of rules, of what we have to decide unanimously, like new members, and what we decide with a majority. We have a Skype conference call every two weeks, which is just to talk to each other, to update each other. But pending decisions will also be discussed at those meetings. We have annual meetings and there's an advisory board. So if we can't make a decisions because votes stall, there's an advisory board who can interfere. I'm in Amsterdam, sometimes somewhere else, Alix is in Pakistan, Andrea is in I think Afghanistan, so when we talk to each other every two weeks on Skype, it's like we're talking to different planets. Which is great, but at the same time it's complicated as well. But in the end, I think it works. At least we are responsible for our own decisions and the direction we are taking.
AF: I mean at the end of the day, we all collectively own Noor - it's our business. And we're all photographers, we're all artistic, we're all passionate. But you know, we all come together to make it work.
JL: It's actually a very democratic organization. Because to be honest, we each get a vote, and our vote counts for a full weight of our membership. So, sometimes you have a thing that you want to put forward and it works because there's other people that agree, and sometimes it doesn't. But at the end of the day, there's a lot of respect among the members of the group I guess you win some and you lose some. But over all, it works out.
JE: Well, Alix, can you think of the last major disagreement you had?
AF: No [laughing]. No, not really.
KL: We never have any disagreements.
JE: Come on, no, really?
JL: [laughing] It's perfect.
JE: What types of things become extended conversations?
KL: Well, there's a discussion about editorial.
What's the weight of editorial. Some of us feel that editorial is still good for us, that the focus of the agency should be on editorial, that anyone who's employed by Noor should be focused on editorial. And some people feel that we have to look in a different direction. So we compromise. We listen to each other and we make it work.
JL: Ultimately it comes down to resources. Our resources are limited. How much of our resources do we put into editorial, alternative forms of fund-raising, marketing and creating ways to get our work out in the most effective way. We discuss it, make decisions and we try things, and see if it works. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't and we try another thing.
AF: Let's not forget that we not only have Noor Images - the agency - we have the foundation. Which to me, is one of the most exciting aspects of Noor.
JE: O.K., tell me more about the foundation?
AF: Well, we very much believe in giving back and giving free education, so there's been these master classes around the world which have been sponsored by Nikon, where all the participants can get education for free and they've been varied and world wide. Recently we've been doing a course in Cairo.
KL: Yeah, we're about to get the 501-C3 status in the U.S. We are very aware that sometimes we need external funding, when it's not coming from the editorial world. It will expand our scope, our market and what we can do as a group. Noor is not there to make profit as a company. So, we have kind of a different strategy than most agencies. We know what our monthly expenses are in terms of rent, staff, and we share this, chipping in every month. And then Noor takes a small percentage which is just used as a buffer. But the goal is for all the money to go to the photographers. With other agencies you would organize your own assignment, the magazine would call you, and the agency would still take 50 percent. Fees are not based on that. So, as long as people produce in Noor, I think it works very well.
JE: Let me ask you one more question? What does Noor look like in five years, in 20 years?
AF: We don't want to become too big. It's nice to be a tight group and to stick together. Yes, we probably grow, but not too much.
JL: I really hope that Noor is known way outside of traditional kind of photographic markets, and becomes even more a name that is synonymous with real commitment to social justice.
KL: There's no pressure on photographers in Noor to use social media, but we acknowledge as a group that it's important, that it's a way to communicate with new audiences. Nobody's pressured to use video or audio, but we do recognize that it might play an important part in the future, in the near future. We know there's an audience out there. And the audience is not just the traditional audience who reads newspapers. There's an audience of policy makers, there's an audience of NGOs, of human rights, of you name it. I think we have a lot to conquer, still. And I think there's a future for us.
JL: Definitely.
AF: I think what Noor is already recognized for is in-depth visual storytelling. Our hope is, that Noor is about great journalism, great research and reaching larger audiences world-wide.

HEADLINE: In a Word

BYLINE: PHILIP B. CORBETT


HIGHLIGHT: For the end of summer, here's an extra-large grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers. 

 BODY:
For the end of summer, here's an extra-large grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.
 Convention planners were downplaying suggestions early Tuesday that their event might yet be reduced to a single night, saying that while they were keeping a close eye on the storm, they were continuing with their revised schedule full steam ahead. 
From The Times's stylebook: 
 downplay. An ungainly leftover from the age of penny-a-word telegram economies. Make it play down.
 Through the narrow corridors and battered shelves of the cozy store in the storied Brill Building in Times Square, a knowing worker will then peruse and (more often than not) find the sheet music, vinyl record or CD the person is looking for. 
"Peruse" is not a synonym for search; it means to read or study, and takes a direct object. Not the phrasing we wanted here.
 Mrs. Ryan's mother struggled with cancer for the last 35 years of her life, first battling advanced melanoma, then breast cancer, then ovarian cancer and a recurrence of the melanoma she thought she had beat. 
Make it "had beaten."
 Nebraskans approved it by a margin of more than 2-to-1. 
Campaign alert: The margin, as the stylebook notes, is "the difference between two values." "More than 2 to 1" is a ratio or proportion (and also doesn't need hyphens here).
 The idea that during rape, "the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down'' to prevent pregnancy, as Mr. Akin said, has surfaced periodically among anti-abortion advocates over the past two decades, usually involving the term "forcible rape'' to refer to what Mr. Akin called "legitimate.'' 
Avoid this head-spinning combination of pro and con. "Abortion opponents" is simple and clear.
 That Mr. Holmes, who is being held in the Arapahoe County jail awaiting arraignment on 142 criminal counts, deteriorated to the point of deadly violence cannot help but raise questions about the adequacy of the treatment he received and about the steps the university took or failed to take in dealing with a deeply troubled student. 
The stylebook prefers "cannot help raising."
 I first landed at Bank of America not by choice, but by acquisition. Some 20 years ago, I became a customer of Bank South when I moved to Atlanta as a youngish journalist. (My discerning criteria at the time was that it had a branch near my apartment and an A.T.M. near my office.) 
"Criteria" is plural. Use "criterion" or choose a different word.
 Mr. Romney, a Mormon, and Mr. Ryan, a Catholic, also represent a new era in presidential politics: neither are Protestants. 
Make it "neither is a Protestant."
 Looking back at London 2012 (the closing ceremony is today), watching how the Duchess dressed may very well have been one of the Games' most heavily spectated sports. 
The verb "spectate" is probably best avoided, but in any case it's intransitive and shouldn't be used as a passive participle like this. (Also, the introductory phrase here seems to be a dangler.)
 BOSTON -- Mitt Romney read Scripture from his iPad as he juggled his 2-year-old grandson on his lap. He made sure to accept a small piece of white bread and cup of water, representing the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ, from a member of the priesthood who looked like he was about to accidentally pass him by. 
Avoid this use of "like" as a conjunction. Make it "as if."
 Many criminals in the city are becoming more sophisticated, like using high-tech tools for identity theft and other forms of computer crimes. 
A different "like" problem -- there's no noun here for the "like" phrase to refer to. Rephrase.
 Prosecutors loosened howls of indignation. Prominent prosecutorial sorts have written letters in the past month and intimated they will no longer serve on committees if such calumnies stand. 
The word we wanted here was "loosed," meaning "released."
 Ms. Brown said her columns and Twitter posts were her own writing -- she also has penned two recent Op-Ed articles for The New York Times, one calling Planned Parenthood too ideologically driven, and another saying President Obama can be condescending to women -- and dismissed accusations that she was doing anyone else's bidding. 
"Penned" is journalese. "Wrote" is perfectly good.
 One bypasser said as he exited, "Those two really know how to bring the house down.'' 
Make it "passer-by." 
 Confident his teammates were on board, he hopped a flight Saturday afternoon. 
The idiom used in this sentence about the football player Nick Mangold's trip to London to watch his sister in the Olympics creates unintended ambiguity. Mangold's Jets teammates were figuratively "on board" with his flight, but were not on the plane.
 "If a picture is worth a 1,000 words, video is worth 5,000 pictures and so to have any sort of raw footage is incredibly helpful to investigators," said Larry Cunningham, a former Bronx prosecutor who is an associate professor and associate dean at St. John's University School of Law in Queens. 
The numeral doesn't work in this phrase. Make it "a thousand words."
 Advocates for Mr. Ryan argue that he would be a boon to Mr. Romney on the ballot by cementing in voters' minds an economic vision for the country that is very different than Mr. Obama's. 
Make it "different from." 
 In that regard, the tax could have enormous symbolic value as a blow for egalité, coming from a new president who has proclaimed, "I don't like the rich." 
If we're going to use French -- appropriately enough, in this story about France -- we have to get it right, accents and all. Make it "égalité."
 You can imagine the Goldstein family's dinner table was a blast, too: debates on the merits of Hannibal Hamlin, Abraham Lincoln's first vice president, verses John Nance Garner, one of F.D.R.'s three, who famously compared the vice presidency to ''a bucket of warm spit.'' 
Ouch. Make it "versus."
 That feeling may fuel one of the Democrats' great hopes -- that threats to abortion rights, attacks on Planned Parenthood and objections to the health care law's requirement that insurance plans cover birth control pills -- will prove to be more meaningful for single women than jobs plans. 
There should not be a second dash here. Better still, streamline the sentence.
 But Mrs. Fournier, the smoking foe, thinks the soft approach is doomed. 
"Foe" means enemy, as the stylebook points out. It's hyperbole in many contexts, where "opponent" would be perfectly adequate.
 The government fought back hard, with no indication that its far superior military machine had lost its edge against an opposition still working predominately with small-caliber weapons. 
As the stylebook says, use "predominantly" as the adverb.
 [Caption] Mahmoud Shedid, left, Omar Hamed, center, and his brother Abdelrahman Hamed filled up on a pre-dawn meal in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, on Wednesday before their daily Ramadan fast. 
The stylebook advises, "Ordinarily close up compounds formed with pre unless the prefix is directly followed by an e or an uppercase letter." But there is a reason "predawn" does not even appear in our dictionary: it is an unfortunate journalistic cliché of recent vintage. 
 Ms. Gu and the family aide, Zhang Xiaojun, are accused of killing Mr. Heywood in a hotel on the outskirts of Chongqing after what the state media has described as "a conflict of economic interests.'' 
Monolithic but still plural: make it "media have" (or "news media have").
 Federal District Court Judge Paul G. Gardephe's résumé includes many impressive accomplishments but not an art history degree. Nonetheless he has been asked to answer a question on which even pre-eminent art experts cannot agree: Are three reputed masterworks of Modernism genuine or fake. 
This is a direct question and should end with a question mark.

HEADLINE: After a Year, Business Group Members Discuss Their Progress

BYLINE: ADRIANA GARDELLA


HIGHLIGHT: Even in a tough economy, all five of the women-owned businesses are growing. 

 BODY:
About a year ago, the She Owns It business group began meeting with the goal of exploring the day-to-day challenges faced by four women who own and run companies. Since then, the group, which now has five members, has gathered regularly to discuss topics such as hiring and managing employees, health insurance, manufacturing, growing pains, and customer service.
Over time, the group's composition has changed. Former member Carissa Reiniger left because lof scheduling conflicts. New members Deirdre Lord and Beth Shaw stepped in, joining veterans Jessica Johnson, Alexandra Mayzler, and Susan Parker.
The women's businesses have also evolved. This post provides snapshots of three of the original businesses, and the two more recent additions.
Owner: Jessica Johnson.
Company: Johnson Security Bureau provides security services to government and commercial clients.
2011 Sales: $1 million-plus (up from $700,000 in 2010).
Employees: 100-plus (up from 60 in 2010).
The 50-year-old company was founded by Ms. Johnson's grandparents. Last year, it increased both its annual sales and employee count. Ms. Johnson attributes this success to factors including a focus on customer service, more time spent on the hiring process, and expanding operations into New Jersey.
She recently said job creation had been her most important metric for measuring her company's success. But looking ahead she said, "I may need to consider different metrics because my focus for 2012 isn't as much on growth as it has been." It has shifted to determining which business opportunities make the most sense for the company to pursue. The new metrics Ms. Johnson is considering include rates of employee turnover and sales closed.
Owner: Deirdre Lord.
Company: The Megawatt Hour is an online subscription service that helps commercial and industrial clients manage, track, and forecast their energy use and expenses.
2011 sales: The company, a start-up, began operating in December 2011 and had sales of $2,000 that month.
Employees: five.
For now Ms. Lord, who founded an earlier company and has an extensive background in the energy industry, is focused on building the business and continuing to tweak its products to meet the needs of customers and prospects. For example, after some experimentation, the Megawatt Hour is offering three service models: a transactional model for businesses that want to use the product only when they are about to make an energy-buying decision, and free and premium models that allow customers to monitor their ongoing energy use and costs. The company is also exploring various sales channels and recently started working with energy consultants who will offer the Megawatt Hour's product to their clients. The product will be marketed with the consultant's name and the information that it is "powered by the Megawatt Hour."
Owner: Alexandra Mayzler.
Company: Thinking Caps Tutoring offers study-skills coaching, subject tutoring, and test preparation to middle- and high-school students.
2011 Sales: about $780,000 (up from about $700,000 in 2010).
Employees: five full-time, 45 part-time tutors (up from four full-time and 40 part-time tutors in 2010).
Ms. Mayzler started Thinking Caps from her dorm room at New York University in 2003. To determine how well the company is doing, she said she tracked the hours worked by her tutors, the number of client families, payables and revenue, looking for annual increases in all. By those measures Thinking Caps had a good year in 2011, she said. Additionally, after opening an office in Austin, Tex., last fall, Thinking Caps expanded into Houston in January of this year.
Owner: Susan Parker.
Company: Bari Jay manufactures and sells bridesmaid and prom dresses to retailers.
2011 Sales: $8.3 million (up from $7 million in 2010).
Employees: 17
Ms. Parker and her sister became co-presidents of their father's business in 2008, following his death. With no garment industry experience, it was rough going initially for the sisters. But they sought guidance from some of their father's longtime friends in the industry and managed to increase sales by 20 percent from 2009 to 2010. To determine how well Bari Jay is doing, Ms. Parker said she considered revenue, profit margins, and booked orders. Revenue and booked orders rose in 2011, and margins stayed about the same - as planned, she said. Still, there are challenges, most notably finding a way to keep up with orders and addressing production issues that arise partly from the increased cost of manufacturing dresses in China.
Owner: Beth Shaw.
Company: YogaFit trains yoga instructors, entering into exclusive partnerships with yoga studios and health club chains. It also hosts fitness conferences, teacher-training seminars and retreats.
2011 Sales: $4.4 million (up from $4.2 million in 2010).
Employees: 13 at company headquarters and 60 trainers (independent contractors).
Ms. Shaw, a former magazine advertising sales representative, founded the company in 1997, after becoming interested in yoga as a hobby. To measure YogaFit's success, she said she looks at revenue. "I always want to beat the previous year," she said. But sales are down since their high of $5 million in 2009, a fact Ms. Shaw attributes to factors including a more crowded market and the company's unprofitable merchandising division, which is being trimmed. To get back on track, Ms. Shaw said she hired a chief operating officer who has "dramatically cut expenses" and added an experienced fitness industry marketer to her staff.
In future posts, the group will continue to discuss the realities of business ownership. Are there any issues you would like to see raised?

HEADLINE: Live and Let Live: Humans and Tigers

BYLINE: RACHEL NUWER


HIGHLIGHT: Coexistence is possible with the right safeguards, researchers report. 

 BODY:
In an increasingly crowded world, wildlife conservation often requires that humans share space with large carnivores. But living alongside potentially deadly 670-pound tigers poses its challenges, and the tigers must similarly contend with human disturbances. Two new studies suggest that it is possible to find an equilibrium, however.
"If you have animals and people living on top of each other, there's a constant threat of conflict," said Neil Carter, a doctoral candidate in systems integration and sustainability at Michigan State University. "Seeing both sides of the coin is really the only way to identify conservation actions that are able to help both people and animals thrive."
With that goal in mind, Mr. Carter set off for Chitwan National Park in Nepal, a popular tourist destination that is home to around 125 adult tigers and is surrounded by a forested buffer zone where 560,000 people, mostly farmers, live. On occasion the tigers pick off livestock, and 65 people lost their lives to tiger attacks between 1998 and 2006. While the government provides some compensation for livestock losses, some tigers have been poisoned to death by locals who resent the predation.
Mr. Carter took a survey of around 500 individuals living within a mile of the national park, asking questions like "Does it please you just knowing that tigers exist in the nearby forests?" and "How worried are you that tigers will attack you or someone in your family?"

He also asked people whether they preferred that the tiger populations increase, decline or remain the same.
Writing in the journal Oryx, Mr. Carter and his colleagues reported that nearly 20 percent of the people surveyed said that tigers had attacked their livestock or threatened them directly, and around 40 percent viewed tigers as a nuisance. 
Still, the interviewees were evenly divided between those wishing that there were fewer tigers and those hoping that the forest population would increase. Most of those in favor of more tigers associated the animals with tourism and thus with enhanced revenue. Other people valued tigers because of their Hindu belief system or as an icon of national heritage.
Yet only a few people recognized that tigers perform an ecological service by keeping populations of large crop-raiding herbivores in check. "Crop raiding causes a bigger economic impact on locals than tigers killing livestock," Mr. Carter said. Without the tigers, herbivore populations would likely explode, he pointed out, yet of all the values people assigned to tigers, keeping the forest "healthy" ranked lowest. 
Creating educational programs to highlight this service might encourage people to view the tigers in a more positive light, Mr. Carter said.
Among those who associated tigers only with negative impacts, he found that those feelings were driven more by pragmatic concerns than by fear. Building effective cattle sheds and protective fences and increasing government aid to those who lose livestock could alleviate those misgivings, he wrote.
Mr. Carter and his colleagues also set up motion-activated cameras in nearly 80 places around the community and in the forest forest, including footpaths and roads, to figure out what habitat humans and tiger share. During the day, the researchers watched as humans and vehicles traversed the trails. At night, tigers silently padded by the same locations.
"People and tigers are sharing the same space by using it at different times of the day," Mr. Carter said. "That speaks to tigers' capacity to adapt."
In places where tigers live but humans are scarcer, the animals tend to prowl throughout the day and night. Chitwan tigers were one-sixth less active during the day by comparison with tigers in Indonesia and Malaysia, for example, the researchers point out in a second paper published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. They suggested that this might be because Nepalese locals frequently wander into the forest to chop wood.
Over all, Mr. Carter said, the studies show that large species of wildlife can share the same space as human populations. Studies in other locations where tigers and humans occupy the same space are needed to confirm whether or not this is a universal trend, however, he added.
"Finding something interesting like this in Nepal is exciting," Mr. Carter said. "We should try to identify which policies are working from this case study and potentially duplicate it elsewhere."
From lions and leopards in Africa to cougars, wolves and bears in the United States, he added, more study is needed on human tolerance for carnivorous wildlife and how the animals respond in turn.

HEADLINE: Near the Convention Site, 'Occupy' Takes Root

BYLINE: VIV BERNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: A low turnout of protesters as the Democratic convention kicks off. 

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Eric Verlo waved an "Occupy the DNC" flag as he stood among the dozens of tents pitched around Marshall Park in uptown Charlotte on Monday in advance of the Democratic National Convention. The flag was not so much a rallying point as a declaration of the Occupy movement's defiant presence here.
Mr. Verlo drove from Colorado Springs to Charlotte to join the protest and is one of about 80 to 100 people staying at the Occupy encampment, a launch point for their activism during the convention that begins Tuesday. 
But the park happens to be across the street from a more imposing encampment here - the convention at Time Warner Cable Arena - and the sides are separated by a high fence and a large police presence.
So how is Occupy the D.N.C. going to get its message through the barricades and to the power brokers?
"I'm not sure there's an answer there," Mr. Verlo said. "We're up against barriers around most of the buildings here."
"This is supposed to be part of our democratic process," he said. "This is supposed to be involving the common citizen, but it's looking ever more like it's not. That could even account for the fewer numbers" of protesters.
Perhaps the demonstrators did not know they would be permitted here despite an ordinance that bans camping in the city, which was used to break up the original Occupy Charlotte encampment in January. This time, the city has set up portable toilets and provided water to Occupy members during the convention.
The small Occupy gathering here follows the smaller-than-expected showing in marches at the Republican National Convention last week in Tampa, Fla., and in Charlotte on Sunday.
"I'm a little disappointed," said Darrell Prince, 36, of Brooklyn, an original member of Occupy Wall Street who was also in Tampa last week. "I feel like there's certainly enough people who are upset right now. Congress has a 9 percent approval rate."
"That means there should be people out in the streets, and there's reasons to be out in the streets," he said.
Most of the people out in the streets on Monday morning were participating in the annual Labor Day parade, which wound through several streets in Charlotte and ended at Marshall Park. That led to an odd confrontation between the union members and Occupy campers - two groups that had protested side by side on Sunday in the "March on Wall Street South" - a reference to Charlotte's status as a banking city. 
The union members shouted "four more years" in support of President Obama, while the Occupy members who don't approve of either party responded, "war more years." They shouted back and forth for several minutes, but there was no physical confrontation.
"They are selling out their independence, which is a big issue," said Nancy Menoz of the Anarchists Alliance D.C., who led the shouts of the Occupy group. "And this is my problem right now with the unions that are supporting Obama."
Ms. Menoz and Mr. Prince both plan to be in New York on Sept. 17 for the one-year anniversary of the start of the Occupy movement. The numbers there could determine whether there is a future beyond the encampments that have been banned around the country.
Some remain hopeful.
"I think it's funny that everybody's like, 'Occupy's dead," said Vic Suter, 23, an Occupy Charlotte member who is camping at Marshall Park. "We'll see come September 17 if that can be a revamping, restarting point, so we can figure out if we're not going to have these encampments, where are we going."
Others believe it's inevitable the protests will continue in some form, whether their voices are heard in Charlotte or not.
"I think it's ensured by what's happening with the global economy," Mr. Verlo said. "It's not going to be us starting slogans that will finally win people over. I believe it will be the fact that more people are going to lose their jobs and their homes and those aren't coming back."

HEADLINE: Nuclear Politics

BYLINE: CAROL GIACOMO


HIGHLIGHT: The father of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program is mulling a new career in politics. 

 BODY:
In Pakistan's history, Abdul Qadeer Khan holds a unique place as the father of the country's nuclear weapons program. Now at the age of 76, he's mulling another vocation - political candidate, in elections expected next year.
There are many reasons why this would be bad for Pakistan, which has wasted millions of dollars over the years on its nuclear program when the need for improving the economy, creating jobs, establishing a better school system and building infrastructure is so great. There is also the not-so-insignificant matter of fighting the Pakistani Taliban that is trying to destroy the state.
Mr. Khan brought disgrace upon himself in 2004 when he confessed to having sold nuclear secrets to Iran, North Korea and Libya. Pakistan's president at the time was Gen. Pervez Musharraf who pardoned Mr. Khan but placed him under house arrest. The government relaxed the restrictions in 2009 but his movement remains somewhat limited. Nevertheless, he is still revered by many Pakistanis and could have some electoral appeal. He recently founded the Movement for the Protection of Pakistan.

According to news reports, Mr. Khan seems to be talking some sense. He wants to break the stranglehold of traditional political dynasties and purge the country of corruption, through elections. He is especially looking for support among the youth, who are 47 percent of the population. But he also still revels in his nuclear exploits.
The bottom line is that Mr. Khan was quite content to provide some of the world's most repressive regimes with the capability to blow up its neighbors and anybody else. Pakistan's needs a vibrant, competitive political system that will produce a new generation of enlightened selfless leaders who will commit to building a functioning democratic state that will serve all its citizens. Mr. Khan is not that person.

HEADLINE: Coming to Australia

BYLINE: LUKE HUNT


HIGHLIGHT: Catering to an immigration-sensitive electorate, the Australian government is making it harder for Afghan refugees to make a new home on a land they've risked death to reach. 

 BODY:
MELBOURNE - A takeaway kebab shop in a leafy Australian suburb seems a far cry from the troubles of Afghanistan. But even here the anguish of war and centuries-old prejudices bite.
The sinking of another boat carrying asylum seekers from Afghanistan - almost 100 died last week in Indonesia's Sunda Strait - has left the Hazara community here anxious and disturbed.
"More boats will come," the 29-year-old Hasan Jafari forecasts from the relative comfort of the Doner Kebab Inn, a shop he opened two months ago amid the middle-class comforts of the suburb of Ormond. "It is better to die at sea trying to get here than to be killed in Afghanistan or Pakistan."
Hazaras, a predominantly Shiite and Persian-speaking group, have a long history of being persecuted in Afghanistan at the hands of overwhelmingly Sunni rivals: Pashtuns, Tajiks and Turks. They have been landing on the northwestern coast of Australia in significant numbers since the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001.
The number of Hazaras in Australia has swelled to approximately 50,000, about one-third of them arriving by boat, alongside non-Hazaras from Afghanistan, as well as Pakistan, Iraq and Sri Lanka.
Few of these refugees want to criticize the country that has given them a home. However, some find it difficult to remain silent about a government that claims to be acting in the interest of hard-pressed asylum seekers but has recently decided to send them to third countries whose lack of prominence in the international system and poor track record on human rights is unlikely to deliver much hope.
After successive Australian governments failed to come to grips with the influx of boat people, Prime Minister Julia Gillard endorsed a new policy: In the future, refugees will be diverted to detention centers in Nauru and Papua New Guinea for screening and processing.
Ostensibly designed to curtail human smuggling, this move really seems to be a response to an electorate that is threatening to end Gillard's tenure at the next election. (A vote must be held by Nov. 30 of next year.)
According to Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare, the policy shift has prompted a kind of "going-out-of-business sale," with smugglers offering cheap last-time deals to those contemplating the treacherous voyage. In August alone a record 1,933 asylum-seekers landed in Australia in 34 boats.
Once they arrive, refugees face highly polarized attitudes from Australians. Some are dismissed as illegal or economic migrants. Others are welcomed, particularly if they have arrived from Afghanistan where Australian soldiers have been fighting alongside U.S. troops since 2001.
Jafari, the kebab-shop owner, says doubts about the status of some asylum seekers - be they from Afghanistan and elsewhere - might be legitimate. But not so with Hazaras. In his view, violence against Hazaras in Afghanistan and Pakistan is escalating because Al Qaeda had adopted a policy directly targeting them.
"Seven Hazaras have just been killed in Quetta," Jafari said, referring to a recent incident in the Balochistan province of Pakistan. "It happens all the time. People don't accept us. Countries don't accept us. But Australians do accept us, and so they must come," he said of fellow Hazaras, all in an impeccable Aussie accent.
He knows what he speaks of. Twelve years ago, the Taliban raided his home in the city of Uruzgan. Finding his mother and a sister not wearing their all-encompassing burqas, the Taliban ordered the family to provide one son, Jafari, to fight on the frontline against Ahmed Shah Massoud, the leader of the anti-Taliban resistance.
An uncle sold a family plot and gave Jafari $3,000. Jafari, then 16, fled to Karachi and flew to Jakarta, where he was loaded onto a boat licensed to carry 40 for a six-day voyage. There were 97 refugees onboard. By day nine, they had run out of food. "You can't think," Jafari said describing the ordeal. "You're dizzy, distressed and sea sick all the time."
After 17 days at sea his boat was picked up by the Australian navy at Ashmore Reef, between Timor and northwestern Australia, and escorted to safety. Jafari was among the first Hazara refugees to land in this country. Now, he is a pillar of the Shamama Association of Australia, a group created to assist Hazara refugees. Between grilling kebabs he plays soccer, supports Geelong's team in Australian football. Occasionally he deejays at local nightclubs.
"Life here can be little boring," Jafari conceded with a smile. "But it is nice. Everyone comes into my shop. There are Russians, Greeks, Indians and lots of Jews. This would never happen in Afghanistan. That is why the Hazaras must take a chance and come to Australia.
If only Australia would let them in.

HEADLINE: In UBS Convictions, Parallels to the Libor Investigation

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: A case against the three former UBS executives who were convicted last week has a number of interesting parallels to the Libor investigation, and can provide the framework for cases that might emerge. 

 BODY:
Theconviction on Friday of three former UBS executives on conspiracy and wire fraud charges for rigging bids in the municipal bond market may serve as a template for how prosecutors can pursue cases in the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. 
In the UBS case, federal prosecutors were able to obtain the convictions involving an arcane area of the financial markets. The accusations involve various bankers colluding in setting interest rates at the expense of investors and borrowers. 
That certainly has parallels to the Libor inquiry as more banks are investigated in the submission of false information for the benchmark rate used in trillions of dollars of loans and bonds worldwide.
 In the UBS case, three of the bank's former executives were accused of working with brokers at other firms to rig bids submitted to local governments and agencies to invest the proceeds of their bond offerings. By lowering the interest rate paid on the investment contracts, the firms were able to generate higher returns. 
The defendants were also charged with accepting kickbacks from firms in exchange for steering business their way. The government relied on recordings and e-mails to establish its case, along with cooperating witnesses who had entered guilty pleas.
Although this type of collusion can violate the antitrust laws, federal prosecutors centered their case on the wire fraud statute because it provides a longer prison term and has a longer statute of limitations to pursue charges. A defendant convicted of an antitrust violation can receive a sentence of up to 10 years, while wire fraud that affects a financial institution authorizes a maximum 30-year prison term.
The defendants raised the statute of limitations issue in trying to get their case dismissed; the transactions occurred primarily from 2001 to 2004, and the defendants were not charged until late 2010. 
Under federal law, most charges must be filed within five years of the conduct. The UBS defendants asked the United States District Court in Manhattan to dismiss some counts on those grounds. A law adopted in 1990 during the savings and loan crisis, however, expanded the statute of limitations to 10 years for banking crimes and any violation of the wire fraud statute that affects a financial institution.
An opinion by Judge Kimba M. Wood, who presided over the case, took a broad view of what affects a financial institution. As a result, she concluded that the longer limitations period applied to the UBS case. 
Although the victims were state and local governments -- which do not qualify as financial institutions -- she found that settlements affected UBS and other banks because they paid fines and civil penalties to resolve their cases. Although it was the defendants' own conduct that impacted the financial institutions, their violations were enough to extend the limitations period to 10 years.
The case against the three former UBS executives has a number of interesting parallels to the Libor investigation, providing the framework for prosecutions that might emerge.
One of the defendants, Peter Ghavami, a Belgian who had been head of an investment bank in Moscow, was arrested in December 2010 at Kennedy Airport. In the Libor case, a number of banks are outside the United States, so individuals who might be involved should be wary about traveling to this country because of the risk that they could be detained. 
The $450 million settlement by Barclays in the Libor investigation means that a financial institution was affected by the submission of false interest rates for setting Libor. The Justice Department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are investigating other banks for their role in manipulating Libor, so we can expect additional settlements that are likely to include substantial monetary penalties. 
That means federal prosecutors can rely on the 10-year limitations period because manipulation of Libor affected a financial institution, opening a much wider window for charging individuals for violations.
The Barclays settlement details a number of communications in 2005 and 2006 by traders at the bank seeking to have its Libor submissions manipulated to benefit their investment positions. Among the statements was one in which a person responsible for submitting information for Libor told a trader "Always happy to help, leave it with me, Sir," and another saying "Done . . . for you big boy." 
The settlement outlining the violations notes that the Barclays traders also colluded with counterparts at other banks to manipulate the Libor submissions, and that they "made the requests in person, via e-mail, and through electronic 'chats'." As in the UBS case, prosecutors can pursue charges for violating the wire fraud statute at the banks because e-mail and instant messaging almost always involve interstate transmissions via the Internet.
The definition of an interstate wire transmission has also been broadly construed by the federal courts, making wire fraud particularly useful in cases involving manipulation of information. The communication does not have to be important to the execution of the fraud so long as it was a step in the process, which can include a confirmation like telling "big boy" that the false information had been submitted. A defendant need not even be the one sending or receiving the interstate wire for a violation, or have any knowledge that the communication crossed state lines.
The federal sentencing guidelines recommend substantial penalties for fraud convictions based on the amount of the loss suffered by victims. Because Libor is so important to the loan and debt markets, the potential impact of even a small variation in the rate could trigger enormous losses. Federal judges do not have to make precise calculations when assessing the loss, or even a potential loss. A recommended sentence for manipulating Libor could easily reach 20 years or more. 
The conviction of the former UBS executives shows that prosecutors can win a case involving complex transactions and sophisticated financial issues under the wire fraud statute. That is likely to encourage the Justice Department to pursue cases from the manipulation of Libor against individuals for conduct that took place in the last 10 years.

HEADLINE: What's at Issue in the Private Equity Tax Inquiry

BYLINE: VICTOR FLEISCHER


HIGHLIGHT: The New York attorney general's office is said to be investigating private equity firms' use of a tax strategy known as management fee waiver programs -- programs that might not hold up if challenged in court. 

 BODY:
The New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, is said to be investigatingprivate equity firms' use of a tax strategy known as management fee waiver programs. 
Fee waivers are complicated. The main tax strategy is to turn fees, which are normally taxed as ordinary income, into low-taxed capital gains. But another way to understand the strategy is to look at the overall economic benefit of the deal. At issue is whether, through these Byzantine programs, private equity executives are improperly using pretax dollars, rather than after-tax dollars, to invest in their own funds. 
Fee waiver programs are a little different from the basic carried interest loophole, which allows returns from an executive's profits interest in a partnership to be taxed as if it were investment income rather than labor income. For one thing, reporting carried interest income as a capital gain, while unseemly, is perfectly legal. 
 Fee waiver programs, by contrast, are legally questionable and might not hold up if challenged in court. 
Here's how such a program works. A private equity executive typically has three source of income: management fees, carried interest and investment income from the executive's own investment in the fund. The management fee is received through an affiliate of the fund and is taxed to the executive at ordinary income rates - the top federal income tax rate of 35 percent, plus a 3.8 percent Medicaid tax, plus another 10 percent or more of state and local income tax (which is presumably why the state attorney general is interested). Call it a combined rate of 50 percent. 
Carried interest is held by the executive through the general partner of the fund, and it is taxed at the 15 percent long-term capital gains rate. The executive is also required to co-invest some amount alongside the limited partner investors in the fund. This general partner co-investment often ranges from 1 percent to 5 percent of the fund, and returns are taxed at capital gains rates. 
A fee waiver program is often used to pay for the general partner's co-investment obligation with waived management fees rather than cash. Each quarter or year, as the management fee comes due, the managers can elect to take the cash, or, if markets are looking good, waive the fee. The waived amount can then be used to satisfy the executive's investment in one of the fund's portfolio companies. To make the tax magic (allegedly) work, the waived amount must be eventually be made up from future profits in the fund. If the fund never has additional profits, the limited partners can theoretically try to claw back the cash from the waived fee amounts. 
The risk is mostly theoretical because the waived fee amounts are offset from priority allocations from the fund in any accounting period, even if the fund loses money overall. 
And while the general partner can be asked to contribute cash when the fund winds down, the individual executives do not typically guarantee the partnership's obligations on this amount, and the limited partners, who would have paid the management fee in any event, have no reason to pursue a legal claim.
These fee waiver programs are risky from a tax perspective. Because the management company is not a partner in the fund, the usual "safe harbor" for carried interest, I.R.S. Revenue Procedure 93-27, does not seem to apply. Even if it did, a court would probably treat the waived fee amount as ordinary income under section 707(a)(2)(A), which Congress passed in 1984 to deal with exactly this kind of situation where a partner is acting in its capacity as a service provider to the partnership. 
To see the value of this strategy, think about investing with pretax versus after-tax dollars. Suppose Jill works at an investment bank, and her employer pays her a year-end bonus of $500,000. The bonus is taxed at a combined state and federal rate of 50 percent, leaving her with $250,000 to invest. She invests that $250,000 in her friend Jack's private equity fund, and the investment doubles in value over five years. The $250,000 of new gain is taxed at the 15 percent long-term capital gains rate, leaving her with $212,500 and an overall after-tax amount of $462,500.
Now consider Jack, who works at the private equity fund. To satisfy his co-investment obligation, Jack must invest in the fund. Under a fee waiver program, he waives $500,000 of his portion of the management fee and credits his capital account with that amount. After the $500,000 doubles over five years, and is then taxed on the full amount at capital gains rates on the back end, Jack walks away with $850,000 - roughly 84 percent better off than Jill, who invested with after-tax dollars.

This week's Dashboard roundup of small-business news includes a link to an article about a new program introduced by the New Jersey Department of Labor in partnership with the nonprofit Intersect Fund, a microlender. With loans as small as $500, the program will support small-business development in poor and distressed areas of the state. We decided to contact Rohan Mathew, one of the founders of the Intersect Fund, to learn more. A condensed version of the conversation follows.
Q.
A.
The Intersect Fund was founded in 2008 and made its first individual loans in 2010. In two years since then, we have made 160 loans totaling more than $290,000.
Q.
A.
Microbusinesses are a big market - there are 25 million in the U.S. - but the microlending industry remains small. We made more loans in our second year of lending than the four other New Jersey microlenders combined. I see our primary competition as credit cards, loan sharks, subprime auto lenders, friends and family, and in many cases inaction -- deciding against making an investment to grow the business.
We try to differentiate ourselves with a quick and easy process with few hassles -- even if we decline your application, we do it promptly and with dignity -- and great customer service. Our borrowers have a single point of contact rather than a 1-800 number, so they are able to develop a relationship.
Our most significant constraints for growth are finding great people to grow our staff and access to affordable capital.
Q.
A.
Because we are a nonprofit, we are able to consider not only the R.O.I. but also the R.O.I. We also have a very high number of repeat borrowers, so even though the $500 loan may be a loss leader, it can lead to a larger loan which has more favorable economics.
There's a phrase we've coined internally - the just-right-amount loan - which means that we try to put entrepreneurs in a loan amount that's a good fit for their current situation. Sometimes this means we are only able to accomplish one of a borrower's goals instead of the 10 she came to us with. We determine our loan amounts with an eye toward not taking on undue risk for the borrower, making sure the loan can be repaid in a short amount of time, and financing the investments that will generate the greatest return for the business.
Once, we made a $350 loan to a seamstress who lived on $800 a month of public assistance along with sporadic business income. Rather than just declining her due to her poor credit history and low income, we found a loan amount that was right for her that allowed her to register her informal business and obtain a secured credit card to purchase supplies.
Q.
A.
We have a program for individuals to invest up to $100,000 with us for a minimum term of two years and receive a return of 1 to 3.5 percent. We liken it to a "C.D. with a conscience," allowing investors to earn a return while knowing their money is doing some good.
Q.
We primarily target existing businesses that are unable to access mainstream financing due to the informal nature of the business, limited or no credit history, or language barriers. Our ideal client is looking for a small amount of money -- around $5,000 -- for a specific purpose. We target sole proprietors with one or no employees that operate in traditional, bread-and-butter industries -- i.e., beauty salons, cleaning services, caterers -- that are not capital-intensive or ultracompetitive. These businesses may not grow into million-dollar businesses, but they are more than able to make a good living for the owner.
Q.
A.
Landlords. We often see entrepreneurs get so infatuated with nice retail spaces in great locations that they end up overpaying. Renting commercial space requires experience and knowledge of the market, so first-time tenants need an adviser to look out for their interests. Sometimes an extra $1,000 to 2,000 a month is the difference between a business making money and losing money.
Q.
A.
Yes. It doesn't happen often -- 2 percent loss rate -- but we are serious about collecting on delinquent loans and will use the courts and repossess collateral if necessary.
Q.
A.
The dearth of financing options for small businesses as well as increasing numbers of people that are turning to entrepreneurship has been a boon to our business in recent years. For us, it's not commercial lending, but rather pullbacks in credit card and auto lending that increase our market opportunity.

HEADLINE: My Thoughts on E-Book Pricing? Let Me Draw You a Picture

BYLINE: JULIE BOSMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Bob Kohn, an outspoken critic of the Department of Justice's settlement with three publishers over e-book pricing, said he hoped to be more economical with his words by using pictures as well. 

 BODY:
The Department of Justice's proposed settlement with three book publishers over accusations of e-book price fixing has prompted hundreds of court filings, responses and public comments in advance of the settlement's final approval before a federal judge.
Until now, none has arrived in graphic novel format.
On Tuesday afternoon, Bob Kohn, the chairman and chief executive of RoyaltyShare and one of the more outspoken critics of the settlement, filed a friend-of-the-court brief that laid out his case in five pages of black-and-white comic strips. In an e-mail, Mr. Kohn said he had been spurred to do so when Judge Denise L. Cote of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who is presiding over the case, required him to keep his brief to five pages.
Finding it difficult to whittle his 93-page argument into five pages, Mr. Kohn, an authority on licensing, rights and antitrust matters, tried a different approach.
"I thought of the idea of using pictures which, as we know, paint a thousand words," Mr. Kohn said in an e-mail.
He called his daughter, Katie, who is studying for her Ph.D in film studies at Harvard, who connected him with a fellow student, Julia Alekseyeva. After conferring with Ms. Alekseyeva, Mr. Kohn wrote the script and she drew the illustrations. (Judge Cote and Mr. Kohn play a role in the fictional narrative.)
Mr. Kohn filed the brief on Tuesday afternoon.

HEADLINE: Ahold Weighs Sale of Stake in ICA of Sweden

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The Dutch retailer Ahold says it is considering options for its 60 percent stake in the Swedish supermarket chain ICA, including selling its holding. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The Dutch retailer Ahold said on Tuesday that it was considering options for its 60 percent stake in the Swedish supermarket chain ICA, including selling its holding.
Ahold, which operates the Giant retail chain in the United States, said the review would take up to 12 months, and might lead to an initial public offering of ICA, which runs stores across Scandinavia and the Baltic region. 
The Dutch company did not say how much it planned to raise through the potential sale.
The announcement comes at a difficult time for European retailers, as the Continent's debt crisis continues to hamper consumer spending. Uncertainty surrounding the European economy has also severely reduced the number of I.P.O.'s this year.
Ahold operates ICA with the Swedish investment group Hakon Invest, which owns the other 40 percent of the Swedish supermarket chain. Ahold and Hakon share equal control over the management of ICA.
Hakon has first right of refusal to purchase Ahold's stake in ICA, and is considering a number of options, including potentially buying out Ahold, according to a company spokeswoman.
"Irrespective of Ahold's decision to proceed in this matter, we are confident with our ownership in ICA," Hakon's chief executive, Claes-Goran Sylven, said in a statement. "Our shareholding and ownership influence in ICA is not for sale."
ICA operates more than 2,200 stores in Sweden, Norway and the Baltic countries, and it reported revenue of about $14 billion last year, a slight increase from 2010.
Shares in Ahold rose 4.1 percent in morning trading in Amsterdam on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Republicans Are Wrong on Call for Gold Standard

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Once again, the Republican Party platform is calling for a return to the gold standard, a plan that has little support among economists, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Last week, the Republican Party officially endorsed a platform suggesting that the nation return to a gold standard. The statement on Page 4 does not mention gold specifically but rather talks about "a metallic basis for the U.S. currency." The meaning is clear; no one is talking about basing the dollar on iron, copper or tin. The platform calls for a commission to study the idea.
This approach is very similar to that in the 1980 Republican platform, which also endorsed a gold standard without mentioning gold. It talked about a "monetary standard" and breakage of the link between the dollar and "real commodities," which led to "hyperinflationary forces." Of course, gold is the commodity that dollars were linked to before 1971.
According to an article in the July 31, 1980, issue of The Washington Post, the drafters of the 1980 Republican platform inflation plank included Representative David Stockman of Michigan, the Republican strategist Jeffrey Bell and Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers (and subsequently chairman of the Federal Reserve), who endorsed the gold standard in a 1966 article for the libertarian novelist Ayn Rand's newsletter. The drafters were clearly contemplating a gold standard.
Today, the usual gold bugs - The Wall Street Journal opinion pages, Forbes magazine and conservative Web sites - are all very excited about the Republican endorsement of yellow metal in place of that paper junk we carry in our wallets. During the Republican primaries, both Newt Gingrich and Herman Cain endorsed a return to the gold standard. 
Running parallel to work on the 1980 Republican platform, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Representative Ron Paul of Texas had an amendment attached to a bill regarding the International Monetary Fund that required establishment of a commission to study "the role of gold in domestic and international monetary systems." It became law on Oct. 7, 1980.
By the time members of the commission were appointed, Ronald Reagan was president. The New York Times reported that he was sympathetic to a gold standard and that some of his economic advisers, including the economist Arthur Laffer and the businessman Lewis Lehrman, were keen on the idea. In an Aug. 17, 1981, column, Rowland Evans and Robert Novak reported that the Reagan administration "is filled with closet gold bugs."
The Gold Commission issued its report in March 1982. It said that most members of the commission "believe that a return to the gold standard is not desirable." Of the commission members, only Mr. Lehrman and Mr. Paul dissented and recommended its re-establishment.
Even before that, however, the Reagan administration had signaled its negative position on any return to a gold standard in the Economic Report of the President, issued in February (starting on Page 69). The gist of its objection was that while a gold standard provided stable purchasing power over long periods of time, that was only because inflations were subsequently offset with debilitating deflations. As a consequence, there were greater economic instabilities, higher unemployment and longer recessions during the gold-standard era.
Economists today generally believe that the gold standard exacerbated the Great Depression. They note that those countries that went off it first in the 1930s were the first to recover. A survey of a panel of 41 prominent economists earlier this year by the University of Chicago business school found no support for a gold standard, including by those who had served in Republican administrations, including Edward P. Lazear of Stanford and Richard Schmalensee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
To be fair, the idea of returning to a gold standard in 1980 or 1981 was not absurd. The Consumer Price Index rose 13.3 percent in 1979 and 12.5 percent in 1980, before falling to a still-high 8.9 percent in 1981. Under extreme circumstances, radical solutions have to be considered.
But today, there is no inflation to speak of and what little there is is heading downward toward deflation, as James D. Hamilton of the University of California, San Diego, noted in a Sept. 1 blog post. Like me, he is puzzled that there is any support for the gold standard under current economic conditions.
I asked Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California, Berkeley, a noted expert in international economics, what he thought the consequences would be of returning to a gold standard today.
Professor Obstfeld pointed out that support for a gold standard, both in 1980 and today, appeared to be linked to a recent sharp run-up in the price of gold. But whereas the earlier run-up was clearly because of inflationary expectations, today's is related to financial instability. This is important, because while gold might have helped reduce inflationary expectations, it would make financial instability worse. Professor Obstfeld says "it could be disastrous." As he explains:
If financial distress continues to push the relative price of gold upward in the coming years - whether due to a euro collapse, Israeli strike on Iran, whatever - then the Fed, if on a gold standard, would have to engineer deflation to hold the nominal gold price constant.
Professor Obstfeld further notes the problem of huge capital flows, domestic and international, for a modern-day gold standard:
Because of both the sheer size and the array of securities now available in modern asset markets, the supply and demand forces the United States government might have to withstand to peg the price of gold are orders of magnitude greater than they were even a couple of decades ago, and certainly greater than in any other epoch when a gold standard was seriously entertained. 
For example, speculators could take immense short positions against the dollar, in favor of gold, through highly leveraged derivatives contracts. To withstand this immense market pressure, the government would have to impose severe restrictions on asset markets - not just on international transactions, but on purely domestic transactions as well. 
Furthermore, the government would not want to find itself in a position where a bear squeeze on speculators would lead to chains of counterparty failures that throw the financial system into crisis. So a broad range of financial activities might have to be more tightly regulated for this second, distinct, reason.
It would appear, therefore, that if the goal is to reduce governmental influence in monetary affairs and reduce financial instability, a gold standard would move in the opposite direction on both counts.

HEADLINE: Daily Report: Multinationals Push Into Venture Capital

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: From downtown San Francisco to Palo Alto, Calif., companies like American Express and General Motors are opening offices and investing millions of dollars in local start-ups, reports Evelyn M. Rusli in Tuesday's New York Times. But the push into Silicon Valley comes even as the broader venture capital industry goes through a shaky time. 

 BODY:
From downtown San Francisco to Palo Alto, Calif., companies like American Express and General Motors are opening offices in Silicn Valley and investing millions of dollars in local start-ups, reports Evelyn M. Rusli in The New York Times.
But unlike traditional venture capitalists, these multinationals are less interested in profits and more focused on getting a peek at the next wave of emerging technologies.
Big business has played the role of venture capitalist before, with limited success. During the waning days of the dot-com boom, financial, media and telecommunications companies sank billions of dollars into start-ups.
The collapse was devastating. Although some managed to make money, far more burned through their cash. In 2002, Accenture, the consulting firm, scrapped its venture capital unit after taking more than $200 million in write-downs. The previous year, Wells Fargo reported $1.6 billion in losses on its venture capital investments. Dell, the computer maker, closed its venture arm in 2004 and sold its portfolio to an investment firm. (It resurrected the unit last year).
Companies say they are taking a different approach this time. Rather than making big bets across the Internet sector, investments are smaller and more selective. For example, in August, Starbucks invested $25 million in Square, the mobile payments company based in San Francisco, which will be used in the coffee chain's stores. This year, Citi Ventures, a unit of Citigroup, invested in Plastic Jungle, an online exchange for gift cards, and Jumio, an online credit card scanner.
Still, multinational companies are raising their profiles in Silicon Valley at a shaky time for the broader venture capital industry. While top players like Andreessen Horowitz and Accel Partners have grown bigger, most venture capital firms are struggling with anemic returns.
The market for start-ups has also dimmed in the wake of the sharp stock declines of Facebook, Zynga and Groupon, the once high-flying threesome that was supposed to lead the next Internet boom.

HEADLINE: Valeant Sticks to Torrid Pace of Deal-Making

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The $2.6 billion acquisition of Medicis Pharmaceutical is the 11th deal this year for the Montreal-based Valeant, which merged with Biovail of Canada in 2010. 

 BODY:
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International has not been afraid to spend its cash.
The Canadian health care company paid $2.6 billion on Monday to buy the Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation, a skin care business based in Arizona.
The deal is the latest in a succession of acquisitions by Valeant since it merged with Biovail of Canada in a $3.2 billion deal in 2010. 
 Valeant has picked up assets in emerging economies like Russia and Brazil, as well as specialty pharmaceuticals firms across North America. 
The company has announced 11 acquisitions this year, including an $180 million deal for Natur Produkt International of Russia, a cough and cold pharmaceuticals provider, and a $64 million deal for a number of assets from University Medical Pharmaceuticals, a skin care company.
The deal for Medicis would help Valeant to expand its presence in the world of specialty health care. The acquisition, which is expected to close by June 2013, will strengthen the company's market share in the skin care industry, according to a company statement.
"The acquisition of Medicis represents a significant next step in our journey to become the leader in dermatology," Valeant's chief executive, J. Michael Pearson, said in a statement.
Valeant shares rose more than 13 percent in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
Not every proposed deal has been successful for Valeant. This year, it withdrew its $360 million offer for ISTA Pharmaceuticals, while it also failed in its $5.7 billion bid last year for the biotechnology firm Cephalon.
The global recession has hurt merger activity, but the health care industry has still experienced a steady flow of deals, though it is down somewhat from 2011. The total value of deals has reached $111.8 billion this year, according to the data provider Thomson Reuters.
The spate of activity comes as health care companies look to take advantage of an aging population that analysts expect will continue to spend money on pharmaceuticals and other health care products.
Last month, the health insurance company Aetna announced that it would buy Coventry Health Care for about $5.7 billion in cash and stock. Aetna said the move would help it expand further into government-backed programs like Medicaid and Medicare.
And in July, the health insurer WellPoint agreed to buy Amerigroup for about $4.9 billion in a bid to increase its presence in the markets for the government-backed medical programs.
Many of the acquisitions have come as companies look to take advantage of a slump in the share prices of target companies in the wake of the economic slowdown.
After a lengthy standoff, for example, the British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline agreed in July to buy Human Genome Sciences for about $3 billion. Shares in Human Genome Sciences had fallen around 75 percent in the 12 months before the proposed deal was first announced.

HEADLINE: In Interview Blitz, Ryan Plays Defense and Offense

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: With Mitt Romney keeping a low profile this week, Paul D. Ryan is the face of the Republican ticket, and on Tuesday he blitzed all three morning network television shows, pressing the attack against President Obama days before he is renominated at the Democratic National Convention. 

 BODY:

GREENVILLE, N.C. - With Mitt Romney keeping a low profile this week, Representative Paul D. Ryan is the face of the Republican ticket, and on Tuesday he blitzed all three morning network television shows, pressing the attack against President Obama days before he is renominated at the Democratic National Convention. 
Mr. Ryan was asked to defend controversial statements in his acceptance speech last week at the Republican National Convention and to explain why neither he nor Mr. Romney mentioned Afghanistan form the stage in Tampa, Fla.
Mr. Ryan rejected a suggestion that the omission was disrespectful to the 2,000 Americans dead in the war, or that Mr. Romney had an obligation to lay out his plans as a potential commander in chief. Mr. Ryan pointed out that Mr. Romney spoke of the war to the American Legion the same week. 
"I talked about our veterans and what they've done for our country,"' he said on "CBS This Morning.'' "We're so thankful for what they've done. We believe if we have a strong national defense, peace through strength doctrine, that will help us tremendously."
Mr. Ryan repeated that Mr. Romney supported the president's drawdown of Americans in combat roles by the end of 2014. 
"We will have to do an assessment of Afghanistan immediately after taking office to see what the post-2014 posture looks like."
Mr. Ryan was asked why he blamed Mr. Obama as failing to help a General Motors plant in Wisconsin, even though the plant largely shut down before the president took office. 
"The promise is that he was going to open the plant, the promise is that he was going to lead an effort to retool the plant and people would go back to work and it would be open for another 100 years," he replied on NBC's "Today" show. "The point is he filled people with all this hope as he traveled around the country running for president, making grandiose statements and promises which are just not true."
The Obama campaign responded that Mr. Obama never specifically promised to keep the Janesville plant open, although he did say while campaigning that he would work to "retool" similar plants for more efficient cars. 
"The truth is that had Mitt Romney had his way and we had 'let Detroit go bankrupt,' plants like the one in Janesville would have closed all across the country," said the spokesman, Danny Kanner, in a statement. "Instead, the president bet on the American worker and rescued the auto industry.''
Mr. Ryan was also asked about Democratic accusations that the Republican ticket's plan to cut taxes by 20 percent and make up for lost revenues through loophole-closing would mean a $2,000 tax increase for middle-class families. That was the finding of a nonpartisan tax research group. 
Mr. Ryan said other groups showed it was possible to eliminate tax breaks and still reduce rates for everyone. He said lower tax rates would pay for themselves by spurring the economy. "Economic growth is the key to this, and one of the keys to economic growth is tax reform," Mr. Ryan said on ABC's "Good Morning America.'' 
"And when we keep taxing our families and successful small businesses at much higher tax rates than our foreign competitors tax theirs, you make our businesses less competitive," he added. "We don't think we should be taxing small businesses and families more to spend the money in Washington. It hasn't worked, it won't work, and we think we have better solutions.''
All three interviews were shot back-to-back in a conference room of Mr. Ryan's hotel in North Carolina. He left soon afterward for a busy cross-country campaign swing taking him to Ohio, Iowa and Colorado. Mr. Romney, meanwhile, left his vacation home in New Hampshire for a two-hour drive to Vermont, where he planned an impromptu campaign stop, according to a pool report.
An earlier version of a home page summary for this post reversed the names of the Republican vice presidential nominee. He is Paul Ryan, not Ryan Paul.

HEADLINE: In North Carolina, Romney and Obama Are in a Tight Race

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI


HIGHLIGHT: In North Carolina, where the Democratic faithful have descended to hold their convention, 47 percent of likely voters are supporting the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, and 43 percent are supporting President Obama. 

 BODY:
In North Carolina, where the Democratic faithful have descended to hold their convention, a new shows that Mitt Romney and President Obama are running closely in the state.
In an Elon University Poll, 47 percent of likely voters are supporting the Republican candidate, Mr. Romney, and 43 percent are supporting Mr. Obama, a difference that is within the margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points on each candidate.
In 2008, Mr. Obama eked out a victory in North Carolina, edging out Senator John McCain by less than a half a percentage point, or about 14,000 votes. The Elon University Poll, conducted in partnership with The Charlotte Observer and The News & Observer from Aug. 25 to 30, showed Mr. Romney held an advantage among men, whites, and higher-income and older voters in North Carolina. Mr. Obama's support came from younger, lower-income and black voters. Mr. Romney had a six-point edge among independents, while women were nearly evenly divided.
With the economy or jobs named as the most important issue of their vote this November, a majority of North Carolina voters also said Mr. Romney would do better at handling the economy. Voters were divided over which candidate shared their values most closely, with slightly more saying that Mr. Obama would do a better job handling relations with other countries.
The poll was conducted with live interviewers by cellphone and landline among 1,089 likely voters.

HEADLINE: In North Carolina, Obama's 2008 Victory Was Ahead of Schedule

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: The new economy in North Carolina has made the state more competitive, but it still leans Republican. 

 BODY:
The choice of Charlotte as the host city for the Democratic National Convention may seem unremarkable. President Obama carried North Carolina by fewer than 14,000 votes in 2008, making him the first Democrat to win the state since 1976. The Obama campaign hopes the convention will be a boon to organizing efforts and help solidify gains in its newly won territory.
But the fact that North Carolina is a target at all for a Democratic presidential campaign would have been hard to contemplate just a couple of election cycles ago. There were trends that seemed to favor the Democrats -- an influx of moderate, well-educated voters and a growing Hispanic population -- but the payoff seemed years away.
North Carolina had been reliably Republican for more than two decades. Even Bill Clinton, a Southerner who managed to carry other Southern states, fell short in North Carolina. But over the past few decades, the state's economy has become much more diversified, remaking the state's political landscape.
Longtime economic engines in the state, like tobacco, textiles and furniture, have been fading, while newer sectors -- like banking, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications -- have been growing. New kinds of jobs have attracted new kinds of voters, and North Carolina is younger, more diverse and better educated than it used to be.
But Mr. Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina came early. Favorable political conditions nationally and a substantial surge in turnout pulled the state into the Democratic column ahead of schedule. North Carolina, while more competitive than it used to be, is still to the right of the national tipping point, and Mitt Romney has had a slim lead in most surveys of the state conducted this year.
From 1990 to 2010 the number of Hispanics in North Carolina increased almost tenfold, and the state now ranks 11th (PDF) nationally in Hispanic residents. Most of that growth has been in North Carolina's main urban areas, like Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham and Greensboro.
Indeed, North Carolina's cities have been leading its population boom, making the state significantly more urban. 
The cities have seen an influx of young, well-educated voters drawn to banking jobs in Charlotte and knowledge jobs in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area, known as the Research Triangle, Mr. Heberlig said.
In addition, many African-American families have been moving back to North Carolina, Mr. Guillory said, reversing the out-migration of blacks from the state that occurred in past decades.
The overall effect of these trends on the state's racial makeup has been substantial. In 1990, North Carolina's non-Hispanic white population was 76 percent (PDF). By 2000, it had dropped to 73 percent -- and according to the Census Bureau's estimate, it was down to 65 percent by 2011. Currently, the state is 22 percent black, 9 percent Hispanic and 2 percent Asian.
Not surprisingly, the growth of North Carolina's cities has helped Democratic candidates. If Mr. Obama would have equaled John Kerry's 2004 performance in the four counties containing Charlotte, Durham, Raleigh and Greensboro, North Carolina would have remained red in 2008. There are now enough Democratic-leaning voters in North Carolina's metropolitan areas to power a Democratic presidential candidate to victory under favorable political conditions.
Still, North Carolina's 15 electoral votes would likely go Republican in an election fought to a draw nationally. Outside of its major cities, the state is almost exclusively conservative (save for the rural, black-majority counties in the northeast and the liberal enclave of Asheville). The mountains in the western third of the state, the rural counties along the coast and many suburbs and exurbs in the Piedmont section of the state are all heavily Republican.
"Republicans are still very strong in white majority rural counties," Mr. Guillory said.
Moreover, Mr. Obama may be hindered by the state's struggling economy. It's unemployment rate, at 9.6 percent, is substantially higher than the national average.
The Bellwether: New Hanover County
Wilmington's New Hanover County, on the southeast coast, has been an almost exact barometer of the statewide vote in North Carolina for the past three presidential elections. While it is a bit less diverse than North Carolina as a whole, New Hanover County is home to well-educated voters associated with the University of North Carolina-Wilmington, and it has a fast-growing (PDF) Hispanic community.
Its economy has a bit of both old and new North Carolina, revolving around tourists flocking to the beach, as well as manufacturing and cotton and tobacco farming in the rural areas, Mr. Heberlig said.
One word of warning, though: New Hanover County has been slowly trending Republican, Mr. Guillory said, and its accuracy as a statewide bellwether may not hold up this year.
The Bottom Line
Mr. Obama has a 38 percent chance of carrying North Carolina, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast. While his 2008 victory was made possible by the demographic trends in the state, it was realized by a surge in turnout that may not be repeated this year.
Turnout in North Carolina jumped almost 8 percent from 2004 to 2008, the largest increase in the nation. The state also experienced among the largest increases in youth turnout. Even with all that, Mr. Obama barely carried the state.
North Carolina is much closer to the nation's electoral tipping point than it was a generation ago. The state is even closer than it was four years ago. In 2008, the state leaned to the right relative to the national popular vote by about seven percentage points.
Since then, the demographic trends that have made North Carolina more competitive have continued but at a significantly slower pace because of the recession, Mr. Heberlig said. North Carolina has become about two percentage points more Democratic: the FiveThirtyEight forecast currently pegs it at about five percentage points more Republican-leaning than the national average.
Put simply, North Carolina has moved toward the political center, but it's not there yet.

HEADLINE: On the Road to North Carolina, Obama Stops to Shore Up Support in Virginia

BYLINE: HELENE COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: Of all the swing states this election, there are few more coveted by Democrats then this former capital of the Confederacy. 

 BODY:
MECHANICSVILLE, Va. - Of all the swing states this election, there are few more coveted by Democrats than this former capital of the Confederacy, where an influx of Hispanics and population growth in Northern Virginia has turned this formerly red state, if not blue, then at least, purple.
So it was no surprise that President Obama chose Norfolk as the final stop on a tour taking him to Charlotte, N.C., - and the Democratic National Convention - that he has been on over the past four days. Seeming intent on not heading to North Carolina without first doing all he could to shore up his chances in Virginia, Mr. Obama delivered a rousing speech to 11,600 people at Norfolk State University characterizing his Republican opponents as representative of failed policies of the past.
At times shouting into the microphone, Mr. Obama began sentence after sentence with the word "Virginia."
"So, Virginia - Norfolk - on issue after issue, Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan - they want to take us backwards," the president said. Whenever his audience booed, he fell back on the line he has taken to using of late on the campaign trail. "Don't boo! Vote!" 
Democratic officials initially chose Charlotte as the site of this year's convention in part because of the hope that Mr. Obama will repeat in 2012 his unlikely victory in North Carolina in 2008. But now - even though the Obama camp has still managed to keep North Carolina somewhat still in play this year, campaign operatives privately acknowledge that it will be a tall order for Mr. Obama to repeat in North Carolina in 2012 what he did in 2008.
But Virginia is a whole different story. A New York Times/CBS News/Quinnipiac poll last month showed Mr. Obama up by four points in Virginia. But more recent polls have shown the race tightening.
The state has only 13 electoral votes, but pathways to Mr. Obama's re-election get much steeper if the commonwealth is taken out of the blue column. With Virginia, Mr. Obama can lose Ohio and still win re-election. With Virginia, he can lose Florida and still win re-election. With Virginia, he can even lose both of those once must-have states - and he can still win re-election. Conversely, barring a major shift, it is very difficult to see how Mitt Romney can win the White House if he does not win Virginia; he would have to pick up Democratic-leaning states like Michigan or Pennsylvania.
"Virginia, it depends on you," Mr. Obama said. He reminded the mostly college-age audience - a key constituency for the president - that Mr. Romney once suggested that one way to afford college was for students to go to their parents for loans.
The audience, of course, booed.
"Don't Boo! Vote!" the president roared back.
With the Republican edge in spending increasing each week, the Obama camp has been seeking to turn that edge into another cudgel to use against Republicans on the trail. Mr. Obama did so again on Tuesday.
"Over these next 63 days, you will see more ads, more negative ads, more insults and distractions and baloney than you've ever seen," Mr. Obama told the crowd. "And they'll be supported by $10 million checks from wealthy donors who like things just the way they are."
The president tried to tee up Tuesday night's convention events, with the first lady, Michelle Obama, holding a prime slot on the stage.
"I know that whatever I say here today, it's going to be at best a distant second to the speech you will hear tonight from the star of the Obama family - Michelle Obama," Mr. Obama said.
The president, who is rarely known for showing emotion, even went so far as to suggest that he would become so moved when Mrs. Obama spoke that he would cry.
"I'll be at home and I will watch it with the girls, and I will try not to let them see their daddy cry," he said.

HEADLINE: Tell Me Something New

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: The president should freshen his approach, and bring new material into the campaign. 

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. - To fire up the crowd in a pre-convention speech in Norfolk, Va., today, President Obama ran through a list of his first-term greatest hits - tax cuts, a program to hire veterans, the Iraq pullout, health care reform, etc. But he had no new material, and his recital sounded almost rote, compressing a long list of domestic and foreign policies into a blur.
His acceptance speech on Thursday might contain a few new policies; aides have hinted as much. But why wait to freshen his approach? Paul Ryan isn't taking a break from his dishonest parade of attack lines, and the crowds are desperate to hear why the president's second term will be more successful than his first.
Given implacable Republican opposition, it would be a huge second-term accomplishment if Mr. Obama could enact even a few of the proposals blocked in his first term, mostly embodied in his American Jobs Act. But not many people have any idea what's in that proposal, and it doesn't help that he condenses it into a few hurried words.

"We've got a lot more good teachers we've got to hire," he breezily told the Norfolk crowd. . He could have stopped right there, and trained the nation's attention on the financial crisis faced by states and cities that led to the layoffs of nearly 250,000 school employees over the last three years. He could have reminded his listeners that the problem will only intensify under Republican cutbacks, while his legislation would provide state aid to keep hundreds of thousands of teachers in the classroom. Instead, he quickly moved on to bringing the troops home.
"Let's help more folks go to community college to get the skills and the training that companies are hiring for right now," he said. That's a fairly tired line, as important as it is. But, beyond that, he failed to mention that he has proposed some interesting legislation to refashion the unemployment insurance system, by encouraging work-sharing over layoffs and the use of jobless benefits to start businesses.
The president also didn't mention that he wants to cut the employer payroll tax in half, largely for small businesses, and would reduce it further for companies that hire new workers. There are millions of voters out there who think Mitt Romney is the only candidate who plans to cut taxes.
Mr. Obama will need some big new ideas, as David Brooks wrote this morning in The Times, and undoubtedly has a few in his pocket. But he also has plenty of big old ideas that he has failed to enact, and failed to sell. If he won't talk about them to voters, it's unlikely he'll be able to get them through Congress in a second term.

HEADLINE: California's Quiet but Crucial Role in Shaping Fuel Economy Standards

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: The state, with the power to set its own emissions policy, was at the negotiating table throughout the creation of the next round of federal fuel economy standards. 

 BODY:
When the Obama administration completed the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards for 2017to 2025 last month, it was a milestone in a long and frequently contentious process, but not the last word.
California, alone among the states with the power to set its own emissions policy, was at the negotiating table throughout the process and reserved the right to certify the results through its own legislative channels. The state consequently retains the authority to throw a monkey wrench into the agreement, which calls for automakers' fleets to reach an average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, but environmental advocates and industry leaders alike expect an easy approval.
"California and the states that follow it represent 40 percent of the new car market," Phyllis Cuttino, director of the Clean Energy Program at the Pew Charitable Trusts, said in a telephone interview. "That's why you've seen such support from the automakers for an integrated rule."
Jamie Knapp, coordinator of the California Clean Cars Campaign, a loose alliance representing public and private interests, said the integrated national program, in which the federal standard effectively would become that of California, would deliver for the state. "It's in the state's interests to collaborate, because we all benefit," she said in a telephone interview.
Led by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a lobbying group representing the interests of 12 major automakers, the industry readily agreed to the 2012 to 2016 standards, announced in 2009, because it saw a clear path to a unified program in which California's Air Resources Board and the federal government would share standards. And it remains on board for the standards through 2025.
According to Stanley Young, a spokesman for the board, the state's endorsement will be determined in a process similar to that used for the last round of CAFE standards, which apply for 2012 to 2016. "The Air Resources Board staff prepared a separate resolution for consideration by the full board that deems the federal program to be equivalent to that of California," he said in a telephone interview. "We retain our own program, but this process effectively allows a single national program to go forth."
The regulatory draft was sent out for final state review on Friday, and a 45-day comment period was scheduled to begin on Sept. 14. Mr. Young said the board would consider the proposed plan in mid-November.
The federal government has exclusive rights to set fuel economy mandates, while California's standards cover emissions from the operation of vehicles. In the past, this resulted in automakers building cars to one set of specifications for part of the country and to another for California and those states that adhered to its emissions standards.
"I'm not holding my breath to see how this comes out," Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign at the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer advocate, said in a telephone interview. "Everyone was in the room together."

HEADLINE: Republicans Ask 'Are You Better Off?' and Many Reply 'Yes'

BYLINE: MICHAEL ROSTON


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican National Committee received a flood of responses to this question, some they expected, but many that perhaps they did not. 

 BODY:
Early on Tuesday, the first day of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., Republicans took to Twitter and moved to shape the conversation on the Internet about the state of the country since President Obama was elected in 2008. Using Twitter's sponsored hashtag feature, they promoted a question that was anything but rhetorical: #areyoubetteroff
Americans across the country are talking about how #ObamaIsntWorking. Join the conversation: obamaisntworking.com#AreYouBetterOff
- RNC (@GOP) September 4, 2012
According to data reported by Twitter, more than 31,000 tweets used the hashtag #areyoubetteroff since its first mention on September 2, representing a modest response to the Republican National Committee's query. Some of the replies they expected, but many that perhaps they did not.
For some Twitter users, the answer to the R.N.C.'s question was clear: no.
#AreYouBetterOff resounding NO, Before O took office I had a job. Gas was less and so was food.
- Lorre Streitz (@excagrl) September 4, 2012
#AreYouBetterOff Let's see; Bankruptcy earlier this year; cars gone, house in foreclosure, job uncertain; I say "Nobama"
- SS 420 (@SS_420) September 4, 2012
Others let photographs they had taken answer the question:
Thanks Obama #AreYouBetterOff#DNC2012#DNCtwitter.com/JamesBalderram
- James Balderrama (@JamesBalderrama) September 4, 2012
But for many who replied, their answer looked to America's future, not its present. Lynn Davis, a candidate for West Virginia's House of Delegates, shared an answer common to many of the respondents:
#Areyoubetteroff The deficit exceeds 16 trillion dollars. Better question is whether your children and grandchildren will survive.
- Lynn Davis (@LynnDavisWV) September 4, 2012
Many also shared replies that appeared to reflect their perception of the dire economic straits faced by others, without mentioning their own condition directly:
#AreYouBetterOff - NO. Unemployment for women and students rise to 10-28% over last three years. Minorities hit hardest. #DNC2012
- kjcopp (@kjcopp) September 4, 2012
While the Republicans may have hoped to build the case that most Americans feel they are not better off, they appeared to receive replies they did not intend. Many users on Twitter responded affirmatively, often describing in vivid detail how their lives had improved since Mr. Obama's election. And many of the positive messages appeared on the R.N.C.'s own Web site, too:
#AreYouBetterOff Yes! My 401K lost over 50% of it's value in 2008 when DJIA dropped to 6,443. It has rebounded & gained. DJIA now at 13,000
- I'll adore ya (@_velouria_) September 4, 2012
#AreYouBetterOff ? Sure am. My wife and I are now gainfully employed and can almost afford to vote #republican but we're still voting #Obama
- Jeremy Brown (@JeremyBrownFunE) September 4, 2012
One Twitter user also wondered if Mitt Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, were better off since 2008:
I'd like to see #ROMNEY's and #RYAN's assets from 2008, compare them to today, and ask them #AreYouBetterOff ??
- Edward Emerling (@edemerling) September 4, 2012
The positive responses also raised the social and foreign policies that Mr. Obama is likely to highlight:
#AreYouBetterOff .. Yes! In 2007 my health insurer said I had to pay $500 for my IUD, this year I got it for free. God Bless #Obamacare
- Liberalaachee (@liberalaachee) September 4, 2012
#AreYouBetterOff ... Yes. My sister isn't going back to Iraq, is coming home from Afghanistan, and may serve regardless of who she loves.
- Lee Pham (@Lee_Pham) September 4, 2012
And one of Mr. Obama's actions on national security also provoked a variety of tongue-in-cheek responses like this one:
#AreYouBetterOff No. Signed, Osama Bin Laden.
- Path2Enlightenment (@Path2Enlighten) September 3, 2012
The Republican National Committee succeeded in touching off a wide-ranging discussion about whether Americans feel they are better off now than they were four years ago. But as often as the Twitter users who responded reinforced the Republican Party's message, those who are sympathetic to Mr. Obama were able to make the "#areyoubetteroff" hashtag assist the Democrats' cause, too.

HEADLINE: With Lax Regulation, a Risky Industry Flourishes Offshore

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: Reinsurance, already something of a murky business, may become even more complicated as hedge funds rush to open their own firms in Bermuda. 

 BODY:
The hedge fund industry has been rushing headlong to open Bermuda-based reinsurers.
Reinsurance, already something of a murky business, may become even more complicated as a result. And while the hedge funds are likely to profit, the question is: Who's watching to make sure this doesn't lead to another financial calamity?
Reinsurance is the business of providing insurance to insurers. To hedge their risk, insurers will cede part of their claims by buying their own insurance from reinsurers. It's a big business. Holborn, a reinsurance brokerage firm, estimated that $215 billion to $220 billion in reinsurance was written globally in 2011.
 The reinsurance business plays an important role in paying claims from catastrophes for which regular front-line insurers don't want to take the full risk. According to Holborn, the reinsurance industry spent an estimated $48 billion last year on claims related to the New Zealand earthquake, the Japanese tsunami and nuclear disaster and Hurricane Irene in the United States. If you are hit by a disaster, it's probable that your insurance claim will be paid by the reinsurers.
Surprisingly, these big profits make it a good time to be a reinsurer. Less-capitalized companies have fallen by the wayside and premiums are likely to rise.
So why are hedge funds entering this business?
It's the money. Hedge funds are perpetually plagued by fickle investors who want to withdraw money at the first sign of deteriorating results. But a hedge fund can set up a reinsurer in Bermuda or the Cayman Islands. Under the regulations of these islands, the new reinsurer can then use the premiums it collects to invest with the hedge fund itself. The hedge fund suddenly has hundreds of millions in permanent capital that can't be withdrawn.
The hedge funds are also looking to capitalize on the increased interest by pension funds and endowments in reinsurance. With the stock market a shaky investment and yields low, pension funds and others are piling into the reinsurance market in search of higher yields. The Pennsylvania Public Schools Employees' Retirement System, for example, recently invested$200 million in the Aeolus Property Catastrophe Fund, which finances reinsurance of catastrophe claims.
David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital pioneered the hedge fund-sponsored reinsurer in 2004, when Greenlight set up Greenlight Re in the Cayman Islands. Since then, a number of other hedge funds have entered the reinsurance market, but in the last six months what was a trickle is turning into a flood. Daniel S. Loeb of Third Point has announced the creation of a $500 million Bermuda reinsurer named TP Re. Steven Cohen's SAC Capital Advisers has also created a Bermuda reinsurer called SAC Re, which is also raising $500 million.
Hedge funds are also big players in a reinsurance instrument known as a catastrophe bond. These bonds pay out only if there has been a significant event like a hurricane. According to GC Capital, $13.5 billion in catastrophe bonds were outstandingas of the first half of 2012. The catastrophe bond market has been around for a while, but as money pours into this sector, it is likely that hedge funds and other financiers will rush to create other types of reinsurance financial products to draw in money.
This new market is arising outside the United States, mostly in Bermuda and the Caymans.
And that may be a problem.
These new reinsurers still operate as hedge funds. If you examine Greenlight Capital Re's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, its appears as focused on its investment return as its reinsurance business. Indeed, Greenlight Capital Re's assets are managed by Greenlight Capital's investment adviser, DME Advisors, for 20 percent of the profits and a 1.5 percent administration fee, the same as would be the case for a hedge fund.
Yet while they are partly hedge funds, these new companies are regulated as reinsurers. And Bermuda requires only minimal capital requirements and disclosure of financial positions, and it does not strictly regulate how these companies invest their money. The Cayman Islands has similarly light regulation.
For American regulators, the reinsurance industry is largely outside its jurisdiction, dominated as it is by foreign companies. So no regulator is really watching to ensure that these reinsurers do not make excessively risky investments that blow up.
According to Best's Special Report, companies domiciled in Germany wrote about a quarter of the global reinsurance business in 2011 while companies from Bermuda wrote a third of premiums. The last two big American reinsurers left are Berkshire Hathaway and Transatlantic Holdings (now a subsidiary of the Alleghany Corporation), but they are at an increasing disadvantage because of the better tax treatment and lighter regulation for offshore reinsurers.
Yet the concern is not that so much of the business is offshore, but that the growing role of hedge funds may push the main reinsurers to be more aggressive with their own investing. The result would be to push the reinsurance market into becoming a giant hedge fund industry.
We're already seeing some movement in this direction. The big reinsurer Validus is forming the Bermuda-based PaCRe with the hedge fund magnate John Paulson's Paulson & Company.
According to a recent study by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, we don't have much to worry about. First, these investments are countercyclical - meaning that if the stock market goes down, reinsurance is unaffected. After all, disasters just happen; they aren't caused by the economy.
Furthermore, stress tests have shown that a huge loss can be sustained by the reinsurance industry far greater than losses caused by Hurricane Katrina. The reinsurers are also required to post collateral in the United States when they write policies. This collateral typically takes the form of letters of credit backed by the reinsurer's investments.
All this assumes that there are few links between the insurance market and the stock market. But insurers and reinsurers are already big investors in stocks, and some are invested in hedge funds themselves. And this connection to the capital markets will become more pronounced as hedge funds reinvest their reinsurance business money.
Given hedge funds' penchant for leverage, any movement in the markets will be exacerbated as a result. In a catastrophe like Sept. 11, which sent the market into a tailspin, reinsurers operating as hedge funds may face their own enormous losses, which are magnified by their investment losses.
This could create a serial shock to the system as reinsurers default on their collateral, leaving the banks that issued letters of credit holding the bag for billions in unexpected losses.
In other words, the reinsurance market is starting to look like many of the markets before the financial crisis - lightly regulated and interconnected in ways that policy makers can't see, with banks potentially left with the wreckage. The industry may be right that reinsurance is different and has its own checks and balances, but we've also heard that before. It behooves United States regulators to make sure.

11:41 P.M. | Democratic Convention Day 1 Wrap
And with that, the first day of the Democratic National Convention is over. Join us again tomorrow night for more live coverage, including the broadcast of TimesCast Politics and a speech by former President Bill Clinton.
- 
11:26 P.M. | The Obamas Next Door
Forget they live in the White House, forget their glamorous clothes and trips, forget their Ivy League degrees. In Michelle Obama's lively, impassioned address to the Democratic convention on Tuesday night, she cast herself and her husband as ordinary Americans - people who drove rusted cars and worried about student loans.
When the Obamas were first married, "our combined monthly student loan bills were actually higher than our mortgage," she said. "We were so young, so in love, so in debt," she continued to laughter and applause.
She spoke about watching her father, a city worker with multiple sclerosis, "slowly shave and button his uniform" in the mornings. She even mentioned the teachers who taught her to treat the school janitors with respect.
"How hard you work matters more than how much you make," Mrs. Obama said. "Helping others means more than just getting ahead yourself."
Mrs. Obama never mentioned Mitt or Ann Romney, or the fact that they started life wealthy and grew vastly wealthier. But she didn't have to: that is the job of her husband's advisers, who have been working furiously for months to define Mr. Romney as clueless about economic struggles and fundamentally out of touch.
- 
10:59 P.M. | A Closer Look at Jobs Claims
One of the more frequently cited statistics at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday was the claim that the United States has added 4.5 million private-sector jobs since the beginning of 2010 - but the figure does not tell the whole story of the labor market under President Obama.
The number was cited, in various ways, in the Democratic Party platform, and in the convention speeches of Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago and Mayor Julián Castro of San Antonio. In his keynote speech, Mr. Castro said: "Four years ago, America stood on the brink of a depression. Despite incredible odds and united Republican opposition, our president took action, and now we've seen 4.5 million new jobs."
The nation does have 4.5 million more private-sector jobs than it did in January 2010. But by then, Mr. Obama had already been in office for a year. Starting the jobs count in January 2009, the month Mr. Obama took office, shows that the nation now has only 332,000 more private-sector jobs now. Figuring out when to start the count is not easy. Mr. Obama did not take office until Jan. 20, 2009, and his policies did not have time to take effect for months. But when evaluating claims about jobs creation, it is worth looking at when the starting point is.
And note: the Democrats are only talking about private-sector jobs. States, cities and localities have cut hundreds of thousands of public sector jobs in recent years to balance their budgets. Counting all jobs - private and public sector - there are slightly fewer jobs now than there were in January 2009, or slightly more jobs now than there were in February 2009, Mr. Obama's first full month in office.
- 
11:01 P.M. | First Lady's Speech Changes Tone of Evening
The tone of the Democratic convention changed sharply the moment Michelle Obama took the stage. In contrast to the speech that Ann Romney, Mitt Romney's wife, gave at the Republican convention last week, Mrs. Obama - in her prepared text - avoids any kind of political confrontation: no talk of Republicans or Romney or even the other side.
There is much talk of the Obama family, and the experience of raising two daughters in the White House, something that concerned her, she said, when Mr. Obama first began running for president. But the political discussion is limited mostly to addressing Mr. Obama's record: in pushing health care legislation, in supporting abortion rights. The attacks, by design, have been left to the other speakers.
In the speech, Mrs. Obama tries to connect her husband's personal experiences with the policies he has advocated in the White House.
"Believe it or not, when we were first married, our combined monthly student loan bills were actually higher than our mortgage," she said to a hall that was hushed and attentive. "We were so young, so in love and so in debt. That's why Barack has fought so hard to increase student aid and keep interest rates down, because he wants every young person to fulfill their promise and be able to attend college without a mountain of debt."
"When people ask me whether being in the White House has changed my husband, I can honestly say that when it comes to his character, and his convictions, and his heart, Barack Obama is still the same man I fell in love with all those years ago," she said.
- 
10:50 P.M. | Michelle Obama Speaks of Life Before White House
Michelle Obama, the main event of the evening, opened her remarks with a reference to returning military veterans, one of her major projects as first lady. It was one of the things, she said, that made serving as first lady a privilege.
But Mrs. Obama quickly segued into the concerns she had about how life in the White House would affect the life she and Barack Obama had built in Chicago. It is a theme she has returned to repeatedly in her years as first lady.
 "I loved the life we had built for our girls," Mrs. Obama said, referring to Malia and Sasha. "I loved Barack just the way he was."
- 
10:37 P.M. | Castro's Keynote 
The first session of the convention has been marked by a series of sharp critiques on Mitt Romney: on his taxes, his wealthy, his view of government and spending, his experience. Julián Castro, the mayor of San Antonio and the keynote speaker, used his prime-time speech to deliver a withering attack on the Republican candidate.
"First, they called it 'trickle-down,' then 'supply side,'" he said. "Now it's 'Romney/Ryan.' Or is it 'Ryan/Romney'?"
"Either way, their theory has been tested," he said. "It failed. Our economy failed. The middle class paid the price. Your family paid the price. Mitt Romney just doesn't get it." 
He led the crowd in a call-and-response, saying that Mr. Romney's budget plan doesn't "just pummel the middle class - it dismantles it." 
"When it comes to getting the middle class back to work, Mitt Romney says, 'No.'" Mr. Castro began. "When it comes to respecting women's rights, Mitt Romney says, 'No.' When it comes to letting people marry whomever they love, Mitt Romney says, 'No.' When it comes to expanding access to good health care, Mitt Romney says, 'No.' "
"Actually," Mr. Castro said to laughter from the audience, "Mitt Romney said, 'Yes,' and now he says, 'No.' Governor Romney has undergone an extreme makeover, and it ain't pretty. So here's what we're going to say to Mitt Romney. We're going to say, 'No.' "
In keeping with the classic role of a keynote speakers, Mr. Castro offered a strong case for Mr. Obama as well. 
"Four years ago, America stood on the brink of a depression," he said. "Despite incredible odds and united Republican opposition, our president took action. And now we've seen 4.5 million new jobs. "
- 
10:16 P.M. | O'Malley: 'Forward, Not Back'
Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland kicked off the Democratic leaders of tomorrow portion of the convention, delivering a rousing speech that celebrated President Obama, criticized Mitt Romney, and did his best to rally the crowd behind the campaign's terse slogan, "Forward."
"President Obama is moving American forward, not back," Mr. O'Malley, a possible future presidential candidate, said to the crowd that waved blue and red placards stamped with "Forward" and "Not Back."
Mr. O'Malley took aim at Mr. Romney saying, "Swiss bank accounts never built an American bridge." 
He praised his home state of Maryland, especially its public schools, but did not dwell on parochial accomplishments as much as the Republican keynote speaker, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.
The performance was probably helpful to Mr. O'Malley's political prospects since he stumbled last weekend when a television host asked him whether Americans were better off now than four years ago.
"No, but that's not question of this election," Mr. O'Malley said, opening the door to days of Republicans attacks.
- 
10:11 P.M. | A Focus on Romney's Record in Massachusetts
It shouldn't come as any surprise, but Mitt Romney's years in Massachusetts, including his record as governor, are getting more attention at the Democratic convention than they did at the Republican convention.
Earlier in the evening, delegates hooted as the convention replayed clips from debates Mr. Romney had with Senator Edward M. Kennedy when he ran for Senate in 1994. And now, Deval Patrick, a Democrat who succeeded Mr. Romney in office, presented Mr. Romney as a failed governor who left Massachusetts in worse shape than he found it.
"Mitt Romney talks a lot about all the things he's fixed," Mr. Patrick said. "I can tell you that Massachusetts wasn't one of them. He's a fine fellow and a great salesman, but as governor he was more interested in having the job than doing it."

9:56 P.M. | Kal Penn Offers a Celebrity Pitch for the Youth Vote
By Republican convention standards, it was a bit early for goofy-Hollywood-guest night, and the guest was about six decades too young. But Kal Penn reported for duty, armed with a pitch for young voters.
"I am honored to accept your nomination for president of the United States," said Mr. Penn, an actor who worked in the White House and is a surrogate for the president when not playing a charming slacker in the "Harold & Kumar" movies. 
Praising Mr. Obama, his former boss, for ordering the raid that killed Osama bin Laden and for making it possible for people to get "gay married," Mr. Penn said, "Thank you, invisible man in the chair."
Mr. Penn spoke of the president's executive action on immigration and his administration's use of tuition tax credits to ease the debt burden on students. And, he said, Mr. Obama ended the Iraq war, which brought home one of his friends.
Earlier in the day, the Obama campaign released a video in which the president appeared in a skit with Mr. Penn and his "Harold & Kumar" co-star, John Cho. Mr. Obama was pictured calling Mr. Penn to recruit him to help turn out the youth vote.
 "There's a lot at stake here," a stern-looking Mr. Obama said into a phone, "Just remember that I'm trusting you on this."
Cut to Mr. Penn and Mr. Cho, sacked out with empty pizza cartons in what looks suspiciously like a post-marijuana case of the munchies. "That was the president," Mr. Penn said, after hanging up and trying desperately to focus.
The video was designed to promote Mr. Penn's hosting of a live webcast of the final evening of the convention. The Twitterati quickly declared that it was the first time a president had made an open bid for the marijuana-smoker vote.
Mr. Obama did not address questions about legalizing marijuana that came up last week when he did a question-and-answer session on Reddit.
- 
9:46 P.M. | Rahm Emanuel on Health Care 
Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago and President Obama's first chief of staff, has made no secret of the fact that when he was in the White House, his view was that Mr. Obama's proposed health care bill was too ambitious. It would not pass, he said, and it could undercut Mr. Obama's authority with Congress and among voters.
But tonight, Mr. Emanuel was singing a different tune, joining a number of Democrats, among them Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, offering a full-fledged and unambiguous defense of Mr. Obama's health care initiative.
Ms. Sebelius even referred to it as "Obamacare," leaving little doubt that Mr. Obama will make this a major part of his convention and campaign.
And Mr. Emanuel, who flew in to remind the delegates of the tough situation Mr. Obama found upon taking office, found only good things to say about the law.
"Today, because of President Obama's courage, kids can stay on their parents' plan until they are 26," he said. "Insurers cannot kick you off your policy because you have hit your limit. They will not be able to deny you because you have a pre-existing condition.
"Because of the president's leadership, every American will have access to affordable, quality health care," he said. "That was the change we believed in."
And the most remarkable thing about Mr. Emanuel's remarks? That might have been the longest the famously colorful mayor of Chicago has gone without uttering a single profanity.
- 
9:40 P.M. | Strickland Fires Up the Crowd With Attacks on Romney
 It can be difficult, particularly at this stage of a presidential campaign, to come up with a fresh line of attack on a rival. But former Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio found one as he brought Democrats to their feet with some of the sharpest denunciations yet of Mitt Romney.
 He invoked Christmas to make his economic argument.
 "If Mitt was Santa Claus," Mr. Strickland said, "he'd fire the reindeer and outsource the elves."
Mr. Strickland, who hailed the bailout of the auto industry, accused Mr. Romney of intentionally misleading the American people.
 "On what he's saying about the president's policy for welfare to work, he's lying. Simple as that," Mr. Strickland said. "On his tax returns, he's hiding. You have to wonder, just what is so embarrassing that he's gone to such great lengths to bury the truth?"
 He portrayed Mr. Romney as secretive, assailing him for the stewardship of his own money, declaring that it was "well past time for Mitt Romney to come clean with the American people."
 "Mitt Romney has so little economic patriotism that even his money needs a passport. It summers on the beaches of the Cayman Islands and winters on the slopes of the Swiss Alps," Mr. Strickland said. "In Matthew, Chapter 6, Verse 21, the scriptures teach us that where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
 A year ago, Mr. Strickland was considered a top contender to be chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Party activists on the convention floor here now know why.
- 
9:24 P.M. | Democrats Press Social Issues
In Tampa last week, the speakers at the Republican National Convention, for the most part, steered clear of raising any social issues that might play well with the delegates, but not as well with independent voters.
Not in Charlotte. Democrats so far have gone the opposite direction, with speakers talking in support of abortion rights and gay marriage. The speakers include Nancy Keenan, the president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, who drew cheers in denouncing Mitt Romney's opposition to abortion rights.
"Women in America cannot trust Mitt Romney," she said. "Mitt Romney would take away our power to make decisions about our lives and our future."
Andrew Tobias, the openly gay treasurer of the Democratic National Committee, praised Mr. Obama's record on gay issues.
"The Democratic Party under the leadership of Barack Obama has dramatically improved the lives of millions of lesbian, gay, transgender and bisexual Americans and at no cost to anyone else," he said.
Mr. Tobias told a story of attending college and having a 26-year-old tutor who was gay. 
"He and I never talked about it at the time," he said. "No one talked about being gay back then. People killed themselves over being gay. But the progress we have made. Eight weeks ago, I attended the young tutor's wedding. To a guy!"
The young tutor Mr. Tobias was referring to? Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts.

8:21 P.M. | Democrats Tout Obama's Support for Israel
Mitt Romney may have made a pilgrimage to Israel this summer and he may be supported by Sheldon Adelson, a pro-Israel casino magnate from Las Vegas. But Democrats are not ready to cede the pro-Israel vote to Republicans.
Robert Wexler, a former congressman from Florida, declared on Tuesday that no one had been more supportive of Israel than President Obama. Mr. Obama, he noted, had defended Israel in international organizations like the United Nations, redoubled American aid for Israel's military defense and pledged that he would use military force to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.
The Obama administration's economic sanctions on Iran, he said, had squeezed its oil exports and devastated its currency.
 "Mitt Romney claimed that the president has thrown Israel under the bus," Mr. Wexler said. "Perhaps Mr. Romney should listen to those who know best, Israel's leaders." He cited a statement from Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak, who said the military support of the United States was at unprecedented levels.
- 
8:08 P.M. | A Tribute to Kennedy and a Tweak for Romney
The Democrats honored one of their liberal lions, the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and used him to tweak Mitt Romney, who challenged him unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1994. In a video tribute, Mr. Kennedy was shown debating Mr. Romney over abortion rights during that campaign. Mr. Romney insisted he supported Roe v. Wade, a position he later disavowed.
"I'm pro-choice," Mr. Kennedy declared, with a gibe that has been thrown at Mr. Romney many times in his political career. "My opponent is multiple choice."
The video portrayed President Obama as the steward of Mr. Kennedy's legislative legacy, with his passage of longtime Kennedy causes like the health care overhaul and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Kennedy's endorsement of Mr. Obama in 2008 was a crucial imprimatur for the young senator in his battle with Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Mr. Kennedy's grandnephew Joseph P. Kennedy III, a candidate for the Fourth Congressional District in Massachusetts, appeared before the crowd to say, "This is the first convention since 1956 that we meet without Senator Ted Kennedy. But make no mistake: he is here with us tonight."
"As we pause to remember Senator Kennedy," the tousled-haired Mr. Kennedy said, "we recommit ourselves to the leader he trusted to carry on his causes."
Caroline Kennedy will speak at the convention on Wednesday night.
Republicans criticized the video as inappropriate. "Classless Dems use tribute video of deceased Ted Kennedy to attack Mitt Romney," said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, in a Twitter message.

7:49 P.M. | A Low-Profile Appearance for Carter
On Wednesday night, one former Democratic president, Bill Clinton, will appear before the convention here in a live prime-time speech, in an event that is being billed as second in importance only to President Obama's speech itself.
But there is another living Democratic president: Jimmy Carter. And he was given a decidedly lower-profile role in this convention.
Mr. Carter spoke around 7:30 p.m. to a hall where there were big swaths of empty seats. Not that Mr. Carter would notice: His appearance came in a videotaped address to the delegates.
And no wonder. Mr. Obama's critics have often invoked comparisons to Mr. Carter in trying to portray Mr. Obama as a weak chief executive. Mr. Carter had barely left the stage, or rather the screen, before Mr. Romney's campaign had weighed in on the Carter appearance, with a statement bearing the headline, "Welcome Back Carter!"
"When President Obama chose President Carter for the opening night of his convention, he chose a fitting surrogate," said Ryan Williams, a Romney campaign spokesman. "From stagnant unemployment to a broken deficit pledge, both presidents left the country worse off than it was before they took office."

7:23 P.M. | Reid Takes the Stage
Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, did not repeat his undocumented assertion that Mitt Romney had paid no taxes for the past 10 years when he spoke before the convention, a claim that drew him widespread rebuke.
But in one of the toughest speeches in a night already marked by tough speeches, Mr. Reid, a Nevada Democrat, challenged Mr. Romney on why he released just one year of his tax returns, saying there was no way for Americans to tell if the policies Mr. Romney was proposing would benefit Mr. Romney himself.
"Never in modern American history has a presidential candidate tried so hard to hide himself from the people he hopes to serve," Mr. Reid said, standing in front of a screen that showed - presumably - images of the red desert hills of his home in Searchlight, Nev. "When you look at the one tax return he has released, it's obvious why there's been only one."
"We can only imagine what new secrets would be revealed if he showed the American a dozen years of tax returns - like his father did," Mr. Reid said. "Mitt Romney said we should take his word that he paid his fair share. His word? Trust comes from transparency, and Mitt Romney comes up short on both."
Mr. Reid's electoral concerns this year go beyond Mr. Obama; he faces the prospect of the Democrats losing control of the Senate. That was clearly on his mind as he denounced what he said was the rising influence of the Tea Party in Republican policies.
"We must stop the Tea Party before the United States Senate falls into the hands of extremists and ideologues," he said. "If they won't stand up to Rush Limbaugh or Grover Norquist, what makes anybody think they will stand up for you?"
- 
7:17 P.M. | The Latino Vote
It's not exactly subtle. There's a parade of Latino officials paying tribute to President Obama at the Democratic convention tonight - and also tearing into Mitt Romney, Mr. Obama's Republican nominee. It's a reminder of how important the Latino vote is to Mr. Obama's re-election strategy.
Among the speakers is Representative Nydia Velázquez of New York, who offered praise for Mr. Obama's record on health care and the economy - and also praised him for issuing an executive order that granted many young illegal immigrants a two-year reprieve from deportation. And she tied Mr. Romney to Republicans who have, over the past year, advocated tough measures aimed at curbing immigration.
"Mitt Romney, on the other hand, is walking away from us," she said. "He was with people who disrespect us and people who divide us and people who do not believe that the American dream means all of us," she said. "President Obama has worked with us for the last four years, in good times and in tough times."

Democrats gathered here on Tuesday to begin a brisk three-day convention intended to draw sharp programmatic differences with the Republican Party and walk a line between promoting President Obama's first-term accomplishments while recognizing the continuing economic despair that has marked the last four years. 
Tuesday night's events will feature a speech by Michelle Obama, in what Mr. Obama's aides said would be the beginning of an attempt to prompt voters to re-examine the president's record, particularly his health care law and his work on the economy.
In contrast with the other speakers on Tuesday night - and most of the speakers this week - Ms. Obama in her remarks will not offer criticisms of Mr. Romney, instead offering what aides described as an account of her husband's motivations in pushing through the health care bill and the auto industry bailout. Other speakers, however, will focus on what has emerged as one of the convention's top goals: drawing sharp contrasts with Mr. Romney. Read more ...

HEADLINE: But Wait, There's More. Excerpts From Conversations With President Clinton.

BYLINE: AMY CHOZICK


HIGHLIGHT: On a recent trip to Africa, former President Bill Clinton discussed a range of topics - from health care and the political climate in Washington to the shooting in Aurora, Colo., to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's plans. 

 BODY:
NYT: Do you think the political climate is worse in Washington than it was when you were in office?
Mr. Clinton: I don't know, nobody has accused the president of murder yet. Nobody has tried to bankrupt him with bogus investigations, so it's not quite as bad. But the political impasse has gone on longer. In that sense, my time was extremely painful for the people involved but not so bad for the American public. ... Nothing has broken the logjam yet. The election will break it. If the president wins, then anyone who wants to stay in business and wants to hang onto their majority will work together. Or, the logjam will break with Mr. Romney's election and they'd just implement their agenda, which I believe will be very bad for the economy. But the election will break the logjam.
NYT: We've seen a lot of the work in Africa of the C.H.A.I. [Clinton Health Access Initiative] program. Speaking of access to health care, what did you think about the Supreme Court's recent health care decision?
Mr. Clinton: The Supreme Court decision on health care was legally curious. I personally thought it was an easy decision.
NYT: About that mandate, during the 2008 primary Barack Obama sparred with your wife about her insistence on a mandate. And now it's the centerpiece of his health care plan. Was that just good politics?

Mr. Clinton: Yes. First of all, Obama was right, it was good politics. I remember when I was governor being visited by this delegation of motorcyclists who were mad at me because I didn't support the repeal of the helmet mandate. These bikers kind of liked me and thought I was sort of this rednecky guy and they said: "How can you do this? This is crazy. We want to ride without a helmet so we can feel the breeze in our hair and hear things." And I said: "I know you do. But you do not have a right to have an accident in which you do not die but you are seriously injured and then the rest of us have to pay for you."
The debate between Obama and Hillary in the primary, first of all, he ran a very adroit primary and he was very smart politically and in fairness to him, he hadn't dealt with the dirty details and the complexities of health care. She knew from all the work we'd done before that if you didn't have a mandate, it wouldn't work. And, in fairness, when we started out we didn't have an individual mandate because we had an employer mandate. I thought the president deserved credit. Most people running for president try to do as close to what they say they're going to do as possible unless they were convinced they were wrong or circumstances had changed. We're glad Lincoln didn't keep his promise to not free the slaves. We're glad Roosevelt didn't keep his promise to balance the budget.
NYT: After the Columbine shooting in 1999, you spoke out in favor of stricter gun laws. Do you think Mr. Obama should do the same in light of the shooting in Colorado?
Mr. Clinton: He's from Chicago. I'm from Arkansas. I had a .22 and was shooting cans off fence posts when I was 10 or 11 years old. They tried hard to demonize me, but the reason I was able to prevail with the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban -- but never did get the gun show loophole passed once the Republicans got to Congress -- is that I came from a culture where people could hear me talk about it and they couldn't imagine me shutting them out of deer season. I had this brilliant great uncle. I bet his I.Q. was 185 with about a sixth-grade education. I said: "What in the hell is this? Nobody really thinks I'm going to take their guns away." He said: "No, Bill, but you've got to remember guys like me. We never took a vacation in our lives. We don't have anything but hunting and fishing." He was a very blunt guy. I said, "'Do you actually think they believe I'd take their guns away from them?" He said, "Hell no, but they don't want to take a chance." It's very important if you want to take this on not to treat all these rural people like they're stupid or don't have legitimate concerns.
NYT: Your wife's approval rating is nearly 70 percent. What do you make of that?
Mr. Clinton: I know that in general, secretaries of state and defense tend to become popular because they are by definition out of politics. But I don't think it's very complicated. I think the country sees her the way those of us who know her see her. She just gets up every day, goes to work and pushes a rock up the hill. If it falls back down, she pushes it up the hill again.
You know, when we were going together in law school and I realized I loved her, I said, "You know, I want to marry you, but you shouldn't marry me." I literally had this conversation with her. And she said, "Why?" I was 26 or 27 when I got out of law school. I'd worked on the McGovern campaign. I'd met all these guys who were against the Vietnam War. I'd seen people in our generation who are the most prominent and I said, "You're the most gifted of all of them." And she just laughed at me and said, "What are you talking about?," and I said: "You should be in public life. You should go home to Chicago or go to New York or someplace and practice law and you should be in public office." She said: "Look at how hard hitting I am. Nobody will ever vote for me for anything." So she went to Arkansas with me.
NYT: Does she want to turn her current popularity into another run for the presidency?
Mr. Clinton: She believes she is leaving politics. She believes she's going to write a book or do her N.G.O. work and try to influence policy. But this whole rise of the Tea Party has made us both think we can't ignore politics. That's why I wrote that little book "Back to Work." But that's what she believes. And she points out that we're not kids anymore and a lot of people want to be president. She doesn't think she'll ever run again. But I think we need to let her rest, and I'd be for whatever she wants to do.
NYT: 
I just talked to her. She was pumped. She went to those 9 countries in 12 days. Hillary started exercising like crazy. She does it at 6:30 in the morning. She has this trainer come by. I told Chelsea, I feel bad calling her so early, but I said, "O.K., I'm calling," and she'd already been working out for 30 minutes in the swimming pool with this trainer.
NYT: What are you reading at the moment?
Mr. Clinton: I just finished "The Social Conquest of Earth," a fabulous book, and I read a few weeks ago E. J. Dionne's book and I've been gorging on mysteries on this trip so I can read myself to sleep. I have a Kindle and I have an iPad, but I don't have it hooked up for books. I've started to use the Kindle because I've outbuilt my house with all the books. I've been trying to give a lot of my books to my school to build out their library. I suppose I'll get into it [e-reading]. I like holding a book, but it's a pain in the rear when you're traveling all over Africa.

HEADLINE: Those Madmen Driving Our National Highways

BYLINE: By DWIGHT GARNER

 BODY:
KILLER ON THE ROADViolence and the American Interstate
By Ginger StrandIllustrated. 252 pages. University of Texas Press. $25.
When Vladimir Nabokov wrote in ''Lolita'' that ''you can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style,'' he was not predicting the arrival of the serial killer and necrophile Ted Bundy. But he might have been.
It's unclear to me how fancily Bundy wrote. But he spoke with a grisly élan. Asked by a prison interviewer to describe his crimes, he said: ''How do you describe what a quiche tastes like? Or what the juice of a bouillabaisse is like or why it tastes the way it does?'' He added, ''Some people taste clams'' while others ''mullet and the mussels.''
Among American serial killers, Bundy seemed especially terrifying because he was mobile. He confessed to murdering 30 young women in the 1970s, and those killings were spread across seven states. He was bad, as the ZZ Top song has it, and he was nationwide. 
Ginger Strand's new book, ''Killer on the Road: Violence and the American Interstate,'' examines the links between random killings and the anonymity and soullessness bred by our Interstate System. These are connections most of us have long ago made in our minds. As Ms. Strand observes, ''If a song or book title contains the word Interstate or Freeway, expect mayhem.''
Ms. Strand's slim book is part true-crime entertainment, part academic exegesis, part political folk ballad. I don't wish to overpraise it: it has soft spots; it frequently deals with material covered in better books; you will not confuse the author's modest prose with Nabokov's. Yet her cross-threaded tales of drifters, stranded motorists and madmen got its hooks into me. Reading Ms. Strand's thoughtful book is like driving a Nash Rambler after midnight on a highway to hell.
On its most primal level ''Killer on the Road'' recounts the crime sprees of men like Charles Starkweather. In 1958, at 19, he cruised around Lincoln, Neb., in stolen cars with his girlfriend and a sawed-off shotgun, killing 11 people and leading the National Guard on a multistate manhunt. His bad actions inspired two indelible pieces of American art: Bruce Springsteen's song ''Nebraska'' and Terrence Malick's film ''Badlands.''
Starkweather was driven, in no small part, by class rage. He said later, ''Dead people are all on the same level.''
Ms. Strand, whose previous work includes ''Inventing Niagara'' (2008), a history of Niagara Falls, dilates frequently upon class issues in her new book, upon the social inequities and simmering resentment behind many violent crimes. But her political analysis has more tentacles than that.
In a chapter about the killings of young people, mostly black boys, in Atlanta in the late 1970s and early 1980s, murders for which an unhinged man named Wayne Williams was ultimately arrested, she carefully parses how the Interstate System plowed through black sections of town, eliminating old neighborhoods. These were ''white men's roads,'' as the National Urban League put it, ''through black men's bedrooms.''
She charts the social atomization that resulted. ''Atlanta's urban renewal and expressway construction had, at the very least,'' she declares, ''built the stage on which the tragedy in Atlanta could unfold.''
This book's most unsettling chapter takes its name from one of the great, literate rock bands in this country: Drive-By Truckers. This chapter gives us Ms. Strand at her angriest, grisliest and most convincing. In it she proposes that America's 10,000 or so truck stops breed serious crime, including serial murder, at a terrible (and largely preventable) level.
She commences by observing that ''at least 25 former truckers are currently serving time in American prisons for serial murder.'' Trucking has become a job that attracts marginal characters, she writes, ''less educated, less stable, less tied to unions, less rooted in family life'' than they once were. She quotes the economist Michael Belzer, who calls trucks ''sweatshops on wheels.''
The bars to entry are low: criminal records and even drunken-driving convictions are often overlooked. The pay is abysmal. Many drivers are lonely and depressed. Annual turnover at some trucking companies, she says, is around 100 percent.
This information is clearly not enough to suggest that even a fraction of America's 18-wheelers have sociopaths at the wheel. But in 2009 the F.B.I. went public with its Highway Serial Killings initiative, noting the numbers of women, often truck-stop prostitutes, killed each year, and suggesting the suspects are mostly long-haul truckers.
Ms. Strand focuses primarily on one case. She attended the 2010 trial of Bruce Mendenhall, the so-called Rest Stop Killer, who was convicted of murdering one woman in his truck in Nashville but will likely stand trial for the killings of other truck stop prostitutes in other states.
Her analysis deepens. She notes how little work has been done on the mental health of truckers. She asks if there might be ''something about trucking that could push some people predisposed to violence over the edge.''
She advocates for trucker's welfare. Do truck stops have to be such soul-crushing places? ''It's not hard to imagine how truck stops might counter the rigors of driving,'' she writes. ''They might have salad bars and dog runs and fitness centers. Instead they offer arcades and dingy drivers' lounges -- a row of easy chairs all facing a giant TV, as if what a driver should do when he stops driving is go and sit some more.''
She is even better on the lives of truck-stop prostitutes, the so-called lot lizards who knock on truckers' doors at night, offering their services for as little as $30. (Truckers who don't wish to be disturbed, the author says, post a sign in their windows, ''a lizard behind a circle with a bar through it,'' so they can get some sleep.)
When these women disappear, few tend to notice. Ms. Strand interviews an Indianapolis detective who calls them ''throwaway people'' about whom, sometimes, only the cops seem to care. But these women can be made more safe, as can the truckers themselves, by better lighting, design and security at truck stops, the author argues, in much the same way planners designed away much of the crime at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan.
Her plea on behalf of these prostitutes is a plaintive call for simple human dignity. ''Those devalued lives,'' she writes, ''like the truckers', are unimaginable outside the landscapes highway federalism built: the anonymous world of exit ramps, right-of-ways and travel plazas where places are numbers, people are anonymous, and human interaction is entirely mediated by commerce.''
Ms. Strand probably doesn't mean to creep us out on her book's dust jacket, where she writes that she ''spends a lot of time on the road.'' No matter. We've already been creeped out. ''Killer on the Road'' is a small book that carries a heavy load of unpleasant but important freight.

HEADLINE: School District Bets Future on Real Estate

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
GERVAIS, Ore. -- This tiny farm-country community is having a back-to-school sale, on the schools themselves. Interested in a well maintained, one-owner elementary with playground and orchard view? Or a 1990s charmer, now used for teaching second through fifth grades but convenient to shopping and the Interstate?
Like school districts all over the nation, Gervais, with about 1,100 students in a town of 2,300 people, has been deeply stressed by years of financial retrenchment. Music and art classes were eliminated last year. Teaching positions have been reduced through attrition and layoffs loom in years ahead, with state aid showing few signs of a robust comeback. 
So this summer, administrators took radical action against their sea of troubles. In tough times, why should Gervais (pronounced JER-vis) do things the way everybody else was doing them? That is how the district superintendent, Rick Hensel, recalled the tone of the meetings as teachers, staff members and residents tossed around ideas.
The board's decision, in June, was a fire sale. Three of the five school buildings in the district -- all six miles or more from town, holdovers from a time when rural districts like this built a little school every few miles -- were put on the market. Asking prices range from $460,000 for the smallest elementary, to $844,000 for a school on eight acres zoned for agriculture, to $2.4 million for an elementary school on 10 acres zoned for residential use.
The second part of the decision was in some ways even more momentous as a measure of how the recession is still reshaping the nation: a consolidation of all the students and classrooms in the 65-square-mile district in downtown Gervais.
Proceeds from the building sales would be put toward new classrooms. Cost savings from reduced busing and other efficiencies of a centralized cluster would save teaching jobs and, with luck, board members said, lead to restoration of arts programs. A $4.2 million bond, on the ballot here in November, would pay for the transformation in time for the 2013 school year, even if the old schools had not yet sold or been leased.
''It wasn't that we're broke and desperate,'' said Mr. Hensel, who added that several potential buyers had contacted the district but that no firm offers had yet emerged. ''We were looking for a way to keep from desperation.''
But Gervais's story also reflects a demographic transformation here in the Willamette Valley south of Portland. What had been a deeply rural world a few generations back -- big farm families spread out across the fertile Willamette plain -- was changing even before the recession. Commuters with jobs in Salem, half an hour southwest, or Portland, an hour north, moved into town in the early 2000s. The population, only 500 people or so in years past, more than quadrupled. Farm kids had become town kids.
''It used to be that two-thirds of the population of the school district lived in the outlying areas,'' said Brent LaFollette, the school board chairman, ''and now it's just about a complete opposite, in that two-thirds of the district lives right here in Gervais.''
What that means for the new district plan is that student transportation ratios will flip as well, from 60 percent of the students on a bus this year -- mostly elementary school age, heading to the outlying schools -- to about 60 percent living within one mile of school.
Luck, or foresight by past education leaders, also played a role in making the consolidation possible. About eight years ago, the district bought 17 acres adjoining the high school. It sat mostly empty for years, but now sports fields have been moved there, clearing space for the new buildings.
The structures themselves will also be a kind of experiment. This summer, Gervais district officials contacted an architecture team at Portland State University that has been working on new designs for mobile classrooms, incorporating green building standards like improved natural light, air circulation and energy efficiency into modular school construction, which has surged all over the country as schools have tried to control costs. The Gervais project will be one of the first to use the new designs.
''They had the foresight to say, 'How we do reorganize and look at the future?' '' said Sergio Palleroni, an associate professor of architecture at Portland State and a co-designer of the new school model with Margarette Leite, an assistant professor of architecture.
Some students, enjoying the last days of summer vacation on a recent sunny afternoon, were less confident that having all the schools in one place would be wonderful. Suzanna Rambeau, 16, is a junior. Her senior year, if all goes according to plan, would be the first year of the new era.
''Having a bunch of little kids around, I don't know,'' she said. ''It's already cramped.''
She was also skeptical that arts programs would come back in time to benefit her. She was a flute player, she said, until the band program ended.
But Britanny Moreno, 7, a second grader who will take the bus to her school when classes start this week, said she had a big plan for third grade, when that school will be just down the street from her house.
''I could ride my bike,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Looks to Airport as a Business Draw

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE NEGRONI

 BODY:
WINDSOR LOCKS, Conn. -- For more than a year, Martin Seifert, president of Nufern, a fiber optics company based in East Granby, Conn., felt like the most beautiful girl at the dance. With the purchase of a small company in Maryland in 2010, he started scouting places to expand his labs and found himself being wooed by economic development officials from Connecticut, Maryland and Canada.
''If you go to Quebec and start a company, you'll get a 60 percent rebate on your research and development expenses,'' Mr. Seifert said, explaining one of the many tax breaks he could have received by relocating. 
Instead, he decided to add 30,000 square feet to the building he already occupied in Connecticut's new Bradley Airport Development Zone, where he will receive a five-year, 80 percent tax rebate on the assessed value of the improvements and new machinery installed.
In July, Nufern qualified for the incentives, becoming the first of what the Connecticut Airport Authority hopes will be a rush of companies building or expanding in an area that has had hard times.
From the boom year of 2005 when 3.7 million people flew from Bradley, passenger traffic fell to 2.8 million in 2011. Two airlines left the airport and many of the remaining carriers cut service. In April 2010, the last airline was moved out of the aging Terminal B and all flight operations were consolidated at the newly renovated Terminal A.
Creating a plan to develop idle buildings and vacant land in the four communities of East Granby, Windsor, Windsor Locks and Suffield that surround the 2,400-acre airport was a priority for Dannel Malloy, who became governor in 2011.
''Somebody should have done this 20 years ago, 10 years ago, five years ago,'' Mr. Malloy said of the decision to move management of the airport from the state's Department of Transportation to the 11-member airport authority.
A zone like the one created in Connecticut last year is hardly a new idea. Communities across the United States have begun aggressive programs to encourage development around airports, taking a cue from booming airports like Amsterdam's Schiphol and Washington Dulles in Virginia. Recently, Atlanta successfully wooed the German automaker Porsche with $14 million in incentives to open its North American headquarters near Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, at a site formerly used by Ford.
''Leaders recognize the airport and its built-up areas are primary business assets to compete in the 21st century,'' said John D. Kasarda, a co-author of ''Aerotropolis: The Way We'll Live Next,'' a book about the urbanization of airports.
Pittsburgh, though, is an example of the potential risks when a community relies too heavily on the fortunes of airlines. US Airways removed its hub from Pittsburgh in 2004 and reduced service again in 2008. Flights dwindled to 150 from 600 a day.
During the hub's heyday, 90 percent of the airlines' travelers were changing planes at Pittsburgh International. Now most users begin or end their trips there. Much of the land that was part of the airport's long-term economic plan remains unused. Only 250 acres have been developed and there is no airport business incentive program.
''There are parallels between Bradley and Pittsburgh,'' said Greg Lindsay, who wrote ''Aerotropolis'' with Mr. Kasarda. Both airport communities were onetime commercial linchpins and are now ''worried about drifting into obscurity as service is cut back,'' Mr. Lindsay said. ''Pittsburgh had it worse, however, because it planned for the future on the basis that US Airways would always have a hub there.''
These days Bradley is served by seven airlines, and the governor says he is personally involved in campaigning for new flights. The state is considering offering a reduction in landing fees and other fees to airlines willing to bring transcontinental and international service to the airport.
''We are targeting specific routes to make it more lucrative for a carrier to offer service at Bradley,'' said Kevin A. Dillon, the airport's executive director. ''We're trying to get business that will generate travel and also generate employment in the area.''
Airports Council International, an industry association, has reported that airport growth can create jobs and spur economic development beyond airfields. Colin Spear, assistant director of airport development for the International Air Transport Association, said the largest airport cities have common characteristics. They tend to be megacities with a large population; they are close to a primary world transfer route; and they have an airline either based at the local airport or operating a hub there. In short, Mr. Spear said, size matters.
''Cities that lack a sufficient number of the characteristics,'' he said, ''clearly will face a bigger challenge in realizing their goals.''
This might be disheartening news to boosters of Bradley Airport, wedged between New York and Boston -- two cities that meet many of the association's described criteria.
But Governor Malloy said he believed the airport could overcome its deficits.
''We know that the marketplace in New York and Boston is saturated,'' he said. ''Our traffic problem is that we don't have enough traffic. That leaves us on the plus side of that equation.''
Connecticut's effort to join other cities in a march to add airlines and build up the acreage around the airport could create what Mr. Lindsay called ''the virtuous circle'' seen elsewhere, in which business spurs more air and cargo service, which in turns spurs more business.
But it is no sure thing. ''Not every airport can be an airport city,'' he said. ''Does it make sense to pursue air service with scarce resources?''
At Nufern, Mr. Seifert said his company would spend $360,000 this year sending products via airfreight from Bradley and an additional $150,000 on air travel.
''We are committed to fly out of Bradley as our first choice because it ultimately costs us less to do so,'' Mr. Seifert said, adding that being in Connecticut had its own value, including the availability of trained workers and the quality of life. ''You might as well locate in China if it's only cost that matters to you.''

HEADLINE: With Lax Regulation, a Risky Industry Flourishes Offshore

 BODY:
The hedge fund industry has been rushing headlong to open Bermuda-based reinsurers.
Reinsurance, already something of a murky business, may become even more complicated as a result. And while the hedge funds are likely to profit, the question is: Who's watching to make sure this doesn't lead to another financial calamity?
Reinsurance is the business of providing insurance to insurers. To hedge their risk, insurers will cede part of their claims by buying their own insurance from reinsurers. It's a big business. Holborn, a reinsurance brokerage firm, estimated that $215 billion to $220 billion in reinsurance was written globally in 2011.
The reinsurance business plays an important role in paying claims from catastrophes for which regular front-line insurers don't want to take the full risk. According to Holborn, the reinsurance industry spent an estimated $48 billion last year on claims related to the New Zealand earthquake, the Japanese tsunami and nuclear disaster and Hurricane Irene in the United States. If you are hit by a disaster, it's probable that your insurance claim will be paid by the reinsurers. 
Surprisingly, these big profits make it a good time to be a reinsurer. Less-capitalized companies have fallen by the wayside and premiums are likely to rise.
So why are hedge funds entering this business?
It's the money. Hedge funds are perpetually plagued by fickle investors who want to withdraw money at the first sign of deteriorating results. But a hedge fund can set up a reinsurer in Bermuda or the Cayman Islands. Under the regulations of these islands, the new reinsurer can then use the premiums it collects to invest with the hedge fund itself. The hedge fund suddenly has hundreds of millions in permanent capital that can't be withdrawn.
The hedge funds are also looking to capitalize on the increased interest by pension funds and endowments in reinsurance. With the stock market a shaky investment and yields low, pension funds and others are piling into the reinsurance market in search of higher yields. The Pennsylvania Public Schools Employees' Retirement System, for example, recently invested $200 million in the Aeolus Property Catastrophe Fund, which finances reinsurance of catastrophe claims.
David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital pioneered the hedge fund-sponsored reinsurer in 2004, when Greenlight set up Greenlight Re in the Cayman Islands. Since then, a number of other hedge funds have entered the reinsurance market, but in the last six months what was a trickle is turning into a flood. Daniel S. Loeb of Third Point has announced the creation of a $500 million Bermuda reinsurer named TP Re. Steven Cohen's SAC Capital Advisers has also created a Bermuda reinsurer called SAC Re, which is also raising $500 million.
Hedge funds are also big players in a reinsurance instrument known as a catastrophe bond. These bonds pay out only if there has been a significant event like a hurricane. According to GC Capital, $13.5 billion in catastrophe bonds were outstanding as of the first half of 2012. The catastrophe bond market has been around for a while, but as money pours into this sector, it is likely that hedge funds and other financiers will rush to create other types of reinsurance financial products to draw in money.
This new market is arising outside the United States, mostly in Bermuda and the Caymans.
And that may be a problem.
These new reinsurers still operate as hedge funds. If you examine Greenlight Capital Re's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, its appears as focused on its investment return as its reinsurance business. Indeed, Greenlight Capital Re's assets are managed by Greenlight Capital's investment adviser, DME Advisors, for 20 percent of the profits and a 1.5 percent administration fee, the same as would be the case for a hedge fund.
Yet while they are partly hedge funds, these new companies are regulated as reinsurers. And Bermuda requires only minimal capital requirements and disclosure of financial positions, and it does not strictly regulate how these companies invest their money. The Cayman Islands has similarly light regulation.
For American regulators, the reinsurance industry is largely outside its jurisdiction, dominated as it is by foreign companies. So no regulator is really watching to ensure that these reinsurers do not make excessively risky investments that blow up.
According to Best's Special Report, companies domiciled in Germany wrote about a quarter of the global reinsurance business in 2011 while companies from Bermuda wrote a third of premiums. The last two big American reinsurers left are Berkshire Hathaway and Transatlantic Holdings (now a subsidiary of the Alleghany Corporation), but they are at an increasing disadvantage because of the better tax treatment and lighter regulation for offshore reinsurers.
Yet the concern is not that so much of the business is offshore, but that the growing role of hedge funds may push the main reinsurers to be more aggressive with their own investing. The result would be to push the reinsurance market into becoming a giant hedge fund industry.
We're already seeing some movement in this direction. The big reinsurer Validus is forming the Bermuda-based PaCRe with the hedge fund magnate John Paulson's Paulson & Company.
According to a recent study by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, we don't have much to worry about. First, these investments are countercyclical - meaning that if the stock market goes down, reinsurance is unaffected. After all, disasters just happen; they aren't caused by the economy.
Furthermore, stress tests have shown that a huge loss can be sustained by the reinsurance industry far greater than losses caused by Hurricane Katrina. The reinsurers are also required to post collateral in the United States when they write policies. This collateral typically takes the form of letters of credit backed by the reinsurer's investments.
All this assumes that there are few links between the insurance market and the stock market. But insurers and reinsurers are already big investors in stocks, and some are invested in hedge funds themselves. And this connection to the capital markets will become more pronounced as hedge funds reinvest their reinsurance business money.
Given hedge funds' penchant for leverage, any movement in the markets will be exacerbated as a result. In a catastrophe like Sept. 11, which sent the market into a tailspin, reinsurers operating as hedge funds may face their own enormous losses, which are magnified by their investment losses.
This could create a serial shock to the system as reinsurers default on their collateral, leaving the banks that issued letters of credit holding the bag for billions in unexpected losses.
In other words, the reinsurance market is starting to look like many of the markets before the financial crisis - lightly regulated and interconnected in ways that policy makers can't see, with banks potentially left with the wreckage. The industry may be right that reinsurance is different and has its own checks and balances, but we've also heard that before. It behooves United States regulators to make sure.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Activity Declined in August

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- American factory activity shrank for the third straight month in August as new orders, production and employment all fell. The report adds to other signs that manufacturing is struggling around the globe as the economy remains sluggish. 
The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, said on Tuesday that its index of manufacturing activity fell to 49.6. That's down from 49.8 in July and the lowest reading in three years. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.
Weak consumer spending and steady declines in business orders for large machinery and other capital goods are slowing factory output.
The report followed other data that showed manufacturing has slowed overseas. A measure of factory activity in China fell to its lowest level in more than three years last month. Manufacturing in Europe has also stagnated.
In another sign of slow growth, a separate report showed that construction spending fell in July by the largest amount in a year.
Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, said uncertainty caused by the recession in Europe, the slowdown in Asia and impending tax increases and spending cuts in the United States ''is taking its toll on activity.''
Mr. Dales told clients that the latest reading of the I.S.M. factory index was consistent with ''growth in the third quarter of between 1.5 percent and 2 percent.''
The manufacturing index typically needs to fall to about 43 to suggest the broader economy is shrinking, according to the I.S.M. Growth at or below 2 percent is not enough to significantly lower the unemployment rate, which was 8.3 percent in July. The Labor Department will report on August employment on Friday.
American factories have been a crucial source of jobs and growth since the recession ended in June 2009. But the sector has shown signs of weakness in recent months.
The I.S.M. survey showed factories kept adding jobs in August but at a slower pace. And production dropped sharply to 47.2, the first time it has fallen below 50 since May 2009.
New orders, a sign of future production, also dropped. New export orders increased but remained below 50.
Separately, the Commerce Department said Tuesday that construction spending declined 0.9 percent in July. It followed three months of gains, which were driven by increases in home and apartment construction.
The decline in July left spending at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $834.4 billion, nearly 12 percent above a 12-year low hit in February 2011. Construction activity is roughly half of what economists consider healthy.
Spending on residential construction fell 1.6 percent in July from June to a seasonally adjusted annual level of $264.6 billion. But that was dragged lower by a 5.5 percent decline in home improvement projects.
Spending on single-family homes rose 1.5 percent, the fourth straight monthly gain; spending on apartment construction was up 2.8 percent, the ninth straight monthly gain.

HEADLINE: Experts Issue a Warning As Food Prices Shoot Up

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With the worst drought in half a century withering corn across the Midwest, agricultural experts on Tuesday urged international action to prevent the global spike in food prices from causing global hunger. 
The directors of three major United Nations food and agriculture programs sounded the alarm both on the immediate problem of high food prices and the ''long-term issue of how we produce, trade and consume food in an age of increasing population, demand and climate change.''
Agricultural production has fallen in a number of major crop exporters this summer. Sweltering heat and a severe drought have damaged the corn crop in the United States. Droughts have also hit Russia and Ukraine, hurting the wheat harvest, as well as Brazil, affecting soybean production.
Low yields have translated into high prices. Last week, the World Bank reported that food prices climbed 10 percent from June to July, with the price of both corn and wheat jumping 25 percent to records. Soybean prices climbed 17 percent over the same period, and rice prices declined moderately, the Washington-based institution said.
''We cannot allow these historic price hikes to turn into a lifetime of perils as families take their children out of school and eat less nutritious food,'' Dr. Jim Yong Kim, who became president of the World Bank in July, said in a statement. ''Countries must strengthen their targeted programs to ease the pressure on the most vulnerable population.''
To that end, the World Bank and the United Nations food agencies -- along with other development and aid groups -- have urged countries to prepare for what seems likely to become the third food price shock in five years.
Low-income countries that rely on agricultural imports should invest in safety-net programs for the poor, they recommended. They also urged countries to bolster local production.
Groups including the World Bank and the United Nations have also warned against trade protectionist policies in light of climbing food prices.
''Countries must avoid panic buying and refrain from imposing export restrictions, which, while temporarily helping some consumers at home, are generally inefficient and make life difficult for everyone else,'' said the directors of the United Nations programs, José Graziano da Silva of the Food and Agriculture Organization, Kanayo F. Nwanze of the International Fund for Agricultural Development and Ertharin Cousin of the World Food Program, in a statement.
International groups increasingly see inconsistent yields and drastic swings in food prices as a problem driven by climate change -- and a global challenge that is not intermittent, but here to stay. Since the food crisis in 2007 and 2008, they have bolstered international cooperation to help foster more stable food supplies and keep the most vulnerable countries prepared.
Oxfam, the international nonprofit, issued a report on Tuesday estimating how extreme weather events might affect food prices in the coming decades -- forecasting that the prices of a number of food staples could surge far beyond the projected increases.
''We will all feel the impact as prices spike but the poorest people will be hit hardest because they often spend up to 75 percent of their income on food,'' said Heather Coleman, climate change policy adviser for Oxfam America, in a statement.
The United Nations agencies warned that too few countries were producing too large a proportion of staple crops -- leaving the world more vulnerable to droughts and floods.

HEADLINE: States Sift for Libor Losses

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
The scandal over global interest rates has state officials like Janet Cowell of North Carolina working intensely behind the scenes to build a case for suing the nation's largest banks.
Ms. Cowell, the state's elected treasurer, and several of her staff members have spent the summer combing through the state's investments trying to determine how much the state may have lost because of suspected manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which is used as a benchmark for trillions of dollars of financial contracts around the world.
''We think this could be as big as the mortgage crisis settlement, that this could be a really high impact situation and that we should be aggressive on this,'' Ms. Cowell said, referring to the $25 billion settlement that the nation's biggest banks entered with state attorneys general.
The activity provides a glimpse at how widely the Libor scandal has spread through the financial world, and how much damage may still be in store for the banks accused of manipulating Libor. Her work also suggests just how difficult it is, and how long it may take, to get to the bottom of the losses. 
The attorneys general in Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut have all been examining how much their states may have lost as a result of a lowered Libor. A spokeswoman for Connecticut's attorney general, George C. Jepsen, said that the state's work with New York's attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, ''has broadened significantly over the last few weeks and we are now coordinating with a much larger group of attorneys general.''
Even before the British bank Barclays admitted in June that its employees had tried to manipulate Libor, there were a number of lawsuits filed by cities and municipal agencies seeking damages from large banks for manipulating Libor. But while those cases were filed by private sector lawyers, the public officials are looking at bringing more wide-ranging lawsuits on behalf of the states. The Justice Department has coordinated with the states and is leading its own investigation.
The government officials are hoping that their cases will be bolstered by new settlements between regulators and individual banks that are suspected of participating in the manipulation. Most of the more than one dozen banks involved in setting Libor have said in official filings that they are in discussions with regulators about their involvement in the Libor process.
Libor is supposed to represent how much banks are paying for short-term loans from other banks. It is determined by the British Bankers Association after a daily poll of the world's largest banks. It then serves as a benchmark for rates paid by consumers and businesses on everything from mortgages to derivatives to student loans.
Barclays said in its settlement that it and other banks pushed Libor down artificially during the financial crisis to appear more healthy. Barclays also admitted that its traders tried to manipulate Libor at other points in order to sweeten particular financial deals. Barclays paid $450 million to settle the charges.
The financial products used by states and local governments are especially vulnerable to an artificially lowered rate.
Ms. Cowell, a 44-year-old Democrat and former business consultant who is running for another four-year term, was aware of the potential implications of the Libor case for North Carolina almost as soon as the Barclays settlement was announced on June 27. The next Monday, at her weekly staff meeting, she asked her office's lawyers and investment officers to begin looking into it.
The inquiry has focused primarily on two areas of the state's finances.
One was the state's public pension plans, which in North Carolina are overseen by the treasurer. A state money manager began identifying bonds held by the state pension fund and money market fund investments that derived their value from Libor.
In July, lawyers from the treasurer's office took part in a conference call on the topic with pension funds in other states. Ms. Cowell and members of her staff have found a few investments held by the $76 billion pension fund that were tied to Libor, but they have now determined that the losses were most likely ''pretty small.''
The other, more significant area where Ms. Cowell began looking for losses was in a kind of financial contract that many states use, known as an interest rate swap. States use swaps when they want to issue a bond at a floating interest rate but protect themselves from future swings in rates. In a standard swap, a state makes a regular payment to its bank and gets a payment back that is determined by the level of Libor. If Libor was lower, the payments will be, too.
North Carolina had two major swaps at the time the benchmark was suspected of being rigged. Together, the two swaps were tied to $1.3 billion of bonds that were issued in 2002 and 2005. The banks on the other side of these contracts included Bank of America, of Charlotte, N.C., and JPMorgan Chase & Company based in New York, both of which are involved in setting Libor.
The challenge facing North Carolina and other states is that there is no agreement yet on how much the banks actually manipulated Libor, and for how long. The lawsuits that have already been filed have estimated that the banks held Libor down by at least 30 basis points, or 0.30 percent, for three years. By one method of calculation, that could have meant losses for North Carolina of around $10 million on their swaps.
Ms. Cowell said she assumed that as more banks settled with regulators, those numbers would become clearer. In the meantime, the treasurer's office is working out formulas for losses that they can plug numbers into if and when new settlements are made public. At that point, Ms. Cowell also plans to share her work with other municipal agencies in North Carolina that held about 40 swaps during the period in question.
''This is an unprecedented level of analysis, and an unprecedented wide spectrum of financial impact,'' Ms. Cowell said.
The inquiry could provide a political bump for Ms. Cowell, who is seeking another term as anti-Wall Street sentiment is running high. A graduate of the Wharton School of Business, she served on the Raleigh, N.C., City Council and then the state Senate before taking office in 2008. She cites among her accomplishments the state's maintaining its status as one of eight with a AAA rating from the major credit rating agencies.
North Carolina's attorney general will make the final determination on whether the state will join existing lawsuits, proceed with its own case or take no action at all. The attorney general's office did not respond to requests for comment.
But the office has been involved in many of the discussions with the treasurer's staff, people involved in the meetings said.

HEADLINE: Mired Shares Await Word On Europe

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed slightly lower on Tuesday as investors continued to await clarity on the European Central Bank's plans to shore up heavily indebted countries, but the market ended off its lows on a rally in Apple shares. 
Equities were lower for much of the session, with industrial and material companies weak after a report showing that manufacturing contracted by its fastest pace in more than three years. Telecommunications and consumer staples, two groups that tend to outperform during periods of uncertainty, led on the day.
Markets remain skittish ahead of the European bank's meeting on Thursday, when the bank's president, Mario Draghi, is expected to introduce plans to lower borrowing costs for countries like Spain and Italy, whose bond market troubles are the latest front in the region's debt crisis.
''We're not going to get any definitive direction so long as everyone is waiting around on the Fed and E.C.B.,'' Michael Vogelzang, president of Boston Advisors, said. ''Things seem very soft right now, and until that changes, the market may have a hard time getting out of the range we've been in.''
On Friday, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, disappointed investors by declining to signal any imminent stimulative action to bolster sluggish growth, though he kept the door open for further easing down the line.
Apple rose 1.5 percent to $674.97 and helped erode broader losses. Earlier, the tech giant distributed invitations to an event in San Francisco on Sept. 12, setting the stage for what is widely expected to be the release of the iPhone 5.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 54.90 points, or 0.42 percent, at 13,035.94. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 1.64 points, or 0.12 percent, at 1,404.94. The Nasdaq composite index was up 8.09 points, or 0.26 percent, at 3,075.06.
In company news, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International agreed to buy Medicis Pharmaceutical for $2.6 billion in cash. Valeant shares climbed 14 percent to $57.58 on the New York Stock Exchange while Medicis surged 38 percent to $43.65.
About 57 percent of companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed up; almost three-fifths of Nasdaq-listed shares ended higher.
Interest rates were slightly higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 8/32, to 100 15/32, and the yield rose to 1.57 percent from 1.55 percent late Friday. The bond market was closed on Monday in observance of Labor Day.

HEADLINE: Smarck Michel, Former Haitian Premier, Dies at 75

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Smarck Michel, a businessman who served for almost a year as Haiti's prime minister after the United States restored President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in the mid-1990s, died at his home here on Saturday. He was 75. 
The cause was a brain tumor, his son, Kenneth, said.
Mr. Michel became prime minister in 1994 when a multinational military force led by the United States restored Mr. Aristide to the presidency after three years in exile. Mr. Aristide's first term was cut short in 1991 when the army ousted him in a coup.
The choice of Mr. Michel was seen as an effort to placate business leaders and members of Haiti's middle and upper classes who felt threatened by the return of Mr. Aristide, a populist, left-leaning former Roman Catholic priest. Mr. Michel resigned almost a year later over opposition to his economic proposals, which included a privatization plan that was unpopular with Haiti's poor majority.
During Mr. Aristide's first term, Mr. Michel served briefly as commerce and industry minister. He was dismissed from that post amid criticism of the government for not lowering the prices of food and other basic goods. Mr. Michel had instituted price controls, but they were widely ignored.
Smarck Michel was born on March 29, 1937, in St. Marc, a port city north of Port-au-Prince, and moved around Haiti as a child because his father was serving in the Haitian armed forces.
He attended college in New York, then returned to Haiti to help run the bakery his father had started. He later ran a grocery store in downtown Port-au-Prince.
After his brief stint in politics, he returned full time to the grocery store until he closed it in 2010 and retired, his son said.
In addition to his son, Mr. Michel's survivors include his wife, Victoire Marie-Rose Sterlin, and two daughters, Patricia and Marjorie Michel.

HEADLINE: Chinese Motor City Limits Cars

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
GUANGZHOU, China -- It is as startling as if Detroit or Los Angeles restricted car ownership.
The municipal government of Guangzhou, a sprawling metropolis that is one of China's biggest auto manufacturing centers, introduced license plate auctions and lotteries last week that will roughly halve the number of new cars on the streets.
The crackdown by China's third-largest city is the most restrictive in a series of moves by big Chinese cities that are putting quality-of-life issues ahead of short-term economic growth, something the central government has struggled to do on a national scale.
The measures have the potential to help clean up China's notoriously dirty air and water, reduce long-term health care costs and improve the long-term quality of Chinese growth. But they are also imposing short-term costs, economists say, at a time when policy makers in Beijing and around the world are already concerned about a sharp economic slowdown in China. 
''Of course from the government's point of view, we give up some growth, but to achieve better health for all citizens, it is definitely worth it,'' said Chen Haotian, the vice director of Guangzhou's top planning agency.
Nanjing and Hangzhou in east-central China are moving to require cleaner gas and diesel. Cities near the coast, from Dongguan and Shenzhen in southeastern China to Wuxi and Suzhou in the middle and Beijing in the north, are pushing out polluting factories. And Xi'an and Urumqi in northwestern China are banning and scrapping cars built before 2005, when automotive emissions rules were less stringent.
''There's a recognition finally that growth at all costs is not sustainable,'' said Ben Simpfendorfer, the managing director of Silk Road Associates, a Hong Kong consulting firm.
Facing public pressure to address traffic jams and pollution, municipal governments from across China have been sending delegations to Guangzhou. But the national government in Beijing is pushing back against further car restrictions because of worries about the huge auto industry, said An Feng, a senior adviser in Beijing to transportation policy makers.
''This has really become a battle,'' Mr. An said.
Beijing's municipal government started limiting new license plates at the start of last year when the economy was in danger of overheating, but Guangzhou is the first city to act during the current slowdown. Faced with public dissatisfaction over traffic, Guangzhou has also built an extensive subway system in the last few years, along with large parks and a renowned opera house.
The local government initiatives are not the main cause of the Chinese economy's difficulties. The government clamped down on credit a year ago in a successful bid to rein in inflation, but starved many small and medium-size businesses of credit in the process.
Other broad economic problems have been building for years. These include industrial overcapacity and the monopolistic grip of many state-owned enterprises, as well as the inefficient allocation of loans.
But for now, the growing regulatory burden on business is reinforcing a trend toward slower growth, economists say.
''That's why I think the slowdown is likely to be a trend, instead of just a short-term cycle,'' said Xiao Geng, the research director at the Fung Global Institute in Hong Kong.
Polluting factories being pushed out of increasingly affluent cities in southeastern China are being turned away by poorer cities in western and northern China unless they install costly, extensive equipment to control emissions, said Stanley Lau, the deputy chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Industries, a trade group representing manufacturers that employ nearly 10 million workers in mainland China.
''There is no hint that these costs will be lowered because of the market slowdown,'' he said.
Some executives in China complain about rising regulatory costs, particularly as new rules at the local level coincide with rising wages. Critics in the business community say that an economic slowdown may not be the best time for China to turn away from the largely unrestrained dash for prosperity of the last three decades.
But while the local measures may limit short-term growth, they are part of a broader transition. China is no longer just a developing economy that has pursued a particularly raw form of capitalism, while remaining Communist in name. It is becoming a modern, industrialized economy whose leaders increasingly listen to public opinion and seek to balance the environment, social welfare and many other issues against economic growth.
The question is how much short-term pain will China endure, in the form of slower growth and higher costs, to achieve a more balanced and sustainable economy.
Ma Jun, the director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, an environmental group in Beijing, said that local officials had become more interested in the environment in the last year after large street demonstrations against polluting factories in cities like Dalian, Shifang and Qidong. In each case, local officials agreed to halt construction of the projects or close them after becoming the targets of local and national ridicule.
Bernadette Brennan, a senior lawyer in the Beijing office of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that after three decades of experience in China, she had seen change in the last year. Instead of resisting pressure to address pollution, she said, municipal officials have begun contacting her office to seek advice on how to improve.
Measuring the environmental benefits of the changed policies is difficult.
A series of typhoons makes it hard to compare air quality data in China this summer with previous years, said Alexis Lau, the director of the atmospheric research center at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. In Guangzhou, emissions of a wide range of pollutants peaked in 2007 and 2008 and receded in 2009 and 2010 because of weaker economic growth. Emissions started to rise in 2011 as growth returned, but did not match 2008 levels.
Pollution per dollar of economic output has clearly declined, Mr. Lau said. Emissions of sulfur dioxide, a top priority in China in recent years because of its role in acid rain, have declined across China but particularly in Guangzhou, a city of 15 million people, including migrants.
The financial dependence of local governments on the sale of land leases to new developments may limit the extent to which some cities confront businesses. But city governments also own many of the businesses within their borders, making these businesses think twice about challenging policies like license plate restrictions.
''The car companies are owned by the government,''said Mr. Chen, who drives a Toyota Camry built in Guangzhou. ''The car companies must obey the government.''
He added, ''What do we need gross domestic product for if we don't have health?''

HEADLINE: 'Are You Better Off?' The Answer Is Less Clear Than It Was in 1980

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- When Ronald Reagan asked voters a week before the 1980 election whether they were better off than four years earlier, he turned a race that had been nip-and-tuck for months into a landslide victory -- and showed how a pointed question can be a lethal political weapon.
Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, speaks often of that election in meetings with donors and other supporters, citing it to reassure those who are alarmed that he has not been able to build a lead against a president burdened with a listless economy, ballooning federal debt and a jobless rate deep in the red zone for an incumbent.
But if Mr. Romney believes the ''Are you better off?'' question will be political kryptonite for President Obama, he will have to reckon with an economic scorecard that is more mixed than he and other Republicans are claiming on the campaign trail. American voters, too, have more complicated feelings about their fortunes, and those of their children, than they did when Mr. Reagan first posed the question. 
''People are not better off than they were four years ago, in the sense of where the economy is today compared to where it was,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard, ticking off statistics from the unemployment rate to housing prices. ''But certainly, things could have been a lot worse. You can decide whether the glass is half-empty or half-full.''
The half-full argument, which the Obama campaign will promote at the Democratic convention here this week, holds that the economy is far stronger than it was at the depths of the recession in early 2009 when it was bleeding 800,000 jobs a month.
Tepid though it may be, the pace of this recovery is on a par with the aftermath of other post-World War II financial crises, like those in Asia and Latin America.
In July, the United States added 163,000 jobs. The economy, which contracted 6.7 percent in the first quarter of 2009, expanded 1.7 percent in the second quarter of this year. Stocks rose too: the Wilshire 5000 market index rebounded from 9,087 in January 2009 to 14,258 last month.
''We avoided falling into the abyss, and it was an open question whether we would,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, who was Mr. Obama's chief economic adviser until the end of 2010. ''It may not be easy to explain, but it's right. It's the truth.''
Voters, though, seem squarely on the half-empty side. Only 20 percent of those surveyed think their financial circumstances are better now than four years ago, while 39 percent think they are worse off, according to a CBS News poll conducted in August. That is just as pessimistic as during the financial meltdown a month before the 2008 election.
Moreover, 47 percent of those polled in April by The Times and CBS News think things are likely to get worse rather than better for the next generation of Americans, while only 24 percent think things will improve. That is also worse than when Mr. Obama took office, when 32 percent said the future would be worse.
But, as pollsters note, Americans have consistently expressed pessimism about the future, regardless of whether a Democrat or a Republican was in office. In three decades of polling by The Times and CBS News, only during the last year of Bill Clinton's presidency did a solid plurality -- 44 percent -- of people voice optimism about the next generation.
Even in the final year of Mr. Reagan's presidency, in July 1988, 59 percent of people said the future would be ''bogged down'' by troubles rather than brighter.
Those numbers belie Mr. Romney's claim, in his acceptance speech in Tampa, Fla., that ''for the first time, the majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future.'' They also offer Mr. Obama a line of counterattack.
The enduring pessimism, Mr. Obama's advisers say, reflects a deeper sense of grievance on the part of the middle class, which has seen incomes stagnate since the 1970s, even during times of prosperity. The campaign hopes to exploit those feelings by presenting Mr. Obama as a great defender of the middle class against the predatory policies of Republicans. In this way, they say, he may be able to detach himself from the current economic cycle -- and place himself in the broader current of economic change in America.
''Middle-class insecurity didn't start with the recession,'' said David Plouffe, a senior strategist to the president. ''The question is who do you trust to build the kind of economy that's going to give the middle class security? That's the central mission of our presidency.''
From taxes and the health care law to education reform and investments in high-technology manufacturing, Mr. Plouffe said, the Obama campaign will lay out the case that its policies will help the middle class while Mr. Romney's will harm it.
Stanley Greenberg, a pollster who helped develop Mr. Clinton's ''It's the economy, stupid'' campaign in 1992, said, ''People want to know the plan,'' adding that Mr. Obama has ''to talk about moving America to a place where the middle class can prosper.''
But analysts say Mr. Obama must be careful about how he talks about investments, because voters understand that the federal government is broke and are therefore wary of promises. ''If you stand up and say, 'Here are all the things we're going to spend money on,' you risk getting yourself into a big argument you don't want to have,'' said Jared Bernstein, former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
For all the talk about the future, Mr. Obama cannot avoid the last four years. Some analysts said he should defend the health care law and the Dodd-Frank financial regulations, but in the context of laying the groundwork for future growth. He should also point out that the United States is one of the fastest-growing economies in the developed world, even at its sluggish pace.
''Yes, it's slower than a get-rich-quick scheme,'' said Austan Goolsbee, a former economic adviser to Mr. Obama. But as recent bubbles and meltdowns have shown, Mr. Goolsbee said, ''get-rich-quick schemes didn't work.''
This year is different from 1980 in an important respect. When Mr. Reagan asked voters whether they were better off, he listed four yardsticks: inflation, employment, America's standing in the world and their sense of security. In all of these areas, Mr. Plouffe said, ''everything seemed to be off the rails.''
This time, inflation is virtually nonexistent, and Mr. Obama has compiled a solid record in foreign policy and in national security.
Still, some experts said Mr. Obama should not underestimate the political salience of ''Are you better off?'' this year. David Gergen, a political analyst and former presidential adviser, recalls how he and Richard Wirthlin, a Republican pollster, came up with the question at a farm in Virginia while preparing Mr. Reagan for his debate with President Jimmy Carter.
Part of its appeal, Mr. Gergen said, was that Mr. Reagan was good at asking questions, especially ones he knew the answer to. The question, he said, also distilled ''a sentiment that was there among voters but had not come together in a coherent way.''
'' 'Are you better off now than four years ago?' remains potent,'' Mr. Gergen said. ''It may not be as compelling as it was then. But a campaign based on a feeling of people's resignation is not a winning campaign either.''

CHARTS: Better and Worse: Whether the economy is doing better or worse than it was four years ago can depend on when you start counting. Many economic indicators were moving downward between the summer of 2008 and President Obama's inauguration the following January. Some indicators have recovered to their levels in January 2009, but not July 2008.

HEADLINE: Carving a Legacy of Giving (to His Party, Too)

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
KAYONZA, Rwanda -- Bill Clinton could not stop talking about soybeans. Over dinner in Kigali with a handful of longtime political aides and deep-pocketed donors, he recited the price of soy (''It never exceeded $8, and now it's $16'') and extolled its virtues as a miracle crop (''You can grow it with just a thin layer of topsoil'').
The following day, he and his daughter, Chelsea, took a tour of a future soybean processing plant here, still a red-dirt construction site at the foot of misty green hills. Mr. Clinton swatted a fly out of his eye and predicted that demand would soar. ''The Chinese can't drink milk, so they rely on soy,'' he said.
But when the manager at the plant asked him to return next year, when production will provide work to as many as 1,400 farmers, Mr. Clinton turned the subject to himself. 
''I'm older than you,'' he replied. ''We have to be sure I'm still around.''
In conversations, Mr. Clinton frequently gives the sense that he feels as though he is living on borrowed time. And the world that he now inhabits -- the global philanthropist on a journey to cure the world's ills and burnish his legacy -- is far from the muddy terrain of partisan politics that he will return to on Wednesday night at the Democratic National Convention.
In a speaking slot typically reserved for the vice president, Mr. Clinton will place Mr. Obama's name into nomination. The invitation serves as a reminder of how far Mr. Clinton has come in four years to refurbish his image and restore his frayed relationship with the Democratic Party after Mr. Obama defeated his wife in the 2008 presidential primary campaign. And it shows how much Mr. Obama has come to rely on a predecessor he once criticized to serve as both role model and validator.
For many Democrats, Mr. Clinton's renewed stature and his appeal to rural and white working-class voters, a vital group that Mr. Obama has struggled to connect with, make him both an ally of the current administration and a constant reminder of its political shortcomings.
''The excitement of 'hope' and 'change' aren't what they used to be,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant who worked for Mr. Clinton. ''Bill Clinton represents the America Barack Obama needs to get back.''
At 66, he has outlived most of the men on both sides of his family. The man who was known to jog to McDonald's, and who underwent quadruple bypass surgery in 2004, no longer eats meat or dairy products, and his skinny frame looks almost frail and unnatural carrying his outsize personality.
Confronting, perhaps, the prospect of a future without Bill Clinton, he is bringing his family deeper into the William J. Clinton Foundation, the charitable organization that he started in 2001. His wife, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, has said she will return to charitable work after President Obama's first term, and his daughter has taken on a more active role in recent years. ''I told her, 'Chelsea, you've got to suck it up if you want to have a life with a public impact,' '' Mr. Clinton said.
A Breakneck Tour
The visit here to the soy plant, partly financed by his foundation, was part of Mr. Clinton's six-day tour in July to South Africa, Mozambique, Rwanda and Uganda. The roadshow gave Mr. Clinton, his daughter and a group of donors and aides who have been allied with the Clintons since their Arkansas and White House years a firsthand look at the philanthropic work that has consumed most of his post-presidential energy.
The trip had the singular feel of a Clinton campaign tour, with a breakneck schedule of speeches and meet-and-greets, Secret Service agents, a chartered Sun Country 737 and lots of Arkansas wisdom. (''We have a saying in Arkansas: If you find a turtle on a fence post, he didn't get there by accident,'' Mr. Clinton told a group of bewildered nurses in Kigali.)
During the trip, the subject of his own presidency was a frequent one, but it is not always a nostalgic one. From the Rwandan genocide and the AIDS epidemic to famine and war in Somalia, Africa stands out as a source of conflict and regret for Mr. Clinton. Although his foundation has 1,300 employees and volunteers and works in 50 countries, nowhere is Mr. Clinton's desire to right some of the wrongs of his presidency and proselytize Brand Clinton more evident than here.
The list of aides and donors who traveled with Mr. Clinton to Africa reads like the index of a Clinton family biography. The Clinton friends included Ira Magaziner, a key adviser in Mrs. Clinton's health care initiative in the 1990s who now runs the Clinton Foundation's health division, called CHAI (short for Clinton Health Access Initiative and pronounced like the spiced Indian tea); Helen Robinson, a Little Rock friend who worked for Mr. Clinton when he was governor and held posts in the East and West Wings in the Clinton White House; and Jonathan Orszag, the brother of the former Obama aide Peter Orszag and an economic adviser in the Clinton administration.
But the trip also included donors like Andrea Catsimatidis, the daughter of the supermarket mogul John Catsimatidis, and her husband, Christopher Cox, whose grandfather was Richard M. Nixon, who both support Mitt Romney in the coming election. Two other donors, Davis Sezna, the chief executive of a hospitality group, and his wife, Barbara, are also registered Republicans.
While traveling, Mr. Clinton frequently invokes his own time in office, peppering speeches with phrases like ''in the 1990s'' and ''when I was president.'' He loves defending his foreign policy record so much that aides have turned it into a verb. ''You got Black Hawked'' means that Mr. Clinton cornered you, waved a long finger and defended at length his administration's decision to intervene in Somalia.
But he does not Black Hawk anyone on Rwanda. He has said that not stopping the 1994 genocide, in which an estimated 800,000 Rwandans, mostly Tutsis, were slaughtered, was one of his main foreign policy failings.
''I don't think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down. And I regret it,'' Mr. Clinton told CNN during one of his stops in Rwanda. Today, a plaque that reads ''William J. Clinton Foundation'' hangs at the entrance of the Kigali Genocide Memorial Center. Mr. Clinton helped raise the money to build the museum around a previously unmarked area where survivors took the remains of their loved ones.
Chelsea Clinton accompanied her father on each stop in Africa, shaking hands and introducing herself (''Hi, I'm Chelsea'') along the way. The exposure is part of her deliberate evolution into a more public and less press-averse figure. In recent years, she has joined the boards of the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative and CHAI.
It is widely assumed that Mrs. Clinton will join the foundation once she relinquishes her post as secretary of state. (Mr. Clinton runs all of his potential meetings with foreign leaders by the State Department.)
''My mom is even more vehement in private than in public, if that's possible, about leaving at the end of President Obama's first term,'' Chelsea Clinton said. ''She wants to go back to being a professional advocate for women and girls.''
Straddling Two Worlds
A good deal of what Mr. Clinton does at the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative is act as a broker between wealthy supporters, like the ones on this trip, and worthy causes. While his relationships with certain billionaires have drawn criticism, a big part of Mr. Clinton's political nimbleness was his ability to shift between opulence and poverty.
In Johannesburg, he stayed at the Saxon Hotel, where he also stayed as president, when it was still the lavish private home of Douw Steyn, an eccentric South African insurance magnate. The hotel is also where Nelson Mandela went after prison to write his memoir, and several photographs of Mr. Clinton in his younger, plumper days hang on the walls.
''I always feel guilty about staying here,'' Mr. Clinton said as he looked around his private villa's marble columns and army of obedient staff members. ''But I get over it.''
A couple of days later, a black S.U.V. carrying Mr. Clinton, his daughter and Secret Service agents set off in a blinding cloud of orange dust before they made an off-the-schedule stop at a model village called Nyagatovu in rural Rwanda.
''I love this,'' Mr. Clinton said as he explored the farm plots scattered with single-room houses with brightly painted doors.
''Let's go look at the cows!'' he said and slouched down in his suit to pet a slobbery brown dairy cow. ''These people have the hardest job because the cows have to be milked every day, so they have no vacation.''
He likes to use the Zulu greeting sawubona (''I see you'') when he is traveling in parts of southern Africa, and he often received the response ngikhona (''I am here''). It is that sort of personal connection that helped him lure rural and working-class voters back to the Democratic Party in 1992, and it is that touch that many political analysts say Mr. Obama lacks, a perceived gap that Mr. Clinton said he had tried to help with.
''Suppose we've been friends for 40 years,'' Mr. Clinton said, putting a hand on a reporter's shoulder. He continued: ''If you came to visit me in the hospital and said something pretty and eloquent instead of saying 'God, I'm sorry. This sucks. I wish I could do more about it,' it's an insult.''
''So I told the president the eloquence should go at the end of his speeches now, never in the middle,'' Mr. Clinton said.
In between espousing theories about how to solve Africa's food shortage (''We need to do things Americans did literally 80 years ago during the Depression for farmers'') and offering statistics about waterborne diseases (''80 percent of victims are under the age of 5''), Mr. Clinton often brought the conversation back to politics.
As he posed with tourists during a detour to Nicosia, Cyprus, Mr. Clinton yelled out for a reporter's attention. ''These people are from the Netherlands,'' he said, putting his arm around a sunburned couple, camera phones in hand. ''It's the only country in the world with a 100 percent general health care mandate,'' similar to the one that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama sparred about in the 2008 Democratic primary.
Regaling His Guests
After several stops in Rwanda, Mr. Clinton and his entourage flew to Uganda. There he joined supporters for dinner in the verdant garden of the Kampala Serena Hotel, in Uganda's capital city, the loud hum of locusts in the background. He had changed from the navy blue suit and pink dress shirt that he wore during the day into a casual guayabera-style shirt and khaki cargo pants. Typically, he changes outfits at least three times a day on his trips.
''He's like Lady Gaga,'' one of Mr. Clinton's aides said.
At casual nightly dinners, his captive audience nodded when he ticked off obscure accomplishments (''In Arkansas, we went from 48 percent to 53 percent forested land when I left office'') or praised Rwanda's minister of health (''Obama could replace Sebelius with her tomorrow, and I'd support it'').
If the donors get their money's worth, Mr. Clinton makes sure that his charitable work does as well. On a visit to a primary school in the Mpigi District of central Uganda, a rural brickmaking area a half-hour outside Kampala, George Srour, the founder and ''chief dreamer'' of Building Tomorrow, a nonprofit group that helps bring schools to sub-Saharan Africa, told Mr. Clinton that he could use additional financing. Mr. Clinton pointed to Rumi Verjee, a wealthy Ugandan of Indian descent who lives in Britain.
''See that guy over there? He's one of the most successful business people from Uganda, and he wants to give back,'' he said to Mr. Srour. Mr. Clinton called out to Mr. Verjee: ''Hey, Rumi, come over here. This is a shakedown!''
Later that day, aides stood on the tarmac at Entebbe International Airport, giddily awaiting the arrival of Bill Clinton there. ''Is that him?'' Chelsea Clinton asked, holding a hand over her eyes as she watched a military helicopter emerge over the late-afternoon horizon.
When it landed, a slender 14-year-old Ugandan boy in his tattered school uniform shyly stepped out: Bill Clinton Kaligani. His mother named him after Mr. Clinton when he visited Uganda in 1998. A photograph of Mr. Clinton holding the boy, as his wife looked on, wearing shoulder pads and a wide hat, hangs in their home in Chappaqua, N.Y.
''He was born the day before we got there,'' Mr. Clinton said minutes before he embraced the boy on the tarmac. ''It was one of the most memorable days of my presidency.''
Mr. Clinton agreed to pay his school fees, a move that some aides thought would set a bad precedent. Mr. Clinton did note that on the same 1998 African tour, a Senegalese farmer had named a goat after him.
''We're going to fly the goat in next,'' he joked.
On almost every leg of the trip, the traveling entourage aboard the chartered 737 batted around political theories about Mrs. Clinton's chances of being elected president in 2016. ''If Romney wins, the party has to rally around her,'' said one donor who did not want to be named.
Mr. Clinton grins when he thinks about his wife's high approval rating. ''I think the country sees her the way those of us who know her see her,'' he said. But on the subject of another presidential bid, Mr. Clinton is more reserved.
''She points out that we're not kids anymore, and a lot of people want to be president,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''But I think we need to let her rest, and I'd be for whatever she wants to do.''
But he clearly would like some role for his wife and his daughter in guaranteeing the future of the foundation.
''We're trying to build it up to make sure it'd still run if I drop dead tomorrow,'' he said.

HEADLINE: First Lady to Extol First-Term Record in Convention Kickoff

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Democrats gathered here on Tuesday to begin a brisk three-day convention intended to draw sharp programmatic differences with the Republican Party and walk a line between promoting President Obama's first-term accomplishments while recognizing the continuing economic despair that has marked the last four years.
The convention, which was gaveled to order at 5 p.m., will feature a speech by Michelle Obama, in what Mr. Obama's aides said would be the beginning of an attempt to prompt voters to re-examine the president's record, particularly his health care law and his work on the economy. 
In contrast with the other speakers on Tuesday night -- and most of the speakers this week -- Ms. Obama in her remarks will not offer criticisms of Mr. Romney, instead offering what aides described as an account of her husband's motivations in pushing through the health care bill and the auto industry bailout. Other speakers, however, will focus on what has emerged as one of the convention's top goals: drawing sharp contrasts with Mr. Romney.
''We want to crystallize the choice between two very different visions of the economy,'' said Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Obama's deputy campaign manager.
Before the gavel was banged, the roads and sidewalks of this medium-size Southern city were choked with traffic as delegates, guests, journalists and various hangers-on sought to find their way to the site. Mr. Obama does not arrive here until Wednesday, but security appeared tighter than it was in Tampa, Fla., where Republicans gathered last week.
Democrats awoke -- many after a long night of festivities -- to find that downtown Charlotte (known as Uptown) had completed its transformation into a maze of high-wire fences and security barriers. There were clusters of police officers on every corner, with squads of them patrolling the streets and sidewalks on bicycle.
As Democrats prepared to convene, Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, kept out of sight on an estate in Vermont, where he was engaged in debate preparation. By contrast, Mr. Obama campaigned during parts of the Republican convention last week. Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, campaigned Tuesday in Ohio and Iowa.
Mr. Obama made his final campaign event before the convention in Norfolk, Va., on Tuesday, signaling just how critical that state is to his re-election hopes.
Democrats were also preparing to adopt the party platform, including a plank endorsing same-sex marriage -- a first for either party.
Beside Mrs. Obama, the choice of speakers chosen for the convention's first night signaled some of the organizers' demographic priorities. The keynote address -- the same speech that vaulted a young Senator Obama from Illinois to national fame in 2004 -- will be delivered by Julian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio who is Latino, a crucial target for the Obama campaign.
Other speakers include Lilly Ledbetter, who has become a symbol in the women's pay equity movement; Tammy Duckworth, who lost her legs in the Iraq war and is running for Congress in Illinois; and Nancy Keenan, an abortion rights leader.
The Obama campaign has been meticulous in reviewing the speeches at the convention with, so far at least, one notable exception: the address on Wednesday night by former President Bill Clinton. In fact, an official said the campaign had not even had a chance to see Mr. Clinton's speech.
''All I can say is that he's going to KILL!!'' David Axelrod, a senior Obama adviser, said in an e-mail.
Despite bursts of intermittent showers Tuesday, Mr. Obama's aides said that barring safety concerns, they were proceeding with plans to have Mr. Obama deliver his acceptance speech outdoors Thursday at the Bank of America Stadium.
''Look, we plan to be there, rain or shine, unless there's a safety issue,'' Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, said at a breakfast arranged by Bloomberg News. ''So we'll continue to monitor the weather, but we hope to be there, rain or shine. It's going to be a special moment, and we're really excited about it.''
Whether the Obama campaign can fill all those seats -- no matter the weather -- was another question.
''Seventy-five thousand seat stadium Thursday night,'' Diane Sawyer, the ABC anchor, said to Mr. Messina at a news forum Tuesday morning, a note of incredulity in her voice. Mr. Messina did not directly address the implication.
''Look, we are incredibly excited about the opportunity,'' he said. ''We think we're going to have a great convention and we think there are going to be a bunch of people at that convention.''
Mr. Obama appeared Tuesday at Norfolk State University in Virginia, where he offered what he described as a ''basic recap'' of the Republican convention last week, as well as a preview of some of the themes expected to be pressed here in Charlotte.
''Basically, they said, first of all, everything is bad and it's Obama's fault, and Governor Romney knows the secret to creating jobs and growing the economy,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The only problem was, he kept it secret.''
''There was a lot of talk about 'hard truths' and 'bold choices,' but they never bothered to tell you what they were,'' he added. ''And when my opponent had the chance to offer his secret sauce, he did not offer a single new idea. It was just retreads of the same old policies that have been sticking it to the middle class for years.''

HEADLINE: First Lady Tops Opening Night For Democrats

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Democrats opened their convention here on Tuesday night with a parade of officials telling voters that Mitt Romney does not get it and with a rousing speech from Michelle Obama making the case that President Obama does.
Mr. Obama's roster of Democratic promoters spent the first hours detailing a political indictment of Mr. Romney, blistering him as being out of touch with the middle class and intent on taking the country back to the policies that caused the economy's problems.
But the main attraction of the evening was the appearance of Mr. Obama's lead character witness: the first lady, who, wearing a pink-and-gold-speckled sleeveless dress, was greeted with chants of ''Four more years!'' from the excited arena, to which she responded: ''With your help.'' 
''Barack knows what it means when a family struggles,'' she said in remarks that electrified the party faithful in the Time Warner Cable Arena and were broadcast nationally by the television networks. ''He knows what it means to want something more for your kids and grandkids. Barack knows the American dream because he's lived it, and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love.''
Four years of partisan sniping, Washington gridlock and continued economic challenges may have dulled the luster of the man this party nominated four years ago. But Mrs. Obama sought to remind his 2008 voters that the same person they supported then is underneath the tarnish she sought to buff away.
The address was meant to lay the foundation for a convention program devised to remind wavering working- and middle-class voters -- the same ones Mr. Romney is working so hard to woo away -- what they liked about the president when they supported him four years ago, and how his own humbler roots have helped inspire his policies to help them.
''He believes that when you've worked hard, and done well, and walked through that doorway of opportunity, you do not slam it shut behind you,'' Mrs. Obama said, her impassioned delivery drawing the crowd to its feet as it waved red, white and blue ''Michelle'' placards. ''You reach back, and you give other folks the same chances that helped you succeed.''
It was one of the few times Mrs. Obama came close to even a subtle reference to the very direct argument being made against her husband's opponent here. She argued that Mr. Obama's experience as president had taught him that ''no amount of data or numbers will get you the right answer.'' Her portrait of her husband was the inverse of the one that other Democrats have sketched of Mr. Romney, who former Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio said viewed the ''American worker'' as ''just numbers on a spreadsheet.''
As someone with whom she was ''so young, so in love, and so in debt,'' Mrs. Obama said, her husband believes ''success isn't about how much money you make. It's about the difference you make in people's lives.''
Mrs. Obama's was almost the only voice lacking an explicit anti-Romney edge, conveying a personal tone and touch after speeches that were personal in a different way when it came to the president's opponent. As the other speakers undertook a program that amounted to a thundering response to the Republican convention last week in Tampa, Fla., they went after Mr. Romney on just about every conceivable issue.
The keynote speaker, Mayor Julián Castro of San Antonio, offered the overarching argument against Mr. Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconson.
''Their theory has been tested. It failed. Our economy failed,'' Mr. Castro said in what seemed to be the second-most rousing speech of the night for the Democratic audience. ''The middle class paid the price. Your family paid the price. Mitt Romney just doesn't get it.''
After what has at times been a tentative approach to promoting the health care law, perhaps Mr. Obama's signature legislation, the program included a full-throated defense of the overhaul and the Supreme Court's decision to uphold it.
And an Arizona woman, Stacey Lihn, took the stage with her toddler, Zoe, who has a congenital heart disease, and said her daughter's health insurance would run out if Mr. Romney won and followed through with his promise to get Mr. Obama's health care law repealed. ''But we're also scared,'' she said. ''Governor Romney repealing health care reform is something we worry about literally every day.''
The Democrats even got the spirit of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts into the act in a tribute video. It showed Mr. Kennedy in his 1994 debate with Mr. Romney during their Senate race, mocking Mr. Romney for his shifting position on abortion rights and calling him ''multiple choice.''
The program never addressed the disappointment of many wavering Obama voters in the president's handling of the economy, as Republicans will note. But the speakers pounded Mr. Romney on immigration, on health care, on Medicare, on foreign policy, on the 2009 auto bailout and on his tax policies, which they said would benefit the rich at the expense of the working class and cause the kind of economic damage that they said Mr. Obama had worked to undo.
Mr. Romney's wealth was given full attention, with Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland referring to the Swiss bank account Mr. Romney no longer has by saying: ''Swiss bank accounts don't put cops on the beat or teachers in our classrooms. Swiss bank accounts never created American jobs.''
Apparently concerned about alienating voters with too much negativity, Mr. Obama's strategists were careful to ensure that speakers always included a positive element about Mr. Obama.
''Mitt Romney is walking away from us,'' Representative Nydia M. Velázquez of New York said. ''He walks with people who disrespect us and people who divide us and people who do not believe that the American dream means all of us. President Obama has walked with us for the last 12 years -- in good times and in tough times -- and right now we are going to walk with the president to the polls and onward to victory.''
Mindful of the need to address a sometimes deflated group of liberal, grass-roots supporters, speakers stressed core party social issues like abortion rights and the president's support for gay marriage.
A group of Democratic women in the House of Representatives came to the stage together -- led by Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader -- to criticize Republican moves against the so-called Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which would make it easier for women to press discrimination cases, and various elements of the president's health care overhaul, including its coverage of contraception.
When Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark gave a speech introducing the party platform and its first-ever declaration of support for same-sex marriage,'' the delegates broke into a standing ovation and cheers of ''Cory!'' and ''U.S.A.!''
''No matter who you are, no matter what color or creed, no matter how you choose to pray or who you choose to love,'' Mr. Booker shouted, ''if you are a citizen of the United States of America, you should be able to find a job that pays, you should be able to afford health care for your family, you should be able to retire with dignity and respect, and you should be able to give your children the kind of education that allows them to dream even bigger, to go ever farther and accomplish more than you could ever imagine.''

HEADLINE: The Comeback Vegan

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C.
I remember the first time I realized that Barack Obama was not going to be another Bill Clinton. Everyone assumed that the Secretariat from Illinois was the natural heir to the Secretariat from Arkansas. But Barry was only out of the gate for a day in 2007 before it became apparent that, while the senator had a bouquet of talents and several virtues that Clinton would never possess, he was not quite Bill's match as a political natural.
On his first Iowa campaign trip, Barry was irritated. (Michelle had made him quit smoking). He was hungry. (He had eaten only trail mix.) He was indignant. (Why would press pests care what he looked like shirtless in Hawaii?) 
When the diffident debutante ended up in the deserted AmericInn's lobby in Iowa Falls on an icy Saturday night with reporters and a few six-packs, he did not seize the opportunity to seduce, as Bill would have. Clinton probably would have chatted with one reporter about Gabriel García Márquez, another about economic philosophy and a third about prowling the Arkansas backwoods to find antique cameos for Hillary.
Barry, for his part, looked around with dazed distaste and scurried up to his room. He seemed oddly conflicted about politics. That ambivalence started with the first political speech he gave at Occidental College, when he felt both elation at his ability to rouse with words and disdain at how easy it was. It became an exhausting pattern: Get people wildly excited and then withhold the excitement. Avoid sound bites and visceral connections because political games are beneath you. Instead of surfing the magic and using it to cow the opposition, Obama would retreat inside himself at crucial moments, climbing back to his contemplative mountaintop.
He rationed his smile, his eloquence and his electricity, playing the dispassionate observer, delegating, dithering and rushing in at the last moment to try to save the day. A cold shower to Bill's warm bath. While Clinton aides had to act like sheepdogs, herding the boss offstage as he tried to linger and schmooze issues with crowds, Obama needs to be alone and decompress even after meeting with a few people.
Last week, Republicans struggled to answer the Dada question about Mitt Romney: ''Can he be human?'' This week, Democrats struggle to answer the Dada question about the once-thrilling Obama: ''Can he be exciting?'' (Nobody ever asked either question about Bill.)
After running last time as the stake in the heart of the dysfunctional, draining and seemingly indestructible Clinton dynasty, Barry has had to humble himself and ask for the help of the man his camp painted as racist and intemperate in 2008. During that race, Bill literally carried an 81-page list of perceived insults by Obama to Hillary. It is the great psychodrama of this convention: Will the shrewd and diabolical Bill buoy Barry or puncture him? Will he be generous or -- like all those 2016 strivers at the Republican convention -- self-obsessed?
''We don't need Clinton the man,'' said one Obama honcho as they nervously await the draft of Bill's speech. ''We need Clinton the myth.''
The two tall, left-handed, silver-tongued baby boomers both grew up not knowing their fathers. But while the disciplined Barry became self-reliant, with little patience for neediness or insincerity, the undisciplined Bill became self-indulgent, a maw of need and maestro of faux sincerity.
Obama doesn't like to share the stage with other politicians or even campaign for House Democrats. He thinks of himself as a singular force, a unique brand, and his narrative has always begun and ended with him. He thinks he did build it himself. But now -- because of his own naïveté, insularity and arrogance -- he needs Clinton to rev up the disillusioned faithful and donors and lure independents and white working-class men.
Bill, hailed by some as the first black president, must expand Barry's narrative to reach back and link Obama's roiling tenure of wars, debt and partisan-fencing to Clinton's restful stretch of prosperity. You know you're in trouble when you're seen as less capable of taming the House Republicans than an ex-president who was impeached by the House Republicans.
And what does the Big Dog get? Resurrection, redemption, relevance, a reflected patina of Obama integrity and fidelity; the chance to outshine the upstart who outmaneuvered his wife and, by extension, him in 2008. And a possible ticket back to the Oval, this time as the first First Man, a vegan gnawing on Michelle's vegetable garden.
It's not a bromance, like Romney and Paul Ryan. It's a transaction. Obama needs his Democratic predecessor to reassure jittery voters that the future can look like the past, with a lower deficit, plenty of jobs and the two parties actually talking. In return, Bill will have the capital to try to ensure that the past can look like the future, with Hillary as Obama's successor.
What a wild twist. Instead of ushering in the post-Clinton era, as intended, Obama has ushered in the pre-Clinton era.

HEADLINE: It's Mitt's World

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Mitt Romney has been criticized for not discussing foreign policy. Give him a break. He probably figures he's already said all that he needs to say during the primaries: He has a big stick, and he is going to use it on Day 1. Or as he put it: ''If I'm president of the United States ... on Day 1, I will declare China a currency manipulator, allowing me to put tariffs on products where they are stealing American jobs unfairly.''
That is really cool. Smack China on Day 1. I just wonder what happens on Day 2 when China, the biggest foreign buyer of U.S. debt securities, announces that it will not participate in the next Treasury auction, sending our interest rates soaring. That will make Day 3 really, really cool. Welcome to the Romney foreign policy, which I'd call: ''George W. Bush abroad -- the cartoon version.'' 
I know Romney doesn't believe a word he's saying on foreign policy and that its all aimed at ginning up votes: there's some China-bashing to help in the Midwest, some Arab-bashing to win over the Jews, some Russia-bashing (our ''No. 1 geopolitical foe'') to bring in the Polish vote, plus a dash of testosterone to keep the neocons off his back.
What's odd is that Romney was in a position to sound smart on foreign policy, not like a knee-jerk hawk. He just needed to explain what every global business leader learned long before governments did -- that, since the end of the cold war, the world has become not just more interconnected but more interdependent, and this new structural reality requires a new kind of American leadership. Why?
In this increasingly interdependent world, your ''allies'' can hurt you as much as your ''enemies.'' After all, the biggest threats to President Obama's re-election are whether little Greece pulls out of the euro zone and triggers a global economic meltdown or whether Israel attacks Iran and does the same.
In this increasingly interdependent world, your rivals can threaten you as much by collapsing as by rising. Think of what would happen to U.S. markets and jobs if China's growth slowed to a crawl and there was internal instability there?
In this increasingly interdependent world, we have few pure ''enemies'' anymore: Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Al Qaeda, the Taliban. But we have many ''frenemies,'' or half friends/half foes. While the Pentagon worries about a war with China, the Commerce Department is trying to get China to buy more Boeing planes and every American university worth its salt is opening a campus in Beijing; meanwhile, the Chinese are investing in American companies left and right. President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela is the biggest thorn in America's side in Latin America and a vital source of our imported oil. The U.S. and Russia are on opposing sides in Syria, but the U.S. supported Russia joining the World Trade Organization and American businesses are lobbying Congress to lift cold war trade restrictions on Russia so they can take advantage of its more open market.
Think of Egypt. I was critical of Egypt's new president, Mohamed Morsi, from the Muslim Brotherhood, for attending the Nonaligned Movement summit meeting in Iran. I argued that he was giving legitimacy to an Iranian regime that had crushed the very kind of democratic movement that brought Morsi to power. But Morsi surprised me, for the better, by using his visit to Tehran to call out the Iranian leadership for supporting Syria's ''oppressive'' regime. The Iranians were livid. You can be sure that, on other days, Morsi will say and do things that will give us indigestion. We still need Egypt's strategic support in the region. It still needs our economic aid. But a more democratic, Muslim Brotherhood-led Egypt will not behave like the automatic ally it was before. We'll need a new kind of relationship. It will be complicated.
But that's today's world, and the leadership challenge it poses is easy to describe but hard to pull off. If the world is more interdependent, how do we create healthy interdependencies so we rise together, rather than unhealthy interdependencies so we fall together? The 2008 global economic crisis was an example of an unhealthy interdependency. So is the failure to reach any kind of global climate agreement. When we bring Russia into the World Trade Organization, we're creating a healthy interdependency. When Russia protects Syria's dictator, even when he's crushing his own people, it's creating an unhealthy interdependency.
The best way for an American president to forge healthy interdependencies is, first, to get our own house in order and gain the leverage -- in terms of resources and moral authority -- that come from leading by example. For instance, Romney is right: there are unhealthy aspects to the U.S.-China interdependency that need working on, but they are not all China's fault. We would have more leverage to build a more healthy relationship if we saved more, consumed less, studied harder and got our own banks to behave less recklessly.
Republicans love to criticize Obama for ''leading from behind.'' But if you're not leading by example in an interdependent world, you can lead from the front or behind -- no one will follow you for long.

HEADLINE: Party Platforms Are Poles Apart In Their View of the Nation

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
Voters are forever being told that they face stark choices. But the platform that Democrats approved Tuesday at their convention in Charlotte, N.C., was, in areas from social issues to entitlements, a mirror image of the platform that the Republicans adopted last week in Tampa, Fla.
Yet it was the omission of something that had been included in Democratic Party platforms since at least 1992 -- a statement that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel -- that drew immediate criticism from Republicans.
The Democratic platform supports same-sex marriage for the first time -- ''We support marriage equality and support the movement to secure equal treatment under law for same-sex couples,'' it reads -- and reaffirms the party's support for abortion rights. The Republican platform supports the passage of constitutional amendments that would ban abortion and define marriage as ''the union of one man and one woman.''
When it comes to Medicare, the Democratic platform says the party will oppose ''any efforts to privatize or voucherize'' the program, while the Republican platform would reshape the program for those under 55 so they would get ''an income-adjusted contribution toward a health plan of the enrollee's choice,'' including a government plan. 
And while the Democratic platform opposes any privatization of Social Security, the Republican platform says younger workers should be given the option of ''personal investment accounts as supplements to the system.''
But it was the absence of the plank on Jerusalem that drew criticism from Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee.
The new Democratic platform states that ''President Obama and the Democratic Party maintain an unshakable commitment to Israel's security,'' but drops language from previous platforms about Jerusalem. The 2008 platform said: ''Jerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel. The parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations. It should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.''
Obama administration officials, in keeping with decades of official American policy, have been unwilling call Jerusalem the capital of Israel because Palestinians also envision it as the future capital of their hoped-for state.
Mr. Romney issued a statement Tuesday criticizing the platform's omission as ''shameful.''
If there is one thing the two parties agree on this year, it is the size of the chasm that divides them on so many issues. The Democratic platform says that ''this election is not simply a choice between two candidates or two political parties, but between two fundamentally different paths for our country and our families.'' The Republican platform calls the 2012 elections ''a referendum on the future of liberty in America.''
Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark, a platform committee chairman, emphasized its call for a ''balanced approach'' to deficit reduction, including raising taxes on the wealthy. ''When your country is in a costly war, with our soldiers sacrificing abroad, and our nation is facing a debt crisis at home, being asked to pay your fair share isn't class warfare,'' he said. ''It's patriotism.''
The Democratic platform sometimes reads more like a look back than a road map of what the party would do over the next four years. Many paragraphs are devoted to putting President Obama's record in the most flattering light possible. The platform mentions that 4.5 million private-sector jobs have been created in the United States since ''early 2010'' -- a time period that ignores the steep job losses of 2009. If the platform had started counting in January 2009, the month Mr. Obama took office, it would have found that 332,000 private-sector jobs had been created.
Some of this year's planks are reminders of the unfulfilled pledges from 2008.
That platform, echoing a promise Mr. Obama had made as a candidate, said, ''We will close the detention camp in Guantánamo Bay, the location of so many of the worst constitutional abuses in recent years.'' As president, though, Mr. Obama has failed to deliver on that promise, so the 2012 platform says ''we are substantially reducing the population at Guantánamo Bay.''
The 2008 platform called for ''comprehensive immigration reform,'' but since it has not passed, the 2012 platform does, too. And the 2008 platform said ''we will implement a market-based cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions by the amount scientists say is necessary to avoid catastrophic change.'' Since that has not happened, the 2012 platform calls for reducing carbon emissions domestically ''through regulation and market solutions.''
But any tension between the party's last platform and its current platform pales in comparison with the differences between the Democratic and Republican party platforms this year.
While the Democrats failed to enact the promised climate change legislation, they still call it a top priority. ''We know that global climate change is one of the biggest threats of this generation -- an economic, environmental and national security catastrophe in the making,'' their platform says, adding that they ''affirm the science of climate change.''
This year's Republican platform dropped the 2008 section on ''addressing climate change responsibly.'' The new platform states that it opposes ''any and all cap-and-trade legislation.''
The Democratic platform says ''the right to organize and collectively bargain is a fundamental American value'' and opposes ''the attacks on collective bargaining that Republican governors and state legislatures are mounting in states around the country.'' The Republicans support right-to-work laws, which weaken unions, and salute ''the Republican governors and state legislators who have saved their states from fiscal disaster by reforming their laws governing public employee unions.''
On taxes, the Democratic platform says that President Obama will fight to extend tax cuts for the middle class while ''asking the wealthiest and corporations to pay their fair share.'' The Republican platform calls for extending the Bush-era tax cuts.
And on guns, the Democratic platform states that ''the individual right to bear arms is an important part of the American tradition, and we will preserve Americans' Second Amendment right to own and use firearms.'' But it says the right can be subject to ''reasonable regulation,'' and calls for reinstating the assault weapons ban. The Republican platform says, ''We oppose legislation that is intended to restrict our Second Amendment rights by limiting the capacity of clips or magazines or otherwise restoring the ill-considered Clinton gun ban.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Shift Moves Center Far to Right

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
To hear Republicans on the campaign trail, the United States could not have elected a more left-wing president than Barack Obama, one more hostile to business or more eager to expand government power. Left-wing Democrats, I'm sure, would disagree. If they had their druthers, they would probably make a more liberal, more pro-big government choice. Somebody, perhaps, like Richard Nixon.
That's right. The Nixon administration not only supported the Clean Air Act and affirmative action, it also gave us the Environmental Protection Agency, one of the agencies the business community most detests, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to police working conditions. Herbert Stein, chief economic adviser during the administrations of Nixon and Gerald Ford, once remarked: ''Probably more new regulation was imposed on the economy during the Nixon administration than in any other presidency since the New Deal.''
Nixon bolstered Social Security benefits. He introduced a minimum tax on the wealthy and championed a guaranteed minimum income for the poor. He even proposed health reform that would require employers to buy health insurance for all their employees and subsidize those who couldn't afford it. That failed because of Democratic opposition. Today, Republicans would probably shoot it down. 
Historians might protest that it is crazy to brand Nixon a lefty. He was rabidly anti-communist. If anything, they might argue, his seemingly left-leaning policies underscore how uninterested he was in the economy and how far he would go to buy popularity with public money.
Still, Nixon's initiatives would never pass muster in the Republican Party of today, focused as it is on cutting taxes and public spending. His decisions not to try to undo big government programs passed by Lyndon Johnson's Democratic administration underscores how much the political center has moved.
The difference between then and now is that Nixon -- like most mainstream Republicans -- accepted that government had a role to play guaranteeing Americans' economic well-being. That consensus cracked around the time of Ronald Reagan's inaugural speech in 1981. ''Government is not the solution to our problems, government is the problem,'' the president intoned. And the country's political center set off on a long rightward migration.
Interestingly, Americans say their political ideology has changed little since the late 1970s. The share of voters who defined themselves as liberal was 20 percent in 2010, up slightly from 19 percent in 1980, according to polls by The New York Times and CBS News. The conservative share over the same time rose to 35 percent, from 30 percent.
But these polls ignore how much the meanings of the terms have changed. The rightward drift in economic thinking becomes apparent in surveys asking about specific issues. In surveys 25 years ago, 71 percent of Americans believed it was the government's job to take care of those who couldn't care for themselves, according the Pew Research Center. This year the share is down to 59 percent. And most of the shift reflects a decline among Republicans.
Republicans' support for labor unions has fallen sharply since the late 1980s, according to Pew's research, as has their support for protecting the environment. Their drift fits the position of Congressional Republicans, whose views on the economy have been shifting right for the last quarter-century while Democrats' views have remained roughly still. And as Republicans have moved to the right, economic policy has followed.
Consider what has happened to federal nonmilitary discretionary spending, which pays for housing vouchers and veterans' health, highway maintenance and the Food and Drug Administration -- essentially all the domestic social programs that are not mandatory like Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.
When Nixon resigned from office in 1974, nonmilitary discretionary spending amounted to about 4 percent of the nation's economy -- roughly the same as at the end of the Johnson administration before him. Discretionary spending expanded through the administrations of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, reaching a high in 1980 of 5.2 percent of the nation's gross output. Then the tide turned: by 2008, before the Great Recession shrank the economy and the fiscal stimulus lifted spending, nonmilitary discretionary spending had fallen to 3.6 percent of national output.
Conservatives will say their ideas won simply because they are better. Social scientists have some alternative hypotheses of our great conservative shift.
The big government strategy from the 1940s through the 1970s produced a spectacular improvement in living standards. But many economists now say they believe the focus on full employment and income redistribution at the expense of everything else also contributed to the strategy's demise, removing the fear of joblessness and encouraging excessive wage increases.
Combined with cheap money printed by the Federal Reserve, it produced a burst of high inflation and high unemployment that bedeviled the 1970s -- discrediting government as an economic steward and letting a new belief take hold: the economy should be left to the market, which always knows best. The end of the cold war, which discredited central planning and other left-wing economic theories, probably helped solidify this stance.
Economic philosophies could shift again, of course. Just as the big government policies of the New Deal emerged from the Great Depression and World War II, the financial crisis and recession just past might again persuade Americans of the perils of unfettered capitalism and cause the pendulum to swing back.
Still, the scorched-earth debate over Obamacare underscores how difficult it will be for the American political system to swallow a more activist government than it has today.
Those nostalgic for Johnson's Great Society programs might remember that they occurred in a kinder, gentler economy in which American companies faced much less competition than they do today. Eastman Kodak could run a mini-welfare state through much of the 20th century --with profit-sharing, health benefits and pension plans -- because it had fat monopoly-type profits. Detroit's Big Three amounted to a cozy oligopoly.
Globalization and its attendant burst of competition put an end to the fairy tale. Companies squeezed costs to stay in the game, zeroing in on wages and working conditions. Unions, once politically powerful institutions fighting for workers' share, became weaker and weaker.
Half a century ago, American employers might have accepted a higher minimum wage on the ground that they needed American consumers to be able to afford their products. They might have supported public education on the ground that they needed an educated American work force. They might have accepted financial oversight because they raised money from small investors in American markets.
But globalization freed businesses from the limitations of one nation and the clutches of the nation state. As businesses' footprints extended around the world, these objectives became less important than assuring low taxes. Free to jump borders, businesses became much more difficult to tax or regulate. And in the current dismal economy, they don't seem too eager for a return of the big government days.
The United States is in ideological flux. The Great Recession has given us both the Tea Party and the Occupy Wall Street movement, and produced perhaps the most polarized government of the modern era. Liberal-leaning Democrats, often disappointed at the president's compromises, will pine for a more aggressive champion of workers' rights. But they may want to count their blessings. Americans today might not elect somebody as liberal as Richard Nixon.

HEADLINE: A Pride of Literary Lions, Unleashed All at Once

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
The list reads like a Who's Who at an exclusive book party: Junot Diaz, Ian McEwan, J. K. Rowling, Zadie Smith and Tom Wolfe.
All are superstar authors who are releasing hugely anticipated books this fall, colliding in one of the most crowded literary traffic jams in recent memory.
Fall is traditionally the biggest season in the book business, the time that publishers reserve for their most high-profile authors. But this year it is especially crammed with writers who are both household names and have not released a book in several years, like the octogenarian Mr. Wolfe, whose last novel, ''I Am Charlotte Simmons,'' was published in 2004, and Mr. Diaz, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ''The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,'' which came out in 2007.
Salman Rushdie, the author of ''Midnight's Children,'' will release a memoir, ''Joseph Anton,'' that goes on sale on Sept. 18. Ms. Rowling, best known for her phenomenally best-selling Harry Potter series, has written her first novel for adults, ''The Casual Vacancy.'' 
In November Nan A. Talese/Doubleday will release Ian McEwan's ''Sweet Tooth,'' a novel featuring his first female protagonist since Briony Tallis in ''Atonement.'' Michael Chabon's new novel, ''Telegraph Avenue,'' is scheduled for release on Sept. 11, five years after his most recent book, ''The Yiddish Policemen's Union.''
The pileup has left publishers jostling for shelf space and publication dates, and critics wondering how they can review all of the elite writers worthy of attention -- not to mention the debut and midlist authors who might be neglected.
''You can only read so much,'' said Ron Charles, the fiction editor for The Washington Post. ''There are some real giants this year. It's difficult for places like us that just run one review a day.''
Booksellers, who are preparing to stock their shelves with titles that will stay there until Christmas, have been thrilled by the lineup, saying it could be one of the richest fall seasons in five years or more.
''I just can't imagine what October is going to look like on our shelves,'' said Gayle Shanks, an owner of Changing Hands bookstore in Tempe, Ariz. ''I think we're going to have to add a few cases for fiction.''
Daniel Goldin, the owner of Boswell Book Company in Milwaukee, Wis., said he was ''thrilled'' by the unusually deep selection of big fiction titles.
''It always seems like we are scrounging for literary books to sell in the fall, and wind up going back to winter and spring for inspiration,'' he wrote in an e-mail, adding that this year he was looking forward to selling books by T. C. Boyle, Sherman Alexie, Louise Erdrich and Ken Follett.
Last month New York magazine published an interactive graphic carrying the headline, ''Which Event Novel Should You Read This Fall?,'' guiding readers through all of the choices. In a fall books forecast, Flavorpill, the online cultural guide, said that the season promised ''to be a doozy, with September in particular filled with some serious literary heavy hitters, and enough great reads piled up through the autumn months to get you fat and happy just in time for winter.''
Geoffrey Kloske, the publisher of Riverhead Books, an imprint of Penguin Group USA, said that publishers had to consider the competition for spots on best-seller lists, placement in bookstores and media coverage.
''If a publisher thinks a writer is coming out too quickly on the heels of some previous work or, more likely, the work is a little shaky, then she'll probably spend a lot of time glancing over her shoulder,'' he said.
Some readers appear to be stocking up early. On Amazon, a listing for Mr. Rushdie's memoir noted that some customers who had bought the book also preordered books by Barbara Kingsolver, Mark Helprin, Mr. McEwan, Ms. Smith and Mr. Chabon.
The nonfiction side has its share of major titles too, including the surprise book by a former member of the Navy SEALs describing the Osama bin Laden raid, which was released on Tuesday; a Bob Woodward book on the Obama administration and the economy; a memoir by the musician Pete Townshend; and ''The Oath,'' Jeffrey Toobin's study of the Obama administration and the Supreme Court.
This season may be especially compressed because of the presidential election on Nov. 6, an event that several publishers privately said that they were trying to avoid, lest it take away from news media attention they might receive for their books.
Michele Filgate, the events coordinator at Community Bookstore in Park Slope, Brooklyn, said that when media coverage was devoted to an election, ''a lot of books can get lost in the shuffle.''
''When it's an election year, publishers tend to save their big books for the spring instead of the fall,'' she said. ''This year they're still bringing out some of the A-list authors.''
Mr. Wolfe's new book, ''Back to Blood,'' set in Miami, will come out on Oct. 23, just two weeks before the election. Books by Dennis Lehane and J. R. Moehringer are also scheduled for a fall release.
For shows like NPR's ''Fresh Air'' with Terry Gross, one of the most plum spots for authors to promote their books, interviewers and reviewers are dividing their time among genres, said Maureen Corrigan, the show's longtime book critic.
''This week alone I'm reading a political autobiography, a debut novel and the Zadie Smith, and I'm trying to make a decision by tomorrow which one I'm going to go with,'' she said. ''It does seem like an embarrassment of riches.''
Some bookstores have struggled to find enough evenings for author events. Rebecca Fitting, an owner of Greenlight Bookstore in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, said it had been at least four to five years since a fall season was crammed with so much high-profile fiction. To squeeze all of the available authors into their schedule, the store planned events on nights -- like Friday -- that were previously off-limits, said another owner, Jessica Stockton Bagnulo.
''Finding the space on the schedule has been an adventure,'' she said. ''We don't usually host Friday night events, but for Zadie Smith, we will make an exception. It's certainly a good problem to have.''
Mr. Charles of The Post added that the glut of big releases had been complicated by the extreme length of many of the books.
While he loved ''The Passage,'' a vampire novel by Justin Cronin that came out in 2010, he said he might not have time to review the second book in the trilogy, ''The Twelve,'' which is being published in October and clocks in at 592 pages.
''In a crowded schedule like this, I just don't know if I can get to it,'' Mr. Charles said. ''When we say big authors, we mean it in every sense of the word this time.''
For authors, bumping into another writer's publication date can go unnoticed. Mr. Diaz, the author of the coming ''This Is How You Lose Her,'' said he and Michael Chabon met for the first time at BookExpo America in June, but the fact that their books were both coming out the same day -- next Tuesday -- didn't come up in conversation.
''Maybe if I wrote faster, I might actually notice market forces more,'' Mr. Diaz said in an e-mail. ''But I write so slow and publish things so rarely, I seem to exist on another planet.''

HEADLINE: Charlie Rose, 73, Tobacco's Friend in House

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
Charlie Rose, a former United States representative from rural North Carolina who fought to protect the tobacco industry and its farmers when political and regulatory pressure on the industry were on the rise and smoking in steady decline, died on Monday in Albertville, Ala. He was 73.
The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, said his wife, Stacye Hefner. 
Mr. Rose, a Democrat some called Mr. Tobacco, was first elected to the House in 1972. His southeastern North Carolina district was covered with tobacco farms, but the crop's economic and geographic footprint shrank over the next two decades of his tenure.
Mr. Rose (no relation to the television interviewer of the same name) worked to ease the transition and successfully fought to preserve government price supports for tobacco even as the government was warning of its potentially lethal health effects.
''There's no way you could represent that district and not be in support of tobacco farmers,'' said Merle Black, a professor of politics at Emory University.
In the 1990s, the Clinton administration considered a significant increase in the federal tobacco tax to help pay for the ambitious health care overhaul proposed by the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mr. Rose, the chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Peanuts and Tobacco, led the opposition.
''In the past, the Reagan and Bush administrations were pretty reasonable about taxing tobacco,'' Mr. Rose said in an interview in 1995. ''But I think all of us who represent tobacco states knew that the growing concern about smoking and health was going to someday lead to this type of attitude and reaction in the White House. This talk of $2 a pack is scaring us to death, and that's putting it mildly.''
The health care plan did not pass, and the federal tobacco tax has yet to reach $2 per pack -- it is now $1.01 -- but Mr. Rose was correct that change was coming. He retired from Congress in 1996, two years after Republicans took control.
Charles Grandison Rose III was born Aug. 10, 1939, in Fayetteville, N.C. He graduated from Davidson College and received his law degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He worked as a chief district court prosecutor before he was elected to the House.
Ms. Hefner, whom he married in 1995, is the daughter of former Representative Bill Hefner of North Carolina. The couple moved to Albertville several years ago to be close to Ms. Hefner's family.
Besides Ms. Hefner, Mr. Rose is survived by a sister, Irene Owen; a brother, Fred Rose; four children, Charles, Louise, Kelly and Parker; and a stepson, Joseph Hawk. Two previous marriages ended in divorce.
Mr. Rose was more liberal than many other Southern Democrats of his era, on issues including civil rights, and he was well regarded by other members of Congress for helping modernize the House by installing computers in offices and television cameras in the House chamber.
But he also faced ethics charges. In 1988, the House ethics committee issued him a ''letter of reproof'' for failing to disclose that he had converted campaign money for his personal use. In 1994, Mr. Rose agreed to pay $12,500 to settle a civil action brought by the Justice Department related to the same issue.
Mr. Rose and Ms. Hefner started a lobbying firm after he left office and represented a range of clients, including oncologists and R. J. Reynolds, the tobacco company, with which the firm still has a contract.

HEADLINE: Ryan Carries Load While Romney Readies for Debates

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa -- With Mitt Romney keeping a low profile, Representative Paul D. Ryan was the face of the Republican ticket once again on Tuesday, blitzing morning television shows and skipping between battleground states, fully embracing the role of tormentor in chief of President Obama.
''We just heard about an hour ago that our government eclipsed the $16 trillion mark in our national debt,'' he said at an afternoon rally here. ''Of all the broken promises of President Obama, this is probably the worst one.'' 
It was the second day in a row that Mr. Ryan was carrying the load for the Republican ticket, a role he has comfortably adopted even as it makes him the chief target of Democratic counterattacks. One of those on Tuesday charged that he had no business giving a ''lecture'' on debt because he ''was a rubber stamp in Congress for policies that turned surpluses into deficits.''
The role also comes with heightened scrutiny of his every utterance, as shown Monday when he cited a statistic for business bankruptcies but conflated the number with far more common personal bankruptcies. He corrected himself by Tuesday in his speeches.
Mr. Romney was hunkered down on Tuesday for a first full rehearsal of the coming presidential debates, which start on Oct. 3, according to pool reports. He traveled with advisers to the home in West Windsor, Vt., of a former Massachusetts lieutenant governor, Kerry Healey, where Senator Rob Portman of Ohio played the role of Mr. Obama.
So Mr. Ryan led the multiday, coordinated efforts to lash President Obama to the legacy of the last one-term Democratic president, Jimmy Carter.
Even as the Democratic National Convention prepared to show a tribute video to Mr. Carter on Tuesday night, Mr. Ryan told supporters in Westlake, Ohio: ''I remember a convention speech -- I was a pretty young guy at the time. Remember Ronald Reagan talking about Jimmy Carter, asking, 'Are you better off now than you were four years ago?' ''
The congressman spoke at a lectern adorned with a new sign asking, ''Are You Better Off?'' By the time he arrived in Iowa, the same message was repeated on two giant signs.
''If we fired Jimmy Carter then, why would we rehire Barack Obama now?'' he asked.
A spokesman for the Obama campaign said the Romney-Ryan economic plan would return to policies that led to the financial crisis.
''While Romney and Ryan may want to revise the past, they can't make up their own facts,'' the spokesman, Danny Kanner, said.
Mr. Ryan's visit to Ohio was the latest of many to a state of crucial importance to the Republican ticket; he has gone to lengths to emphasize his connections as a graduate of an Ohio college, and he added a new wrinkle on Tuesday, saying that Ohio and his native Wisconsin are economically ''in the same boat.''
''You know, we fish out of similar boats in the Great Lakes for great walleye,'' Mr. Ryan riffed. ''You've got bigger walleye here in Lake Erie than we do up in Lake Michigan, I'll tell you that. I wouldn't say yours is better tasting, but walleye is the best freshwater fish to eat bar none.''
The crowd of about 2,000 was highly enthusiastic, giving Mr. Ryan sustained applause as he entered and shouting out throughout his speech.
A pro-Obama voter also shouted out, after Mr. Ryan pinned responsibility on the president for last year's downgrade of the nation's credit rating.
''Read the S&P report!'' the man yelled, referring to the rating agency that issued the downgrade. ''They blamed Republicans!''
In three television interviews with network morning shows, Mr. Ryan was peppered on this issue and others from his convention speech that have drawn scrutiny. He responded with a repertoire of studies and counterpoints to bolster his case.
Asked about Democratic accusations that the Republican ticket's plan to cut taxes by 20 percent and make up lost revenues by ending deductions would mean a $2,000 tax increase for the middle class, Mr. Ryan rejected that conclusion, which was reached by a nonpartisan tax research group.
He said lower tax rates would spur the economy. ''Economic growth is the key to this, and one of the keys to economic growth is tax reform,'' Mr. Ryan said on ABC's ''Good Morning America.''

HEADLINE: Words Not Spoken

 BODY:
Not many people know it, but the Democratic Party supports a ban on assault weapons. It's a position that, if enacted, could save many lives by reducing the lethality of mass shootings, but you have to flip more than halfway through the party's new 26,500-word platform to find it.
President Obama purportedly agrees with that position, but he never talks about it on the campaign trail and has done nothing to make it happen. In light of the many murders committed by gunmen who never paused to reload, renewing the ban is something that speakers at the Democratic convention in Charlotte, N.C., should pound the lectern to support. But don't hold your breath. Most of the time on Tuesday was spent bashing Mitt Romney. 
There's nothing wrong with that, but to persuade a nation of skeptics, the party needs to do more than explain what it is against. As a statement of party principles, the Democratic platform contains much to applaud, so why aren't Democrats applauding it louder?
Party leaders have chosen a series of popular programs to run on, often avoiding topics that make pollsters nervous. At the convention on Tuesday, Mayor Cory Booker of Newark, a co-chairman of the platform committee, spoke of Democratic ideals and common sense, like deficit reduction where ''everyone from elected officials to the wealthy and the superwealthy pay their fair share.'' (The platform also seeks dramatic reductions in domestic spending, which is unnecessary and unfortunate.)
Mr. Booker talked about the need to help people retire with dignity, to become the world's ''No. 1 educator,'' to cut taxes for small businesses, and to prevent predatory lending. ''When your country is in a costly war with our soldiers sacrificing abroad and our nation is facing a debt crisis at home,'' he said, ''being asked to pay your fair share isn't class warfare. It's patriotism.''
All good, and it duplicates what Mr. Obama has been saying on the stump. But why not also talk about the section of the platform that issues a call to ''make ending poverty a national priority''? Granted, the section is only four paragraphs and consists of mostly familiar ideas like raising the minimum wage and expanding low-income tax credits. But those are four more paragraphs than Mr. Obama has spoken about poverty lately. Michelle Obama, the first lady, spoke movingly about families struggling with a variety of hardships, but the larger subject is unlikely to come up regularly in Charlotte.
The platform, unlike the ticket, speaks at length about climate change and the need to reduce carbon emissions to slow it down. (The section is a strong counterweight to Mr. Romney's provocative charge that the Obama administration is waging a ''war on coal,'' though it should have dropped ''clean coal'' as an energy choice.) The platform talks about reducing nuclear proliferation, confronting North Korea and combating narcotics trafficking.
And it demands campaign finance reform -- by constitutional amendment if necessary -- to require greater disclosure of the unlimited contributions that are turning this election over to the biggest check writers. Taking a stand against the rising influence of money in politics is a sharp contrast to this year's Republican platform, which retreated from the party's longstanding support for disclosure. But Mr. Booker did not mention it, and no convention speaker on Tuesday made it a priority. Like the assault weapons ban, it has been relegated to a document that few will ever read.
Convention speakers have but a few minutes in the spotlight to reach listeners and cannot be expected to run through every line item in a long platform. But Democrats also have a limited amount of time left to persuade the nation to let them hold the White House and increase their position in Congress. If they don't start talking about their fundamental principles, going beyond the easy sound bites, they will lose voters who are hoping for more.

HEADLINE: Egypt's Economic Struggle

 BODY:
Eighteen months after Egypt's revolution, President Mohamed Morsi, the United States and the International Monetary Fund finally seem to be pulling in the same general direction on the question of how best to revive the country's devastated economy. Their efforts are long overdue and will require a sustained commitment as Egypt struggles with its transition to democracy. 
Mr. Morsi and his party, the Muslim Brotherhood, initially adopted the self-defeating posture of rejecting outside assistance. Since his election in June, however, Mr. Morsi has become much more pragmatic as he confronted the real challenges of governing.
Egypt's problems -- a huge budget gap, a perilous drop in currency reserves, the need for thousands of new jobs and better schools -- are simply too big to solve without international help. Last month, Mr. Morsi acknowledged as much when he requested a $4.8 billion loan from the I.M.F. The deal is expected by the end of the year.
The Obama administration's announcement on Monday that it is close to an agreement with Mr. Morsi's government on an assistance package is the latest good news. Egypt's debt to the United States exceeds $3 billion, and President Obama has now offered $1 billion in debt relief. The Americans and Egyptians are still negotiating the terms, but the relief is likely to take the form of a direct cash transfer to Egypt's treasury.
Mr. Obama has also offered $375 million in financing and loan guarantees for American companies and banks that invest in Egypt and a $60 million investment fund for Egyptians to invest in new enterprises.
Mr. Obama offered an aid package last year, not long after the revolution. It languished, too long in our opinion, while Egypt's transition played out and Washington waited to see whether the Muslim Brotherhood and the military would stick to a democratic path, which it has, though with rocky moments.
Some in Congress worry whether Mr. Morsi will abide by the peace treaty with Israel, and there are legitimate concerns about his harsh treatment of critics of the news media and whether he means to represent fairly all Egyptians, including Christians. But he has, so far, upheld the peace treaty, handled a militant attack in the Sinai Peninsula reasonably well and, on a trip to Tehran last week, publicly lambasted the Iranian leaders for supporting President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.
There is no reason Congress should not support the administration. Lawmakers should also be prepared to provide more aid as needed and to work with the administration to rebalance the relationship so that assistance goes to development projects, not just the military, which has received roughly $1.3 billion per year for three decades. Increased trade is also vital. An American-sponsored trade delegation to Egypt planned for next week should be the first of many.
It would be hard to overstate the importance of helping put Egypt, the most important nation in the Arab world and the key to Middle East stability, on a firm economic footing. China -- which last week promised Cairo a $200 million loan and signed various deals involving agriculture, the environment and telecommunications -- sees this clearly. So should Congress.

HEADLINE: As the Democrats Take Center Stage

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Democrats Say U.S. Is Better Off Than 4 Years Ago'' (front page, Sept. 4):
When I hear Mitt Romney or Paul D. Ryan ask whether I'm better off now than I was four years ago, I have to say absolutely yes.
The policies of the Bush administration wrecked the economy. It's taken some time to get it moving forward, and the Republicans have made recovery only more difficult. That the economy is rebounding means that I am far more likely to find opportunities for employment than I was four years ago. 
The real question, of course, is will I be better off four years from now under a Romney-Ryan administration that doesn't respect or support women's rights, women's right to choose, universal health care, immigration reform, gay rights or same-sex marriage.
It will be an administration that believes that the safety net that supports so many Americans in times of need should be shredded in favor of bootstraps.
Well, the answer to that question is a definitive no.
CYNTHIA CARNEY JOHNSON New York, Sept. 4, 2012
To the Editor:
The response to the question Republicans seem to have found -- are Americans better off than they were four years ago? -- should be: Yes, for those citizens and families who were able to take advantage of President Obama's policies (simply ask autoworkers and related businesses, or construction workers who were helped by the stimulus package). But no for those who were denied help because the Republicans did not pass needed Democratic programs or even reach a compromise on them.
The question should be, Are Americans going to reward the Republicans for their callous infliction of distress and anguish on America for the sole purpose of attaining power in 2012?
KENNETH M. ROBBINS Middletown, Conn., Sept. 4, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''The Competitor in Chief: In Politics, and About Everything Else, Obama Plays to Win'' (front page, Sept. 3):
Of course every successful politician has plenty of ego, which is reflected in his or her competitiveness. We can only hope that it is balanced by sufficient intelligence and a strong-enough sense of fairness to translate into effective leadership.
Whether this results in a successful presidency depends in large part on circumstances, including (but not restricted to) the extent to which these qualities are matched by the opposition. The outcome of the present election will depend upon this.
ERIC L. BITTMAN Amherst, Mass., Sept. 4, 2012
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (''It's Still Halftime in America,'' column, Sept. 2) calls for each candidate for president to detail an exceptional ''journey.''
The fiscal future of the United States is certainly one of a very few crucial issues in this year's election, not least because it is intertwined with other issues like the return of the economy to robust health and the appropriate role of government.
Why can't President Obama respond to Mr. Friedman's call by announcing that he supports the Simpson-Bowles Commission's recommendations on the fiscal future of the United States and that he will work to put the commission's recommendations into effect in his next term?
The president's acceptance speech on Thursday night in Charlotte would be a good place to announce this exceptional journey.

HEADLINE: Critics Say A State Law Hurts Effort To Add Jobs

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Environmentalists in this greenest of places call the California Environmental Quality Act the state's most powerful environmental protection, a model for the nation credited with preserving lush wetlands and keeping condominiums off the slopes of the Sierra Nevada.
But the landmark law passed in 1970 has also been increasingly abused, opening the door to lawsuits -- sometimes brought by business competitors or for reasons unrelated to the environment -- that, regardless of their merit, can delay even green development projects for years or sometimes kill them completely.
With California still mired in what many consider its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the law, once a source of pride to many Californians and environmentalists across the country, has turned into an agonizing test in the struggle to balance environmental concerns against the need for jobs and economic growth.
''Something is broken,'' said Leron Gubler, the president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. ''A lot of jobs could have been saved if not for these lawsuits, as well as new jobs once these projects were completed.'' 
Mr. Gubler said lawsuits and the threat of litigation had delayed at least seven recent projects in Hollywood, costing the area more than 6,000 jobs.
In one of those Hollywood projects, the developers of a mixed-use retail and residential project won a lawsuit over its building plans, but the owners declared bankruptcy and sold before the ruling. Work has finally begun under new ownership, but another lawsuit has been filed.
In San Francisco, the city's plan to paint bicycle lanes, one of the main goals of environmentalists, was delayed for four years by a lawsuit filed by a local resident who claimed that the lanes could cause pollution.
And it is not only big projects that are litigation targets. In San Jose, a gas station has been indefinitely prevented from adding another pump because of a lawsuit filed by the owner of a competing gas station across the street.
Republicans and business advocates have sought for years to weaken the law, describing it as one of the most egregious examples of an overregulated economic climate that has driven so much business from the state.
But in the 42 years since Gov. Ronald Reagan signed the Environmental Quality Act into law, attacks against the measure have largely failed, a testament to the power of the environmental lobby and to the importance of environmental issues to voters here.
Still, with unemployment in the state still above 10 percent, sentiment may be turning against the law, with Democrats increasingly joining Republicans in trying to change it.
Gov. Jerry Brown declared that overhauling the law was ''the Lord's work,'' and in just the last several weeks, some of the state's highest-ranking Democrats have lined up in support of fundamental changes to the act, including the leaders of both houses of the State Legislature.
Last month, Michael J. Rubio, a Democrat in the State Senate, introduced a bill that would have overhauled the enforcement of the law. Though the bill was killed within 24 hours, he said he would try again next year.
''This is a very important law that we have to protect, but we have to strip away the possibility'' of the law ''being abused,'' Mr. Rubio said. ''These kinds are lawsuits are not living up to the intent of the law.''
This shift in attitude is pitting California Democrats, who have often been at the forefront of environmental policy, against the environmental lobby, one of their usual allies.
Currently, the Environmental Quality Act requires developers to go through a public process in which potential impacts on the environment are studied and plans to mitigate them detailed. Almost anyone can challenge those plans in court.
Mr. Rubio's bill would have limited these suits in some circumstances, if the project met all other environmental standards. But environmental groups asserted that this kind of amendment would have effectively curtailed the law's enforcement mechanism.
''It wasn't reform: it was gutting the law,'' said David Pettit, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''The California Environmental Quality Act as we've known it for many years protecting the environment would go away in favor of a checklist approach.''
Mr. Pettit acknowledged that the law has led to some abusive litigation, but he insisted that those cases were rare. Less than 1 percent of all projects in the state face lawsuits under the environmental act, according to a 2005 study by the Public Policy Institute of California.
''But this issue is going to come back,'' Mr. Pettit said. ''The development community has never liked it, and they're playing the jobs card now.''
Developers have said they spend millions of dollars to strengthen their projects' defenses against potential lawsuits. That drives up cost, they said, even when they do not get sued.
The Environmental Quality Act, they complain, has given rise to a cottage industry of people who make money suing or threatening to sue, a practice known as greenmailing, over projects in their neighborhoods. It is usually cheaper, developers said, to settle out of court and pay ''go-away money,'' rather than risk a protracted legal battle.
Raphael Bostic, a professor at the University of Southern California's Sol Price School of Public Policy, said the Environmental Quality Act had achieved its original purpose. But its overall effects have become more complicated over time.
''There is now consideration of environmental issues before development rather than after, which was one of the overarching goals,'' he said. ''But now, it's used much more regularly as a tool to stop development and make development more costly.''
Editorial pages up and down the state have endorsed overhauling the law. And in July, three former governors -- George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson, both Republicans, and Gray Davis, a Democrat -- wrote an op-ed for U-T San Diego advocating for ''modernization'' of the law.
In an interview, Mr. Davis said that while the original intent of the law should remain intact, the high unemployment rate made some kind of overhaul imperative.
''There are a lot of very worthwhile projects that are being stalled indefinitely for reasons largely unrelated to the environment,'' Mr. Davis said. ''Maybe if they could have gotten started, people could have gotten to work a lot sooner.''
Lawmakers have managed only relatively minor changes to the law so far. Last year, Mr. Brown signed legislation to fast track a proposed football stadium in downtown Los Angeles. Another bill, which would exempt striping bicycle lanes from the Environmental Quality Act, now awaits his signature.
Yet despite significant bipartisan support, any major changes to the law remain a tall order in Sacramento.
Brian Nestande, a Republican assemblyman, was part of the bipartisan coalition that supported Mr. Rubio's short-lived bill.
''There is no doubt that was a missed opportunity -- it's going to be tough to do it next session,'' Mr. Nestande said. ''Striping bike lanes on a road can't even be done without an environmental analysis. That's the level of insanity this has gotten to.''

HEADLINE: Cool Fossils and Hot Rocks

BYLINE: RANDALL IRMIS


HIGHLIGHT: The expedition uncovers vestiges of the Cold War and the age of phytosaurs in the Chinle Formation of Utah. 

 BODY:
Friday, Aug. 31
Seeing the stark landscape of southern Utah, we often think of it as an untouched wilderness. Yet, it's easy to forget that these lands witnessed at least 13,000 years of human occupation before any Westerner visited, and this has profoundly affected the ecosystems we see today.
As our team searches for fossils among the canyons and washes of southeastern Utah, we see evidence of a more recent alteration of the landscape. In the 1950s and 1960s, this area was the center of the uranium mining rush, as the United States government offered a premium for any ore discoveries that might lead to a uranium deposit that could be mined. This effort was spurred on by cold-war economics and national security concerns.
We commonly come across old mining roads, adits, abandoned machinery and miners' trash as we look for our more ancient quarry. Yet this is not just a curious part of the recent past; increased demand for uranium has led to renewed interest in the Chinle Formation uranium deposits in our area. Therefore, one of our goals is to understand what fossils are found in the layers that also produce uranium ore, to ensure that any future mining doesn't destroy scientifically important evidence of ancient life.
And that search for fossils from the time of early dinosaurs is proceeding well! We continue to find remains from different plants and vertebrate animals that lived some 210 million years ago. New discoveries include many different parts of the skeletons of the crocodilelike phytosaurs.
The past few days we've focused on a site that we've excavated over several years. Several rock layers at this locality preserve more than a dozen species of fossil fish, which are otherwise rare in the Chinle Formation.
Because these layers extend horizontally into the hillside, we first have to remove all the rock above these strata to expose the fossils. This process, called overburden removal, has occupied us for the past day and a half as we use picks and shovels to slowly dig down to the fossil layer. I'll check in next time with the fruits of our labor.

HEADLINE: Social Insurance and Layoffs

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Social insurance for unemployment, disability and retirement encourages workers to stop working and employers to lay people off, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Unemployment insurance and other types of social insurance subsidize job separations and thereby result in too many layoffs and too few people employed.
A variety of programs help workers after they leave a job and do not start a new one, depending on the circumstances of the job separation.
Unemployment insurance is often available when the worker was laid off and continues to look for work. Disability insurance is available when a worker's health makes it too difficult to remain on the job. Social Security's old-age insurance program provides income for elderly people after they leave their jobs.
Layoffs, disability events and retirements have some differences, of course, which is why each type of job separation has a separate insurance program. But in each case, a working relationship between an employer and an employee has been terminated, and the worker has not started a new one with, say, different working conditions or a different rate of pay.
In their analyses of disability and old-age insurance, economists have found that insurance reduces the cost of job separations and thereby increases their numbers, because the insurance helps replace the income and production that is lost when the worker stops working.

The prospect of the insurance payments gives employers less reason to change the nature of a job to encourage a disabled or elderly employee to remain at work and gives employees less reason to accept changes in working conditions or pay that would make it easier for employers to retain them.
David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has studied the United States federal disability-insurance program and finds that it "provides no incentive to employers to implement cost-effective accommodations that would enable disabled employees to remain on the job."
The Congressional Budget Office explains further about disability insurance that "because the D.I. program is funded through a flat-rate payroll tax on employers and employees, employers do not bear the costs associated with a disabled worker who stops working and becomes a beneficiary in the D.I. program."
Note that disability benefits are paid to employees, not employers. Nevertheless Professor Autor and other economists conclude that the benefits affect employer behavior because the employment relationship is exactly that: a relationship between employer and employee. 
If an employee has better, or less bad, options outside the relationship, then the employer will find the employee more expensive to keep. Disability and other forms of social insurance increase the income employees can receive outside the job and thereby make employees more expensive from an employer's point of view. 
The economists Jonathan Gruber and David Wise have found that Social Security provisions "provide enormous incentive to leave the labor force early." Just like disability insurance, Social Security provisions can shift some of the burden of job separations from the private sector to the public insurance programs and thereby give the private sector too little incentive to prevent or delay the separations.
Employers sometimes experience reductions in demand from their customers, as auto manufacturers and home builders did early in the recent recession. One way they react is to lay off part of their work forces. But they could also adapt to less demand by work-sharing, reducing prices charged their customers (or increasing those prices less than the general rate of inflation) or reducing wages.
Smart employers recognize that one of these adjustments - layoffs - brings forth help from the government through its safety-net programs (on behalf of employees); the other adjustments do not. If the safety net were less generous, there would be fewer layoffs during a recession, because employers would adjust less with layoffs and more in other ways.
(State unemployment insurance programs are, and have been, "experience rated" in the sense that employers sometimes find their payroll taxes increased for each employee they dismiss. However, the experience rating is imperfect; some employers are already at the maximum tax rate and further layoffs would not increase it. More important, the effect of experience rating on employer costs of layoffs was present even before the recession. What's new since 2008 are the federal extended and emergency unemployment programs that are not experience-rated, thereby adding to the benefits an unemployed person can expect to receive without adding to the taxes levied on his former employer).
Thus, even if it were true that the unemployed completely ignored the safety net's generosity in their decisions to seek and accept jobs, the safety net would still increase unemployment during a recession by increasing layoffs.
Yet economists have recently forgotten this important connection between unemployment insurance and the number of people employed. The C.B.O. has looked at the economic effects of unemployment insurance and noted that extending unemployment benefits would "reduce the intensity of some workers' efforts to search for a new job because the higher benefits would lessen the hardship of being unemployed." But the C.B.O. concluded that "the net impact on the unemployment rate from some workers' reduced efforts to find a job would be slight."
Although it looks at incentives to avoid job separations in its consideration of disability insurance, the C.B.O. makes no mention of the same incentives in its analysis of unemployment insurance and consequently is premature in its rejection of the basic economic proposition that paying people for not working will reduce the number of people who work.

HEADLINE: The New York Restaurant Wish List

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Dining reporters and critics describe the restaurants they wish would open. What are yours? 

 BODY:
The new season is upon us, and so is Florence Fabricant's annual list of the most notable restaurant openings. But instead of asking you which upcoming New York restaurants you're most excited about -- though by all means, share those if you have them -- we thought we'd ask which restaurants you wish would open. 
Suggestions can be pragmatic (better takeout in Fort Greene) or somewhat more detached from reality (a Pizzeria Uno at the Met). And if you want to mention specific chefs ("April Bloomfield's doughnut shop in the middle of Union Square"), why not. Post them in the comments section.
We asked Dining reporters and critics to get the ball rolling by offering their suggestions:
Julia Moskin: The Upper West Side has been under a strange curse for decades, with great food shops (e.g. Zabar's) but grim restaurants (e.g. Carmine's). The wish list is long -- a ramenya, an ice cream parlor -- but my first priority is a decent place for Mexican street food, done right. Tamales with taste. Salsas that sing. Taquitos with dignity. If only ...
Pete Wells: A really first-rate Cantonese restaurant, like what Hakkasan could have been if the quality were as high as the prices. A spectacle with better than average food, where tourists will feel like they saw New York and New Yorkers will feel like they weren't ripped off. (In other words, the kind of place that the Rainbow Room was under Joe Baum.) A Moroccan restaurant with a chef who pays attention to ingredients. More, and better, restaurants in Harlem, Bedford-Stuyvesant and the Bronx. And a place that does for Vietnamese food what Ayada, Sripraphai or, in a slightly different vein, Pok Pok Ny have done for Thai.
Sam Sifton: A good bagel shop in Carroll Gardens would be fantastic. It'd be nice to have a white table-cloth French bistro somewhere in Brooklyn as well, with superior steak frites, straight, no chaser. I wish more better Chinese restaurants would open everywhere. How about a second Marc Forgione on the Upper West Side? 
Florence Fabricant: I would be delighted if Laurent Gras got his act together and opened a restaurant in New York, if there could be even more options walking distance from BAM, and if Joël Robuchon would reopen L'Atelier somewhere.
Eric Asimov: Indulge me. This is what I would want to eat, not what I think will be economically successful: A great southern Indian restaurant with a wonderful list of fine sherries, ciders and beers. A Latino rice-and-beans joint -- pernil, mofongo, pollo, the whole bit -- that uses great ingredients, with a wonderful list of sherries, ciders and beers. And a French bistro that departs from the typical hackneyed menu and serves all the wonderful but uncommercial dishes you used to be able to find in the French countryside: lamb's feet wrapped in tripe, wild hare, that sort of thing.
Glenn Collins: Regrettably, New York City has long lacked an authentic destination-location chopped-pork barbecue establishment that is faithful to the epistemology of Eastern North Carolina. It should be a weathered, rickety roadside shack with nonexistent signage, a gravel parking lot and no name.
The menu is necessarily limited. We are talking juicy, fatty chopped barbecue only - pit-fired from hard wood - from a pork shoulder or whole hog. It is to be served on a paper plate awash in a bath of cider vinegar with a bit of salt and red-pepper flakes. There must be hush puppies on the plate, yielding a crispy, corny, buttermilk taste. The fresh, cool coleslaw should be moist, but not runny enough to transgress upon the hush-puppy domain.
The plate should be alarmingly flimsy, and it must rest on a faded vinyl checked tablecloth. The forks and knives should be made of white plastic and stingily supplied, as if they are about to run out at any minute. The odd-lot tables should be rickety enough to defy any stabilization from strategically placed matchbooks. A greasy bottle of house-made hot sauce will keep the barbecue fundamentally honest.
Motorcycles should be revving up every five to six minutes in the parking lot. And it would be nice, but hardly necessary, to have grease-dotted, fading pictures of country celebrities on the wall, signed with illegible scrawls.
It is always advisable to locate such a barbecue shack way out in the woods, far from scented candles, sheriffs and revenuers. This is something of a challenge in New York City, but the good news is that it will be another year until the construction of a new café at Tavern on the Green in Central Park can be completed. Until then, the road to Tavern, called Warner LeRoy Place, extending into the park from West 67th Street, is surrounded by trees. Why not locate right there in the empty parking lot? It seems to be the perfect white-paper-napkin zone.

HIGHLIGHT: A collection of links from the reporters and editors of the Dining section. 

 BODY:
Slate: A gravely obsessive Pepperidge Farm fan samples every variety of the label's cookies and emerges with alarming insights like this: "I don't quite understand how a Milano slice is really a Milano -- it would seem an open-faced Milano would be a contradiction in terms, seeing as the sandwich structure of the original is the defining feature." Willie Wonka, meet Jacques Derrida. -- Patrick Farrell 
: Rethink your assumptions about white wine, especially those that "tremble and whirl in your mouth like a meth-crazed ballerina." -- Julia Moskin
: It's fermented. It's smelly. It is close to rotten. Why, it's surströmming, the craved-for but notorious Swedish classic herring dish (aged in lactic acid, bacteria and enzymes and sealed in cans that bulge and sometimes burst). Now it's in season and the European Union food-safety patrol has tried to ban it. -- Glenn Collins

Newsweek: Got lobster? Thanks to this summer's glut (a record harvest has sent prices lower than they've been in three decades) Maine is rebranding the lobster as an everyday protein instead of a special-occasion treat, with a $3 million marketing campaign hoping to emulate the success of the "Got Milk?" commercials. -- Glenn Collins

: Cheating is rife in big-ticket fishing competitions, and one all-women team in Texas, the Nice Tails, now has the felony charges to prove it. -- Julia Moskin
The Economist: An institute in Stockholm estimates that close to half of the food the world produces goes uneaten. In India, as much as 40 percent rots on the way to market, and Americans waste $165 billion by tossing 40 percent of their food untouched. So worldwide programs are trying to reclaim wasted food. -- Glenn Collins
Poetry Foundation: A brief, haunting Leonard E. Nathan poem about potatoes and family. -- Jeff Gordinier

HEADLINE: Wicksell Goes To China

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: We don't want them buying our bonds. 

 BODY:
The idea that we are at the mercy of the Chinese -- that terrible things would happen if they stopped buying our bonds -- is very influential. Yet it's just wrong.
Think of it this way: the argument that interest rates would soar if the Chinese bought fewer bonds is the same as the argument that interest rates would soar when the U.S. government sold more bonds -- which, as you may recall, was the subject of fierce debate more than three years ago -- and you know how that turned out.
Again, you can think of this in terms of Wicksell: we're in a situation in which the incipient supply of savings -- the amount that people would save at full employment -- is greater than the incipient demand for investment. And this excess supply of savings leads to a depressed economy.
What China does by buying bonds is add to the excess savings -- which makes our situation worse. (This is just another way of saying that the artificial trade surplus hurts our economy -- just another way of stating the same thing). And we want them to do less of it; far from fearing that they will stop, we should welcome the prospect.
Yet this point isn't even controversial -- by and large, commentators aren't even aware that fear-of-China syndrome might be in error.

HEADLINE: Why the Minimum Wage Doesn't Explain Stagnant Wages

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Is the minimum wage one of the most important causes of the American income slowdown? 

 BODY:
Until the mid-1980s, only a single state - and one of the smallest in population, Alaska - had set a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum. But with the federal minimum remaining unchanged at $3.35 an hour for most of the 1980s, more states began to set higher floors for wages.
By the end of the 1980s, a dozen states had their own, higher minimum wage. By 2008, 32 states did. The number has fallen to 18 today, because the federal minimum has risen since 2008 - it's now $7.25 an hour - and overtaken some state minimums, but the 18 include several large states. In Illinois, the minimum wage is $8.25. In California, it is $8. In Florida, it is $7.67.
As a result of these state minimum wages, the federal minimum is not as important as it once was. It applies to less than 60 percent of the population.
In this space, we have been examining the causes of the American income slowdown - over both the last decade and the last generation - and our recent list of 14 possible causes included the stagnation of the federal minimum wage. That stagnation certainly matters: in 1968, the minimum wage was 45 percent higher than it is today, adjusting for inflation.
But I think it's fair to say that the minimum wage is not one of the most important causes of the income slowdown. The minimum wage instead belongs on a list of secondary causes. It probably did play a substantial role holding down the pay of low-income workers in the 1980s and in increasing inequality, as research by David S. Lee and others has found. But its role seems to have been much smaller in the last two decades.
I'll confess that I did not expect to come to this conclusion. When we started this project, I assumed that the minimum wage would have played a larger role. If others think it has, we welcome hearing from them.
The crucial point is that the minimum wage has risen, even after adjusting for inflation, over the last 20 years. The reason it is so much lower now than in the late 1960s is that it declined so much from the late '60s through the late '80s.
The effective minimum wage today - a national average taking into account both the federal and state minimums - is about $7.55, which is more than 10 percent higher in inflation-adjusted terms than the effective minimum in 1990. Today's effective minimum is also about 7 percent higher than in 2000.
Yet the overall pay of people at the bottom of the income ladder has been virtually unchanged since 1990, according to Census Bureau data. And pay at the bottom (as well as the middle) has fallen since 2000. The rising tide of the minimum wage, to use President John F. Kennedy's formulation, has not kept most boats from falling.
Why doesn't the federal minimum wage matter more than it does?
For all the economy's problems, American society is still richer than it was a generation ago, with fewer low-wage workers. As a result, fewer are subject to the minimum wage than would have been the case in the past. The biggest changes have occurred among women.
In the 1970s, women made up the great majority of minimum-wage workers. But as women's pay has risen, the share making the minimum wage has dropped sharply. Over all, about 5 percent of all hours worked in 2009 were paid the minimum wage or less (some businesses, like restaurants, are exempt). That was down from 8 percent of hours in 1979, according to research by David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Alan Manning of the London School of Economics and Christopher L. Smith of the Federal Reserve.
The decline is almost entirely the result of rising women's wages. About 4 percent of men's hours are paid at or below the minimum wage, down only slightly from 5 percent in 1979. For women, the decline was much bigger: to 6 percent, from 13 percent.
None of this is meant to suggest that the minimum wage is irrelevant. It affects not only minimum-wage workers but also those paid slightly more, who often receive raises when the minimum rises. If Congress increased the minimum wage to its inflation-adjusted 1968 level, a large number of poor people would receive a raise. Some would also lose their jobs, if their employers decided they could not profitably pay the higher wage. But research suggests that modest increases in the minimum wage do not have a large effect on employment.
All in all, a higher minimum wage would probably lead to a rise in pay for lower-income workers in general and a decline in inequality.
The 1980s help make that case in reverse. The federal minimum did not change from 1981 to 1990, causing its inflation-adjusted value to fall 30 percent during that time. Wages in the bottom of the income distribution fell sharply, even more sharply than they have in the last decade. The inflation-adjusted wage of a worker at the 20th percentile of the distribution dropped 9.5 percent from 1981 to 1990, according an analysis of government data in the forthcoming book "The State of Working America, 12th Edition," by the Economic Policy Institute.
Mr. Lee, a Princeton economist, argues that the minimum wage accounted for "much of the rise" in inequality in the bottom part of the income distribution in the 1980s. David Card of the University of California, Berkeley, and John DiNardo of the University of Michigan have made a similar argument. Mr. Autor, Mr. Manning and Mr. Smith suggest the effect was smaller but agree it existed.
Since 1990, though, the minimum wage has risen. If you're trying to understand why every income group except for the affluent has taken an income cut over the last decade, you probably shouldn't put the minimum wage at the top of your list of causes.
In coming weeks, our look at other causes will continue.

HEADLINE: Kaushik Basu Named to World Bank Post

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: He will be the first Indian chief economist at the bank and the second from the developing world. 

 BODY:
On Wednesday, the World Bank announced its new chief economist: Kaushik Basu, a Cornell University economist and the former chief economic adviser to the Indian ministry of finance.
As noted by Justin Sandefur of the Center for Global Development, he will be the first Indian chief economist at the bank and the second from the developing world. (His predecessor, Justin Yifu Lin, is a Chinese national.) For years, developing economies have pushed for a greater voice within the Washington-based Bretton Woods institution.
"Kaushik is uniquely suited to help us offer evidence-based solutions and advice to client countries and provide innovative excellence in leading our development research," Jim Yong Kim, who took over as the World Bank's president in July, said in a statement announcing the hire. "Kaushik brings firsthand experience from a developing country and will be a terrific asset to the institution."
Mr. Basu has "a reputation as an out-of-the-box thinker and a deep understanding of policy issues and their interface with politics," a Cornell colleague, Eswar Prasad, wrote in an e-mail.
His academic and government work has focused on development, comparative and public economics. In recent years, he has written on exchange rate manipulation, inflation, recessions and stimulus and child labor, among other topics.
A paper he released last year caused a bit of a stir: While advising the Indian government, Mr. Basu argued that countries could reduce the incidence of "harassment bribes" - e.g., "I'll approve this home renovation project for you for a small fee " - by making it legal to give a bribe, though not to receive one.
"This will cause a sharp decline in the incidence of bribery," Mr. Basu said. "After the act of bribery is committed, the interests of the bribe giver and the bribe taker will be at divergence. The bribe giver will be willing to cooperate in getting the bribe taker caught. Knowing that this will happen, the bribe taker will be deterred from taking a bribe." (Mr. Basu notably argued against giving an amnesty for past incidents of bribery.)
Mr. Basu is to start at the bank Oct. 1. In the meantime, you can follow him on Twitter.

HEADLINE: Report Assails Palm Oil Project in Cameroon

BYLINE: ELISABETH ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Two groups assert that a planned palm oil plantation would threaten wildlife and is opposed by many locals. 

 BODY:
On Tuesday, we told you about land grabs by timber companies in Liberia that are threatening that country's tropical rain forest. Today environmental groups and forestry experts are abuzz about a project in nearby Cameroon that is overseen by Herakles Farms, an affiliate of the New York-based company Herakles Capital that pursues agricultural initiatives in Africa. 
The company has acquired a huge tract of land in southwestern Cameroon under long-term lease and plans to develop one of the world's largest palm oil plantations there. Palm oil has been increasingly cultivated in Africa and Asia because it can be sold at good prices for use in biofuels, which are in principle better for the environment than fossil fuels. 
But many palm oil plantations in the developing world have proved environmentally controversial because the first step in their creation is cutting down rainforest or draining swamps - acts that cancel out any environmental benefit. 
The plantations tend to be owned by multinational corporations that sell the fuel on global markets but do not necessarily heed the needs of local people or animal populations that depend on the vanishing forests. To guard against such problems, a watchdog group called the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, representing both industry and conservation groups, seeks to promote good environmental practices on palm oil plantations and respect for local communities. 
Although Herakles had promised sustainable development on its Cameroonian plantation, several environmental groups, including W.W.F., have filed complaints with the Roundtable group about practices related to the palm oil project. 
A new report released by Greenpeace and the Oakland Institute, an environmentally minded think tank, details numerous problems. The area to be developed, which is about eight times the size of Manhattan, is a hot spot of biodiversity, and the 99-year land lease is of questionable legal status, the groups' researchers say. The report also asserts that the project was vehemently opposed by many of the people who live in the region.

Calls to the Herakles Corporation in New York were not returned this afternoon. But Herakles Farms has previously denied allegations made in complaints to the Roundtable group. And Reuters reported that it had obtained a copy of a letter in which Herakles affirmed its commitment to sustainable agriculture and to the standards set by the Roundtable organization.
The Roundtable group announced on Tuesday that Herakles had withdrawn from the sustainability program. 
"This is a very sad day for Cameroon," Basile Yapo, the W.W.F. director for Cameroon, said in a statement. "Given the rapid pace and scale of palm oil development in West Africa, it is critically important that the governments in the region put in place vital safeguards to insure that these projects are sustainable."

HEADLINE: Sept. 4: The Simple Case for Why Obama Is the Favorite

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Polls taken since last week's Republican convention show the race to be a tie. If history is a guide, that puts Mitt Romney in a hole. 

 BODY:
I've been tiptoeing around this point, because I don't think that our forecast model ought to represent the totality of our analysis about the election.
But you'll notice that our forecast has moved toward President Obama over the past several days. It now gives him about a three-in-four chance of winning the Electoral College on Nov. 6.
I'll explain a little bit more about how the model comes to that conclusion in a moment, but the intuition behind it is pretty simple:
1. Polls usually overrate the standing of the candidate who just held his convention.
2. Mitt Romney just held his convention. But he seems to have gotten a below-average bounce out of it. The national polls that have come out since the Republican National Convention have shown an almost exact tie in the race.
3. If the polls overrate Mr. Romney, and they show only a tie for him now, then he will eventually lose.
The first point is the simplest of all, but perhaps the most important. There is a lot of focus on the bounce that a candidate gets after his convention - that is, how the polls conducted just after the convention compare with the ones taken immediately beforehand.
But the more instructive comparison may be how the post-convention polls track with the actual election result - it's Nov. 6 that we're really concerned about, after all.
On average, between 1968 and 2008, the challenging candidate led by 10 percentage points in polls conducted just after his convention. By comparison, the challenging candidate eventually lost the popular vote by an average of three points in these years. That means the post-convention polls overrated the challenger by an average of 13 points.
The good news for Mr. Romney is that this tendency has been growing smaller over time. However, it hasn't necessarily disappeared. In 1992, Bill Clinton led by more than 20 points after his convention, but his actual winning margin was only about six. In 2000, George W. Bush came out of his convention in Philadelphia with about a 10-point lead in the polls - but he eventually lost the popular vote. John Kerry, in 2004, got very little bounce from his convention. But Mr. Kerry nevertheless came into his convention with a lead, and he maintained it - then he lost the popular vote by about two points instead. 
There were also two recent cases in which the post-convention polls did not overrate the standing of the challenging candidate. In 1996, Bob Dole trailed by about nine points immediately after the Republican convention in San Diego, which is the same margin by which he eventually lost to Mr. Clinton. And in 2008, Mr. Obama led by about four points after his convention in Denver, but won by a wider margin, seven points, instead.
Both 1996 and 2008 are slightly odd cases, however. In 1996, the polls had Mr. Clinton ahead of Mr. Dole by double-digits almost the whole way through the campaign, including on Election Day itself; the period right after the Republican convention that year was about the lone exception. So this may have been a case of two wrongs making a right: the polls were persistently biased toward Mr. Clinton, and Mr. Dole's convention bounce counteracted that temporarily.
And in 2008, it's not quite clear what would have happened if not for the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which occurred about two weeks after the party conventions. Mr. Obama very probably still would have won, but it might have been by a smaller margin had the economic problems not become so acute so quickly.
Certainly, Mr. Romney could benefit from a parallel to either of these circumstances. The election is close enough that if there is even a modest bias in the polls toward Mr. Obama, the president's chances will be tenuous. 
And the economic recovery is tepid enough that if there is some intervening event, such as in Europe, then some voters who were willing to give Mr. Obama the benefit of the doubt may change their minds.
But that isn't how you draw these things up. You don't want your chances to come down to the residual chance of a polling error or an October surprise. You want to be ahead after your party convention - not just tied, something that even Walter F. Mondale had (very briefly) managed to do in 1984.
The forecast model had no expectation of a double-digit bounce for Mr. Romney. This year the polls have been hard to move for any reason. By the model's logic, that implies that the conventions wouldn't move them much either.
But since Mr. Romney's deficit with Mr. Obama was very narrow (he trailed by about two percentage points heading into the Republican convention in Tampa, Fla.) it wouldn't have taken much of a bounce to put him ahead. 
Specifically, the model's assumption was that the post-Tampa polls would overrate Mr. Romney's eventual finish by about four percentage points. That's why the forecast has moved toward Mr. Obama over the last several days. It sees a bunch of polls showing a tie in the race, and interprets them as tantamount to a four-point Obama lead, since they were taken in the midst of what should be a high point for Mr. Romney.
Now that the Democratic convention has begun in Charlotte, N.C., the pressure will be on Mr. Obama. For two weeks or so after Thursday, the model will subtract a point or two from Mr. Obama's column in the polls.
But Mr. Obama seems to have more control of his own destiny right now. If he carries even a modest bounce out of Charlotte, he'll remain in the front-runner's position. 
And if Mr. Obama gets a bounce that's a bit better than modest - say, he leads in the national polls by in the neighborhood five or six points next week, as Mr. Bush did following his convention in 2004 - Mr. Romney's position will start to look fairly grim. 
It may be presumptuous, of course, to assume that Mr. Obama will get any bounce at all. And even a strong speech in Charlotte could seem futile if we get a poor jobs report on Friday. By this time next week, we could be talking about how Mr. Romney's two-point bounce looks good compared with Mr. Obama's zero-point bounce.
But we have to evaluate the data as it comes in. Being only tied in the polls immediately after his own convention is unambiguously a bearish sign for Mr. Romney - and probably the most tangible sign to date that Mr. Obama is the favorite.

ING Group to Sell Stake in Capital One | The Dutch financial services giant ING Group plans to sell its 9 percent stake in Capital One in a deal that could be worth around $3 billion.
ING acquired the stake in the American firm when Capital One bought ING Direct USA for $9 billion in February.
The Dutch firm said late on Tuesday that it would sell 54 million shares in Capital One, and would set the price before the start of trading in New York on Wednesday. Based on the closing share price on Tuesday, ING's stake in Capital One is worth around $3 billion.
The move to sell the shares comes as ING has been forced to sell assets as part of the conditions of a 10 billion euro ($12.5 billion) bailout it received from its local government in 2008. DealBook »

HEADLINE: A Closer Look at Jobs Claims

BYLINE: MICHAEL COOPER and KITTY BENNETT


HIGHLIGHT: At the convention, Democrats frequently claimed that the United States has added 4.5 million private-sector jobs since the beginning of 2010 - but the figure does not tell the whole story. 

 BODY:
One of the more frequently cited statistics at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday was the claim that the United States has added 4.5 million private-sector jobs since the beginning of 2010 - but the figure does not tell the whole story of the labor market under President Obama.
The number was cited, in various ways, in the Democratic Party platform, and in the convention speeches of Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago and Mayor Julián Castro of San Antonio. In his keynote speech, Mr. Castro said: "Four years ago, America stood on the brink of a depression. Despite incredible odds and united Republican opposition, our president took action, and now we've seen 4.5 million new jobs."
The nation does have 4.5 million more private-sector jobs than it did in January 2010. But by then, Mr. Obama had already been in office for a year. Starting the jobs count in January 2009, the month Mr. Obama took office, shows that the nation now has only 332,000 more private-sector jobs now. Figuring out when to start the count is not easy. Mr. Obama did not take office until Jan. 20, 2009, and his policies did not have time to take effect for months. But when evaluating claims about jobs creation, it is worth looking at when the starting point is.
And note: the Democrats are only talking about private-sector jobs. States, cities and localities have cut hundreds of thousands of public sector jobs in recent years to balance their budgets. Counting all jobs - private and public sector - there are slightly fewer jobs now than there were in January 2009, or slightly more jobs now than there were in February 2009, Mr. Obama's first full month in office.

HEADLINE: Is The Economy On The Mend?

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Deleveraging proceeds. 

 BODY:
Advance excerpts from Bill Clinton's big speech tonight have him making the obvious argument:
In Tampa the Republican argument against the President's re-election was pretty simple: We left him a total mess, he hasn't finished cleaning it up yet, so fire him and put us back in.
But is the economy being cleaned up?
The best case for that proposition, I think, comes if you believe that excessive household debt was at the core of the issue. Obviously this is a view I like; Gauti Eggertsson and I have done some formal modeling (pdf), and Atif Mian and Amir Sufi (pdf) have provided strong empirical evidence. 
And if that's what you think the problem is, we have in fact made significant progress. Here's the ratio of household liabilities to GDP:
Between debt repayment, defaults, and -- since recovery began in mid-2009 -- rising income, the US has made a lot of progress in deleveraging. Add in the fact that we've worked off the excess construction from the Bush years, and there's a pretty good case that the stage has been set for a much stronger recovery over the next few years.
Even if that's true, by the way, inadequate stimulus and debt relief have inflicted huge, gratuitous suffering. But the case that we have been healing all the same is pretty good.

HEADLINE: Shifting Views on Climate Change

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: Responding to questions about science, Mitt Romney says he believes the world is getting warmer and "humans play a role in that warming." 

 BODY:
President Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, have spelled out their views on climate change in a bit more detail than they usually do on the campaign trail in response to questions from a group of scientific organizations.
 In written statements posted on Tuesday at the Web site of Sciencedebate.org, the candidates added some clarity to their views on global warming, but in a way that also raised some questions about their consistency. 
Sciencedebate.org, which counts among its members the National Academies, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Scientific American magazine and dozens of other professional and academic scientific societies, was created with the goal of raising the profile of scientific and technical questions in the presidential campaign.
In his response to the group's question on climate change, Mr. Obama called it "one of the biggest issues of this generation" but stopped short of calling for a cap and trade system or other broad national policy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, something that he had favored during the 2008 campaign. He said his administration had set stricter limits on emissions from vehicles, invested billions in clean energy research and proposed the first limits on carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. He also said that the United States was leading international negotiations on climate change, although those talks have so far had little impact on greenhouse gas levels worldwide.
 Mr. Romney, whose views - or at least, his language - on climate change have shifted markedly over the years, gave one of his most forceful statements on the question yet. "I am not a scientist myself, but my best assessment of the data is that the world is getting warmer, that human activity contributes to that warming and that policymakers should therefore consider the risk of negative consequences," he wrote.

"However, there remains a lack of scientific consensus on the issue - on the extent of the warming, the extent of the human contribution and the severity of the risk - and I believe we must support continued debate and investigation within the scientific community."
 That is a distinct shift from last October, when Mr. Romney said: "We don't know what's causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us."
 In his statement to the science group, he criticized the president's approach to global warming, saying that when Congress rejected his cap and trade proposal, Mr. Obama proposed federal regulations that would bankrupt the coal industry, raise manufacturing costs and drive jobs overseas. He was also critical of the president's international efforts, saying that the United States has done nothing to curb emissions in the developing world and that unilateral action by this country would simply shift manufacturing to nations with looser environmental laws.
Mr. Romney said he supported government financing for clean energy technology development and a reduction in regulation to allow faster deployment of new and existing energy sources, including nuclear power. 
 The 2012 Republican platform makes little mention of climate change except to criticize the Obama administration for raising it to the status of a national security threat. In his nomination acceptance speech last week, Mr. Romney ridiculed a statement that Mr. Obama made at the end of the 2008 primaries that future generations would look back at his nomination as the moment when "the rise of the oceans began to slow and our plant began to heal."
"President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet," Mr. Romney said in his convention speech. My promise is to help you and your family."
The 2012 Democratic platform is less muscular on the subject than the 2008 version. The 2008 version refers to climate change as an "epochal, man-made threat to the planet" and called for dramatic changes in energy production and consumption through an economy-wide cap and trade system.
 In 2012, with the economy still reeling from the effects of the recession, the party moderated its tone, referring to climate change as "one of the biggest threats of this generation" and a "catastrophe in the making." The platform calls for accelerated efforts to develop clean energy sources, but makes no mention of cap and trade or a carbon tax to drive down greenhouse gas emissions.
 We'll wait to see what President Obama will say on the subject when he accepts his party's nomination on Thursday night . . .

HEADLINE: Shell to Test Capturing of Carbon in Canada

BYLINE: CLIFFORD KRAUSS


HIGHLIGHT: The project is intended to permanently store more than a million tons of carbon dioxide a year, which Shell said is equivalent to taking about 175,000 cars off the road. 

 BODY:
HOUSTON - In a bid to make oil sands production less polluting, Royal Dutch Shell announced on Wednesday that it would go forward with the first carbon capture and storage project ever tried in the fields of western Canada.
The announcement of the Quest project after years of study comes just months before Washington will reconsider whether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline to increase imports of heavy oil from the oil sands. Environmentalists have fought the project, arguing that refining and burning oil from the oil sands emit far more carbon than conventional oil.
The project, which is scheduled to begin operations by 2015, is intended to capture and permanently store underground more than a million tons of carbon dioxide a year, which Shell estimated was equivalent to taking 175,000 cars off the road. Carbon capture projects have lost favor in recent years because of concerns about their heavy costs, which have typically been subsidized by governments.
The Shell project, with an estimated cost of about 1.35 billion Canadian dollars ($1.36 billion), will be heavily subsidized by the Canadian federal government and the provincial government of Alberta, which together are putting in 865 million Canadian dollars (about $874 million) over more than a decade.
Shell said it was hoping to reduce the carbon emissions from a treatment plant in Scotford, outside Edmonton, that processes extra-heavy oil called bitumen so it can be shipped to refineries in the United States.
"We recognize that our growth requires that it be accompanied by improved environmental management," said John Abbott, Shell's executive vice president for heavy oil, at a news conference in Calgary, Alberta. "Quest is a very big part of that."
Mr. Abbott said that Quest would reduce the emissions from the Scotford plant by 35 percent and demonstrate the technical viability of carbon capture and storage techniques. He added that it would help lead to wider application "through the energy industry and other sectors in the years to come."
Canada is already the top source of imported oil for the United States and currently produces more than 1.7 million barrels a day of synthetic crude from oil sands. The country's leaders hope to more than double oil sands production by 2025. To accomplish that, they need the Keystone XL pipeline - which would run to Gulf Coast refineries - to export more oil to the United States, or they must build an alternative pipelines to Canada's western coast to export the crude to Asia.
President Obama rejected TransCanada's application for a permit to build the 1,700-mile, $7 billion Keystone XL pipeline in January, but the Canadian pipeline company is reapplying for a permit. Mitt Romney has said he will approve the pipeline if elected president. An improved environmental outlook for oil sands might well encourage President Obama to reconsider his initial rejection.
On Wednesday, TransCanada proposed a new route for the pipeline to avoid an environmentally sensitive region of prairie and sand dunes in Nebraska, reducing the length of its transit across the Ogallala Aquifer.
"We know the world is watching," Ken Hughes, Alberta's energy minister, said at the news conference. "We are deeply committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions."
The Canadian government estimates that carbon emissions from oil sands production and refining has declined by roughly 40 percent since 1990, but the process remains more carbon-intensive than for all but the heaviest conventional crude oils produced around the world.
Canadian and American environmentalists have been opposed to oil sands development because of concerns over pollution and the destruction of natural habitat for hundreds of bird species in the Canadian boreal forest. But at least some Canadian environmentalists have expressed support for the Quest initiative.
"We see it as one tool in the tool kit that we need to tackle climate change," said Ed Whittingham, executive director of the Pembina Institute, an influential Canadian environmental group. "We have been critical of oil sands but we are supportive of C.C.S.," he added, using shorthand for carbon capture and storage.
But Kate Colarulli, deputy director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Oil campaign, said the project would not change her opposition to the pipeline.
"It's a lot of taxpayer money spent on greenwashing," she said. "The truth is there is an environmental Armageddon happening in northern Alberta. There are also questions about whether these gases can be safely stored underground."
The Quest project will pipe liquefied carbon dioxide to injection wells and then store the substance nearly a mile underground under multiple layers of rock and mineral formations. The oil sands will originate from the Athabasca Oil Sands project, a giant mining endeavor operated by Shell in a partnership with Chevron and Marathon. The companies have not disclosed how much money they will invest in the project.
Graham van't Hoff, Shell's executive vice president for carbon dioxide and alternative energies, said in an interview that it was important that Canada make a large financial commitment because "there is not yet the economic justification on this scale of abatement."
"Government subsidies are needed to get things off the ground," he added.
Iain Pyle, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in London, estimated that the project would probably break even with the government subsidies. "It's more a move to improve the environmental impact of the oil sands," he said.

HEADLINE: Women, Women, Everywhere - but Not Much About Their Paychecks

BYLINE: MARGARET SULLIVAN


HIGHLIGHT: Where, after what seemed like women's night on Tuesday at the Democratic National Convention, was the coverage of pay equity, along with gender-economic issues in general? 

 BODY:
The stage at the Democratic National Convention was awash in women Tuesday night. And it's no wonder, since President Obama needs women desperately to win in November. Female voters tend to like Mr. Obama more than Mitt Romney -- though Mr. Obama's popularity among women has fallen sharply. So women were very much in the mix. (A nifty interactive graphic on NYTimes.com shows that "women" was the keyword mentioned third most often Tuesday night - after Obama and work.)
Each female speaker had her subject: Nancy Keenan had abortion (and she actually used the word, not its euphemism, "choice"). The Iraq war veteran Tammy Duckworth, a moving figure with her prosthetic limbs and heartfelt delivery, had the military and overcoming poverty.
Michelle Obama had everything (including, it must be said, a great dress, featuring what a friend of mine would call her Second Amendment look -- the right to bare arms). Smart female commentators like Rebecca Traister of Salon were impressed by the first lady's speech and yet a bit regretful that it essentially blotted out this Ivy League-educated woman's accomplishments beyond those of "Mom in Chief." Alessandra Stanley 's TV Watch ably and entertainingly compared Ann Romney's speech last week with Mrs. Obama's.
Then, there was Lilly Ledbetter, the 74-year-old Alabama woman whose (unsuccessful) fair-pay suit became the basis of the first law that Mr. Obama signed as president, who spoke about pay equity.
One would think that this subject - and those closely related -- would be a topic worth noting, given how it lives right at the nexus of all-important women and the all-important economy.
But that subject - not just pay equity but also gender-economic issues in general - were all but ignored in press coverage of women's night, at least in print. The Times gave Ms. Ledbetter a half-sentence in Wednesday's print edition. The Wall Street Journal allotted not even that in its morning newspaper, although the Washington Wire on WSJ.com took up the subject the night before. (Granted, only Ms. Ledbetter, among the speakers, focused on gender-pocketbook issues fully, so the fault may be as much a missed opportunity by the Democratic strategists as a hole in coverage by the press.)
Tim Harper of The Toronto Star took up the gender gap story in his online column Wednesday, but there wasn't much else -- at least not that I saw. Readers, I know, will correct me if I'm wrong.
Gender issues, particularly those going beyond the hot-button discussion of abortion, are worth exploring, and it's too bad that the Democratic night-of-women opportunity didn't prompt such a focus.
There was plenty of reader response to Tuesday's post about fact-checking and the truth. I hope to develop the subject further for a column in the Sunday Review section. If readers have specific examples of "false balance" - the near-meaningless quoting of both sides to achieve the effect of fairness - I'd like to hear from you by e-mail at public@nytimes.com
