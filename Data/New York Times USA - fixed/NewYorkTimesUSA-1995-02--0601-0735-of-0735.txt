HEADLINE: BALANCED BUDGET NEARS 67 VOTES NEEDED IN SENATE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Two more Democrats today joined the ranks of senators who support a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, and even opponents conceded that proponents were within an ace of the 67 votes needed to adopt the measure and send it to the states for ratification.
But in Congress, close is still a synonym for trailing. And even as it was clear that the amendment drive had gained new momentum, other senators widely viewed as supporters showed signs of having second, third and maybe fourth thoughts. 
 As a result, the hottest and most prolonged constitutional debate in recent history -- an argument that has smoldered though seven separate floor votes just since Ronald Reagan became President -- seemed bound for a climax next Tuesday with nobody sure of the outcome of the vote and the votes of at least five Senators up for grabs.
"Sixty-four votes I consider firm," said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is leading the supporters.
"It'll win -- 67 or 68 votes," said Senator Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat who is a confirmed budget-cutter but believes the amendment is a bad idea.
"One vote, one way or the other," said Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a usually savvy vote-counter who counts himself among the undecided Democrats.
The two Democrats who declared today, Senators Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware and Tom Harkin of Iowa, opposed the amendment last year, the last time it came before the Senate.
Senator Harkin's conversion, in particular, was striking since only three years ago, he was running for President as one of the last of the New Deal Democrats.
Both Senators said their doubts had been overtaken by fears that uncontrolled Federal spending was wrecking the economy and pilfering prosperity from future generations.
Senator Biden said he had concluded that an amendment would force the Republican Congress to confront the need for broad spending cuts and tax increases, not merely cuts in unpopular social programs. But the true imperative, he said, is to prevent the Federal debt from consuming the resources for programs of every political stripe.
"Unless this thing gets focused," he said in an interview, "by the time we face the music, everything I care about is going to be gone."
Senator Harkin issued a statement saying that the annual interest payment on the $4.5 trillion Federal debt, which now eats up 28 cents of every income-tax dollar, "is crowding out our ability to invest in our people and build a better future for our kids."
"It's time that we pass on to our kids more opportunity, not more debt," he added.
The House passed the balanced-budget amendment by a vote of 300 to 132 on Jan. 26. Should it pass in the Senate, 38 states would have to ratify the amendment for it to become part of the Constitution.
Both Senators Harkin and Biden are leading liberals swimming against a conservative political tide, and both face re-election campaigns next year. But there was no clear evidence that politics was the sole deciding factor in their announcements, and Mr. Biden, for one, said calls to his office were running against his stance.
He sponsored his own balanced-budget amendment more than a decade ago, and later called for an across-the-board freeze on Federal spending. And while Mr. Harkin opposed a version of the amendment last year, he supported it when it came before the Senate in 1986.
Their announcements bring the tally of publicly declared supporters of the balanced-budget measure to 52 Republicans and 12 Democrats, a total that Senator Hatch cites as official but that nobody else believes is complete. The question today, in a Senate that teemed with speculation but precious little legislative action, was which of the undecideds had secretly cast his lot with the amendment supporters.
This is the sort of speculation that obsesses the chamber and its hangers-on in every long debate, and Democratic supporters broadly hinted that at least two of their members were all but committed to their side. Today the rumor mill ground almost to dust the names of five Democrats: Dorgan, Conrad, Ford, Breaux and Nunn.
Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, who is concerned that the amendment would permit Congress to spend Social Security funds to balance the budget, was nevertheless said to favor the measure. He remained publicly undecided.
North Dakota's senior Senator, Kent Conrad, who is said to lean heavily against the amendment, paused only long enough to confirm his indecision before ducking into a meeting room off the Senate floor.
Senator Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky, who has twice supported the amendment, appeared squarely on the fence. A fellow Democratic Senator who spoke on condition of anonymity said Mr. Ford, the Senate's second-ranking Democrat, seemed to have been leaning for the amendment until he became angered after Republicans began a pressure campaign of television advertisements in his home state last week. Mr. Ford did not return a call seeking his comment.
Senator Breaux, also a past amendment supporter, is believed to be in the "yes" camp this time, too, and will announce his decision on Friday. Today he said opposition in his state was growing, mostly from groups representing elderly people and advocates of social programs that would face budget cuts.
"Most of the people for it think it's something we're going to do up here, and that it won't have any effect on them down there," Senator Breaux said. "That's not the way it's going to be." Still, he said, the question of whether to make those cuts might well be best left to the states as part of a debate over ratifying the amendment.
And then there is Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, a conservative who is also a past supporter of the amendment, and who not only tends to weigh in at the last moment on major issues, but also to go against the grain.
Mr. Nunn had been marked down as a sure supporter by many groups that favor the amendment. Today he said he has deep concerns that the amendment would effectively give control of the budget to the Federal courts, as they would have the power to interpret it.
He also said he would try to change the amendment on the Senate floor next week to limit judicial reviews of its meaning, and suggested -- but did not say -- that he might vote against the amendment if he fails.
"I don't want the Federal courts raising taxes and cutting spending the balance the budget," he said.
Senator Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat who is his party's chief supporter of the amendment, said later that it was "very doubtful" that the Senate would make any further changes of substance in the measure.
Senator Simon nonetheless pronounced himself "cautiously optimistic," but hastily added, "I'm not claiming victory."

HEADLINE: Dow, in a Surge, Pushes Past 4,000 Level

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 4,000 for the first time yesterday, marking a milestone in a difficult year for stocks but a powerful one for the American economy.
For now, market analysts say, the surge in the Dow points to a reduced likelihood of an economic recession and an enhanced possibility of what economists call a "soft landing," or a slowing but still-growing economy with little inflation. 
 Though stocks have risen during the last two months, their longer-term performance has still lagged. During the last year, profits on the Dow have not matched the less risky returns of fixed-income investments. And some analysts say the Dow could turn down again in the next few weeks, because traders are misjudging the course of the economy.
"The market is ahead of itself in assuming that the Fed has won the battle against inflation and already brought about a soft landing," said Christine A. Callies, equity strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman & Company.
Still, the stock market rallied yesterday, closing at 4,003.33, up 30.28 points, because of encouraging remarks on Wednesday by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, implying that the Fed's tight-money policy may be coming to an end.
Such an easing would lower corporate borrowing costs, fatten corporate profits and imply that inflation was no longer a threat, thus preserving the value of assets like stocks and bonds.
"Many, many of our accounts were participating in this market today," said Kevin M. Haggerty, the manager in charge of equity trading for Fidelity Capital Markets, the trader for the nation's largest mutual fund.
The trading yesterday was unusually heavy, at 394.7 million shares, or more than 20 percent higher than the daily average of 325 million shares this year. Almost twice as many stocks rose as fell on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,466 advancing and 787 declining. Ninety-nine stocks hit new highs, while only 34 hit new lows.
The broader stock indexes also fared well, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index reaching a record 486.91, up 1.84 points, topping its record of 485.22 on Feb. 16.
But the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 3.42 points, to 791.35, which is still far from its peak of 803.93 reached last March 18. And the Russell 2000, one of the broadest stock indexes, rose only 1.01 point, to 254.95, still far from its record of 271.08, also reached last March 18.
The Dow faded more than 17 points yesterday afternoon, inching below 4,000 a scant two minutes before the close, after another senior Federal Reserve official, Alan S. Blinder, suggested that Mr. Greenspan was talking in "the abstract" and may have been misinterpreted by traders.
"One of the things that the surge in the Dow means is that it's probable we're not going to see a recession," in part because of the calming of the markets, said Richard B. Hoey, portfolio manager for Dreyfus Growth and Income Fund, with $1.6 billion of stocks. "Beyond that, the Dow does not mean a great deal," he added, because "this is more of a relief rally, than an enthusiasm rally. It's relief that the Fed isn't going to kill the rally."
There is little enthusiasm in the stock market, Mr. Hoey said, because investors can still make twice as much from fixed-income investments, like 7.33 percent from 10-year Treasury bonds, than they can from the Dow, whose stock prices rose only 2.9 percent in the last year and only 5.7 percent with reinvested dividends. "They're riskless returns, unlike the Dow," he said.
As if to underscore the uncertain returns of stocks, Motorola, once a market leader, fell 1 1/2, to 56 1/2, as the Dow and S.& P. 500 were establishing new records. Last week, Motorola reported that cellular telephone sales, a big product line, may be slowing.
Other technology stocks also weakened. Compaq fell 2, to 34 1/8, and Intel fell 19/16 , to 781/16 .
Still, the market's overall direction was up. The Dow was led higher by J. P. Morgan, rising 1 3/8, to 63, and Philip Morris, gaining 1 1/4, to 59 1/2.
Some market analysts say they wonder whether there is enough money in the stock market to sustain a broad-based rally. Last year the net cash inflow into stock mutual funds slowed to $119.3 billion, from $129.6 billion in 1993, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group. Meanwhile, the assets of money-market mutual funds shot up to $628.2 billion, from $582.8 billion in 1993.
But yesterday, traders bid up the price of shares after carefully combing the Congressional testimony on Wednesday of Mr. Greenspan.
In his prepared text and his answers to question from senators, the normally Delphic Mr. Greenspan was unusually clear and specific about what he called the "signal accomplishment" of keeping inflation below 3 percent for three consecutive years for the first time since the early 1960's. And traders concluded that the Fed was less likely to continue its policy of tight money beyond perhaps one more increase in short-term rates.
Mr. Hoey, the portfolio manager at Dreyfus, said he suspected that Mr. Greenspan's remarks were timed to calm markets made nervous by the continuing troubles in the Mexican economy and currency. By calming American markets, Mr. Greenspan helps to calm Mexico, which helps to calm America even more, Mr. Hoey said.
Despite the difficult 12 months that began with the Fed's increase in rates on Feb. 4, 1994, which led to a drop of nearly 10 percent in the Dow by April, traders bid up prices past the millennial mark in record time.
It took about 46 months to pass from 3,000 in April 1991 to 4,000 yesterday, compared with the 51 months it took to cross 3,000 from 2,000 in January 1987, and the agonizing 14 years it took to cross 2,000 from 1,000 in the long bear market of the 1970's.
Ms. Callies of Brown Brothers said the rally appeared to be part of the normal life cycle of bull markets, in which speculators rush in to bid up prices because some convenient event, like testimony of a Fed chairman, provides an excuse. "It's a routine change in sentiment," she said. "There would have been a speculative rally at some point, with or without Alan Greenspan."
Among the gainers yesterday, Boston Scientific rose 1 1/8, to 20 1/2, after its shareholders and those of Scimed agreed to a $1 billion merger. Scimed rose 2 3/8, to 67 7/8.
Morrison Knudsen rose 1 3/4, to 8 7/8, as its creditors granted it an extension on defaulted loans. And Multimedia rose 8, to 37 1/8, after it said it might put itself up for sale.

HEADLINE: CARTER RECEIVED COOLLY IN HAITI

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Five months after he negotiated an agreement that averted an invasion and restored President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, Jimmy Carter returned today to the scene of one of his diplomatic feats. But instead of receiving a hero's welcome, he was plunged into the turmoil of Haitian domestic politics.
Invited by Mr. Aristide and scheduled to receive an honorary degree at the Groupe Olivier Collaborateur University, Mr. Carter landed here to find the walls of the capital covered with graffiti denouncing him. 
 There was no official representative of the Haitian Government at the airport to greet him, but tonight Mr. Carter met with President Aristide and then went to a dinner at the United States Embassy.
Despite the graffiti, he professed to be undeterred and eager to jump back into the fray in a country he has visited nine times over the last decade. "We are very glad to be back in Haiti, a country obviously dedicated to peace, human rights and democracy," he said upon arriving.
The former President was accompanied by his wife, Rosalynn. Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, and Gen. Colin Powell, who helped Mr. Carter negotiate the departure of Haiti's military dictators and the entry of 20,000 American troops, are to arrive Friday.
Their visit, which is to end Saturday night, is intended to examine the most contentious issues facing Haiti. The priority, Mr. Carter said, is "to assess the progress being made, and to see if we can be of any help, in an orderly election process."
He said the delegation would also evaluate Haiti's security and economy. He stressed that "we are not here in an official capacity," but also said that he would be reporting to President Clinton "and other officials."
On Monday, after months of negotiation and a new electoral code, the Haitian Government announced that elections for more than 2,000 legislative, county and municipal posts will be held on June 4, with a runoff on June 25. Jockeying for political advantage began immediately, and accelerated when it became known that Mr. Carter intended to meet with leaders of 18 different parties.
On Tuesday, Mr. Aristide dismissed all 4 generals and 39 colonels and majors from the Haitian Armed Forces. Almost immediately, rumors began circulating that Mr. Carter would attempt to persuade the President to rescind that action.
Some diplomats here described the timing of the military purge as a warning to Mr. Carter not to meddle in Haitian affairs. "He could have announced those changes any time he wanted, but he chose to do so three days before Carter was scheduled to arrive," one diplomat said.
In addition the country has been swept by rumors that sympathizers of the military regime may attempt to disrupt the Carnival celebration this weekend. A decree issued by the Ministries of the Interior, Defense and Justice on Wednesday spoke of efforts to subvert the government, thus increasing the unease among the populace.
Early in the week, anti-Carter graffiti in Creole and English appeared on walls of buildings here, including the American Embassy, scribbled by groups of young men who fled whenever an American military patrol turned the corner. The slogans in English included obscene insults as well as: "Carter, We Don't Need You" and the ever-popular "Carter Go Home," while the Creole messages spoke of "Carter the fake democrat" and "Carter, lawyer for soldiers and thugs."
According to Haitian radio reports and some of the slogans, the graffiti appeared to be the work of the left wing of Mr. Aristide's Lavalas movement, which is suspicious of the American role here and of Mr. Carter's intentions. But some diplomats suggested clandestine pro-military groups trying to discredit Mr. Aristide were responsible.
Mr. Aristide's press secretary, Yvon Neptune, said today that while the Government was not involved in the graffiti, such expression was to be expected in a new democracy like Haiti's where "Everyone is free."
Groups supporting Mr. Aristide were particularly angered by Mr. Carter's decision to invite representatives of right-wing parties, including several that supported the dictatorship that overthrew Mr. Aristide in September 1991, to meet with him. More than a score of grass-roots organizations issued a statement this week saying that the Carter visit posed a danger to democracy.
Mr. Carter jokingly described the graffiti as part of his official welcome. He went on, however, to describe it as "a lawless act, apparently by one who is against democracy and freedom but who doesn't represent the people of Haiti."

HEADLINE: Dispute Over Nuclear Treaty Is Souring Relations Between Israel and Egypt

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Egypt, which in 1979 was the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, now sees an alarming deterioration of its relations with its neighbor, centered around a bitter dispute over Israel's refusal to sign the treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
The dispute, which has resulted in sharp exchanges between the two countries, is the most serious since Egypt's condemnation of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Egypt's position has soured relations with the Clinton Administration, which has mounted a strong drive to renew the nuclear non-proliferation treaty indefinitely at a United Nations conference in April. And it has stymied Israel's efforts to broaden diplomatic and economic ties with other Arab countries. 
 "We do not believe that the N.P.T. extension should be linked to whether other states join to the treaty, or to a specific time frame for achieving our broadly supported non-proliferation goals, in the Middle East," a senior American diplomat said.
Egypt, along with Syria and six Persian Gulf countries, now say they will refuse to support renewal of the treaty until Israel signs. Egypt is lobbying other Arab nations to reject the treaty. It has advised Muslim countries to hold off normalizing relations with Israel. And the Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, has accused Egypt of blocking Israel's attempts to establish diplomatic relations with the African nations of Tanzania, the Comoros and Djibouti.
"We shall continue to probe and seriously discuss the Israeli nuclear program," Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said after a meeting today with President Hosni Mubarak and the Israeli Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres. "We need more time, to see what we can reach."
The two sides said they would continue discussions and seek to thwart a further deterioration in relations.
But Mr. Moussa said Israel could not aspire to a wider peace while hiding what he called the only nuclear weapons arsenal in the region.
"We can't talk about a new regional order and then permit a unique nuclear program in our next-door neighbor," he said.
There is no optimism in Israel about a quick way out of this dispute. "The problem is that N.P.T. has no solution," said a senior Israeli official, who refused to be identified. "We won't sign, and they won't drop their demand that we sign."
The exchanges between Israeli and Egyptian leaders have grown heated in recent weeks. Mr. Rabin's characterization a few days ago of Egyptian tactics as "a foul wind" infuriated many officials, including Mr. Mubarak.
The confrontation has also strained Cairo's relations with Washington at a time when many in the new Congress are questioning Egypt's lavish aid package. Israel and Egypt each receive about $3 billion a year in aid.
But American diplomats said that despite ongoing discussions with the Egyptians, there was no effort to use the aid as a bargaining chip.
Israel, which refuses to confirm or deny the existence of a nuclear arsenal, is said by Western diplomats to have about 200 nuclear warheads.
If Israel signed the 25-year-old treaty, its installations would be opened for international inspection, exposing the full extent of any program, and it would have to freeze development of nuclear weapons.
Israeli officials contend that the Egyptians have seized on the issue to keep Israel isolated in the Middle East.
A United States Government report, as early as 1964, listed Egypt as the Arab country most vulnerable to a nuclear attack. Mr. Peres sought today to ally Egyptian fears.
"What we are doing should not affect Egypt, which is a good neighbor," Mr. Peres said. "It should affect countries that hope to destroy Israel -- like Iran, Iraq and maybe Libya."
Mr. Peres, in an Israeli radio interview earlier today in Jerusalem, said he had turned down a request by Mr. Moussa to visit Israel's top-secret Dimona nuclear installation.
"I told him," Mr. Peres said on the army radio, "I thought that was very dangerous. He asked me why and I said: 'What will happen if you visit Dimona and discover nothing. You'll ruin our deterrent.' "

HEADLINE: Greenspan Reassures the G.O.P. on Planned Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Continuing his campaign for deep cuts in the Federal budget, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, reassured Republicans in Congress today that he would try to protect the economy from any damage that might be caused by their proposed spending reductions.
Mr. Greenspan also followed up on his suggestion last month that the Government's Consumer Price Index overstates inflation by recommending today that Congress appoint a special commission to pinpoint the upward bias in the inflation gauge. That way, he said, rather than altering the index itself, the Government could hold down the increase in the future cost of Social Security benefits, Federal pensions and other costs pegged to inflation in line with the commission's estimates. 
In his second day of Congressional testimony, Mr. Greenspan echoed his statement on Wednesday that the economy shows signs of cooling off, hinting that the Federal Reserve would hold interest rates steady or even ease credit if there were signs of a sharp downturn.
Supporting that viewpoint were two economic indicators released today.
The Commerce Department said business investment in factories and equipment, a major source of economic strength for the last two years, should slow in 1995 to a much more moderate pace. American business plans to increase capital spending by 6.6 percent this year, to $592.9 billion, less than half the 13.7 percent jump recorded in 1994.
In the other report pointing to a slowing economy, the Labor Department said that first-time claims for unemployment benefits by newly laid-off Americans rose 2,000 last week, to 349,000. It was the highest since the week ended Jan. 7, which was skewed by holiday fluctuations. Excluding that week, it was the highest since last July.
These were the latest among several recent signs that the expansion is finally being braked by interest rate increases.
Mr. Greenspan, in his testimony today before the House Banking Committee, sought to reassure Congress that spending cuts would not make the slowdown any worse.
It is "unquestionable," Mr. Greenspan said, that in the long run, deep budget cuts would result in lower interest rates and better economic growth. But he added that if the cuts were so severe that they slowed the economy in the short term, "we obviously will respond to that."
Mr. Greenspan was clearly trying to head off an excuse for limiting budget cuts. If the absence of Government spending threatens to deflate the economy, he suggested, the Fed could offset the effect with lower interest rates. But he stopped short of supporting the Republican plan to pass a balanced budget amendment, and expressed doubts that tinkering with the Constitution was a wise way to set the nation's fiscal policy.

HEADLINE: Panel Opposes School Lunch Program

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
A House committee voted today to scrap the national school lunch program and let states decide how to use Federal money to feed school children.
The program was created in 1946 and has become a fixture of American life, subsidizing meals served to more than 25 million children a day. 
 By a party-line vote of 23 to 17, the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities today approved legislation that would turn this and other child nutrition programs over to the states, with a lump sum of Federal money, or a block grant.
Today's action came as House Republicans gained momentum in their efforts to pare back social welfare programs established over the last 60 years. Democrats protested loudly. The bill is likely to be approved by the full House, but the outlook in the Senate is unclear.
Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee, predicted that the child nutrition proposals in the House bill would die in the Senate. "This assault on America's children will be stopped," he said.
Republicans, including Gov. John Engler of Michigan, one of the foremost advocates of block grants, contended that they were being depicted as heartless and mean-spirited.
Under the Welfare Reform Consolidation Act approved today by the House committee, states would gain vast new discretion to design their own school lunch and breakfast programs. Federal nutrition standards would be eliminated; states would set their own standards.
By a vote of 21 to 15, the committee rejected a Democratic proposal to preserve the school lunch program in its current form.
Republicans said the change to a block grant was necessary because states were wasting time and money on huge amounts of paperwork required by Federal regulations.
Representative Donald M. Payne, Democrat of New Jersey, said that if the Federal requirements were too burdensome, "let's look at eliminating the paperwork, not the meals."
Representative Marge Roukema, Republican of New Jersey, voted to replace the school lunch program with a block grant. But she said she was uneasy about one aspect of the proposal: each state would get a fixed sum of money for the year, and the amount would not increase if a state experienced recession or high unemployment.
Under current law, Federal spending for school meals increases in hard times because anyone who meets the eligibility criteria based on family income is automatically entitled to a free lunch. The House bill, part of the Republicans' Contract With America, would eliminate this guarantee.
Representative Duke Cunningham, Republican of California, defended the proposal for a block grant, saying, "I really believe states can do it much better at less cost with more efficiency."
The amount of money in the block grant would increase from $6.7 billion in 1996 to $7.8 billion in the year 2000, Republicans said. But Democrats said it would not increase as fast as it would under current law.
The House bill would allow legal immigrants to get subsidized school meals, but would deny such assistance to children who were illegal aliens.
The bill would also establish a block grant to replace the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. This program, known as WIC, has been shown to reduce infant mortality by improving the health of pregnant women.
A separate part of the House bill would consolidate nine Federal child care programs and freeze Federal spending for them at the 1994 level, $1.9 billion a year. Republicans said the states could serve more people with the same amount of money by slashing administrative costs.
But Helen Blank, a policy analyst at the Children's Defense Fund, said the money was "totally inadequate" to meet a growing demand. Under welfare bills supported by lawmakers from both parties, she said, millions of welfare mothers will be required to work and will need child care.
The House committee rejected a Democratic proposal that would have required states to use competitive bidding when they buy infant formula for babies from low-income families. Such bidding procedures, required under a 1989 law, saved more than $1 billion in the WIC program last year. The savings permitted states to feed more women and children without increasing the cost of the program.
Representative Bill Goodling, the Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman of the House committee, said state officials were smart enough to use competitive bidding techniques if they were truly beneficial. But Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who was head of the Federal Food and Nutrition Service in the Carter Administration, said, "In many states, the major infant formula companies successfully fought the use of competitive bidding before the Federal Government required its use."
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat, said the bill approved today was "the most despicable, mean-spirited legislative proposal I have seen in all my years of public service." Without doubt, he said, "children will go hungry" if the bill becomes law.
Mr. Engler of Michigan, however, said he welcomed the flexibility provided by the House bill and would use it to coordinate the school lunch program with WIC and other forms of food assistance.

HEADLINE: To Some Sioux, Costner Now Dances With Devil

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DEADWOOD, S.D.

 BODY:
Kevin Costner became a hero among American Indians five years ago for his movie "Dances With Wolves," a tribute to the Lakota Sioux culture before whites swarmed the Black Hills in the 1870's to snatch the land and search for gold.
In fact, the actor was presented by tribal leaders with a hand-woven quilt and honored with a ceremony in which a sacred eagle feather was tied in his hair, a gesture of appreciation for his sensitivity to Sioux traditions. 
 But now that Mr. Costner wants to build a huge new casino and resort here, some Sioux feel betrayed. The resort would be partly built on National Forest land that tribal leaders believe belongs to the Indians.
"After the movie, I thought he was pretty cool," said Joe Pulliam, a 26-year-old Sioux artist who lives on the Pine Ridge reservation in Shannon County, the poorest county in America. "But now, it seems like he's just another white guy coming here to take what he can get."
The complicated dispute over the land sought by Mr. Costner and his business partner and brother, Dan Costner, dates to the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868. Under that agreement, the Sioux were granted land from the Missouri River in South Dakota west to the Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming, in exchange for a promise from the tribe to vacate vast sections of the Great Plains.
When gold was discovered in the Black Hills in the 1870's, however, settlers from the East began to swarm into Deadwood's famous gulch and other areas. And in 1877, Congress passed a law that took back the land, an act that many historians believe was intended to punish Indians for the defeat of General George Armstrong Custer and the Seventh Cavalry in the Battle of Little Bighorn a year earlier.
The Supreme Court ruled in 1980 on behalf of the tribes, ordering the Federal Government to compensate the Indians for the property loss. But the tribes have refused to accept the money, insisting that they be given National Forest lands in the Black Hills, which they consider sacred. The monetary compensation has been held in escrow, drawing interest, and is now about $380 million.
The Costners, who also own the Midnight Star casino in Deadwood, which is on private land, want to use about 600 acres of National Forest land for an 18-hole golf course for their new project. The proposed $100 million resort, to open in 1997, would also include a 350-room lodge and an outdoor amphitheater built on adjacent private land.
In exchange for the Federal land, the Costners would swap a 600-acre parcel they own in Spearfish Canyon, about 10 miles from Deadwood. The National Forest Service says it will probably approve the trade because the private land being offered is pristine and spectacular.
But the tribes contend that no National Forest land in the Black Hills should be traded, since they consider the compensation issue unresolved. Over the years, tribal leaders have tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade members of Congress to sponsor legislation that would return the Black Hills to the Indians.
Among whites in South Dakota, any talk of returning the Black Hills to Indians is overwhelmingly opposed. And they welcome the proposed Costner project, especially since jobs are scarce in this remote section of the Dakotas and could become even more scarce if Ellsworth Air Force Base in Rapid City, the largest employer in the area, is shut down in the Pentagon's effort to save money.
Some Sioux express concerns that a huge new casino would hurt business on eight Indian-run gambling halls in South Dakota. But others believe the huge Costner project would increase business for the tribal halls by attracting tourists who could then be lured into making the three-hour drive to the closest reservations.
"We've got plenty of history in Indian country, and we can compete with the casinos in Deadwood for tourism," said Wayne Barber, the general manager for the new Prairie Wind casino on Pine Ridge reservation. "They've got Wild Bill Hickok and we've got Crazy Horse. They've got Potato Creek Johnny and we've got Chief Red Cloud. We've got a herd of bison, an elk refuge, the grasslands, the Badlands."
Kevin Costner, who is working on a movie in Hawaii, could not be reached. Publicists for the actor have declined to comment. Dan Costner did not return telephone calls requesting an interview, but he released a statement earlier contending that their resort would not hurt tribal casinos and that it would have a "strong, positive, measurable impact on Deadwood and the surrounding communities' economies."
Sioux leaders have also expressed resentment over the $14 million in Federal, state and local tax breaks and incentives that have been promised for the Costner project.
"When the tribes wanted gambling, the state fought them every step of the way," said Tim Wapato, the executive director of the National Indian Gaming Association in Washington. "Along come the Costners, who don't even need the money, and they get subsidies. It seems racist to me."
The Costner resort would be named Dunbar, after the United States Army officer played by the actor in "Dances With Wolves." Mr. Costner earned an estimated $60 million from the movie. At the time, some tribal officials suggested that the actor invest some of his profits in Indian casinos. But he has not done so.
Tim Giago, the publisher of the Indian Country Today newspaper in Rapid City, said many of the Sioux people who revered "Dances With Wolves" wanted to give Mr. Costner the benefit of the doubt, speculating that he was "so busy with his movies" that he had not kept track of the dispute in South Dakota.
Doris Leader Charge, a Sioux who taught Mr. Costner some of the Lakota language and had a role in the film, remembers as a small child going to the store and interpreting for her grandmother, who spoke no English. Invariably, the girl would ask for candy. "When I get my Black Hills back," her grandmother would answer.
"Now I'm a woman of 70 myself," said Ms. Leader Charge. "And we're not any closer to getting back our Black Hills than we were then."
As for Mr. Costner, Ms. Leader Charge said that by "making a movie that told people all over the world that the Lakota people still live -- will always live," he has already given American Indians a gift more valuable than money.

Rally in Bonds Falters On Renewed Rate Fears

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Government securities rallied early yesterday, but then gave back almost all the day's gains after comments from the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve rattled some traders and investors.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 5/32 , to 10031/32 , for a yield of 7.54 percent, up from 7.53 percent on Wednesday. The rates on shorter-maturity bills increased a couple of basis points, while the yields on intermediate notes declined slightly. 
 In an interview with Market News Service, Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said he did not intend to signal in a speech last Friday that the Fed was finished raising interest rates or that its next policy move would be a cut in interest rates. Instead, he said, he could "not preclude" another rate increase.
The suggestion was not what traders wanted to hear, because the market rallied yesterday morning and on Wednesday after the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, indicated in Congressional testimony that the Fed might be finished raising interest rates for the time being. Mr. Blinder's comments last Friday seemed to support that view.
Since February 1994 the Fed has raised short-term rates seven times to slow the economy and control inflation.
Until the interview with Mr. Blinder was made public yesterday afternoon, some traders were saying that they could see no limit to the bond rally. An increase reported earlier yesterday in weekly jobless claims data added to a growing belief that the economic slowdown was under way. Initial claims rose to 349,000 for the week that ended last Saturday, up from a revised 347,000 a week earlier. For the week of Feb. 11, the claims were 338,000.
Mr. Greenspan testified before the House Banking Committee yesterday, repeating the points on monetary policy that he made to a Senate panel on Wednesday. But he did not change what he said, and appeared to have little impact on the market.
Robert Sinclair, managing director of United States Treasury trading for BA Securities Inc. in San Francisco, said he expected that with Mr. Greenspan's testimony finished and the monthly Treasury auction of two- and five-year notes ended, the market's attention would turn to economic data.
At the five-year note auction yesterday, the yield was 7.12 percent, down from 7.79 percent last month, and the lowest since Aug. 24, 1994, when it was 6.91 percent.
Mr. Sinclair said the Treasury market had been helped by the fact that there was little supply in alternative investments like mortgage securities, municipals and corporate securities. "With the yields so tight to Treasury securities, it doesn't make sense to buy the alternatives," Mr. Sinclair said. "But that will change once those other alternative markets get some supply."
Analysts say that as the market trades higher, things can get out of line, and they expect the market to give back some of its gains. "The market has gotten out over its skis," Mr. Sinclair said.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year Treasury notes:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

High Yield. . .	7.125%	Low Yield. . .	7.070%	Median Yield. . .	7.100%	Accepted at low price. . .	91%	Total applied for. . .	$27,223,347	Accepted. . .	$11,000,607	Noncompetitive. . .	$952,000	Interest set at. . .	7 1/8%

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Changing Outlook on Rates Sends Dollar Slightly Lower

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar finished slightly lower against leading currencies yesterday as investors continued to adjust their outlook for lower interest rates in the United States.
 Dealers said there was also a growing sense that the Federal Reserve was not prepared to halt the currency's slide. 
 In comments before Congress yesterday, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, reiterated his view that the United States economy was slowing. His assessment has caused investors to lower the chances of a further rise in interest rates and, therefore, the value of the dollar.
 "The dollar feels weak because there is a reassessment taking place about where U.S. rates are going to be," said Paul Farrell, vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank.
 At a time when European economies, especially Germany's, seem to be heating up, the spread between American and European rates is expected to narrow, a change that traditionally bodes ill for the dollar.
Some analysts expect the Bundesbank to raise interest rates within the next several months, given signs of rising commodity prices in Germany.
 Also weighing on the dollar was a growing conviction that the United States would not intervene on its behalf. Yesterday, Mr. Greenspan strongly underscored his desire to see a strong dollar, but dealers said his remarks had failed to impress market participants.
 "The market still has some doubts about the Fed's commitment to come in and aggressively support the dollar," said Michael Faust, currency strategist at Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser, a money managment firm in San Mateo, Calif.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar slipped to 1.4675 German marks from 1.4710 marks on Wednesday. The dollar also fell to 1.2455 Swiss francs from 1.2490 francs. The British pound rose to $1.5945 from $1.5883.
The dollar also continued to drift lower against the Japanese yen, falling to 96.60 yen, the lowest level since Nov. 2, when it touched a post-World War II low of 96.12 yen. The dollar settled at 96.72 yen late yesterday, down from 97 yen.
While less of a factor yesterday, a strong desire to hold German marks influenced the dollar's inability to rally, dealers said.
 "The market is still very much enamored with the mark and that does not bode well for the dollar," said Tom Benfer, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Montreal.

Nationsbank In Mortgage Service Deal

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The Nationsbank Corporation said yesterday that it would pay Keycorp $500 million for the right to service $25 billion in mortgages and some related assets.
The acquisition would increase the loan-servicing portfolio of Nationsbank's mortgage unit to $75 billion, making it one of the five biggest mortgage servicers in the country, the company said. 
 For big banks, loan servicing is a potentially lucrative business. The banks collect monthly payments from borrowers and pass them on to investors for a fee.
On Wednesday, the Nationsbank unit, the Nationsbanc Mortgage Corporation, agreed to buy the right to service $10 billion in mortgages from a unit of the Fund American Corporation of Norwich, Vt. The purchase price was not disclosed.
"We are very attracted to mortgage servicing right now, as it provides a good, recurring source of revenue," said Andrew Woodward, president of Nationsbanc Mortgage.
Shares of Nationsbank rose 75 cents yesterday, to $51.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
An increasing number of mortgage companies are being acquired by bigger banks, whose lower costs allow them to make more money on the business.
Profits at mortgage companies have fallen in the last year as higher interest rates dampened demand for new home loans and shut down the refinancing of existing loans. The slowdown has depressed the prices of mortgage banks.
"If you're committed to the business, you'd rather buy at the low than at the high," said John Heffern, bank analyst with NatWest Securities. "Nationsbank has a history of making pretty savvy investments, buying when most people want to sell."
Nationsbank's deal includes paying $350 million for about 390,000 loans with a weighted average interest rate of 7.95 percent, and $150 million for related assets, including receivables and advances.
Keycorp said it was selling the business, which it put on the block in October, because of its low returns. The mortgage unit has about 500 employees.
"To provide returns comparable to our other businesses, substantial investments would have been required," Keycorp's chairman and chief executive, Victor J. Riley Jr., said.
Keycorp, based in Cleveland, is the country's 10th-largest banking company, with $66.8 billion in assets, while Nationsbank, based in Charlotte, N.C., is No. 3, with more than $169 billion in assets.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Taking Over Mexico

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
When a government lies, its people must pay, and very soon do.
When a poor country borders on a rich country, people from the poor country often cross into the rich country to find work. Sometimes they don't have entry visas. 
 When these people illegally hunting work are presented as a terrifying menace, soon legally arrived foreigners become targets, then even certain native-born.
They are time-proven, all three of these little truths. They are also guaranteed to be ignored when they are the roots of trouble, as they are of the U.S.-Mexico intertwined double crisis of economic immigrants.
Maybe there are still parts of the U.S. where you can ignore Mexican-American realities. But not here, where the Mayor has a hot line connecting with Tijuana, nearby over the border, and certainly not now.
Without vote or debate in either country, the U.S. Government has taken over the responsibility for Mexico's economic future.
This decision was the result not only of mismanagement but falsehoods, evasions and self-delusions by the Mexican and U.S. Governments.
Originally they were designed to convince Americans that Mexico was strong enough financially and politically to enter an economic partnership with the U.S. -- the North American Free Trade Agreement -- that would profit investors and workers in both countries.
Then, as the Mexican economy unraveled, fast, the cover-up began. U.S. and Mexican officials did not pass on what they knew to the investing public or workers who were supposed to get jobs from Nafta.
How long can you cover up a collapsing peso? That can be answered precisely now -- until a few days before Mexico is to default. Then the Clinton Administration had to decide -- let the partner default and investors wait, or throw, oh, $20 billion to $50 billion into the pot to pay back Mexican and U.S. investors.
President Clinton spared Congress the trouble of a vote. Congress kissed his hands. But if Mexico goes bankrupt anyway, life will get nasty for Americans who should have revealed early warnings. So Washington decides to supervise Mexico and spend money to prop up its banks.
That puts America in charge. Mexican investors may like that -- and Mexican politicians who have been running what Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan describes as a one-party Leninist system.
But most Mexicans detest becoming wards of the U.S. or surrendering their oil as collateral. Maybe they will just go and have a revolution. Then Mr. Clinton can tell us how to get our money back.
The whole collection of Mexican and American turpitudes will result in even more Mexicans coming to work illegally in California and Texas. Since these states once belonged to Mexico, that eases whatever feeling Mexicans may have of committing a heinous crime.
But since in so many American eyes they are, why was the immigration problem never faced squarely in the Nafta or loan talks? Shyness? Not exactly. America is two-minded about Mexican immigrants. U.S. industry -- agriculture, textiles, construction -- wants them in time of labor shortages and other times wants them not.
Americans have the right to demand their Government try to stop illegals at the border. But whipped-up anti-illegal passions soon become anti-immigrant prejudices.
That is not maybe. California's plan to take health and education benefits from illegals is now in the courts. State action against legal immigrants has been ruled out by the Supreme Court. But unless the Court rules otherwise, Congress not only can act against legal immigrants but already has. A House panel has voted to deprive them of many health, education and welfare benefits.
Now we shall see whether Representative Gingrich and Senator Doletell their Republican colleagues to go along with the committee or fight for legal-immigrant rights in the name of that old American motto, what was it again, e pluribus something.
Next step: Gov. Pete Wilson of California wants a constitutional amendment to take citizenship from anybody born in the U.S. whose parents arrived without papers. Babies should be more careful -- the fourth little truth.

HEADLINE: Bargains at Expensive Restaurants

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV 

 BODY:
EVERYBODY wants to eat in expensive restaurants, but nobody wants to pay the price. At least, that's the usual stumbling block for the sizable portion of the restaurantgoing public that is unwilling or unable to empty its wallet to fill its stomach in the most refined sort of way.
But in an unlikely fit of collective wisdom, New York restaurateurs in the last few years have come up with a novel way to overcome this resistance: charge less. 
 Some of Manhattan's finest restaurants, including such luminaries as Gotham Bar and Grill, signed onto the $19.92 program (now up to $19.95), which offers a special three-course lunch for that price. Other expensive restaurants have menus in the same range, like Palio's $20 Piatto Unico menu and Jo Jo's $25 lunch deal. And some, like Follonico, offer simpler, less expensive menus at lunch than at dinner. In the latest twist, expensive restaurants are opening less-expensive, less-formal adjuncts in which a completely different menu is served, like Gramercy Tavern's Tavern Taste menu, served in its front room, Cafe Centro's Beer Bar, actually an adjoining restaurant, Cub Room's Cub Room Cafe, also an adjoining restaurant, and the Vodka Bar downstairs at American Renaissance.
It's not noblesse oblige that drives the restaurateurs, of course, but the desire to use their facilities efficiently. A full dining room is always better than a half-full one, and besides, there's always the chance that somebody paying $25 for a meal will feel luxurious and spring for a $50 bottle from the wine list, always a profit center.
Danny Meyer, an owner of Gramercy Tavern, says the inexpensive part of his restaurant allows the entire business to operate more economically. For example, he serves only the biggest veal chops with the largest fillet running through them on the main dining room's $52 menu. The chops on the end of the loin, which don't meet that standard, are on the less expensive tavern menu. Similarly, scraps and trims that are not included in the most meticulously designed dishes are saved and used in soups and salads. Little is wasted.
"It's a win-win situation for the entire restaurant," he said. "If we could sell enough food and beverage in the tavern, we could in a sense subsidize the luxury menu in the dining room."
Not every restaurant has added a financially gentle on-ramp. If $25 is your limit for a meal (not including
tax, tip and beverages), some restaurants may be impossible to enter. Others may demand clever maneuvering by the customer. Here are some principles to keep in mind:
*Lunches are almost always cheaper than dinners.
*Special deals, like pre-theater meals or Sunday night specials, abound. Restaurants use these deals to attract people during their least busy times, and there is an allure to eating at off-hours, like going to a movie in the middle of a weekday afternoon.
*Attitude is important. Feeling like an outsider is easy if you walk into an expensive restaurant and don't plan to spend a lot of money. But remember, restaurants offer special deals to attract customers. If the staff doesn't make you feel welcome, don't go back, and tell all your friends, too.
Here are 10 of the best meals I have recently found in Manhattan, not including some old favorites, like the $19.95 lunch on Fridays at Montrachet and food at the bar at Union Square Cafe. But menus and special deals change frequently, so you may find your own.
 
Beer Bar
 Met Life Building, 200 Park Avenue, at 45th Street, (212) 818-1333.
Beer Bar at lunchtime is raucous, stylish and exciting, all desirable attributes of a railroad terminal restaurant. Indeed, every few minutes rumbles emerge from underneath the brassy carpeting as trains enter and leave Grand Central Terminal next door. With its Art Deco metallic columns and paneled walls, transportation-theme mural and Bauhaus furniture, Beer Bar, the less-expensive auxiliary of Cafe Centro, seems like a culinary incarnation of the Machine Age, with all its characteristic energy and confidence.
The straightforward food fulfills the promise; nothing is fussy or complicated, just delicious. Like a wonderful roast chicken coated with herbs, the skin crackly, served with creamy garlic mashed potatoes and an arugula salad ($12.50); deliciously tender slices of veal served in a peppery stew with sauteed onions and carrots ($12.50), and a thick, juicy hamburger ($9.95) that comes with fried onions, bacon, crisp french fries and homemade ketchup. Appetizers are superfluous, but desserts are not. A frozen Kahlua parfait, served between two light coconut macaroons ($6.50), is enough to send you floating down to the Metro-North platforms.
After lunch, Beer Bar serves only appetizers, so lunch is the time for a meal. Naturally, there is a terrific beer list.
 
Cub Room Cafe
 183 Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 777-0030.
If Cub Room was intended to be the 90's embodiment of the inner sanctum of the Stork Club, the setting of some of Bette Davis's most memorable lines in "All About Eve," the Cub Room Cafe, its modest adjunct, might be the 90's embodiment of the roadside diner where Davis waited tables in "The Petrified Forest." With its wooden chairs and tables, marble tile floor and a blackboard menu for specials, the stark look is a good match for its big plates of gutsy food.
The cafe menu is large and neatly organized: sandwiches, soups, salads, sides and something called "plates," which turn out to be main courses. Among the appetizers, chicken livers glazed in balsamic vinegar and served with roasted potatoes and sweet beets ($6.95) is a hearty choice, while a classic spinach salad ($5.95) with a warm bacon vinaigrette and chopped hard-cooked eggs is expertly rendered.
Plates include a full-bodied lamb stew ($15.95), fragrant with garlic and rosemary, with cornmeal dumplings in a rich red-wine sauce, and pork pot ($12.95), an Alsatian-style dish of a pan-roasted pork loin served with apples, onions and potatoes in a vinegary broth. A pear-and-ginger crumble, with a scoop of lemon ice cream on top ($5), is a nice way to end the meal.
Smaller meals, like sandwiches (including peanut butter and banana), are offered, and the menu closes with this bit of sage advice: "Don't eat anything bigger than your head." The food is better than the joke.
 
Follonico
 6 West 24th Street, Flatiron district (212) 691-6359.
Midday bustles in the Flatiron district, but entering this wonderful trattoria is like crossing into Rome. Here the lunch menu, simpler and less expensive than at dinner, echoes the simplicity of the dining room's pale yellow walls, paneling, ruddy floor tiles, beamed ceiling and wood-burning stove. A glass of fruity Chianti (like the 1990 Monte Antico, $17 a bottle), combined with the wonderful smells of herbs and fresh bread add sensuous realism to the Italian fantasy.
Appetizers are seemingly commonplace, but each is augmented slightly, like a grilled portobello mushroom in rich white truffle oil ($7.50) or fried calamari, not so unusual until you taste the sharp deep-fried capers and greens ($6.50).
The main courses feel truly Roman. Spaghetti carbonara ($10.50) is elementally perfect, just pasta, cheese, pancetta, egg and butter with a little parsley sprinkled on, none of the cream, onions or peas that ruin so many New York versions. In Follonico's open-faced take on the porchetta, the traditional Roman sandwich, moist slices of richly flavored roast pork come on a slice of grilled bread, which soaks up the juices of the pork ($12). The whole is topped with remarkably flavorful broccoli rape, not at all bitter. Individual pizzas are crisp throughout and excellent ($9.50 to $12).
Desserts like sparkling granitas ($5.50), in flavors like pink grapefruit and orange, or a bountiful plate of biscotti and cookies ($5) make the return trip to New York much easier.
 
Gotham Bar and Grill
 12 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village (212) 620-4020.
The $19.95 lunch at the Gotham is one of the great bargains in town. Just entering the modern, spacious dining room makes you feel like one of Manhattan's chosen people, and the wonder is that getting a table is so easy at lunch.
The meal might begin with a chicken soup nothing like Mom's, made with clear chicken broth full of chunks of chicken and ham with accents of scallion and chervil, or with a creamy, intense carrot soup flavored with dill and pieces of smoked salmon that melt in your mouth. Follow that with one of Alfred Portale's signature vertical renditions, a mound of salmon, crisp around the edges, atop a foundation of tomato softened with richly flavored olive oil. And a choice of showstopper desserts: a flourless chocolate cake, still warm and oozy in the center, with a scoop of peanut butter ice cream, or refreshing sorbets like apple and blood orange.
All told, it's a remarkable opportunity to feel pampered and rich.
 
Gramercy Tavern
 42 East 20th Street, (212) 477-0777.
It's hard to imagine better inexpensive food in a more congenial place than in the tavern portion of Gramercy Tavern, in front of the handsome bar between the entry and the main dining room. With its high, wood-beamed ceiling, informal wood tables and Windsor chairs, open kitchen area, early American sideboard overflowing with seasonal fruit, flowers and herbs, and a colorful Robert Kushner mural, the tavern radiates good will and conviviality, like a wonderful community gathering place that just happens to have great food.
The tavern menu, available only in this part of the restaurant, offers an excellent selection of dishes, with appetizers like slices of portobello mushroom, grilled and served with a balsamic vinaigrette and topped with shavings of Parmesan cheese ($7.50). A glistening roast beet salad with red onion and shredded orange ($5.95), is both sweet and tart.
Main courses are beautifully thought out and presented. A tiny quail is butterflied and grilled and served on a soft bed of polenta. The rich, moist meat is set off nicely by little black olives, and the dish comes with a small green salad ($10.50). Roast loin of pork is a peasant dish, served with sweet-and-sour red cabbage spiked with bits of pancetta and apples ($13). Filet mignon is buttery tender but still beefy, served in a mild vinaigrette on a wondrous pillow of mashed potatoes and caramelized onions ($15).
The tavern menu includes an excellent selection of beers and wines by the glass. Chances are, you'll be offered the opportunity to choose desserts (and a cheese course) from the main dining room's menu, but that may elevate your bill to another level, and besides, the small tavern selection includes two superior desserts ($5 each). The upside-down pear tart is wonderful, like a pear Tatin in very light puff pastry, while oatmeal stout gingerbread is moist and delicious. It's the kind of food that makes you never want to leave.
The tavern menu is served daily from noon to 11 P.M., and since reservations are not available in the tavern area, it pays to go during off hours.
 
Jo Jo
 160 East 64th Street, (212) 223-5656.
Jo Jo, Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Upper East Side town house restaurant, manages to be informal and elegant at the same time. In the downstairs dining room, the floor is pure bistro, made of tiny tiles, but the ceiling is a rich lemon yellow, and the fresh flowers, pretty mirrors on the walls, thick linens and solicitous waitresses make you feel as if you are dressed up without wearing a tie.
Jo Jo's $25 lunch menu is a wonderful introduction to Mr. Vongerichten's light and surprising take on classic French food. The menu, which changes weekly, might include an appetizer of broiled sea scallops served over paper thin slices of gingery pink watermelon radish with a rosemary-scented vinaigrette, an exquisite steamed fillet of red snapper on greens and slices of potato in a peppery curry oil, and a baked pear enclosed in crisp pastry crust, bathed in a hazelnut creme anglaise. Do have coffee (it's included), which comes with a piece de resistance, almonds dusted with bitter chocolate.
 
Mad. 61
 10 East 61st Street, (212) 833-2200.
Downstairs at the Barneys New York uptown is a shopping center of a different kind. Around the perimeter of Mad. 61, the fine restaurant, are counters and displays showing what looks to be the bounty of a prosperous village market: olive oils in myriad shades of green, plentiful cheeses, crusty breads, wines and tempting desserts. From lunch to the beginning of dinner, you can sit at the counter or at one of the marble inlay tables and sample Mad. 61's market menu, an inexpensive way to try some remarkable food.
A simple but wonderful appetizer is a big platter of seasonal vegetables ($7.50), like carrots, yams, pearl onions, brussels sprouts and beets, roasted to the point that they are bursting with sweetness. You might want to try one of the excellent crisp-crusted pizzas, like a margherita ($14), simply pizza with tart, tangy tomato sauce with fresh basil and mellow mozzarella, but I would be hard-pressed to imagine a better, more soothing lunch on a cold day than the creamy, beige veal stew ($15), made with crushed white beans, olive oil, rosemary and generous chunks of tender veal.
The platters of tarts, cakes and cookies are enough of a preview to keep even the slimmest appetites alive for dessert. Plum polenta ($6) is an extraordinarily light cake, sweet but not overbearingly so. Sabbiosa ($6) is a luscious, light spongecake, almost biscuity in texture.
Mad. 61 has an excellent list of wines by the glass, ranging from $5.50 for a fragrant South African pinotage to $17 for a Kistler chardonnay from Sonoma County. You can also get smaller tastes of these wines before floating gently back out to the shopping lanes above.
 
Palio
 151 West 51st Street, (212) 245-4850.
What are we doing in Palio, one of the city's most expensive Italian restaurants? Why, having lunch, of course. Not in the second-floor dining room, but in the bar downstairs, under the towering cobalt-blue trellised ceiling, surrounded by the famous Sandro Chia four-wall mural of the Siena Palio. Just as striking as the mural is the fact that the bar, which bustles with excitement in the evening, is practically empty at lunch. If more people knew of the bar's $20 lunch menu, though, wild Tuscan horses would not keep them away.
The best appetizer at Palio is free, a basket of the restaurant's renowned breadsticks, rich with the flavors of olive oil and cheese, breaking with a perfectly satisfying snap in the mouth. For $20, you get a main course, a side dish of pasta and a salad. A grilled salmon steak, for example, is topped with an intense tapenade and comes with penne in a simple sauce of tomato and basil and a delicious salad of arugula and beets. A chicken breast is marinated in a balsamic vinaigrette, grilled and served with penne in a sumptuous veal reduction and a mixed green salad.
You must order strictly from the bar menu to keep prices down. An innocent request for a side order of polenta resulted in a $15 surcharge without a bat of the waiter's eye. Desserts are another $10 apiece, but then the excellent tiramisu is best split in the middle of the day, anyway.
 
Rainbow Promenade
 General Electric Building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, at 49th Street, (212) 632-5100.
The Rainbow Room is the ultimate big-ticket dinner in New York, a night of dining, dancing and glamour 65 floors above Rockefeller Center. The Rainbow Promenade, the bar adjacent to the Rainbow Room, is a little tip of the big ticket: drinks (but no dancing), and food (though not actually "dining"). Still, there is glamour, or at least enough people in tuxedos and ball gowns to make you feel as if you've crashed somebody's wedding.
While there is an actual bar, most of the space stretching in two directions from the bar is devoted to handsome polished wood cocktail tables with Art Deco inlays. Most seats are near windows, and the view, of course, is stunning. Part of the attraction of skyscraper dining is simply the feeling of solidity, the palpable sense that even up so high, the floor, the walls and the windows are immovable. Such can-do confidence combined with a decidedly non-New York City crowd gives the Rainbow Room a real Middle America feeling.
Cocktails seem in order in this tribute to the cocktail age, and a master mixologist, Dale DeGroff, offers some inspired choices with wink-wink names like Hemingway daiquiri, blood and sand and the ever popular between the sheets (each $8.50). Rainbow Promenade serves "little meals," as the menu puts it, mostly appetizers. Some are quite good, like pastrami-cured salmon ($12), a David Burke creation, served on triangles of pita with onions and scallions and a swath of mayonnaise. Japanese hand rolls ($14), marinated strips of salmon in cones of seaweed, seemed over-priced even at this elevation, and a grilled chicken sandwich ($13.50) was drenched in mayonnaise, making the bread and tomato mushy. But a hamburger ($14) was decent and came with very good french fries.
For dessert, try a pear pithiviers ($7.50), if only for the Sisyphean task of pronouncing "pear pithiviers" after several cocktails. Inevitably, this is the moment when a women will stop at your table to ask if you'd like her to photograph your party.
 
Vodka Bar
 260 West Broadway, at Ericson Place, TriBeCa, (212) 343-0049.
This handsome bar, downstairs from American Renaissance, the striking new TriBeCa restaurant, offers a brief but notable lunch menu and a comfortable port in a storm. Along one wall is a row of marble pedestal tables with fresh orchids, a perfect contrast to their soft, billowy banquettes trimmed with gray-striped pillows that almost invite you to take a nap. Opposite is a curving bar with cobalt-blue lights hanging overhead. Bottles of vodka, some infusing with fruit, others with vegetables, stand ready to assist your journey to somnambulance.
Food is a wake-up call, especially a fresh pea soup with dill ($4) that is a striking chartreuse but tastes like the essence of peas, earthy and wonderful. Not so an arugula salad with mushrooms and shavings of Parmesan cheese ($6) that was so salty it was inedible. Homemade saffron fettuccine with seared shrimp, dill and sun-dried tomatoes ($12) was also salty, but not so much that the flavors of the pasta and the seafood broth could not be enjoyed. Simpler choices are better, like a very good hamburger on a fresh poppy roll ($7), with stacks of potato slices, marinated tomatoes and a wonderful sweet pickle.
Succinctly, desserts are fabulous, and the kitchen seems to enjoy sending out extra ones. You may feel that chocolate souffle, soft and oozy in the center, with caramel ice cream on the side ($7) would be enough for two people. And while we also ordered shredded apples, molded into a tart and baked with a wonderful vanilla center, served with blueberry sauce and cinnamon ice cream ($5), little did we know we would also be receiving a pear tarte Tatin, with raspberry sauce and apple sorbet ($5). By the time you leave, you really will need a nap.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Announcing for President: Old News, but Still News

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Presidential candidates these days stage elaborately choreographed nonannouncements as they seek the maximum fanfare and publicity.
First, they coyly suggest that they might run. Then they announce "exploratory committees." Then they hint even more strongly that they will run. Then, when everyone knows what they have decided, they finally make it official. 
 Take Senator Phil Gramm. The Texas Republican plans to mount the stage at College Station, Tex., on Friday morning for the biggest announcement of his political career. There will be balloons and bunting and foot-stomping partisans.
But they will have gathered to hear Mr. Gramm tell the world something that everyone with a passing interest in politics has known for months, if not years: he is running for President. Already, there are bumper stickers, buttons and stationery. There has even been a televised debate among the Republican competitors.
Still, neither Mr. Gramm, a 52-year-old second-term senator who will be the first Republican to declare his candidacy for the 1996 Presidential nomination, nor his opponents are about to forgo a tradition that dates from when there was genuine suspense over who would run for the Presidency. The only surprises these days are when candidates unexpectedly announce that they will not run, like then-Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's declaration the week before Christmas in 1991 and that of former Vice President Dan Quayle earlier this month.
"Everybody knows you're going to run the foot race but you do have to fire the starting gun," said Alex Castellanos, Mr. Gramm's media adviser. "Some of it is ritual, but it's an opportunity to focus public attention on your campaign and your message."
But Lyn Nofziger, the Republican consultant, said a candidate's time and money could be better spent. "As far as public perception is concerned," he said, "it doesn't amount to a hill of beans."
Mr. Nofziger said that at least he tried for some drama when he scripted Ronald Reagan's announcement challenging President Gerald R. Ford for the nomination in 1976. "Reagan was always careful about not saying he was going to run," he said. "So his announcements had a little bit of meaning."
Oddly enough, as the importance of announcements has diminished, candidates are trying to make them an even bigger deal. Perhaps they are mindful of the adage among politicians: The only time you are assured flattering news coverage is on the day you announce and on Election Night -- assuming you win.
No longer are candidates holding stark events in their hometowns. Mr. Gramm, for one, kicked off his announcement with a fund-raising extravaganza tonight at the Dallas Convention Center here, at which he proclaimed that he was now a "real candidate." Organizers said the event -- billed as the "official announcement dinner" -- raised $4.1 million, a record for one night.
On Friday, his first stop will be the front lawn of the Administration Building at Texas A&M University in College Station, where he taught economics. Then he and his entourage will fly to Columbus, Ga., and deliver a similar address in front of the elementary school where he failed the third grade. Then on to New Hampshire, Iowa and Arizona, where early contests will be held, for more events on Saturday.
By stretching out their announcement tours, candidates try to get more attention from the local press. "When you go to Columbus, Georgia, you're going to get three minutes on the local news in the Atlanta media market, which covers 65 percent of the state," Mr. Castellanos said. "You can't buy that kind of an opportunity to tell folks who you are and what you're for."
Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Gramm campaign, said a candidate's formal declaration also "makes it a little bit easier to get people to write checks."
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, said announcements can be valuable indicators of whether candidates have identified clear themes that will translate well to the public. "The rhetorical moment is important because candidates are essentially saying to the press, 'Judge me by this,' " she said. "And they are telling their loyal constituents, 'This is our message.' "
Ms. Jamieson said candidates who win their party's nomination often have messages that do not change much from their announcement to their acceptance speeches.
"Gerald Ford didn't forecast central themes in his announcement speech that he held to in the primary race against Ronald Reagan," she said. "Then, in the acceptance speech at the convention, he had to restart where he should have been six months before." Mr. Ford lost the election to Jimmy Carter.
This year, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, is trying something more ambitious than his announcements in his hometown of Russell, Kan., when he opened his unsuccessful Presidential campaigns in 1980 and '88. On April 10, Mr. Dole plans to start out in Topeka, where he began his career as a state legislator, and continue with a weeklong announcement trip.
But as far as television viewers are concerned, Mr. Dole began his announcement tour weeks ago. "We'll, I'm going to run. For President. In '96," he declared to David Letterman on the "Late Show."
Asked by the host if this constituted his formal announcement, Mr. Dole quipped, "This was an informal announcement." Little did Mr. Letterman know that the Senator had made a similarly unofficial declaration the previous night -- reaching for an older audience -- in a televised interview with David Frost.
William B. Lacy, Mr. Dole's deputy campaign chairman, said the dribbling out of the Senator's intentions was very calculated. "We had for some time been concerned that if we didn't send clear signals to the activists that he was running," he said, "then they might sign up with other candidates."
The event is even more important for former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is less known than Mr. Dole or Mr. Gramm. He will try to steal some thunder from Mr. Gramm by announcing his candidacy in a three-day swing that begins next Tuesday on the courthouse steps in Maryville, Tenn., where his father first introduced him to a member of Congress when he was in grade school.
Arguably, the last time there was will-he or won't-he suspense leading up to a ceremonial declaration of candidacy was in 1968, when Robert F. Kennedy, after days of public agonizing, rose in the Senate Caucus Room on a Saturday morning and declared to a standing-room-only crowd: "I am announcing today my candidacy for the Presidency of the United States. I do not run for the Presidency merely to oppose any man, but to propose new policies."
The only recent candidate who did not embark on a traditional announcement tour was Ross Perot in 1992; he got more publicity, perhaps, by stating his intentions on the CNN program "Larry King Live."
Mr. Dole joked in an interview that he had told Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who will probably have a much tougher time raising money for his race, that they should try something different: a joint announcement in Russell, Kan., since they both are from there.
He recalled Mr. Specter's replying that he might consider it if the two had a joint fund raiser. Mr. Dole said he told his Pennsylvania rival, "Well, I don't know about that."

HEADLINE: Still the Right Deal for Mexico

 BODY:
The United States' pledge to provide $20 billion in loans and loan guarantees should solve Mexico's immediate financial crisis. Yet the well-crafted agreement completed this week imposes harsh, though necessary, restrictions on Mexico's monetary and fiscal policies. That carries risks for both countries.
The United States could lose money in the unlikely event that Mexico not only defaults on loans but also somehow reneges on its agreement to give Washington first rights to its oil revenues. A bigger risk is political: Mexican politics could turn anti-American when policies promoted by the United States hammer hard at Mexico's already modest living standards. 
 The threats for Mexico are far more grave. Foreign investors could flee, despite international aid, driving the Mexican economy into the ground. Short of that, major banks could fail -- despite provisions in the agreement to address their problem -- as Mexican importers, unable to overcome a shrunken value of the peso, default on their loans. Even if the aid package works, President Ernesto Zedillo will be tied to an economy that almost surely will sink for months, if not years. That is bitter medicine for workers who have waited patiently for the promised benefits of radical market reforms to show up in their paychecks.
Notwithstanding the risks, the Clinton Administration could not have designed a much better package. The United States, along with the International Monetary Fund and other international banks, plans to pump enough dollars into Mexico to assure foreigners that their loans will be repaid. The agreement imposes only restrictions that are needed to stabilize the peso and the economy. In truth, Mexico would have had to adopt the monetary and fiscal restrictions even without pressure from Washington. The constraints mirror I.M.F. restrictions it already accepted. Mexico must adopt policies that welcome foreign investors, and that means stamping out inflation with tight budget and monetary policies.
Mr. Clinton made the deal politically palatable at home by including appropriate conditions. Mexico will pay ample interest on loans, and fees for loan guarantees. Washington will have first claim on revenues from Mexico's exports of oil should it default on the loans. By going around Congress, Mr. Clinton avoided humiliating conditions that some lawmakers wanted to impose, including instructing Mexico how to treat Fidel Castro and what type of monetary institution to adopt in place of its central bank.
President Clinton has responded effectively to prevent an economic crisis next door. The next few years for Mexico will not be easy, but they could have been catastrophic without this agreement.

HEADLINE: 'I'm Spending My Children's Inheritance'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Older Americans Cited in Studies of National Savings Rate Slump" (front page, Feb. 21) is absurd. To indict the elderly for being big spenders and not saving, thereby setting a bad example for the baby boomers, makes no sense whatever. 
 First, spending is good for the economy: it creates jobs and contributes to economic health.
Furthermore, if the elderly are spending their incomes, isn't that a fine example of the recently elevated principle of a balanced budget -- spending real money as it comes in? What are savings for if not a rainy day? And many elderly, as the bumper sticker says ("I'm spending my children's inheritance"), have concluded that it's raining now.
But what you ignore is that the over-50 population controls most of the liquid money assets -- money market funds and certificates of deposit; some estimates say as much as 75 percent, in addition to other securities. Add to that the fact that 75 percent of everyone over age 65 is a homeowner with mostly low or no mortgages, and you have a different overall financial picture.
Many older people don't need to save because they have reserves and are asset-rich. But this is not true for the boomers who, along with their negligible savings, often borrow against pension plans and real estate. At retirement their dubious if not dismal financial picture will be quite different from this generation of the elderly.
Blaming the elderly for consuming entitlements they paid for and characterizing these benefits as society's decision "to let the elderly consume a bigger share of the nation's resources" adds further insult.
Let's not forget that the Government has been using Social Security funds to finance this nation by restricting the Social Security trust investments to only United States Government securities. Had these funds, since 1935, been more broadly invested, the rich Social Security trust would be many times richer today and more viable for the future.
Health care is cited as the main culprit in consumption by the elderly. But at the heart of the problem may be our lack of a system that promotes wellness or that operates efficiently for an aging society.
The prospects for addressing these issues are not promising. The rejection of the initiative offered by Senator Bob Kerrey's commission on entitlement spending to look at aging over the next 30 years has shown that we are not about to engage in any serious long-term planning.

HEADLINE: Last Chance for Many Somalis as U.N. Phases Out

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia, Feb. 24

 BODY:
With the last peacekeeping troops packing their bags, today was the final payday for Somalis who worked for the United Nations at the port and airport of this uneasy capital.
In a devastated economy in which most salaried jobs were with the United Nations, the lines of Somalis waiting to be paid for the last time were among the more vivid reminders of the uncertain future for those who are left behind. 
 As hundreds of Somalis milled around the port gates, scores of others -- men, women and children -- managed to get in without passes, sneaking past the Bangladeshi guards, taking one of their last chances to scavenge United Nations leftovers before any fighting between Somali clans breaks out again.
Many Somalis have set up food stalls near the piers, and young children run after trucks, trying to climb on, yelling, "Americans! Americans!" Many try to hide and spend the night in the port area, when it is easier to scavenge, United Nations peacekeepers say.
Hundreds of Pakistani soldiers with the United Nations force continued to board chartered planes today, leaving about 4,000 peacekeepers. At the port, which is expected to close to commercial traffic on Sunday in preparation for the final pullout, the last ships are loading the remaining United Nations equipment.
And a vast American-led international force of 23 ships lies offshore waiting to assist in the withdrawal in what military officials say is a limited mission with only peaceful objectives. The United Nations operation succeeded the United States-led mission that came here in December 1992 to save this East African country from the ravages of war and famine.
For the Bangladeshi soldiers who guard the Mogadishu port, removing the Somalis without passes is a job that is repeated several times a day.
"There is always a rush every day as everyone is trying to sneak in and get some money," said Col. Nur ul-Islam, the commander of the Bangladeshi battalion. "About 50 percent of them sleep here at night. It will be difficult but not impossible to close the port."
So far only about 50 American troops are on the ground here, preparing for the arrival of another 2,000 who will move in to make sure the pullout goes smoothly. The port and airport areas are critical to Mogadishu's warring clans because they will be the main entrance points for fuel and weapons shipments.
Senior military officials and Western diplomats say the clans will fight for the area, but they are optimistic that the fighting will not begin until after the American troops leave. Senior United Nations officials say they believe that the factions have relatively few weapons.
"The price of ammunition has risen very sharply, and now they will have to think twice before firing one bullet," said Victor Gbeho, the United Nations representative in Somalia.
But American military intelligence reports indicate that the two main warring clans, in particular the forces of Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, are moving their armored cars near both the port and airport.
There has been sporadic fighting in some neighborhoods even as both Mr. Aidid and his main rival, Ali Mahdi Mohammed, have sent messages to the United States special envoy, Daniel H. Simpson, expressing willingness to cooperate with the withdrawal. Mr. Simpson is not in Somalia but remains in touch with all sides.
While trying to insure a peaceful pullout, the American military is also preparing for the worst: a clan-based attack aimed at its own troops or a spillover from fighting between Somali factions.
Though agreements have been signed between Somali leaders, previous accords have not been observed. Mogadishu's political atmosphere is highly charged; subclan allegiances constantly shift and armed bandits can be hired for $50 a day, a senior American officer said.
On Saturday, American and Italian forces and the United Nations troops will go over the entire withdrawal operation step by step, rehearsing each move down to the level of company commander. And then Lieut. Gen. Anthony Zinni of the American Marines, commander of the international operation, is to walk through the area his marines will control, including the beach where they are expected to land.
Aboard the ships, soldiers and marines are preparing, spraying their uniforms with insect repellant, some filling their battle jackets with grenades, others practicing with what the Pentagon calls "less lethal weapons," like rubber and wood pellets, pepper spray and sticky foam.
The nontoxic foam can immobilize attackers, gluing them to the ground and to themselves. It cannot be washed off with soap or water, but requires special solvents.
Some marines going ashore in a few days have already been to Somalia, veterans of the first American landing in 1992 and of the operation that followed.
Cpl. Shane S. Borba, 24, of Fresno, Calif., was in Somalia from April to August 1993, during the hunt for Mr. Aidid, the American bombings of the faction leader's headquarters and large demonstrations against the United Nations. He is part of the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit.
"The marines here ask me what to expect," Corporal Borba said. "I tell them, don't expect a full-blown-out war. It's a mindset. Don't go in there thinking everyone is your enemy.
"I tell them the Somalis are here near them because they want a handout -- 'Give me water, give me food,' they always say.
"Watch out for crowds. The Somalis can go from being your friends one moment to throwing rocks the next. I have nothing against them. They are very inquisitive; they want to know what is going on. I saw so many people caught in the middle of a firefight not meant for them. I saw the horror Somalis live in."

HEADLINE: A Building Boom Transforms the Phoenix Desert

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PHOENIX

 BODY:
A happy man, Fred Keene stood beside his yellow bulldozer the other day as it idled among the century-old saguaro cactuses of the Sonora Desert and said, "Busy, busy, busy."
"I'm working nonstop," he added. "I've turned down work. Just turned down a job Monday night -- no time to do it." 
 Mr. Keene and the Caterpillar D-9H bulldozer he bought a year ago are part of a building boom that is gobbling up the desert around Phoenix at the rate of an acre an hour. Wide swaths of homes and shops are spreading outward from the city where only cactus, jack rabbits and rattlesnakes had been before.
"In a year this will all be houses," said Mr. Keene, standing in the afternoon sun on a development site zoned for 4,500 homes. Only a new two-lane blacktop road now cuts into the desert on the eastern edge of the city, its concrete curb sides neatly finished and already marked with speed-limit signs.
Phoenix, one of the nation's fastest-growing cities, is expanding so rapidly that it can barely find enough construction workers to do the job. Builders are raising wages as they bid for one another's skilled craftsmen, and the average time it takes to complete a typical house has increased from about three months to more than five months.
"It's causing the contractor to pay far more today for the same guy that he was complaining about yesterday not knowing a hammer from a screwdriver," said David Wilkinson, an official of the local branch of Associated Builders and Contractors, an industry group based in Rosslyn, Va. "They're desperate."
They are so desperate that the top 10 contractors in Arizona spent an average of $14,000 each over the last three months on national advertising to attract workers, particularly electricians, welders, pipe fitters, masons, roofers and carpenters.
Skilled workers are in short supply almost everywhere, particularly in parts of the South and the Midwest, even though new home construction has cooled because of rising interest rates, said Charlie Hawkins, executive vice president of Associated Builders and Contractors.
But few areas are building as fast as metropolitan Phoenix, which has 2.4 million people, 400,000 more than in 1990. Arizona continues to attract many new residents and businesses from California, by cutting its taxes and keeping its regulations simple.
Critics of the pell-mell development warn of growing congestion and air pollution, rising crime and a strain on public services, but they are greatly outnumbered in the city government.
The boom extends to commercial construction, including a burgeoning computer-chip industry clustered along the edges of freeways in almost every direction, Mr. Wilkinson said. In downtown Phoenix, construction includes a science museum, an art museum, a museum of history, a new library and a new home for the city's largest daily, The Arizona Republic.
Housing permits in the Phoenix area for detached single-family houses rose from 21,896 in 1993 to 26,614 last year, the highest since its record of about 28,000 permits in 1978, said Jay Q. Butler, an analyst at the Arizona Real Estate Center.
At the same time, said RL Brown, publisher of The Phoenix Housing Market Letter, 1994 was a record year in home resales, up 20 percent from the year before, to approximately 52,000.
"Combine the two numbers and you've got a total housing velocity in this marketplace that is something staggering," he said.
The quality of construction has suffered somewhat, several analysts said, and some homes are even being turned over to buyers with interior details unfinished.
Like other opponents of unfettered growth, City Councilwoman Frances Emma Barwood warns of a degradation of the quality of life, and of the cost to the entire city of providing outlying areas with water, electricity, and police and fire protection.
She said the problems ranged from the obvious -- providing enough electricity to run hundreds of thousands of air-conditioners in this sun-baked city, where the normal temperature in July is 105 degrees -- to the hidden and unexpected. As the surface of the desert is scraped away, she said, vast underground populations of termites are being disturbed and have begun to devour the new homes that replace the desert vegetation.
"My concern is, What do we want to look like 15, 20 years from now?" Ms. Barwood said. "Do we want to be like any other city, a sea of rooftops, or do we want to have that last little bit of desert?"
But when she proposed a measure to slow construction, the City Council rejected it by a 7-to-1 vote. "It's kind of hard," she said. "I knew I didn't have the votes, but I just didn't realize I didn't have any votes."
At a heated five-hour public meeting of the Maricopa County Planning and Zoning Commission, hundreds of residents opposed a new planned community called the Villages at Desert Hills, 33 miles north of downtown Phoenix. The $2 billion project, by the Del Webb Corporation, a major developer, would carve 5,661 acres out of the desert to build 16,500 homes. These opponents lost too, and the plan will go before the county's Board of Supervisors for final approval in March.
Stanley Cook watches all of this activity from a unique perspective, and he finds it exhilarating. He is the manager of housing studies for Landiscor, a photographic mapping company, and he studies aerial photographs of the city every 90 days and charts its growth, lot by lot, house by house.
For every house that rises, hundreds of businessmen profit as the city's economy expands. Among them is Mr. Cook, who sells his photographs to various developers.
His composite maps, with their precise, sharp detail, portray the steady progress of Mr. Keene's bulldozer, and others like it, as they scrape away the cactuses in an ever lengthening radius. Skirting Indian reservations and national park land, they progress from one development to the next, leaving houses, banks, pharmacies, pet stores, video outlets and Chinese restaurants -- human civilization -- in their wake.
"It's feeding on itself," said Mr. Cook, another happy man. "We are not going to be able to stop growing."

The Economy
What's so great about a sluggish economy? Wall Street has been celebrating an apparent slowdown, sending stocks to record highs. While such a rally may seem perverse, there are sound reasons for welcoming a breather from a four-year-old economic expansion. Analysts hope slower growth will buy time for companies to train more workers, smooth out the production pipeline and add the capability to turn out a greater supply of goods and services. Economic Analysis. [Page 1.]
 
Factory orders for durable goods rose six-tenths of 1 percent in January, suggesting that the economy may not be slowing as the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, has suggested. It was the third consecutive monthly gain. [37.] 

A building boom is gobbling up the desert around Phoenix at the rate of an acre an hour. The city is expanding so rapidly that it can barely find enough construction workers to do the job. [6.]

Companies
 
A possible setback for Rupert Murdoch emerged. A top F.C.C. official said he did not know in 1985 that the News Corporation, the Australian company controlled by Mr. Murdoch, would own 99 percent of the equity in six TV stations that Mr. Murdoch acquired that year. The statement provides new evidence that Mr. Murdoch may have misled the Federal Communications Commission. [37.]
 
The Hanover Sterling brokerage firm shut down, and stocks brought public by the New York firm plunged. The firm is best known for bringing to market a company begun by Lawrence Taylor, the former linebacker for the New York Giants. [37.]
 
Westinghouse Electric signed an accord to sell China steam turbine and generating equipment. The deal marks the first time since 1989 that an American company has been allowed to sell high-technology components for a Chinese nuclear plant. [39.]
The F.A.A. commended USAir for its safety efforts. [6.]
 
International
 
China is trying to build its own commercial-aircraft industry. The goal of its big push is to compete for aircraft sales throughout Asia. And China is relying on the technical and manufacturing expertise of Western companies including Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus Industrie to do it. [37.]
 
Germany is confronting its first big strike in 11 years. The country's most powerful union, IG Metall, sought to shut down 22 companies and plants in the rich southern state of Bavaria. [37.]
 
The United States and Canada agreed to end restrictions on air travel between the countries in a broad aviation treaty. [1.]
 
Markets
 
The Dow extended its advance beyond 4,000, rising 8.41 points, to 4,011.74. Food and beverage stocks led the ascent. [38.]
 
Treasury prices were mixed after the durable goods report showed signs of continued robust economic growth. [38.]
 
The dollar weakened as the German mark continued to draw strength from declines in other European currencies. [46.]
 
Gold and other precious metal prices tumbled. Crude oil prices rebounded, and coffee prices surged. [46.]
 
Your Money
 
An end to rising interest rates would help investors. If the Federal Reserve has indeed changed its policy, it may be an opportune time to consider buying high-quality intermediate-term debt securities with maturities from 3 to 10 years or investing in foreign stock markets. But betting on the Fed should not be the main factor in forming an investment strategy. [35.]
 
The Israeli stock market has failed to reflect the strength of the country's economy. Israel has built a powerful export-driven economy that is increasingly independent of the Middle East, but analysts wonder when its stock market will turn around. [35.]

HEADLINE: House Votes to Freeze Regulations as Democrats Fail to Gain Health and Safety Exemptions

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The House of Representatives voted today to freeze most new Federal regulations for the rest of the year, with Republicans and Democrats arguing to the debate's bitter end over whether the proposal would endanger the public.
The vote was 276 to 146, as many Democrats ultimately joined to support a bill that President Clinton has threatened to veto if the Senate passes it, saying it would "cost lives." The outlook for the legislation in the Senate is uncertain. 
 Democrats were repeatedly voted down as they tried to exempt specific health and safety rules from the bill. Representative Tom DeLay, the Republican whip from Texas and the bill's senior author, said the amendments were aimed at "frightening women and children and the elderly."
The bill includes an exemption for emergency health and safety rules. But it is far from certain how many regulations could pass through that loophole.
Thousands of regulations are issued every year to carry out laws that Congress has already passed. But the new Republican majority in Congress wants the regulatory moratorium in place while it considers whether to rewrite the underlying laws governing the process of issuing rules.
The bill approved today is one part of a broad anti-regulatory offensive being mounted by Congressional Republicans. On Monday the House is to consider a bill that would replace health considerations with economic calculations as the deciding factor in writing rules to carry out many of the nation's existing environmental laws. Later in the week, the House will consider a bill to reimburse landowners if their property declines in value because the Federal government restricts how it may be developed.
The regulations most likely to be delayed under the regulatory moratorium are those issued by agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. But the bill exempts many of the regulations that lubricate the wheels of commerce, like licenses, deposit insurance and trade rules.
Democrats argued that rules to protect public health, safety and the environment should not be delayed, that some regulations beneficial to industry or to state and local governments would be caught up in the delay, and that the legislation was written so broadly that it could entangle urgent rules in litigation.
But almost every time the Democrats offered amendments to exempt health, safety or environmental rules from the bill, Republicans countered that the legislation provided leeway for the Administration to impose regulations whenever there was an "imminent threat."
"We have fully protected health and safety," said David M. McIntosh, a freshman Republican from Indiana who headed the effort to reduce Federal regulations during the Bush Administration. "This bill will allow the Administration to take any precaution necessary to protect health and safety."
But after two days of debate, the dispute lingered over whether the language permitting health and safety regulations was as lenient as its supporters claimed.
For example, although Republicans insisted that the Agriculture Department could proceed with new rules on meat inspection despite the legislation, the department's top officials disputed that, as did representatives of the meat industry.
And although Republicans said that E.P.A. rules requiring cities to check for the parasite cryptosporidium in drinking water supplies could go ahead, the agency said it did not believe the rules could be proved to head off an imminent threat.
"Although its sponsors say it would exempt public health emergencies, the exemption only applies to situations that are immediately life-threatening," said Carol M. Browner, head of the agency. "We couldn't take action on long-term health risks such as cancer. We'd have to stop rules to control dioxin from incinerators, lead poisoning and bacterial contamination of drinking water."
Democrats did succeed in getting a specific exemption for aviation safety rules, but it was done in an unusual way. After the bill was approved, Democrats worked out a deal with ranking Republicans to write a clarifying technical amendment into the bill.
That means, for example, that the Federal Aviation Administration will be able to follow through on its plan to tighten the safety rules governing commuter airlines to make them equivalent to standards imposed on major airlines. The rules will not be held up, even though it would be difficult for the agency to prove that there is any "imminent" danger of commuter airplanes crashing under existing rules.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said that many of its rules, like those to protect workers from crippling injuries from repetitive motions, would not be covered because the injuries are not considered "imminent."
These injuries are a rapidly growing source of claims for workers compensation. But the Republicans said that the new rules were not so urgent that they should go forward.
Republicans said that the bill leaves in the hands of a White House official -- Sally Katzen, the director of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs -- the determination of whether a rule addresses an imminent threat to safety.
But Administration lawyers said they expected to face lawsuits from affected industries if they attempted to push through many rules using the safety loophole.
 
 
 
THE BILL AT A GLANCE
Regulatory Freeze
 BILL The Regulatory Transition Act of 1995 (H.R. 450)
 
 HIGHLIGHTS Establishes a moratorium on rulemaking by most Federal agencies between Nov. 20, 1994, and Dec. 31, 1995. The moratorium would be lifted earlier if comprehensive regulatory reforms are enacted. Emergency health and safety rules, criminal law-enforcement regulations, and many rules favored by businesses would be exempted.
 
 POLITICS Strongly favored by many business groups but opposed by labor and environmentalists, the rule is part of a broad assault on
Federal regulatory powers being pushed through the House of Representatives by
the Republicans, with some Democratic support.
 
 COST Businesses spend hundreds of billions of dollars each year to comply with Federal regulations, but there is no estimate of the savings due to a temporary reduction in new rules.
 
 STATUS
 
 House Passed on Friday.
 
 Senate Similar bill has been introduced.
 
 White House Calls the bill "unacceptable."

HEADLINE: Clinton, in Canada, Attacks G.O.P. on Domestic Politics

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Feb. 24

 BODY:
President Clinton opened a broad-based assault here today on the Republican-led campaign against big government. He called the balanced-budget amendment a bad idea, denounced the party's attacks on affirmative action and said deep cuts in current Federal spending amounted to a war on children.
Turning to domestic politics at a news conference that was supposed to wrap up a meeting with Canadian leaders, Mr. Clinton accused Republicans of trying to divide voters along racial lines. He painted the spending cuts they have proposed as "radical right-wing measures," while back in Washington his lieutenants labeled the balanced-budget amendment "horrendous economic policy" that could deepen a recession by limiting the Government's ability to mitigate it with increased spending. 
 The President's offensive at a news conference in Parliament seemed intended to buck up wavering Democrats as the battle over the balanced-budget amendment headed for a showdown vote in the Senate next Tuesday and as the debate over affirmative action turns fierce.
But Mr. Clinton also had to bow to the realities of politics in 1995 by conceding that the White House had been forced to begin its own review of programs aimed at opening jobs and other opportunities to minorities to decide which should be defended and which might be scrapped.
"Unless I miss my guess, a bill doesn't become law until I sign it or it passes over my veto," he declared. To a reporter who suggested that his Presidency had become more form than substance, he shot back, "I don't consider myself a titular head of state, and until there is some evidence to the contrary, you shouldn't either."
Mr. Clinton's counterassault, coming a day after two Democratic Senators threw their lot behind the balanced-budget amendment and brought support close to the 67 votes necessary for its passage, was marked by unusual vigor.
Among the points on which he objected more bluntly than ever before was what he called the "astonishing" prospect that the Republican-backed measure would lead to the Federal courts' reviewing budget decisions. That concern was also expressed by Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is widely believed to be the last vote needed for passage, and Republicans were discussing today whether to accommodate Mr. Nunn's request for a clause that would eliminate any role for the courts in deciding Federal budget issues.
The President also directed his top deputies to fight back against the balanced-budget measure in television appearances and from the White House, and aides said he would wage the battle through the weekend with a Saturday morning radio address and telephone calls to undecided or wavering senators.
Sketching a vision of a stingy Republican future, Mr. Clinton seized on proposals, now emerging from House committees, to pare up to $17 billion from the current budget. He said he regarded the Republican-backed efforts to scrap the national school lunch program and otherwise allow states to decide how to spend Federal money on social welfare programs as representing a war on children.
"I do not think the American people expect or support these radical right-wing measures that are coming out of these House committees," the President said. Expressing his hope that the Senate would serve as a brake on the Republican juggernaut, he declared, "We've got a constitutional system, and we've got a chance to see it work."
Asked about a report, first published today in The Washington Post, that he had ordered a review of the Administration's support for affirmative action programs, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that he had done so but said the step did not amount to an abandonment of efforts to give the disadvantaged "a leg up."
He pointed to the armed forces as an example of an institution made better and more representative by affirmative action programs. "In education, training, leadership, development, the military is a model," he said. "It looks like America, and it works."
But the President acknowledged that Republican complaints had put pressure on his Administration to decide how willing it was to defend programs whose utility might be outlived. He said he was determined to prevent the debate over affirmative action "from becoming another cheap, political, emotional wedge issue," but he said he recognized that the White House needed to think anew about "what our obligations are to make sure every American has a chance to make it."
"We shouldn't be defending things that we can't defend," he said. "So it's time to review it, discuss it and be straightforward about it."
Mr. Clinton has long made clear his reservations about a balanced-budget amendment, the current version of which would require the Federal Government to balance its books by the year 2002. In 1994 the White House battled vigorously to prevent a similar measure from winning passage.
But after the Republicans took control of Congress in November, the President began to mute his complaints, and as the House rushed to approve the measure by a vote of 300 to 132 last month, he and his aides waged only a quiet fight against it.
Even today, Mr. Clinton stopped shy of using absolutist terms to denounce the measure. His aides said the approach reflected an understanding that his power of the veto is impotent against the proposed constitutional amendment; it will take effect if it is approved by a two-thirds vote in the Senate and ratified by 38 states.
But as Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and other top officials, including Alice M. Rivlin, director of the Office of Management and Budget, joined forces at the White House this morning to attack the proposal, Mr. Clinton's aides said he had decided to turn to a more vocal campaign as the measure nears its denouement in the Senate.
Gene Sperling, Mr. Clinton's deputy assistant for economic policy, said the President had concluded that "there was a special force in people seeing how economically dangerous the entire economic team believed a balanced budget to be."

HEADLINE: Mideast Peace Effort on Hold

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Suddenly, there seem to be nothing but speed bumps on the road to Middle East peace. Big speed bumps at that.
Israel's peace talks with Syria have been in hibernation for months, and by extension that means no progress is possible between the Israelis and the Syrians' client government in Lebanon. 
 With Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, negotiations on expanding Palestinian self-rule are an exercise in wheel-spinning.
Perhaps worse, the two sides have reverted to behavior patterns that were supposed to have been broken with The Handshake at the White House in September 1993. Israel keeps jabbing its finger in the Palestinians' chest, telling them what to do, especially on security. This week, the P.L.O. responded just as it used to do: running around complaining what bullies the Israelis are, and asking the world to intervene, instead of straightening out differences face to face.
As a worrisome sideshow, a battle over this country's presumed nuclear arsenal has caused relations to deteriorate with Egypt, the first Arab state to make peace with the Israelis. On every front, there has been no real movement for so long that taking the pulse brings reminders of an old Groucho Marx line: Either my watch is broken or this patient is dead.
The situation is hardly so serious, Israeli officials say, playing down talk of a crisis and pointing up positive developments like the recent peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, still on track. Negotiations, they say, are in a trough, not a grave.
Still, no one here denies that the situation is discouraging. The reasons differ on each major front, but they are also tied together.
Syria, for example, followed Egypt's lead this week, citing Israel's nuclear program as the reason talks are deadlocked. That is apparently a facade. President Hafez al-Assad of Syria simply seems uninterested in a quick deal, and maybe Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel feels he can bide his time as well.
The basic elements of a bargain have long been evident: If Syria agrees to full peace, Israel will return the strategic Golan Heights that it captured from the Syrians in the 1967 Middle East war. Now, after more than three years of talks, the Israelis say they are not sure that getting the heights back is Mr. Assad's top priority.
Perhaps, they say, he cares more about consolidating his hold on Lebanon and about persuading the United States to come up first with inducements for peace: money or removal of Syria from its lists of states that sponsor terror and traffick in drugs.
But given current realities in Washington, he seems unlikely to get much of anything. As some officials here see it, Mr. Assad may have concluded that he would do better to wait. Buying time would also let him see what happens on the Israel-P.L.O. front. If that keeps going badly, the reasoning goes, Israel might well turn to Syria in mild desperation, and that would give Mr. Assad a stronger hand.
Since they have said they are ready to give up just about all of the Golan (probably indeed all, though they will not say so publicly), the Israelis are plainly exasperated.
"I can't understand the Syrians," a senior official said. "Don't they want the Golan Heights? Don't they understand our signals?"
Israel's frustration also extends to the United States, for not doing a lot more to push the old enemies toward one another. Without American activism, nothing will happen, warn Israeli officials, some of whom single out Secretary of State Warren Christopher as having been too passive. Health permitting, Mr. Christopher is supposed to visit the Middle East in early March, his first trip here in three months.
On the P.L.O. front, it is Mr. Rabin who seems in no hurry.
Enthusiasm for the 1993 arrangements outlining the stages of Palestinian self-government has faded among both Israelis and Palestinians. But Mr. Rabin in particular looks lately like a man who wishes he never got involved in this in the first place. He is reluctant to forge ahead until he is persuaded that Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. leader, is serious about cracking down on anti-Israel terrorists in areas now under his control, the Gaza Strip and Jericho, on the West Bank.
In the next stage, Palestinian authority is supposed to be expanded throughout the West Bank. As defined in the 1993 agreement, that means Palestinian elections and a companion redeployment of Israeli soldiers.
Before 21 Israelis were killed last month, the latest casualties in a series of Islamic suicide bombings, the shape of an agreement was emerging. Israel would withdraw from Arab cities and towns in the West Bank, but on a staggered basis -- fully in some places, partially in others and not at all in yet others. A likely candidate for the last category is Hebron, where Jews and Arabs live together explosively one year, as of Saturday, after the massacre of 29 Palestinians by an Israeli settler.
But overshadowing the negotiations are the bombs and a long border closing by Israel that is strangling the fragile Palestinian economy in Gaza and the West Bank. And so the core issues -- elections and redeployment -- are not being worked out at all.
Mr. Arafat now demands that Israel stop stalling and start pulling out its forces. He will accept a gradual withdrawal but wants a timetable, he says. Mr. Rabin is not budging, however. First combat terrorism, he says, though his standard for success is fuzzy because even he acknowledges that no one can stop every fanatic with a pack of dynamite.
With no real progress, mutual charges of bad-faith bargaining have grown increasingly loud. They are dismal echoes of the bad old days, pre-Handshake, when Israel and the Palestinians fought endlessly over which one was the bigger victim instead of trying to figure out how to live side by side.
But significantly, no one has walked off in a huff, saying peace talks have gone as far as they can go. Far from it, in fact. Both Mr. Arafat and Mr. Rabin have invested so much in the negotiations, commentators on both sides say, that it may be impossible for them to stop now without suffering perhaps fatal political blows.
A big problem, some here say, is that The Handshake and the euphoria surrounding it were overblown by the politicians as a new dawn. When imbedded enmities did not vanish, disappointment over inevitable reversals came harder than might have been the case with a softer sell.
In this view, patience is the key.
Yaron Ezrahi, a political theorist at Hebrew University, is reminded of the so-called "war of attrition" -- grinding and costly battles between Israel and Egypt in the late 1960's. Israel and the Palestinians, Professor Ezrahi says, are locked into "a peace of attrition," which may take its time and not always follow a straight path.
"It's going to move in zigs and zags for many years," he said. "There will be small conflicts and setbacks. But nobody has the power to stop the peace process and face the alternatives."

HEADLINE: Why Wall St. Cheers as Economy Slips

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Wall Street investors broke out the champagne this week, celebrating what appeared to be an economic slowdown by setting new records in the stock market. But what's so great about a sluggish economy? And doesn't this mean a recession is just over the horizon?
Perhaps, but not necessarily. In fact, the overwhelming advantage of a slowdown now would be to bolster sharply the odds of sustaining America's four-year-old economic expansion for at least another couple of years or so. "The biggest risk," said Edward Hyman, chief economist of the International Strategy and Investment Group, "is if the economy doesn't slow down." 
 After last year's growth spurt of about 4.5 percent -- the fastest advance in a decade for the American economy -- signs of wear and tear are starting to show up across the country. While both California and the Northeast remain relatively sluggish, labor shortages are developing in scattered locations across the country; borrowing by business and consumers is up sharply; bottlenecks are emerging in several industries, and the prices of some raw materials are soaring.
Another year of such rapid growth would probably cause real strains in the industrial heartland from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast.
But there would be risks to any slowdown, too. Whenever growth slows substantially, almost any unexpected shock -- like the 1991 Persian Gulf war -- can be enough to tip a sluggish economy into recession.
Indeed, 7 of the 13 significant slowdowns since the Korean War led directly to recessions, in which economic activity actually declined, according to a report by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a New York investment firm. The six other slowdowns, however, were followed by further periods of growth that extended the expansion by a year or more.
It is not yet clear whether the recent signs of sluggishness will turn into the extended slowdown many experts now expect. And if they do, no one knows whether such a slowdown would be followed by a recession or by a resurgence of growth.
But there are sound reasons for the widespread belief on Wall Street that the economic expansion may be headed for a welcome breather rather than its last gasp. For one thing, inflation is still regarded as very well behaved. That means that the Federal Reserve does not need to worry about prices spiraling up and out of control and that it could stop raising interest rates as soon as it is convinced that growth has slowed, allowing the economy to take off again next year.
That is why investors were so relieved -- sending the Dow Jones industrial average to a record 4,011.74 yesterday -- after Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, suggested on Wednesday that the central bank might be near the end of its yearlong series of rate increases and was even prepared to cut rates if necessary.
Without a slowdown, the Fed would be forced to push interest rates up to such painfully high levels that they would almost certainly bring on a recession.
So analysts are hoping that slower growth will buy time for companies to train more workers, smooth out the production pipeline and add the capability to turn out a greater supply of goods and services. The breather, if that is what it turns out to be, should also make it easier for consumers to pay for past purchases and develop an appetite for more.
"That's the long and short of why people are rooting for a slowdown," Mr. Hyman said.
Still, even when slowdowns do not end badly, the experience can be uncomfortable for a lot of people. Growth of 1 or 2 percent, while not as painful as a recessionary decline in economic output, usually leads to at least a slight rise in unemployment. Fewer new jobs are available. Makers of big-ticket items -- homes, cars, personal computers and the like -- often suffer a painful squeeze on profits.
By contrast, last year's boom lifted the spirits of consumers, inspired business with renewed confidence to invest, cut the jobless rate from 6.4 percent to 5.4 percent and put more than three million additional people to work.
Growth by leaps and bounds early in a recovery when unemployment is high and idle resources abound can be glorious for almost everybody. But when it happens well into an economic expansion -- as it did last year -- rapid growth can be too much of a good thing, producing unwelcome side effects.
That is why a successful slowdown -- often referred to on Wall Street as a "soft landing" -- can bestow real benefits by curing many problems created by an overheated economy.
The same strong factory operating rates that mean higher profits for business and the low unemployment that leads to higher incomes for workers can also create shortages of materials and strains on company finances. At worst, they push prices and wages up much faster than productivity is advancing, sowing the seeds of future inflation. Some optimists say they think the economy's capacity to grow has improved substantially in recent years, making it possible to expand over time faster than the 2.5 to 3 percent rate that the White House and most forecasters consider sustainable. But it is not just bond traders and the Federal Reserve's fears of higher inflation that stand in the way of year-in-year-out growth of 4 to 5 percent.
The ability of the economy to churn out goods and services is limited by two unavoidable governors: its labor force and its productivity. America's labor force is growing about 1 percent a year. And the average output of workers is growing a little faster, perhaps by an average of 1.5 percent or slightly more. So once the nation is fully employing most eligible workers and other valuable economic resources, its cruising speed is nowhere near last year's 4.5 percent growth rate.
"You can't grow forever at a rate twice as fast as the potential to produce is expanding," said Joel Prakken, an economist at L. H. Meyer & Associates in St. Louis.
Once the economy slows, however, it is difficult to predict whether the next move will be up or down. In the middle of the 1980's expansion, for example, growth came to a virtual standstill in 1985 and 1986. The Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates from the beginning of 1983 to the middle of 1984, stopped tightening and actually began to ease slightly. The stock market crash notwithstanding, 1987 and 1988 turned out to be boom years.
By contrast, consider how the growth of the late 1970's expansion came to an abrupt end. After a growth spurt in 1979, the Fed tightened credit and the economy slowed sharply. But inflation continued to rise rapidly and the Fed was forced to keep tightening, sending the economy into a deep recession.
Many forecasters are now betting that 1995 is more like 1986 than 1980.
"We can potentially have a situation like the mid-1980's," said Frederic Mishkin, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. "If growth slows and we don't get more inflation, the payoff could be a longer expansion." Such an outcome, he added, was "the holy grail of monetary policy."
So is the hoped-for slowdown at hand? Despite Mr. Greenspan's encouraging words, the evidence remains maddeningly ambiguous.
"I happen to think the economy is slowing, and obviously the markets are acting like it's slowing," Mr. Hyman said. "But that view is still largely a leap of faith."

HEADLINE: U.S.-Canada Pact Ends Restrictions on Air Travel

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The United States and Canada, after years of expanding trade, agreed today to open up their skies under a broad aviation agreement that will allow their airlines to fly any routes between the two countries.
The accord, the centerpiece of President Clinton's second and final day in Ottawa, is expected to expand passenger and cargo services significantly, generate even more business between the two countries and lead to lower fares. 
 "The only bad news is for those of you with frequent-flier accounts," the President told a breakfast of business leaders. "It means you'll earn fewer miles because it will be so much easier and quicker to get back and forth."
After many tries, the two countries finally phased out a restrictive agreement that governed air service for nearly three decades. The new pact, believed to be unique in the world, lets market demand, not government regulation, determine the number and destination of flights between the countries.
Normally, governments spend months and years negotiating specific routes on a strictly reciprocal basis. Now this laborious process has been eliminated by Canada and the United States.
Consumers will benefit not only from lower fares but a halving of travel time on many routes.
The accord, which is effective immediately, was signed in the ornate Reading Room of the House of Commons by Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena and the Canadian Transport Minister, Douglas Young, with Mr. Clinton and Prime Minister Jean Chretien looking on.
The meeting, in which the leaders discussed global economic and political issues as well as a host of bilateral issues, went unusually smoothly, aides to both said.
This was Mr. Clinton's first state visit to Canada, and Mr. Chretien has not yet been to Washington. The coolness of the relationship to date largely reflected Mr. Chretien's desire to distance himself from his predecessor, Brian Mulroney, who prided himself on his closeness to President Reagan and President Bush. But it also reflected Mr. Clinton's preoccupation with his own domestic agenda.
Mr. Chretien jokingly conceded in a joint news conference that he is now on a first name basis with the President. "When we're alone, I don't call him William J.," the Prime Minister said. "I call him Bill."
Mr. Clinton said he would be "honored" to put bait on Mr. Chretien's fishing pole, a reference to Mr. Chretien's often-quoted comment that he never liked to go fishing with American Presidents, as Mr. Mulroney had done frequently, because "you end up looking like the fish."
The two leaders expressed particular satisfaction with their open skies agreement, which covers the largest bilateral aviation market in the world. Despite the constraints of the old agreement, 13 million people traveled across the border on commercial flights in 1993.
The new accord gives Canada's airlines immediate access to all points in the United States. American carriers, which now control 70 percent of the cross-border market, would gain similar access after a three-year phase-in.
Most Canadian traffic is at three hubs -- Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Because more American carriers want to serve the three hubs than the phase-in rules allow, the Department of Transportation must allocate flights.
Under the phase-in, the United States can add two airlines at Toronto in each of the next two years and four more in the third year; at Vancouver and Montreal, it can add six airlines in each of the next two years. Fourteen United States airlines have already applied for new routes to Canada.
Air Canada, the country's largest airline, announced it was planning 20 new routes between Canadian and United States cities in the next 18 months. It also said it would begin new daily flights between Ottawa and Washington, Montreal and Washington, and Toronto and Atlanta within 60 days, and it plans to expand its Toronto-New York service into an hourly shuttle.
Usually a route-allocation process starts only after an air agreement is signed. This time it began about six weeks ago and, according to Richard I. Mintz, public affairs director at the Transportation Department, the first route allocations will be announced on Monday. The reason for the speedup is to prevent Canadian carriers from getting a competitive head start.
"Aviation's Berlin Wall" is being removed, said a group known as United States Airports for Better International Air Service (USA-BIAS), representing 32 communities throughout the United States that operate some of the largest public airports in the world. It predicted that the new flights would stimulate more than $15 billion annually in new tourism, trade and other economic activity on both side of the border and create 290,000 jobs.
"There's going to be such a dramatic change that people haven't absorbed it yet," said James A. Wilding, chief executive of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.
The two leaders also announced a joint border management agreement to speed frequent travelers through formalities, streamline the processing of commercial goods and free resources for use against smuggling of guns, drugs and other contraband. The accord, details of which are still to be worked out, envisages use of magnetic cards by frequent border crossers to avoid Customs delays.
"The bottom line is that Canadian and American taxpayers will be getting better value for their tax dollars," said Canada's National Revenue Minister, David Anderson.
Despite the harmony in transportation and border issues, a number of bilateral trade irritants still cloud the relationship, and apparently little progress was made in resolving them.
That the two leaders brought their chief trade negotiators into the summit talks -- Mickey Kantor for the United States and Roy MacLaren for Canada -- was an indication of the importance the Governments attach to resolving the disputes.
Already the United States has drawn up a list of potential retaliation targets to counter Canadian cultural protectionism, one of the most explosive areas of disagreement.
Rising Canadian trade surpluses, on top of a 20 percent depreciation of the Canadian dollar over the past four years, has raised American political sensitivity about Canadian market penetration.
The Canadian dollar's depreciation, taken in conjunction with the nearly 40 percent drop in the value of the peso over the past two months, which is likely to drastically cut United States exports to Mexico, has prompted some American trade groups to complain that the United States is emerging as the big loser in the year-old North American Free Trade Agreement.
A disagreement over country music has the highest political visibility.
The United States accuses Canada of "confiscatory" action in its regulatory decision last June to remove Country Music Television of Nashville from Canadian cable systems in favor of a new Canadian country music channel.
Other telecommunications issues include a Canadian proposal to tax audio and video cassettes to raise revenue for royalties to performers when their work is played in Canada. But the plan would deny American performers their share of the fees collected.
Another fight is over an 80 percent tax Canada wants to impose on Canadian editions of American publications like as Sports Illustrated that are designed in the United States and then beamed electronically to a Canadian printer.
Canada, in turn, is riled at the United States for imposing high tariffs on sugar and peanut butter and complains about Americans overfishing Pacific salmon.

HEADLINE: U.S. Treasuries Are Mixed On Latest Economic Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday after a Government report showed surprising signs of strong economic growth.
The report, on factory orders for durable goods, which represent products ranging from personal computers to aircraft, showed a third consecutive monthly gain. The data suggested that the economy might not be slowing at a pace analysts and traders had expected. But the rise in orders for durable goods was at a somewhat slower pace than the gains in November and December. And the durable goods report tends to be volatile, sometimes sending contradictory signals about the direction of the economy. 
 The market will be paying greater attention next week to the revision of the gross domestic product for the fourth quarter and to February sales reports from auto makers.
Yesterday, the price of the 30-year bond rose 6/32 of a percentage point, to 1015/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.52 percent, from 7.54 percent on Thursday. But rates on shorter- maturity issues were higher. Traders said the short end of the market was due for some correction because it had been pricing in unrealistic expectations of Federal Reserve policy.
Eugene J. Sherman, director of research for M. A. Schapiro & Company, likened the situation in the fixed-income market to the experienced hiker who has come to the realization that he has been following a false trail. "The market has rallied since the fourth week in January on the expectation that the economy is slowing and that the Federal Reserve is finished, or only one step away from ending, its tightening," he said.
In the municipal market, bonds were little changed amid expectations that demand for tax-exempt income and a decline in sales of new issues will continue to bolster prices. New bond sales are down about 50 percent.
Market participants are looking ahead to next week's sale of $ 500 million in New York State general obligation bonds, which are part of an advanced refinancing on existing debt. In addition, $ 150 million will be used for new projects. The price of the bonds will be negotiated through Lehman Brothers.

HEADLINE: 2 Key Democrats Voice Doubt on Budget Amendment

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The campaign to add a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, a bare vote or two short of the 67 it needs to win in the Senate on Tuesday, seemed to stumble today on the concerns of two pivotal Democrats that the measure would shift power over Federal spending to the courts.
With five Democrats still undecided, at least publicly, the battle over the amendment is far from over. But the proposal's prospects clearly were not helped when two who have been regarded as among the most likely recruits to its cause -- Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky -- expressed deep reservations about it in speeches and interviews. 
 Mr. Nunn followed up on an earlier veiled threat to oppose the amendment by stating, in a speech on the Senate floor on Thursday night, that he would vote against it unless it was changed to prohibit the Federal courts from ruling on its meaning. To do otherwise, he said, would give the judiciary a veto over taxing and spending decisions that the Constitution vests solely in the legislative branch.
In an interview today, Mr. Ford, the Senate's second-ranking Democrat, said he shared Mr. Nunn's fears.
"I think Nunn kind of threw down the gauntlet," he said. "Judicial authority has a lot of us really concerned." And unless the amendment is altered to address those concerns, he said, "I think some of us are going to have a hard time voting for it."
Mr. Ford said he had other reservations about the measure as well, including the lack of a clause that would prevent Congress from using taxpayers' Social Security contributions to offset deficit spending. He nevertheless said he had not decided how he would vote.
The White House, sensing new weakness in a proposal that had once seemed a sure thing, roused its own slumbering lobbying campaign and began making a serious effort to defeat it.
In Ottawa, President Clinton attacked the amendment, partly on the ground that it would make deficit spending to prop up any future recession-battered economy more difficult. The amendment would prohibit deficit spending without the approval of three-fifths of each house of Congress, as against the simple majority now required.
The Administration's top economic officials pressed that point in Washington, holding a news conference, calling senators and issuing a white paper claiming to show how the 1990 recession would have been all the worse had deficit spending been barred. The state-by-state breakdown estimated that unemployment at the recession's peak, actually 7.7 percent, would instead have been between 8.3 percent and 9.4 percent, with an extra 750,000 to 2.3 million people out of work.
The chairwoman of the National Economic Council, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, suggested that backers of the amendment would walk the same high wire from which President Herbert Hoover slipped in 1930, when he refused to prime the economic pump after the stock market had crashed.
"He wanted to have a balanced budget," she said, "and all of the studies suggest that his attempts to have a balanced budget made the Depression considerably worse. We should not go back and undo a set of policies that work well."
Mr. Clinton has been telephoning wavering Democrats, but his impact is not clear. Senator Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, a Democrat said to be leaning toward support for the amendment, was told today to expect a call from the President. Asked whether that would sway the Senator, his spokesman, Barry Piatt, replied, "No."
"He's always glad to listen," Mr. Piatt said, "but this is not an issue he's going to decide on the basis of who exerts the most pressure."
In an interview, the chief Republican sponsor of the amendment, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, said that his side was one vote short of the 67 it needs on Tuesday and that Mr. Nunn's support was now "crucial." He plans to give Mr. Nunn a pledge, signed by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, to address the judicial-control concerns in legislation that would implement the budget amendment.
Mr. Nunn was in Haiti and could not be reached. But his spokeswoman, Cathy O'Brien, said the Senator would not settle for less than a guarantee that was written into the Constitution.
Told of that, Mr. Hatch said he did not intend to change the amendment, partly out of fear that doing so would erode support in the House. Then he hedged, ever so slightly.
"As someone who through the years has painted himself into corners," he said, "I've learned not to do that."

HEADLINE: White House Signals an Easing on Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The White House is undertaking a top-to-bottom review of Federal affirmative action programs, scrambling to maintain its footing against Republican attacks on preferential treatment of women and minorities.
"What we need to guarantee is genuine equality of opportunity," President Clinton said today in acknowledging the review at a news conference in Ottawa, after meeting with Canadian officials. "That's what the affirmative action concept is designed to do, and I'm convinced that most Americans want us to continue to do that in the appropriate way." 
 But he added: "We shouldn't be defending things that we can't defend. So it's time to review it, discuss it, and be straightforward about it."
Mr. Clinton's announcement of the review marks the first signal that the White House intends to move away from the staunch defense of all affirmative action programs, a position that has been part of the Democratic Party's basic doctrine for more than two decades.
The Administration's review comes as Republicans are attacking such programs, charging that they amount to "reverse discrimination." Some Republican strategists are viewing the issue as a way to attract more of the white male voters who favored Republicans in the last election, especially those groups whose incomes have been stagnant in the last few years.
The issue has sowed jitters among Democrats who fear the Republican strategy may have some success, as well as among black organizations and liberal women's groups, who make up a significant part of the Democrats' base and who are concerned that ending or modifying affirmative action will halt economic gains they made in the 1970's and 1980's.
While stressing that President Clinton "stands firmly behind the principle of equal opportunity and civil rights," a senior Clinton adviser said that the Administration intended to pore over Federal affirmative action programs to see which ones might be outmoded or unfair.
White House officials said they did not know when the review of Federal programs would be completed. A recent listing of such efforts produced by the Congressional Research Service indicates that virtually every Federal agency, from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Veterans Affairs, runs programs that give special aid to minorities and women.
Often these efforts are designed to encourage the use of minority- or women-owned banks for deposits from Federal or state agencies administering a given program, like the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. Federal agencies are often encouraged to direct a portion of research grants to historically black colleges and universities.
Generally, the Federal laws and regulations express the desire that agencies meet undefined goals when it comes to aiding minorities or women. But sometimes these goals are expressed as specific numerical targets, prompting charges that they really amount to quotas.
For example, the Defense Department has a set goal of awarding 5 percent of the total value of its procurement, research, construction, operation and maintenance contracts to "socially and economically disadvantaged individuals."
There are no Federal laws requiring private companies to adopt affirmative action plans. But Federal judges have at times ordered companies that have been found guilty of racial or sexual discrimination to adopt them. Indeed, when the discrimination has been particularly egregious, courts have required companies to impose rigid hiring or promotion quotas to increase the number of minority or female employees or supervisors.
The Federal Government's most powerful tool to encourage private companies to hire women and members of minority groups is the requirement that any company with a Federal contract worth more than $50,000 make a "good faith effort" to meet various "goals and timetables" when it comes to the hiring of minorities or women.
While some Republicans are ebullient about the Democrats' discomfort, others worry that the issue could heighten racial divisions, open the party to charges of racism and anger moderate women, many of whom are already concerned over the Republican Party's drift to the right on abortion.
A Washington lawyer who has advised Republican lawmakers on the issue and who spoke on the condition of anonymity said: "A lot of them really don't have the stomach to take this stuff on. It will be incredibly divisive and they're worried about angering women."
Still, both sides acknowledge that the locus of the debate over affirmative action has shifted to the right. In addition to Mr. Clinton, several other leading Democrats have said that after three decades, the policy ought to be reviewed.
"It's head-spinning," said Clint Bolick, a persistent critic of race- and gender-based preference programs who is vice president of the Institute for Justice, a conservative public-policy research group. "The center of the debate had not shifted for 30 years, and now it has moved dramatically."

HEADLINE: France Accuses U.S. of Leaking Report on American Spies

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The Interior Minister denied today that he was responsible for the disclosure of allegations that American diplomats had spied on the Government, and he blamed the United States Embassy and the Ambassador instead.
The assertion by the minister, Charles Pasqua, reported in Le Monde, seemed to startle the Ambassador, Pamela Harriman, and the embassy issued a withering statement rejecting the charge as "neither true nor credible." The statement also scolded Mr. Pasqua for violating diplomatic confidentiality. 
 The scandal blew up Wednesday when a French demand for the departure of the former station chief for the Central Intelligence Agency and four alleged subordinates was reported by Le Monde. American officials had hoped the affair would quickly cool off, but the statement by Mr. Pasqua and the embassy's response fanned the embers.
Mr. Pasqua, who is traveling in Africa, was interviewed by Le Monde on Thursday during a stopover in Dakar, Senegal. The affair is "serious, very serious," he told the newspaper, calling upon the United States to recall the Americans as soon as possible and denying that he had been responsible for making the affair public.
"I also asked the Ambassador to keep it confidential," Mr. Pasqua said. But, he added, she told him she "could not do it because many agencies were aware of it."
"There have been lots of leaks on the American side," he told Le Monde, which has published details and extensive excerpts of a French counterintelligence report on the alleged political and economic espionage.
That was too much for the embassy, where officials said they had not even seen the counterintelligence report, much less made it public.
"We regret very much a number of the statements made by Minister Pasqua in Dakar," the embassy statement said. "In particular, we categorically reject the allegation that we are responsible for the detailed and totally regrettable press leaks that were published in a number of French newspapers, including Le Monde. This charge is neither true nor credible.
"We also regret his inaccurate and incomplete account of his conversations with Mrs. Harriman. In any event, such exchanges by definition should have been protected by the rule of diplomatic confidentiality."
Mr. Pasqua's first conversation with Mrs. Harriman about the affair is reported to have taken place on Jan. 26, when he is said to have told her he was confident that close allies like the United States and France could quietly work things out.
Instead, after several more exchanges, the details appeared on the front page of Le Monde.
Most French commentators and politicians explain it as an attempt to divert attention from a scandal over illegal wiretapping sanctioned by Mr. Pasqua, an affair that has hurt Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's campaign to succeed President Francois Mitterrand in elections this spring.
Mr. Balladur was clearly the front-runner a month ago, but his poll ratings have fallen drastically since the disclosure that he let Mr. Pasqua talk him into authorizing a telephone tap last December of the father-in-law of a judge investigating allegations of Government corruption. A court later ordered the transcripts destroyed because the authorization had been illegal.
Mr. Balladur was defending his decision as late as last weekend, but pinned responsibility for it on Mr. Pasqua and saw his poll ratings fall even further.
Because America-bashing has been often been a political weapon for conservative French politicians in a pinch, many politicians and commentators have concluded that Mr. Pasqua must have leaked the spying charges to divert attention from the scandal.
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who backs Jacques Chirac, another conservative, for the presidency, said on Thursday that he was "scandalized" that the affair had been made public and called for an investigation to determine who leaked it. Mr. Chirac's chances have steadily improved as Mr. Balladur's have diminished, and the latest polls put both conservatives in a dead heat with Lionel Jospin, a Socialist, in the first round of balloting on April 23.
But Mr. Juppe also said the accused Americans should leave soon.
The State Department said Thursday that the United States had no intention of reassigning any officials before their tours were up. One of the accused finished a tour of duty at the embassy and left France before the scandal became public.
The former C.I.A. station chief and one of the other two accused embassy staff members are understood to be close to the end of their tours anyway. A fifth American is a civilian without diplomatic status whose present whereabouts are unclear.

HEADLINE: Continuing Its Advance, Dow Closes at 4,011.74

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks reached record highs yesterday for a second consecutive session, led by rallies in food and beverage issues.
The Dow Jones industrial average again closed above 4,000 points, rising 8.41, to 4,011.74. For the week, the Dow gained 1.5 percent. 
 "We're feeling pretty good about things right now," said Doug Person, vice president at Bridges Investment Counsel, which manages $600 million. "Rates are stable and possibly trending lower, and it looks like the economy is slowing but not so much that we're looking at a recession."
Stocks stumbled early in the day after the Government reported that orders for durable goods rose six-tenths of 1 percent in January. The data suggested the economy might not be slowing as much as expected.
But the report failed to derail a rally that began picking up steam on Wednesday, when Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, implied that the Fed's policy of raising short-term interest rates might be coming to an end.
An easing in monetary policy would lower corporate borrowing costs and improve profits, thus brightening the outlook for stocks. Long-term interest rates fell yesterday, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond slipping to 7.52 percent from 7.54 percent on Thursday.
Food and beverage shares rose yesterday as the outlook for moderate growth in the economy improved the attraction of companies that sell consumer staples like soap, soda and corn flakes. Such so-called defensive issues report stable earnings through economic booms and busts.
"If you buy into the theory that the economy is going to slow down, you want to be in those names," said Todd Clark, a senior trader at Mabon Securities Corporation.
Shares of the Coca-Cola Company rose 3/4, to 54 3/4, while those of Pepsico added 3/8, to 39 5/8. General Mills gained 1 1/8, to 61 3/8; Ralston Purina climbed 1 3/8, to 48, and the Kellogg Company rose 3/8, to 54 1/2.
Among broader market indexes, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 1.20 points yesterday, to a record 488.11, its fourth consecutive gain. The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.27 point, to 791.08, pulled down by losses in shares of the Oracle Corporation, the Microsoft Corporation, Cisco Systems and Apple Computer.
On the New York Stock Exchange, volume was about 303 million shares, less than the three-month daily average of 316 million shares. Declining stocks outpaced advancing ones, 1,117 to 1,040.
Tobacco stocks rose a second day, after a trial on the addictiveness of cigarettes ended with a mistrial in Indiana on Tuesday. The case was the first in which a jury in a tobacco lawsuit considered evidence of tobacco's alleged addictiveness.
Shares of the Philip Morris Companies rose 1 1/4, to 60 3/4, after adding 1 1/4 on Thursday. American Brands gained 1/2, to 37 3/8, and Brooke Group Ltd. rose 1/8, to 3 1/2.
Among initial public offerings, Speedway Motorsports Inc., which owns the Charlotte Motor Speedway and Atlanta Motor Speedway, rose 1 from its pricing at 18.
Earlier in Tokyo, stocks fell sharply. The Nikkei index of 225 issues plunged 357.08 points, or 2 percent, to 17,472.94, its lowest close since Jan. 4, 1994.

HEADLINE: Officials Assess Local Impact if Military Operations Are Pared

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Dismay, despair and defiance were mingled yesterday in reaction to the prospect of community upheaval and millions of dollars of economic losses growing out of plans to close or curtail operations at military installations in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
Said to be on the Pentagon's chopping block were familiar names like the New London submarine base in Connecticut; the Lakehurst Naval Air Engineering Station in New Jersey, where the German dirigible Hindenburg burned in 1937; Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn, and the Rome Laboratory in Rome, N.Y., the sole active element of Griffiss Air Force Base, which was a victim of a round of base closings two years ago. 
 "I think this is a probably a very enormous mistake that the Defense Department is making, and I believe they will regret it," said New York State Assemblywoman RoAnn Destito, a Democrat whose district covers the Rome-Utica area. "It is a very integral part of not only the Department of Defense but of New York State's high-technology infrastructure."
Mrs. Destito, a member of the Legislative Commission on Science and Technology and the Economic Development Standing Committee, said a closing would affect not only 850 employees at Rome Laboratory but another 2,000 to 2,500 people through a ripple effect.
"Rome Labs has over $150 million in contracts let out in New York State," Mrs. Destito said, estimating that the economic impact of a shutdown at the laboratory would amount to $300 million spread over three or four upstate counties with a total population of 800,000.
She asserted, too, that a closing would affect corporations like Eastman Kodak, GTE, Boeing and Nynex that have local ties to the lab, as well as institutions like Syracuse University, Cornell, the Rochester Institute of Technology and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, which have educational alliances with the facility.
In New Jersey, Arthur Lindberg, a Navy veteran who heads a group called Save Lakehurst, applied the word "devastating" to the prospect of the relocation of equipment and loss of engineering talent that might accompany curtailment of operations at the Naval Air Engineering Station.
Situated on 7,400-acres in the Pinelands of Ocean County, the station is one of eight military bases in the state. With about 600 military and 2,700 civilian employees, Mr. Lindberg said, it pumps an estimated $75 million annually into the local economy.
The base is a research and development center for the catapult and recovery systems that are used on carriers to launch and land aircraft, and the Save Lakehurst committee argues that the base is the only place in the country where such work is carried out.
Representative Christopher H. Smith, a Republican who represents Ocean County and is spearheading the effort to keep the station open, said, "If the United States wants to have an aircraft carrier force, Lakehurst has to be sacrosanct."
The Navy's proposal to move the training school from its base at New London to Charleston, S.C., would cost 500 jobs in Connecticut, according to William D. Moore, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of Southeastern Connecticut.
He said, the loss of the school, with not only its instructors but also 3,000 students, "is going to be significant in terms of lost payroll for the community."
"It will also be significant for the loss of 500 people making permanent homes here," Mr. Moore said.
But Mr. Moore refused to abandon hope. "Simply appearing on the list of bases does not mean it will happen," he said. "We're not giving up, by any stretch of the imagination."
In 1993, New London officials, arguing that the submarine base should not be separated from the training school, which was too expensive to relocate, successfully contested the Navy's proposal to move the submarine base to Georgia. But the Charleston Naval Shipyard and Naval Station, with more than 26,000 military and civilian jobs, was ordered closed.
Mr. Moore said: "The question now becomes: If it's going to take a large expense to move to Charleston, where you have to reopen part of that base and no longer have the savings from 1993, what has changed?"
Fort Hamilton, where the 77th Army Reserve Command has headquarters, narrowly escaped the Pentagon's closing list for 1991. Yesterday, Greg Brooks, executive assistant to Howard Golden, the Brooklyn Borough President, said Mr. Golden had expressed concern over reports of an impending shutdown and was seeking confirmation that the fort was on the list.

HEADLINE: On a Familiar Texas Campus, Gramm Makes It Official

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: COLLEGE STATION, Tex., Feb. 24

 BODY:
Senator Phil Gramm formally declared his candidacy for the Republican Presidential nomination today, presenting himself as an unwavering conservative with the record and the grit to carry forward a rightward revolution that began last November.
Returning here to Texas A & M University, where he was an economics professor for 12 years, Mr. Gramm stood on the steps of the limestone administration building and delivered a message that was plainly spoken and razor-sharp. 
 "We need a leader that has the courage to tell our people the truth," he told an ebullient crowd of thousands that was stocked with placard-waving students swaying to the Aggie Band. "We need a leader who has the vision to define solutions to our problems, solutions that people can understand and can believe in. And we need a leader who is tough enough to get the job done. In the next 20 months, I hope to convince the American people that I am that leader."
The morning sun re-emerged from clouds, and the two-term Senator from Texas made it official: "With a love for America and a resolve to make her right again, I today declare myself a candidate for President of the United States."
Of nine or so Republicans who are already running for the Presidential nomination, the 52-year-old Mr. Gramm is the first to declare his candidacy formally. He has set the early pace of the campaign by building the largest war chest, including $4.1 million -- a record for a single event -- that he reports raising at a dinner in Dallas on Thursday night. And he has won nonbinding straw polls among active party members in a handful of states, a result that speaks to the merits of his early organization.
But half the voters do not yet have an opinion of him, a New York Times/CBS News Poll shows, and among those who do, the sentiment is mixed.
The poll, conducted by telephone among 586 Americans on Wednesday and Thursday, found that 14 percent viewed him favorably, 13 percent viewed him not favorably, 22 percent were undecided, and 51 percent had not heard enough about him to form an opinion.
Among Republicans, the balance of opinion is more positive, although he is still largely unknown. The poll found that 23 percent of Republicans viewed him favorably, 13 percent viewed him not favorably, 19 percent were undecided, and 46 percent had not heard enough.
The poll's margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points.
Here today in College Station, about 60 miles northwest of Houston, Mr. Gramm reminded his audience of his best-known legislative achievement: his co-authorship of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law of the 1980's, which was ultimately undone by subsequent legislation. Asserting that no goal was more critical than eliminating the Federal budget deficit, he repeated an earlier pledge that he would not seek re-election as President if he failed to do so.
He did not outline specific budget cuts, saying only that there would have to be "hard choices" but telling reporters later that he would not tamper with Social Security.
Seeking to distinguish himself as the only genuine conservative in the field, Mr. Gramm gleefully recalled that he had stood alone "in the darkest hour" of the health care debate when he opposed President Clinton's proposed overhaul. "When pollsters were saying it was political suicide to take on the Clinton health care bill head on, when 20 Republican senators had signed on to a big-government compromise that raised taxes," he declared, "I stood up and said, 'The Clinton health care bill is going to pass over my cold, dead political body.' "
After pausing for the hoots and hollers, he added: "I am happy today to say that my political body is alive. The President's health care bill is deader than Elvis. And Elvis may be back, but the President's health care bill will not be back."
The Senator, whose last major speech before a national audience was a poorly received keynote address at the 1992 Republican National Convention, in Houston, took the opportunity today to stake out hard-line positions on a number of issues:
*He pledged to dismantle the welfare system, saying, "I will ask able-bodied men and women riding in the wagon on welfare to get out of the wagon and help the rest of us pull."
*He said he would "stop building prisons like Holiday Inns" and press for vigorous application of the death penalty. "If I have to string barbed wire on every closed military base in America," he said of criminals, "I am going to put these people in jail."
*He vowed to sign an executive order ending quotas, preferences and set-asides for members of minority groups. "I will fight for equal and unlimited opportunity for every American," he said, "but there will be special privilege for no one."
*And he called for a strengthening of the American military.
The event here was marked by military symbolism that posed some unstated but unmistakable incongruities on a day seized by a candidate whose draft deferments kept him out of military service during the Vietnam War. One speaker was his close friend and campaign chairman, Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Members of the A & M Corps of Cadets, dressed in crisp white uniforms, formed a backdrop for the news photographers. Mr. Gramm arrived with his wife, Wendy Lee, and their two college-age sons by walking through the cadets' raised sabres.
And at the end of his speech, there was even the roar of a cannon.

HEADLINE: Orders Rose For Durables Last Month

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
In a report that analysts said raised new questions about whether the economy was slowing as the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, had suggested, the Government said yesterday that factory orders for durable goods rose for the third consecutive month in January.
 According to data compiled by the Commerce Department, orders for durable goods increased six-tenths of 1 percent last month, led by stronger demand for industrial machinery and equipment. 
 The rise was at a somewhat slower pace than the gains in November and December. But analysts said the overall gain in January masked underlying strength. They added that the data did little to support Mr. Greenspan's statement, made to Congress earlier this week, that the pace of economic activity appeared to be losing steam.
 "This is the first major report since Mr. Greenspan's testimony, and it fails to corroborate his suspicion that the economy is slowing," said Paul D. Mastroddi, a managing director at J. P. Morgan & Company. "One of the main messages of the report is that business investment, one of the main sources of growth over the last year, started off 1995 on a strong note."
 David A. Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, said the report ran "against the flow of the other data that is coming in, most of which shows slower growth."
 He was referring to softer retail sales figures, the weak January employment data and lower car sales. The housing market has also slowed recently.
 The durable goods report is among the most volatile the Government produces and by itself cannot be counted on to give a reliable picture of the economy. Still, the report put a damper on the bond market, which had been cheered by Mr. Greenspan's remarks. Bond prices were mixed yesterday, after posting gains in the three previous sessions.
 Mr. Mastroddi said that orders for nonmilitary capital goods rose 8.6 percent in January and were up 5.8 percent when the volatile aircraft component was excluded.
 "This tells me the business investment boom is continuing," he said.
 The gain was paced by orders for industrial machinery and equipment, which jumped by 7.2 percent, the first rise for this segment in three months.
 As Mr. Mastroddi suggested, the overall gain was held back by the transportation equipment category, where orders fell 5 percent. In addition to a decline in aircraft orders, demand for automobiles, ships and trains all declined. Excluding transportation, orders for durable goods increased 2.5 percent last month, after rising four-tenths of 1 percent in December.
 "At this stage of the cycle, we think most of the upward pressure is going to come from the industrial side of the economy," Joseph Liro, chief economist at S. G. Warburg & Company, said. "These durable goods numbers add weight to that view."

House Republican leaders said today that they had abandoned plans to abolish the Federal food stamp program and shift the responsibility to the states after senior Republican lawmakers from farm states rebelled.
The decision marks the first significant setback for the House Republican campaign to pare social welfare programs established by the Federal Government over the last 60 years. 
 The lawmakers from farm states demanded that the Government retain the food stamp program as the ultimate national safety net for poor people.
"The leadership has decided to keep the food stamp program at the Federal level," said Representative Pat Roberts of Kansas, chairman of the Agriculture Committee. "That's the best way to achieve our goals of providing nutrition for the hungry and eliminating fraud from the program."
The decision to preserve food stamps came a day after a House committee voted to scrap several other types of Federal food assistance, including the school lunch program, and turn the money over to the states.
If the states take greater responsibility for social welfare programs as Republicans want, there must be "a Federal social safety net to backstop that process," Mr. Roberts said.
The number of people getting food stamps soared to 27.5 million last year, from 20 million in 1990. More than half of the people getting assistance are children. The program cost $25 billion last year, up from $15.5 billion in 1990.
The Republican rebellion was led by Representatives Bill Emerson of Missouri and Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin, along with Mr. Roberts. But almost all the other Republican members of the Agriculture Committee also balked at the demand to replace the food stamp program with lump sum payments to the states.
House Republicans said that the party's floor leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, had insisted on such a block grant program, but that Speaker Newt Gingrich was more flexible and pragmatic.
Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, welcomed the decision to keep food stamps as a Federal program. But he said, "The same logic should apply to other nutrition programs that the Republicans are seeking to cut like school lunch, school breakfast and the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children."
The original version of the Republican Contract With America would have repealed the Food Stamp Act of 1977 and consolidated all nutrition programs in a block grant to the states. But most members of the Agriculture Committee come from agricultural districts and objected to the proposal as they studied its details.
Mr. Emerson said, "We are already delegating power to the states in other areas of welfare reform," with block grants for cash assistance and child nutrition programs, including the school lunch program. Even without food stamps, he said, the states were getting "a full plate" of new responsibilities. Mr. Emerson is chairman of the Agriculture subcommittee on nutrition.
In a separate action, the National Governors' Association today expressed concern about a Republican proposal to shift the Federal Government's main cash assistance program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, to the states with a lump sum of Federal money. Leaders of the association -- three Republicans and three Democrats -- said in a letter to Congress that the welfare block grant, as now designed, would not adequately meet states' needs in times of recession or natural disaster.
Moreover, the governors objected to Republican plans to deny cash assistance to legal immigrants, and they said that other provisions of the bill improperly "limit state flexibility or shift Federal costs to the states."
On Thursday, the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities voted to scrap the school lunch program and let states decide how to use Federal money to feed schoolchildren.
Some governors also wanted to replace food stamps with a block grant and substitute cash payments for food stamp coupons. But House Republicans rejected that idea, in part because they feared that it would increase fraud and abuse.
Mr. Gunderson, who represents many dairy producers, said, "We're not going to convert this to a cash program."
In an interview, Mr. Roberts, whose constituents produce huge amounts of wheat and feed grains, said: "Most governors would have preferred cash, but that's not a feasible answer. That's not going to happen in the food stamp program."
If cash replaced coupons, he said, there would be no guarantee that the money would be used to buy commodities or to combat hunger.
Under the new Republican proposal, food stamps will remain an entitlement program, available to anyone who meets eligibility criteria set by Federal laws and regulations. Congress would set an annual limit on spending for food stamps. Such a ceiling existed before 1990. In theory, benefits could have been reduced if the money ran out. But in practice, whenever costs threatened to exceed the limit, Congress appropriated more money.
Even though the food stamp program will remain at the Federal level, Republicans say they are determined to slow its growth. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that under current law the Government will spend a total of $150 billion on the program in the next five years. Republicans on the House Budget Committee say they want to trim this by $14 billion, or 9 percent. The savings could be achieved by restricting eligibility or by reducing the monthly allotment.
Agriculture Department officials say that overpayments to food stamp recipients cost the Government $1.8 billion a year. The overpayments result from errors by caseworkers or misstatements by applicants. Mr. Roberts said the Republican welfare bill would address these problems.

HEADLINE: A Stealth Airport for New York;
Lightly-Used Stewart Is New York's Stealth Jetport

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW WINDSOR, N.Y.

 BODY:
Once, Stewart International Airport was going to be New York City's fourth jetport, a gateway to the rest of America that would outstrip Kennedy International Airport in size and passenger volume and transform the rustic Hudson Valley into an economic beehive.
 Today, two decades after government planners announced that soaring vision and five years after passenger service began, even its ardent champions say Stewart is just a nice country airport. 
 To be sure, its 9,600 acres of rolling woods make it bigger than any American airport save those in Dallas-Fort Worth and Denver. But its one terminal is about the size of an elementary school auditorium. It is international only because it has one weekly flight to Cancun, Mexico, during the winter season. And rain or shine, travelers still have to walk across the tarmac to their airplanes.
 The lavish dreams -- and officials at Stewart now laugh at how grandiose those plans were -- evaporated with the end of the big-project era of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, the fuel crisis of the 1970's and the introduction of jumbo jets. The wide-bodied jets cut into congestion at New York City's three airports and helped eliminate the need for a fourth 65 miles from Manhattan.
 Yet, to the almost 400,000 passengers who use it yearly, Stewart is one of the state's best-guarded secrets. Its direct flights to major airline hubs -- three daily flights to Chicago, three to Pittsburgh, four to Washington, two to Atlanta, one to Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and one to Orlando, Fla. -- connect travelers to practically any American city. And its terminal, small as it is, provides just about any service found at Stewart's grander cousins: a newsstand and gift shop, a cash machine, a cafe, three rental car companies, even a duty-free shop.
 The 30 departures a day are on schedule 91 percent of the time, one of the nation's best records. (Newark by comparison has a 75 percent on-time record.) The airport is less than an hour from the Tappan Zee Bridge and close to two highways, Interstate 84 and the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway. There are no traffic jams -- and accompanying nervous fits -- on the scenic roads in, and passengers can park right outside the terminal for $8 a day.
 "It's small and that makes it easier," said Maryann Ahearn, a nursery school teacher who lives in the Catskills village of Woodridge, N.Y. "It's not overwhelming."
 "It's easier to find people," her 7-year-old son, Tom, said of the relatives who visit.
 Joseph Capone, a 43-year-old telephone company technician who lives in nearby Salisbury Mills, said that when he returns from a business trip, he calls his wife from a pay telephone and "by the time I get my bags, my wife is waiting for me outside." He was waiting for a flight to Orlando to play golf.
 "If I go to La Guardia I'm leaving three hours before the flight," he said.
 Still, after a wildly successful first year in 1990-91, Stewart stopped growing. Officials of the State Transportation Department, which owns Stewart and pays private contractors to run it, say they believe they have attracted most of the potential passengers in the six counties of the mid-Hudson region.
 Now, they say, they have to work harder through travel agents and newspaper advertisements to lure people who live or work farther away -- in northern Westchester County, western Connecticut, eastern Pennsylvania and northern New Jersey.
 "It's tough to change habits," said Russell B. Vachon, the Transportation Department's director of aviation. "People around Westchester are convinced that it's easier to go south than to go north."
Mr. Vachon, 49, has been Stewart's guardian angel for two decades. He was a consultant to the former owner, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which acquired the deactivated Stewart Air Force Base in 1970 and seized dozens of surrounding farms for more acreage. He watched skeptically as the M.T.A. studied such quixotic fourth-airport schemes as a high-speed train from Pennsylvania Station that would whisk passengers to Stewart in a half-hour.
 "Trying to serve somebody in Manhattan out of an airport 65 miles north of Manhattan never made a heck of a lot of sense to me when you have airports much closer right there," Mr. Vachon said
 When he talks about Stewart, it assumes an almost human poignance.
 "I have my heart and soul in it," he said. "If there were not an airport there and you ask yourself where's a good place to put an airport, it couldn't be better."
 Mr. Vachon and other state officials have not stopped dreaming altogether. There are plans to more than double the size of Stewart's terminal by adding a second floor and increasing the number of gates from four to seven by early 1997. Ninety percent of the $12.2 million is coming from the Federal Government. The state also has plans to build an exit ramp off Interstate 84 that would shorten the trip to Stewart by skirting country roads.
 The enlarged airport could potentially handle a million passengers a year. But Mr. Vachon admits that whether the extra gates result in flights to more destinations depends entirely on the airlines.
 "You have to understand the way these guys think," Mr. Vachon said. "They only have so many airplanes and they're going to put them where the best payoff is." Officials of American Airlines and USAir, the two largest carriers at that airport, concur.
 Indeed, the main purpose of Stewart's expansion is not to increase flights but to relieve some of the congestion -- congestion that would be considered routine at other airports -- during peak hours and to let passengers walk directly to their plans without stepping outside.
 The people who use Stewart, passenger surveys show, arrive within an hour's drive, with the largest clusters traveling from Poughkeepsie (19 percent), Fishkill (8 percent), Hopewell Junction (6 percent), Kingston (5 percent) and other towns in Orange, Dutchess, Ulster, Sullivan, Putnam and Rockland Counties. I.B.M. executives at the area's three giant plants have long favored Stewart, but there are a lot fewer of them because I.B.M. cut its work force from 31,000 in 1985 to 10,500 last year.
 Ann Davis, an economist at Marist College in Poughkeepsie who studies the mid-Hudson economy, said that Stewart and nearby distribution plants for companies like Caldor, Grand Union and Baxter Pharmaceuticals have helped Orange County become one of the state's fastest growing. More than 78,000 tons of cargo moved into and out of Stewart last year.
 Yet, any expansion plans for Stewart, Ms. Davis pointed out, are dependent on the region's economic health. If the job market shrinks, as it did with I.B.M.'s downsizing, and business travel declines, that could hobble Stewart's growth.
 Limited growth at Stewart would be just fine with the area's environmental groups, who are pleased that noise and pollution have never approached the levels they feared. Carol Sondheimer, associate director of Scenic Hudson, a nonprofit group, said that a sizable spurt in Stewart's growth, inevitably accompanied by a sprawl of cargo warehouses, would erode the area's scenic beauty. That beauty is the basis for an industry larger than Stewart -- tourism centered around such sights as West Point and Hyde Park.
 "If you have people coming into an area where all they see is ugly boxes, that will not create a favorable impression," she said.

HEADLINE: Alexander Woroniak, 76, an Economist

 BODY:
Alexander Woroniak, an expert on East European economic systems who was professor emeritus and former chairman of the Department of Economics and Business at The Catholic University of America, died on Tuesday in Georgetown University Hospital. He was 76 and lived in Washington.
The cause was complications from a fall on Feb, 14, said his wife, Alyce Ann Bergkamp-Woroniak. 
 A native of Lviv, in present day Ukraine, he received a law degree from the Yoanni Casimiri Universitatis in Lviv in 1939 and taught there until 1942. After World War II, he worked in Germany for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the International Refugee Organization.
As an expert on German and Polish law and fluent in five languages, he was able to provide counsel on the resettlement of thousands of refugees, many of whom did not wish to return to lands under Communist control.
In 1950, he came to New York City and worked as an accountant while earning a master's degree in business and accounting from Columbia University. He joined Catholic University in Washington in 1958 and served as chairman of the business department from 1974 until his retirement in 1988.
The author of scores of journal articles, he wrote, with Daniel L. Spencer, "Transfer of Technology to Developing Countries" (Praeger, 1967). He served as a consultant for both Government and private organizations on the economies of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe countries.
His wife is the only survivor.

HEADLINE: Paul Bates, Head of Black Tank Unit, Dead at 86

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Paul L. Bates, the white colonel who commanded the first black tank battalion to enter combat in World War II, died on Tuesday at his home in Dunedin, Fla. He was 86.
The cause was cancer, said a daughter-in-law, Dorothy Bates, of Bloomfield, Mich., and Manhattan. 
 In January 1943, about two years after he joined the Army, Colonel Bates took command of the 761st Tank Battalion, all of whose enlisted men were black.
The 761st entered combat in November 1944 as part of Gen. George S. Patton's Third Army and fought for 183 consecutive days without relief, according to David Williams, a veteran of the battalion and the author in the early 1980's of "Hit Hard" (Bantam), an account of the unit.
The battalion fought in France, then in Germany, where it pierced the Siegfried Line, and then in Belgium, where it fought the Nazis in the Battle of the Bulge. It also fought in Luxembourg and Austria. In all, the 761st Tank Battalion went from Vic-sur-Seille, France, to the Enns River in Steyr, Austria, where it linked up with the Soviet Army.
The unit, whose shoulder patch had a black panther, inflicted thousands of casualties on the enemy and captured, destroyed or liberated more than 30 major towns, 4 airfields, 3 ammunition-supply dumps, 461 wheeled vehicles, 34 tanks, 113 large guns and a radio station.
Colonel Bates was the first member of the 761st to be wounded. Among its 687 enlisted men and 41 officers, 276 received the Purple Heart for wounds in action and 36 died in combat.
In 1978, after a 33-year struggle by the unit's veterans, President Jimmy Carter awarded the 761st a Presidential Unit Citation "for extraordinary heroism in action."
When the unit completed training in rigidly segregated boot camps in Louisiana and Texas, Colonel Bates refused a promotion from lieutenant colonel that would have separated him from what he regarded as one of the best tank battalions in the Army. He was eventually promoted to full colonel.
While in Texas, Colonel Bates refused to court-martial a black officer who had refused to move to the rear of a bus at Fort Hood. The officer was Jackie Robinson, who was subsequently court-martialed but not convicted and left the 761st before it went overseas. Praising Colonel Bates for his fairness and good judgment, Robinson, who would break the color line in major league baseball, recounted the incident in his autobiography.
In 1993, the unit made news because of a PBS documentary, "Liberators: Fighting on Two Fronts in World War II," in which two of its former enlisted men said the battalion had participated in the liberation of the Dachau and Buchenwald concentration camps. But Colonel Bates and other officers, noting that the unit was spread over a 50-mile front supporting the 71st Infantry Division at the time, would not confirm the claim. The unit did liberate Gunskirchen, a subcamp of the Mauthausen complex.
Colonel Bates, who was born in Los Angeles, graduated in 1931 with a degree in economics from Western Maryland College, where he was a star football player and a member of the Reserve Officer Training Corps. He worked as a high school football coach and a teacher before entering the Army as a first lieutenant in February 1941.
During World War II, he was awarded the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars in addition to the Purple Heart. In 1963, he was awarded the Legion of Merit when he retired from the Army, having served in combat commands in Europe, at the Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, Kan., and at the Pentagon.
He remained in close touch with veterans of the 761st and their families, attending yearly reunions and establishing a scholarship at Western Maryland for descendants of members of the battalion.
Colonel Bates, who will be buried on Wednesday with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, is survived by his wife, the former Helen Rosen of Dunedin; his sons, Baron, of Bloomfield, Mich., and Manhattan, and Paul Jr., of Southboro, Mass., and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Ex-Oilman Named Environment Chief

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 24

 BODY:
In a move that pleased business groups but angered some of his staunchest environmental supporters, Gov. George E. Pataki today named a former oil company executive to be the state's highest environmental official.
 The nomination of Michael D. Zagata to be Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation ends what had been a difficult process for Mr. Pataki, who draws broad support from both business and environmental leaders and had sought to satisfy both in his selection. 
 In Mr. Zagata, the Governor picked someone who was praised by business groups and some environmentalists as having a balanced resume of corporate and environmental experience. But the nominee was also attacked today as a disappointing choice by several major environmental organizations, including one that once named Mr. Pataki environmental legislator of the year.
 Though Mr. Pataki will set the broad outlines for environmental policy, Mr. Zagata will wield enormous influence over the department's daily operations, which include filing lawsuits against polluters, issuing permits to developers and enforcing regulations governing garbage disposal, wetlands development and air and water pollution.
 The agency employs 4,000 people and has a $300 million annual budget. Mr. Zagata, who is almost certain to be confirmed by the state Senate, will be paid $95,635 a year.
 Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has suggested that his own strong concern for both environmental and business interests is reminiscent of his political hero, Theodore Roosevelt. In an interview today, the Governor said he chose Mr. Zagata because he has worked for both industry and environmental groups, comes from New York State and is familiar with the agency, having worked there since last fall.
 Mr. Pataki said that even after Mr. Zagata emerged as the top candidate, he continued to review other candidates at the behest of environmental groups that had raised concerns about Mr. Zagata's record in the oil and natural gas industry over the past 14 years.
 "We talked to excellent people from all over the country," Mr. Pataki said. "From my standpoint, it wasn't close."
 Mr. Zagata did not return calls for comment.
 Earlier in his career, Mr. Zagata, 52, taught courses about wildlife resources at the University of Maine, worked for the Wildlife Society and was a Washington lobbyist for the National Audubon Society. He has a doctorate in wildlife ecology.
 After leaving the National Audubon Society in 1980, Mr. Zagata worked for Tenneco Inc., the Kerr-McGee Corporation, the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company and, most recently, the Transco Energy Company, where he was a vice president for environmental and safety affairs. Last year, he was appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to be the state's environmental liaison to business.
 During his 14 years in the oil and gas industry, Mr. Zagata clashed with environmentalists on three issues. He endorsed oil drilling in an Alaskan wildlife refuge; he called for allowing oil companies to sink unused off-shore drilling platforms to create marine habitats, and he advocated allowing companies to build in delicate wetlands in exchange for protecting or creating equal amounts of wetlands elsewhere, a practice known as mitigation banking.
 Mr. Pataki said he was willing to consider mitigation banking in New York State on a case-by-case basis. "If there is a wetland of particular importance, you can't just say you'll get a credit for restoring something elsewhere," Mr. Pataki said. "On the other hand, I don't have an inherent philosophical objection in all cases."
 But several environmental groups said the idea would allow the destruction of sensitive habitats. "Mr. Zagata's career has been highlighted by his attempts to justify why industry should be allowed to do what they wanted to do all along, whether destroying wetlands or critical habitats," said Lee Wasserman, executive director of Environmental Advocates, the group that named Mr. Pataki environmental legislator of the year in 1989, citing his sponsorship of legislation to protect the Hudson River.
 Larry Shapiro, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said of Mr. Zagata, "This guy's role has been to put an environmentally happy face on environmentally destructive actions."
 But David J. Miller, regional vice president for Audubon, said Mr. Zagata "will successfully build partnerships in the protection and proper management of the state's natural resources." Another national environmental group, The Nature Conservancy, also supported Mr. Zagata's appointment.
 Daniel B. Walsh, president of the Business Council of New York State, said Mr. Zagata would bring "a pragmatic approach to balancing D.E.C.'s environmental protection mandate and its impact on New York State's economy."

This week I announced that I would vote for a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution when the Senate takes it up next Tuesday, even though I voted against such an amendment last year. Unlike flag burning and school prayer -- two issues that are the subjects of constitutional amendments that would limit personal freedom -- the decision to encumber future generations with financial obligations is a fundamental choice that can be legitimately addressed in the Constitution.
The question for me is not whether the budget must be in perfect balance. The question is whether we can indefinitely sustain deficits of $200 billion and more without permanently and dangerously limiting future options for our children's generation. Under current budget conditions, trying to spend our way out of recessions is no longer an option; deficits are now the norm, not a conscious policy choice. 
 In the decade after 1981, when we lost control of the deficit, the human-services share of Federal outlays was cut 20 percent. The share going for education, training, employment and social services was cut 40 percent. And those areas of the budget that need help the least and should have been cut -- tax loopholes for the privileged, exotic weapons, spending on those who make money off programs for the middle-class and poor -- were spared.
People say there is much that we can do to contain deficits short of this amendment. Let's look at the record. In 1984, I introduced a bipartisan across-the-board freeze of every Federal program. We got the same argument from many advocates for children and the elderly who now criticize the balanced-budget amendment. I argued then, and I argue now, that unless we put every program on the table, only these programs would suffer.
We then tried the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law, and it failed. Finally, under the leadership of President Clinton, we did do something: we approved a $500 billion deficit reduction plan.
And we lost the next election, because Republicans convinced voters that to balance the budget all we needed to do was cut foreign aid and Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
Now the positive action we took is being undone and replaced with more wasteful spending and more cuts in those areas that have already been bled dry. Just look at the recent action of the House on children's nutrition programs.
So where does all this leave us? It leaves us with $235 billion interest on the debt this year, $270 billion to be paid on the debt in 1997 and $344 billion in 2002. Where are we going to find the money to pay this interest? Surely not with new taxes on the affluent. Surely not with cuts in weapons we don't need, or with savings gained by a new national health care system. Instead, the money is certain to come from Federal programs for the most deserving -- programs for infants, children, the needy elderly and the middle class.
The balanced-budget amendment is far from perfect. We could have made it better -- by including a clear statement that the President and the courts should not interfere with Congress's constitutional responsibility for the budget process, by including my own amendment for a capital budget for Federal public-works investments, by dealing honestly with Social Security instead of using the surpluses in the trust fund to mask the size of the deficit. But these changes were rejected by Republican lawmakers. So the choice before us is either a less than perfect amendment or the status quo -- and all the consequences that flow from it.
I will vote for the balanced-budget amendment on Tuesday because it will force the Government to do what it has been unable to do: to spend only the money it takes in, unless extraordinary circumstances force us to find the resources to spend more. I will do so in the belief that respect for the Constitution will result in a new tradition of fiscal responsibility. Ultimately, this will determine the kind of nation we pass on to our children.

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
Foreign Holdings Can Balance Portfolios

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
Mutual fund companies are looking abroad for inspiration, as these three new overseas funds show. Although investors are encouraged to own some foreign shares to balance domestic portfolios, they should expect interim volatility and plan to hold shares for the long term. That is because overseas securities are subject to additional risks, like currency and political shifts.
 The T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Bond Fund will own high-yielding government and corporate bonds issued in Latin America, central Europe, Asia and Africa. The fund will hedge some risk by buying short- and intermediate-term bonds. 
 The Lexington Global Income Fund invests in a complete package of bonds from emerging markets, established foreign markets and the United States. The fund is a joint venture with Maria Fiorini Ramirez, who heads a global economics consulting group.
 The IAI Developing Countries Fund aims for long-term capital appreciation by owning equities of companies in developing markets that are growing rapidly. The minimum investment has been reduced temporarily to $1,000 from $5,000.

A front-page article on Tuesday about the savings patterns of generations of Americans misstated the views of Michael J. Boskin, who was chief economic adviser under President George Bush. He is pessimistic, not optimistic, that the aging of the baby boomers will raise the national saving rate. 
 The article also misstated the number of Americans born from 1946 through 1964, which is considered the baby-boom generation. It is 75 million, not 45 million.

HEADLINE: Credit Bhutto for Transforming Pakistan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re Paula R. Newberg's attack on Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan in "The Two Benazir Bhuttos" (Op-Ed, Feb. 11):
Since Prime Minister Bhutto's reelection in October 1993, the economy and social structure of Pakistan have been remarkably transformed. Her Government has taken hard economic and budgetary decisions, risking political unpopularity by establishing fiscal discipline, and has been called a model of successful adjust ment in the developing world by the International Monetary Fund. 
 Foreign investment, responding to the economic incentives of the Government, has poured into Pakistan -- $6.5 billion from the United States in the energy sector alone. The $22 billion in foreign investment pledges in Pakistan during this Government's 15 months in office has quintupled foreign investment in Pakistan over the last quarter-century -- five times more in 15 months than in the previous 25 years combined.
The taxation system of the country has been reformed and an agricultural wealth tax imposed for the first time. New drug laws extending the death penalty to drug traffickers have been enacted. Cooperation with the United States and the world community on international terrorism has accelerated. The most recent example of this was the speedy extradition by Pakistan of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who is accused of plotting the attack on the World Trade Center in New York.
Ms. Newberg insinuates that Benazir Bhutto is working with Muslim extremists to deny rights to women. She and the world ought to know better.
To protect the rights of women in society, women's police stations have been created. Women judges have been appointed to the high courts, and thousands of women's health centers have been instituted all across the rural areas, training women in health, nutrition and family planning.
As for not building schools, 6,500 schools are under construction this year alone as part of Prime Minister Bhutto's social action program.

HEADLINE: PENTAGON TO SEEK SCALED-BACK LIST OF BASE CLOSINGS

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Scaling back its plans for shrinking the military, the Clinton Administration has prepared a list for its last scheduled round of military base closings that officials acknowledge will force the Pentagon to keep open more installations than it needs.
At Defense Secretary William J. Perry's direction, the armed services have recommended that about two dozen major bases be closed and more than 80 smaller installations nationwide be closed, reduced or, in a few cases, expanded slightly to accommodate troops from sites that are being closed, senior military officials said. The list is scheduled to be announced on Tuesday. 
 In the New York metropolitan area, the New London submarine base in Connecticut, the Lakehurst naval engineering center in New Jersey and Fort Hamilton in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn are expected to be closed or reduced in size, as is the Rome Laboratory at Griffiss Air Force Base in central New York.
California, where 22 bases have already been ordered closed, would undergo two more potential losses: the Navy shipyard in Long Beach and the Army base in Oakland. But other California bases remained safe, including McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento, which the Air Force unsuccessfully tried to close two years ago.
"I'm profoundly disappointed," Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said in an interview. "That's 3,500 jobs at Long Beach and 2,000 at Oakland. I was hoping we would have a bit of respite."
But the biggest news may be what is not on the list.
The Army spared Fort Carson in Colorado and Fort Riley in Kansas, two bases with large training areas the Army says it cannot afford to lose. The Air Force kept open its five large air logistics centers but proposed shrinking them slightly.
And Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in New Hampshire dodged the knife -- partly to avoid steep job losses in the first primary state of the 1996 Presidential campaign, some military officials said.
After the last round of closings in 1993, then-Defense Secretary Les Aspin predicted the 1995 round would be even more ambitious, the "mother of all base closings." But Mr. Perry scaled back that goal in recent months after the military services told him it would be too difficult and too costly in the near term.
The current list is "about three-quarters of the 1993 round," Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch said in an interview last week. "We need time to balance the base-closing costs and the base-closing savings, and complete the transfer of facilities to productive community use."
But by Mr. Perry's own admission, the military is keeping open more bases, depots, shipyards and laboratories than the shrinking post-cold-war military needs, bleeding money away from training, spare parts and new weapons. The overall size of the military has declined by 33 percent in the past eight years, but the number of installations has shrunk by only 20 percent.
Mr. Perry and other senior Pentagon officials are reviewing the recommendations, and senior aides cautioned that the Secretary might change some before he makes his final list public on Tuesday. But they said that is unlikely.
"Bill Perry and I are very much of the mind to make few changes to the service submissions," Mr. Deutch said in the interview.
The Defense Department list will then be given to a Presidential commission that was set up to review such plans, giving Congress political cover for the final decisions. The panel, formally known as the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, is to hold its first meeting next Wednesday.
The closings will eliminate thousands of military and civilian jobs, and are certain to stir intense opposition among lawmakers whose districts or states are affected. Indeed, a parade of anxious lawmakers have met with Mr. Perry, Mr. Deutch and other senior Pentagon civilians in recent days to plead for installations in their states or districts.
New York's two Senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alfonse D'Amato, its Governor, George E. Pataki, and several Representatives from New York appealed today to Mr. Deutch to spare Fort Hamilton, the Rome Laboratory and Fort Drum in Watertown. Army officials said Fort Drum was not on the list.
Among the other major installations the military seeks to close or scale back are Red River Army Depot in Texas, Fitzsimmons Army Hospital in Colorado, Meridian Naval Air Station in Mississippi, Brooks Air Force Base in Texas and Kirkland Air Force Base in New Mexico.
But survivors like Fort Riley, as well as Fort Wainwright and Fort Richardson in Alaska, counted on powerful political patrons like Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, or Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, in addition to military utility.
Although this year is the last scheduled round, Mr. Perry has suggested that the Defense Department might want to hold another in 1997 or 1998, after the 1996 Presidential elections. But the military services are caught between a desire to slash expensive overhead for a dwindling number of warships, fighter jets and combat divisions and the hope of keeping valuable bases and services in case the military has to grow.
As in 1993, the Navy offered up the largest number of installations in this round, largely adjusting to decisions made in previous rounds. With its bases built to accommodate a 600-ship cold-war fleet, the Navy is now heading toward 346 ships and submarines, and must cut its overhead.
But even the Navy did not make cuts completely commensurate to its projected smaller size. "We don't have as big a Navy to cut from, and most of the big things are already done," Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda, the Chief of Naval Operations, said. "We're also trying to have a reasonable amount of surge capability."
Under the law governing the procedure for closing or consolidating bases, Secretary Perry will submit his list by next Wednesday to the eight-member Presidential commission, headed by former Senator Alan Dixon, an Illinois Democrat. The commission will have until July 1 to accept, reject or alter the Administration's recommendations.
Its decision will then go to Mr. Clinton, who will have 15 days to accept or reject them. If he approves them the recommendations go to Congress, where only a negative vote by both houses can stop the base-closing process.
In its last round in 1993, the commission closed 35 major bases and reduced or consolidated 27 others. More than 100 other smaller installations were closed or consolidated.
It usually takes five to six years to close a base, and in the short term is very costly. By the end of the decade, the Defense Department expects to save about $ 4 billion a year from the 70 major bases closed in the first three rounds. The department operates 470 bases and installations around the country.
Since 1990, the military has closed more than 800 installations overseas, including scores of small installations, but those do not require commission approval.
In making their recommendations, the armed services used the same eight criteria employed in previous base-closing rounds. These measures include military usefulness, operating costs, projected savings, economic impact to local communities and environmental impact.
 The article and the chart included one base erroneously in some copies; Ellsworth Air Force Base in Rapid City, S.D., was not on the Pentagon's list for closing. In addition, the chart listed another base incorrectly in some copies; Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, Mass., is not scheduled to close.

State Rakes In Extra Cash

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
State bookkeepers got a pleasant surprise when they totaled January's tax collections, which took in $43 million more than anticipated. The difference reflected continued strength in New Jersey's economy, Brian Clymer, the State Treasurer, said yesterday. 
 So far, tax collections for the fiscal year that started in July have reached $8.4 billion, or $57.3 million more than projected. The biggest area of increase was in motor vechicle fees, which rose $10.2 million, showing continued strength in car sales, Mr. Clymer said. Corporate taxes were up by $7.9 million, excise taxes on alcoholic beverages up $2.1 million and lottery revenues up $1.6 million. There were slight decreases in other taxes, including the gross income tax, which was $50 million less than expected for January.

Focus on the Contemporary
The New York City Opera will increase its quotient of 20th-century opera during its 1995-96 season, which opens on Sept. 7 with Hindemith's rarely performed "Mathis der Maler" and also includes the American premieres of Toshiro Mayazumi's "Kinkakuji" on Oct. 19 and Jost Meier's "Dreyfus Affair" on April 2, 1996. 
 The premieres account for three of five new productions the company is offering in a two-part season that runs from Sept. 7 to Nov. 19 and from March 1 to April 21, 1996. The other new productions are Puccini's "Boheme," in a staging directed by Graziella Sciutti, and Strauss's "Rosenkavalier," a co-production with the English National Opera, the Los Angeles Opera and the Houston Grand Opera, to be directed by Jonathan Miller.
"I don't feel daring at all," said Christopher Keene, the company's general director. "I feel that this is what the City Opera should be doing. There was a long tradition of presenting contemporary work here in the early years, and even when we moved to the New York State Theater, that first season we did eight 20th-century works. We do very well at the box office with adventurous works, so long as we don't do too many performances of them. But that's equally true of 'Carmen.'"
"Mathis der Maler," composed between 1933 and 1935, is about the 16th-century painter Mathis Grunewald and is set in the context of tensions between Roman Catholics and Protestants and landowners and peasants. Banned by the Nazis, it had its premiere in Zurich in 1938 and was presented in New York City by the Hamburg State Opera in 1967. The City Opera is billing its production as the first professional staging by an American company. Rhoda Levine is the director.
"The Dreyfus Affair" has a libretto by George Whyte about the anti-Semitic trial in 1894 of Capt. Alfred Dreyfus, a French officer who was convicted of handing miltary secrets to the Germans on what later turned out to be fabricated evidence. Mr. Keene conducted the work's premiere in Berlin last season, and described its music as "eclectic, narrative and theatrical." Originally in German, it will be presented in an English version by Mr. Keene and Mr. Whyte.
The Hindemith and Meier works are part of a Freedom Cycle project being underwritten by Philip Morris Companies. City Opera describes the works in the cycle, which begins this season with "Harvey Milk," the Stewart Wallace-Michael Korie work that had its world premiere in Houston last month, as operas about "victims and victors, and the struggle for freedom from oppression." Future installments will include Hugo Weisgall's "Wall," Charles Wuorinen's "Celia, a Slave" and Anthony Davis's "Amistad."
The Mayazumi work is based on the Yukio Mishima novel "The Temple of the Golden Pavilion," about Mizoguchi, a disfigured monk who is obsessed with the Kikakuji Temple in Kyoto. It had its premiere in Berlin in 1976 and has a German libretto by Claus Henneberg. The City Opera production will use an English translation by Mr. Keene. Jerome Sirlin will design and direct the production, which is being underwritten by Music From Japan.
Mr. Keene is conducting all the new productions except "Der Rosenkavalier," which will be conducted by Alexander Sander in his company debut.
The revivals on the company's schedule are Verdi's "Attila," "Rigoletto" and "La Traviata," Mozart's "Magic Flute" and "Don Giovanni," Bizet's "Carmen," Puccini's "Turandot" and "Tosca," Gilbert and Sullivan's "Mikado," Lehar's "Merry Widow" and the Rodgers and Hammerstein version of "Cinderella."
Mr. Keene added that the company, hit hard by the recession two seasons ago, is looking at better times. In the first half of this season, it sold 82 percent of its tickets, up from 79 percent in 1993-94 and 72 percent in 1992-93.
Ticket information: (212) 496-0600.
 
4 U.S. Concerts Dropped
 The London Philharmonic had planned to give two performances each in New York and San Francisco on its way to a Far Eastern tour in mid-March. But the orchestra has dropped the American leg of the tour and will instead fly directly to South Korea for three concerts, and from there to Japan for five performances.
"No sponsor pulled out, as such," an orchestra spokesman said, "but the whole tour came together over a long period, and when we finally got through all the details, it was clear that it was not working out to be financially viable. It's very much our intention to get back to the States as soon as we can, probably for a more substantial tour."
Lincoln Center, which was to have presented the concerts on March 12 and 13, is offering refunds and exchanges at the Avery Fisher Hall box office or by mail from Lincoln Center Productions, 10 Lincoln Center Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10023, attention London Philharmonic. Information: (212) 580-5030.
 
Contest for Conductors
 The first Leonard Bernstein Jerusalem International Conducting Competition is open to conductors between the ages of 24 and 37. The preliminary screening, by videocassette, is to take place between April 15 and May 12. Regional auditions are to be held in the United States, England, Austria, Japan and Israel in June and July, and the final rounds, in Jerusalem, are scheduled to run from Oct. 2 to 14. There will be no ranking of winners and no limit to the number of laureates, each of whom is to receive a $ 25,000 cash prize, a medallion and conducting and recording opportunities.
The conducting competition is the first in a sequence of contests to be held under the Bernstein banner. In 1996 there will be singing competition, and in 1997 composers will compete. There is talk of adding a competition for educators, although a format for that has not yet been determined.
Applications for the conducting contest are available from the Leonard Bernstein International Music Competitions, 11 Rivka Street, P.O. Box 10185, Jerusalem 91101, Israel, or by telephone (011-972-2-735032) or by fax (011-972-2-716380).

HEADLINE: Is the Fed's Promised Land Appearing on the Horizon?

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
In a characteristically careful way, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, told Congress this week that the economy might be entering the moderate-growth/low-inflation mode that for a policy maker is the functional equivalent of the Promised Land.
And for the investor, that would mean an end to rising interest rates. 
 While this is welcome news, Steven Janachowski, a principal at Brouwer & Janachowski, a San Francisco investment advisory firm, said that a change in Fed policy ought not to be the primary basis for investment decisions.
"We don't believe in structuring portfolios based on an economic forecast," said Paul K. Napoli, executive vice president in charge of the personal investment division at the United States Trust Company.
"The data Mr. Greenspan is relying on are short-term, and subject to revisions," Mr. Napoli added. "So I am not so sure I would like to run out today and say this is the best time to buy stocks and bonds."
Still, Mr. Napoli and others concede that now is a particularly good time to be buying high-quality intermediate-term -- that is, three to 10 years -- debt securities. With yields on such Treasury notes hovering around or just over 7 percent, and inflation remaining around 3 percent and unlikely to go markedly higher, the real returns of 4 percent are handsome, they say.
"If you are someone who is shopping for income, this is a good time to consider getting back in," to the bond market, Mr. Janachowski said.
If the Fed has really finished raising rates, now is also an opportune moment to reconsider putting some money into foreign stock markets, the professionals say.
Many of these markets, particularly in countries with currencies linked to the dollar, have been battered in the last year, as local central banks have been forced to raise rates to keep in step with the Fed.
"If the economy really is slowing and United States rates really have peaked, then it is positive for all non-United States equity markets," said Richard H. King, who manages the $1.7 billion Warburg Pincus International Fund.
"Essentially, the world has pretty reasonable sustainable economic growth and low inflation, which is the best combination we have had in a long time," he added.
Over the last month, Mr. King said, he has been funneling money into Southeast Asian markets, including Hong Kong and Singapore. He said Australian and New Zealand equities should also stand to benefit if the Fed stopped tightening.
The Fed's quest for the Promised Land has taken many investors on a costly trip. To cool the economy and drive down inflation expectations -- to engineer, in short, a "soft landing" of the economy -- the Fed pushed up short-term interest rates seven times over the last year.
The impact of the Fed's moves was not confined to the domestic bond market, which in 1994 had its worst year since the Depression. Financial markets around the world were also rocked.
Mr. Greenspan did not rule out further rate increases, but in his testimony he made it plain that the upward phase of the interest rate cycle was nearing an end. Indeed, the Fed chairman said the central bank was prepared to ease monetary policy by lowering interest rates if outright signs of economic weakness began to crop up.
Mr. Greenspan would not have "used the 'E' word if he didn't think the Fed was now in a neutral policy mode," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence. "If we really are in a soft landing, we won't get any more tightening anytime soon."
The Fed's apparent change in approach "argues for a constructive attitude toward markets, but not a wild-eyed bullishness," said Neil A. Soss, a principal at Soss & Cotton, a New York money management firm.
One reason is that investors may have already missed some of the gains. The bond market has been rallying for more than three months. And various stock market indexes hit record levels before Mr. Greenspan testified last week.
Inevitably, many analysts remain skeptical, contending the Fed has much more to do to contain inflation and rein in the economy. And they worry that Mr. Greenspan's remarks may come back to haunt him.
"The chairman's statement virtually says the Fed will not respond any more until it becomes quite clear that inflationary pressures are worse," Henry Kaufman, who runs his own money management firm in New York, said.
"If that is the case, it will be the first time the Fed has moved off of a pre-emptive attack on inflation. That will raise the difficult question in the market that the Fed is being a laggard."
Mr. Kaufman views the drop in bond yields over the last few months as temporary. If money is to be committed to the fixed-income market, it should be in the short-term sector, he said, where a loss from another rise in interest rates would be less than on longer-term bonds.
Unlike the last year, though, when the bond market seemed to call the tune for stocks, Mr. Kaufman predicted that would change in 1995.
"There will be a departure from the performance of equities and bonds," he said. "This is a year when there will be continued strong profit growth, and that will be supportive of stocks. At some point, the bond market will labor, while the equity market continues to improve."

The Man Who Keeps 'E.R.' 's Heart Beating

BYLINE: By ANDY MEISLER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
ANY VISITOR TO THE BURBANK production offices of "E.R.," the NBC medical drama series, could quickly discern who is the guiding force behind the biggest network hit in several years.
It is not Michael Crichton, the novelist and screenwriter, who created the show, wrote its pilot episode -- and departed almost immediately to write new novels. It is not Steven Spielberg, whose Amblin Television company took the project to a big studio, Warner Brothers. It is not Leslie Moonves, the president of Warner Brothers Television, which produces the show for NBC. 
 It is a man named John Wells, a veteran television scriptwriter, most notably for "China Beach."
At any one moment, Mr. Wells is supervising the content and execution of at least four one-hour episodes in various stages of development -- from script to filming to editing to post-production. Future story lines of the series are also his responsibility: on the walls of the conference room next to his office are whiteboards covered, in felt-tip markers, with dozens of handwritten dramatic situations and plot twists, approved by him and cleared for use in episodes as yet unwritten. In the term of the trade, Mr. Wells is "E.R." 's show runner.
For the last 10 years at least, the person with that unofficial title has been the true auteur of series television. Day to day, a show runner makes all important decisions about the series' scripts, tone, attitude, look and direction. He or she oversees casting, production design and budget. This person chooses directors and guest stars, defends the show against meddling by the network or production company and, when necessary, changes its course.
Even in this notoriously collaborative medium, show runners are responsible for what viewers see on the screen. Yet the show runner's true position and influence are unknown to nearly everyone on the other side of the picture tube.
On a Monday morning about two months ago, the first task facing Mr. Wells was to prepare the season's 14th episode, to be filmed the following week. Mr. Wells had written the script; he plans on writing at least 5 during the 26-episode season.
"What's the figure?" he asked, turning to his casting director, John Levey.
"$56,709," said Mr. Levey, half-jokingly, referring to the projected cost of hiring guest stars and supporting cast. Mr. Wells next led a freewheeling discussion about the availability and desirability of several actors familiar to television audiences. Then he inquired about the status of a handful of previously used bit players whose recurring minor characters -- nurses, hospital staff members' children, police officers -- Mr. Wells had written in.
Next, Mr. Wells discussed with some of the show's assembled writer-producers and production coordinators how scenes shot on location in Chicago (the fictional setting for "E.R.") would be melded with scenes filmed on the Warners sound stage. A previously filmed episode needed "pickups" -- scenes filmed again because for various reasons they did not match the scenes surrounding them. Mr. Wells ordered them.
"O.K., let's get into this one," said Mr. Wells, opening the 70-page script. With the director, James Hayman, taking notes, Mr. Wells led a shot-by-shot dissection.
One scene involved a doctor working frantically over a patient inside a speeding ambulance. Was everyone "on the same page," Mr. Wells asked, about exactly how to film such a scene inside a stationary, hand-rocked ambulance mock-up?
In a comic subplot, a poisonous snake gets loose inside the emergency room. What kind of snake should be used, and from where and for how much can it be rented? The prop master, Rick Kerns, produced Polaroid pictures of some venomous specimens available from a local animal handler who specializes in cinematic reptile rentals. Mr. Wells selected a yellow-eyelash pit viper.
How much blood should be visible during a certain operation? Mr. Wells asked Dr. Joe Sachs, one of the show's two medical consultants. A special kind of X-ray device is used with a catheterization procedure performed in the script. Mr. Kerns reported that a medical company was flying in the appropriate machine, complete with the technician needed to operate it, gratis.
In Mr. Wells's script a new regular character, Deb, played by Ming-Na Wen, upstages a fellow medical student, John Carter (Noah Wyle), when they are presenting their surgical cases in a hospital classroom. Upon reaching that point, someone gently questioned Mr. Wells about Deb's motivation for acting the way she did.
"Is she Machiavellian?" he asked.
"No, it's more that she's narcissistic," Mr. Wells said.
 
The Job Description
Big Picture, Little Picture
 For complicated reasons having to do with economics, ego and history, the title show runner never appears in the credits of a show. Indeed, the term is rarely even written down or mentioned to outsiders.
Every show runner is listed as an executive producer on a show's credits. Yet not every executive producer is a show runner.
Often, the show runner is the person who created the series. Sometimes, though, the show's creator ranks below the show runner; other times, especially on long-running series, the creator-show runner has moved on and bequeathed power to another.
Perhaps most surprising, show runners almost always emerge from the ranks of writers -- traditionally Hollywood's most underempowered profession. Nevertheless, the show runner's sovereignty is acknowledged by nearly everyone in television.
"The show runner is the person responsible for a show -- period," said Mr. Moonves of Warner Brothers, which currently produces 23 network series. "He is the creative dictator. Ultimately, all the calls in that area are his. He is in charge of the big picture and the little picture."
Caryn Mandabach, president of Carsey-Werner, which has produced "Roseanne" and "The Cosby Show," agreed: "The buck always stops with him."
And Stuart Bloomberg, ABC's executive vice president for prime-time programming, said, "When we're considering doing a series, one of the first questions we ask is 'Who's the show runner?' "
John Wells's eclectic background seems perfect for the job of show runner -- but like most, he toiled for years before he even realized he was heading toward such a post.
Raised in Virginia, West Virginia and Colorado, he graduated from the theater program at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, then worked as a stage manager in regional theater and at La Mama, the Off Off Broadway company. He moved up to producing stage shows in Los Angeles, and in the mid-1980's began to write.
In 1987 he produced a low-budget movie comedy, "Nice Girls Don't Explode." After four years on the writing staff of "China Beach," learning from its show runner, John Sacret Young, he became show runner on no fewer than five unsold pilots, and on a short-lived CBS series, "Angel Street."
Last year Creative Artists Agency, which represents Mr. Wells, set up a meeting between him and another client, Michael Crichton. "We had lunch," said Mr. Wells, "and we really hit it off. I had read the script and had a lot of things to talk about, and he really agreed with what I had to say." Mr. Wells was put in charge.
 
The Long Workday
'This Is Like Flying A Jet Plane'
 Mr. Wells's busy Monday proceeded. With a select group of producers, he discussed the problems on episode 13, which was being filmed on the sound stage a few hundred yards away. Its director was a day behind schedule, a major delay on an eight-day shoot. "She knows she's in trouble," said a producer. "We don't want to put more pressure on her."
Mr. Wells, who had been viewing the footage already shot by this director on her first assignment for "E.R.," concluded that she had been trying to capture too many long, complicated scenes in one take. Instead, she should be breaking the scenes up into more easily filmable parts. A producer was deputized to go to the sound stage and gently make this "suggestion."
Immediately after this decision was made, Mr. Wells received an unscheduled visit from George Clooney, who plays Dr. Douglas Ross. Mr. Clooney, in an off-duty costume of baggy T-shirt and work pants, declined to let a reporter sit in on his conversation with Mr. Wells. Mr. Clooney emerged from the conference room 15 minutes later, apparently in a good mood.
Mr. Wells then moved to his office for lunch -- and simultaneously to view a preliminary edit of episode 12 on his office television set. Surrounded by about 10 staff members, including editors, writer-producers and the show's other medical adviser, Dr. Lance Gentile, he munched through the rough cut, which was still without music and sound effects, and made copious notes.
Then, while watching dailies of episode 13 -- this time viewing several different versions of various scenes -- he covered many more pages of his legal pad.
Mr. Wells next walked with Mr. Hayman, the director, to Mr. Levey's casting office across the Warner lot. For several hours he sat in on final readings for a half-dozen or so guest roles on episode 15.
Five or six actors read for each part. The aspirants ranged from pre-teen-age members of an inner-city acting workshop (for the part of a young gang member who terrorizes the hospital) to several familiar-looking female character actresses, including a well-known movie star of 15 or 20 years ago (for the part of a hospice nurse).
Mr. Hayman and Mr. Levey coached the actors, asking for occasional "adjustments" in their deliveries. But no final choices were made without Mr. Wells's nod.
By the end of the casting session, it was late afternoon. Mr. Wells left to watch yet another episode and indicate where music and sound effects should be added. After that were administrative tasks, and phone calls to return, stretching into the night.
"You know," said Mr. Wells a bit wearily, during a brief conversation between editing sessions, "this is like flying a jet plane. There are just so many ways to screw up.
"I think personally, the biggest mistake is trying to do it all by yourself. You have to accept total responsibility while also accepting the fact that it's a large collaborative effort. When I look at an episode and see only my own contribution, that's not a successful episode. When I can see bits and pieces of everyone's contribution, I think: 'That's a successful episode.' "
 
The Evolution
Why Rob Petrie No Longer Exists
 Indeed, it is the unusual ability to be at once a creative wellspring, a capable team leader and a bottom-line administrator that makes an effective show runner such a rare commodity. The rewards are accordingly handsome: $25,000 to $50,000 an episode, plus hefty fees for writing scripts, plus residuals, plus occasional participation in syndication profits.
Although show runners' names are no more than vaguely familiar to the public, the proven ones are well known in the television industry. Those who have established themselves on hourlong dramas include Jacqueline Zambrano ( "Under Suspicion"), John Romano ("Sweet Justice"), Patrick Hasburgh ("Seaquest DSV"), Chris Carter ("The X-Files"), Ed Sherin ("Law and Order") and Gregory Hoblit ("N.Y.P.D. Blue").
On sitcoms, which are performed like very short plays before audiences and are filmed or taped on permanent stage sets, the show runner's duties are somewhat different. Specifically, they encompass supervision of all onstage rehearsals in the five-day production cycle and the often frantic script rewrites that accompany them.
Sitcom show runners include Marc Flanagan ("Grace Under Fire"), Rob Ulin ("Roseanne"), Yvette Denise Lee ("Living Single"), Christopher Lloyd ("Frasier"), Michael Moye ("Married . . . With Children"), David Duclon ("Family Matters") and Jeffrey Lane ("Mad About You").
The average viewer's conception of how a television series is made may still be based mainly on the fictional relationships between the "head writer" Rob Petrie, the "producer" Mel Cooley and the "star" Alan Brady on the old "Dick Van Dyke Show." And it is true that many early television shows were the fiefs of actor-producers like Desi Arnaz or Danny Thomas. Others were produced by the same cigar-chomping wheeler-dealers long associated with the assembly-line production of motion pictures. By the 1960's, however, it was clear that there were increasing differences between a good television series and a successful movie.
"Movies were more and more about stars and spectacle and visual effects," said Mr. Romano, who was a Dickens scholar and an assistant professor at Columbia University before becoming a television writer. "Television, on the other hand, is seen on a small screen. It always has and always will depend almost solely on character and dialogue. And the only people who can give you that are writers."
This caused a subtle power shift, paving the way for idiosyncratic writer-producers like Norman Lear, Larry Gelbart and Stephen J. Cannell. And especially Steven Bochco -- whose "Hill Street Blues," with its story "arcs" that stretched over several episodes and its rapidly evolving regular characters, changed the medium in ways not really understood at the time.
"It meant that a show had to have a large and very competent permanent full-time writing staff," Mr. Wells pointed out. "In the old days, on shows like 'Mannix' or 'Hawaii Five-0,' the main characters didn't change much; the episodes could be written and run in any order. So producers hired maybe one or two story editors who farmed out most of the scripts to freelance writers.
"But then, as the shows became increasingly complex, working on a character level as well as a plot level, it became obvious that freelancers wouldn't be able to keep up with the characters' development. So increasingly, people were brought onto staff because they had to be right there to know all the things that were happening to the characters.
"And that led, as the stories became more complex, to the realization that what slowed shows down the most was a lack of good writers. So if you wanted a really good writer on a show, that writer increasingly demanded more creative control."
Creative control meant that the writer-producer surpassed the nuts-and-bolts-type "line" producer. As that happened, Rob Petrie's old "head writer" title became obsolete. Today, he would probably be a show runner, with hegemony over Mel and perhaps even Alan.
But as a viewer, you wouldn't know that. Because what has remained the same over the years is a vague and opaque system of on-screen credits and, for reasons that go back to the dawn of the movie era, a reluctance to give credit where credit is due.
"Let's face it," said a publicist who insisted on anonymity. "Who are the viewers most interested in? Some guy who types and sits in his office 80 hours a week, or the good-looking men and women who appear on their television sets every week?"

Children's Seats In Air Faulted

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
THE Federal Aviation Administration has tested forward-facing child safety seats certified for use aboard airplanes and found them wanting.
The results do not mean that parents who ordinarily take forward-facing safety seats aboard to buckle in larger children, those over the age of 2 and under about 3 1/2 years, should stop doing so: At the moment there is no substitute. It does mean that forward-facing safety seats bearing a Government seal for use in a car or plane may not safeguard their riders in a survivable air crash. Rear-facing safety seats for smaller children were judged safe. 
 In tests conducted last summer by the F.A.A. labs, five types of child restraint devices, holding test dummies, were fastened into airplane seats and put through simulated crashes. Forward-facing seats, backless booster seats and torso harnesses did not protect dummies from severe head impact. Although the report was published in September, it received little attention.
The author of the F.A.A. research, Van Gowdy, supervisor of biodynamic research at the F.A.A. Civil Aeromedical Institute in Oklahoma City, said that as long as safety seats were certified for air use after an automotive test, parents were going to presume a "significant level of safety" would be provided. "There is no evidence to support that," Mr. Gowdy reported at a conference on airline safety sponsored by the Southern California Safety Institute in Torrance, Calif., early this month.
Mr. Gowdy said existing test specifications for seat use in cars did not recreate cabin conditions.
In discussing his findings in Torrance, Mr. Gowdy noted the established fact that auto travel, by any calculation, was far more dangerous to children than air travel. According to Dr. Jeffrey J. Sacks at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, auto crashes kill or injure 79,000 children under 4 in a year. Even an airline year like 1994 may bring the death of one or two young children and perhaps six injuries.
 
Flying in a Lap
 In the F.A.A. tests, rear-facing seats, which are used for children under 20 pounds, usually about 2 years old, were effective in safeguarding riders. However, because airlines let children under 2 travel without tickets, they often sit in adults' laps instead. Safety seats may be used only for children under 2 if a child has a ticket or a flight attendant allows use of an adjoining empty seat.
At the upper end of the toddler range, children who have reached the age of 3 or 3 1/2 years old -- who must be ticketed -- can use regular airline lap belts and enjoy a degree of safety nearly comparable to adults. So the hazard continues for infants under 2 who are not placed in the rear-facing safety seats, and a new hazard has been revealed for children too large for these seats and too small to use an adult belt: the current Government-approved forward-facing safety seats do not do the job because the certifying tests are inadequate.
The conference, attended by airline employees and commercial safety trainers as well as enforcement officials, heard several times about the F.A.A.'s lack of a safety rule on infant seating.
James M. Hall, head of the National Transportation Safety Board, said that his agency, which investigates transport accidents and recommends changes, had repeatedly pressed the F.A.A. on this: "It continues to rebuff our requests that all be secured in takeoff, landing and turbulence."
Nothing prevents an airline from acting on its own, but Dean M. Resch, head of the survivability division of the F.A.A., said in an interview that if the cost of safety changes was greater than the legal liability, the airlines would not act alone. Airlines have said that if parents were compelled to buy tickets for infants, too, they might drive instead of flying. "If the public raises the issue, something will be done," Mr. Resch said. "But it doesn't mean much to anyone unless you are the parents of those kids who died."
How have safety seats for children been labeled safe for use in planes when three types cannot do the job? This question was asked repeatedly at the meeting of 300 people that heard Mr. Gowdy's report.
 
Tests Based on Autos
 The answer is that the seats are tested in devices that simulate automobile seats and belts, but without a barrier in front to represent a dashboard or a front seat. The automotive tests presume a 32-inch open space for a child's head to be flung forward into in a crash. When the child is in a forward-facing safety seat in an economy-class airplane seat, there is just 32 inches between the back of one seat and the back of the seat behind it. Films showed the dummies' heads hitting the seat ahead with tremendous force.
Mr. Gowdy undertook these tests at the request of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, manufacturers of child safety seats, the F.A.A., the National Transportation Safety Board and a few airline associations. The tests could not undo the certification provided by the highway safety agency. The brand names tested were given in the report, but not linked to the individual results.
Five brands of rear-facing seats performed well. One torso harness approved for airline use was too loose and too elastic and was judged unsatisfactory. A belly belt approved for use in England to hold a child less than 2 on an adult's lap was also unsatisfactory. "The impossibility of protecting a small child, by any means, sitting on the lap of an adult restrained by a seat belt was confirmed," the report said.
Seven models of forward-facing seats approved for both car and plane use were tested, plus one seat built overseas specifically for airplane use. Two failed because they could not be belted in. In the six others, the dummy's head received severe blows. When the airplane seat belt anchor was shifted 4.8 inches above the regular site and 4.5 inches to the rear, before the seat was installed, the dummy's head did not hit the seat ahead, but this adaptation cannot be made on the spot.
 
Seat Belts Found Better
 Four approved booster seats, the backless models with swing-aside shields that are often used for children over 2 because they are more compact to carry, were tested. One seat disintegrated. And in three, the dummy's head hit a locked seat back in the next row. If the child is big enough to ride in a booster seat, the report said, he or she will be better off using an adult seat belt.
A 3-year-old will get acceptable restraint in an adult belt although it will be near its minimum length, the report said.
The F.A.A., according to Fraser Jones, a spokesman, is working with the highway safety administration to revise the standards for the tests that certify the seats.
The F.A.A. report, "The Performance of Child Restraint Devices in Transport Airplane Passenger Seats" by Van Gowdy and Richard DeWeese, is available for $17.50 plus $4 shipping from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Va. 22161; (703) 487-4600.

The N.E.A. Is Elitist, True. It Should Be.

BYLINE: By Edward Rothstein 

 BODY:
DEBATES ABOUT THE NATIONAL endowment for the Arts tend to become fairly pious, so Americans will no doubt be hearing many grand proclamations beginning on Wednesday, when the Senate Appropriations Committee starts its hearings on the endowment. In recent months, House Speaker Newt Gingrich has attacked the Government agency for supplying "patronage for an elite group." The N.E.A. has responded by citing evidence of the spiritual, social and economic benefits of the arts for all Americans.
Both the attack and the defense are misguided. Populist conservative critics, in accusing the endowment of "elitism," are echoing a criticism the agency addressed long ago. In 1991, for example, endowment literature pointedly portrayed the agency as nonelitist, boasting that it served 170 ethnic minorities and insured a broad distribution of benefits, taking into account race, ethnicity, sex and geography. Unfortunately, those criteria have little to do with artistic judgment and much to do with social policy. When it comes to art, there is no way of judging even vastly divergent styles without some notion of differentiation and choice -- in other words, elitism. If the N.E.A. is doing its job properly, Mr. Gingrich should be praising it, not condemning it, for being elitist. 
 What's more, the endowment's defense that it is socially useful is both a distraction and a liability. In one of its publications, the N.E.A. said it supported arts education in schools because the arts improved grades, self-esteem, attendance and "social equity." But once art is treated as a form of therapy, either for society or for the individual, it must be judged as political or social policy. Some artworks have espoused the same goal, thus inviting political, not simply esthetic, criticism. The economic and social benefits of art should be secondary considerations, supplements not essentials. It is on the basis of the artworks and their importance to this country that the debate about the N.E.A. should be carried out.
A look at the N.E.A.'s music program may help clarify the issues. Mr. Gingrich's charge of elitism criticizes the audience as well as the art; he is asserting that Federal funds are supporting entertainment for the wealthy. At a time when budgets are being slashed in social services, why should the arts be immune?
But he has it wrong. Audiences at recitals, orchestra concerts and the opera are drawn largely from the middle class. And the performance of music -- art music as well as pop -- has traditionally been a way out of the lower classes for talented young people. Congress may still decide that support of music is too much of a luxury, in which case many Americans will mourn the loss and gaze in envy at more visionary civilizations.
Congress would be missing a great opportunity. Of all Government programs, the N.E.A. probably has the greatest impact, given the cost involved. Omus Hirshbein, who directs three endowment programs -- for music, opera and musical theater, and presenting institutions -- reports that less than $17 million is budgeted for music or music institutions in this fiscal year, a small fraction of the endowment's $167 million budget. The vast majority of presenting organizations, ranging from university associations to institutions like Symphony Space on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, will receive $15,000 or less; the largest grant to a single presenting agency will be $23,000. Smaller orchestras may receive a mere $5,000. The five largest orchestral grants are $236,400 apiece, amounting to less than 1 percent of each recipient's budget.
These sums have an importance far beyond their size. A grant from the N.E.A. provides an imprimatur that attracts additional support from local governments, foundations and private patrons. The endowment says each dollar it grants may be used to raise as much as $11 from other sources. And in some cases -- like grants given to composers -- the endowment plays the classic role of patron, bringing new works into existence.
The agency, then, can potentially supply crucial leadership in the music world at a very low cost. But is it up to the task? Are decisions made according to the rolling of various logs, personal or political? Can the N.E.A. act as a true patron, or must it act merely as an agency? Tone and taste become important.
THERE NOW SEEMS TO BE SOME HOPE. MR. Hirshbein, whose leadership of the performing arts program at the 92d Street Y was a boon to New York's musical life, inspires confidence. Since moving to the N.E.A. last May, he has expressed an interest, for example, in finding ways to increase touring by solo recitalists and jazz ensembles, to help underfinanced opera companies present interesting repertory, and to improve arts education by working with local school districts. He is also, he said, "looking for more efficient ways to bring composers and sponsors together."
Politics, of course, will still be an issue in the music program. It is bound to be, since the N.E.A. is by definition a political institution, meant to serve a diverse public. The question is, How can sophisticated and elite tastes be applied without falling prey to either orthodoxy or populism? Conflict is unavoidable. The hope is that the results will be both elite and thoroughly nontherapeutic.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
A Big Brokerage Set to Descend on Midtown South

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
CORPORATE paths sometimes cross in unpredictable ways. Just as the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company was moving employees out of its imposing North Tower building at 11 Madison Avenue, at 25th Street, to make it available for general leasing, CS First Boston was facing a crucial decision. It had to decide where to park itself once its principal midtown lease expires in 1996.
These coinciding circumstances led eventually to a momentous handshake in January. CS First Boston, one of the city's largest brokerage and investment banking firms, agreed to lease 1.1 million square feet of space in the building for 20 years. That's more than half the building's total space. 
 The deal gives Met Life a fulltime guest in a corporate cluster it developed for its own use over the better part of the century. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced the agreement Jan. 24. The final terms of the lease are still in negotiation.
For the Midtown South area in general, the deal widens the scope of business activity to include brokerage and investment banking, functions generally associated only with the midtown and downtown office districts. But it also demonstrates the key role of city government in holding large employers in the city.
CS First Boston wanted to stay in Manhattan, its officers said, but would not have been able to do so without a package of benefits it negotiated with the city's Economic Development Corporation.
"In our case, the economics of the deal meant everything," said Robert Raziano, chief financial and administrative office of CS First Boston. "Even with the city's package, premises costs would have been as much as 10 percent cheaper in the Jersey City enterprise zone. We were close to signing up to build a million square feet in what would have been a more efficient building. But we wanted the city's help to be able to stay in New York."
The city's package is linked to job growth. It will have a value in current dollars of $50.5 million over 20 years if employment grows to as many as 5,500 employees. The value of the deal is $32.8 million if employment stays at the current 3,700 level.
About 80 percent of the benefit will come in the form of exemptions from state and city sales taxes on equipment and machinery, a major factor as CS First Boston goes forward with what it says will be an investment of $300 million to prepare its 11 Madison Avenue space.
In interviews, officials of both companies elaborated on the events that got them together.
As recently as 1990, Met Life had about 6,400 people working in its 3.8-acre office cluster, east of Madison Square Park between 23d and 25th Streets, from Madison Avenue to Park Avenue. It has 3.3 million gross square feet of space on those two blocks, 1.1 million of it in the South Building, which includes the original Met Life Tower with its celebrated clock, and 2.2 million square feet in the North Building.
Of the total, 4,000 people worked in the North Building and 2,400 in the South Building. Now, total employment at Madison Square is down to 3,000, all in the South Building. A thousand employees have been moved to 200 Park Avenue, the former Pan Am building, which Met Life owns; another thousand throughout the region have taken voluntary separation. Other employees have been scattered to offices in the metropolitan area. Total Met Life employment in the metropolitan area has shrunk to 5,100.
Met Life is already far advanced on a $300 million upgrading program at 11 Madison Avenue, which was built in three stages between 1930 and 1950. It has 29 floors above street level and one of the city's longest, most elegant lobbies. The reconstruction work has included the demolition of mezzanine levels to create three 100,000-square-foot floors with 17-foot ceiling heights, well-suited for trading activities. It also includes a reconfiguration of the core of the building, removal of a bank of elevators, and updated electrical and mechanical systems.
Martin Turchin, the Edward S. Gordon & Company broker who was CS First Boston's real-estate adviser, said that there was no building currently available in midtown that met the space and configuration needs of the company. Even those developers with ready-to-build midtown sites apparently would not have been able to match the floor sizes available at 11 Madison Avenue.
CS First Boston is taking four 100,000-square-foot floors -- three through seven -- and the second floor, with 40,000 square feet. It will also have eight tower floors -- 21 through 28 -- totaling 400,000 square feet, for executives and investment bankers. And about 180,000 square feet below street level will be used for cafeterias, a conference center and other common facilities. Occupancy is expected to start early in 1997.
Almost $100 million of the projected $300 million in fit-out costs will be for the technological component of trading, sales and research. Technology requirements lift the occupancy costs of brokerage firms well above those of most manufacturing companies, Mr. Raziano said. They are usually 7 to 10 percent of operating revenues, or even higher in a bad year for the cyclical industry.
FIGURES from CS First Boston on employee dispersal underscore the centrality of Manhattan as a corporate center and of New York City as a residence for white-collar workers. Of the 3,700 midtown employees, 61 percent live in one or another of the five boroughs. Of the rest, 15 percent are in New Jersey, 9 percent in Long Island, 8 percent in Westchester, and 7 percent in Connecticut.
Jobs in the "front office" category account for 71 percent of total employment. Total annual compensation (including year-end bonuses) is typically in the range of $150,000 to $200,000. Back-office jobs account for 29 percent of the work force, with pay typically in the range of $50,000 to $75,000 a year.
In moving to 11 Madison Avenue, the company will give up nearly 500,000 square feet in Park Avenue Plaza, or 55 East 52d Street, a Fisher Brothers building, plus 100,000 square feet at Tower 49, at 12 East 49th Street; 30,000 square feet at 509 Madison Avenue, at 53d Street, and 35,000 square feet at 599 Lexington Avenue, between 52d and 53d Streets.
CS First Boston acquired the "CS" in its name in 1993, when First Boston inserted the designation in front of all its international affiliates. It stands for Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank that holds the principal ownership stake in the company.
Clay B. Lifflander, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said that in providing tax relief to induce large employers to stay in the city the Giuliani administration was trying to link a portion of the benefits to employment growth. Growth triggers a certain amount of the benefits.
"In the $50 million CS First Boston package, about $18 million is predicated on their growth over time," he said. Besides the sales-tax forgiveness, the benefits package includes partial real-estate tax abatements and discounts on energy costs.
Mr. Lifflander also said that in recent deals the city had managed to lower the average length of time it takes to recover forgiven taxes through the direct and indirect tax revenue generated when a company stays in the city. "In previous deals the paybacks were six to seven months," he said. "We're down to four months."
By the city's calculation, CS First Boston's presence in the city with 3,700 employees will generate $115 million a year in direct and indirect tax revenues. The cost to the city in forgone taxes is $21.8 million. Indirect revenues come largely from sales taxes generated by employee spending.
At 11 Madison Avenue, Cushman & Wakefield is the brokerage in charge of leasing the remaining 800,000 square feet. Market rents in the area for direct leases are in the low $20-a-square-foot area, said Jeffrey C. Heller, a leasing agent, but within the area nothing is comparable to 11 Madison Avenue, especially in the size of its floors.
"The building will compete with midtown," said Mr. Heller.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Dr. Alan J. Sholomskas;
Treating Depression Among the Elderly

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
THE signs of depression can easily be mistaken for the normal signs of aging, making it difficult to recognize the disorder and get treatment for an older person.
But an estimated 1 percent to 3 percent of elderly people experience major depression, and the figures rise to 15 percent to 20 percent among older adults in hospitals and nursing homes, said Dr. Alan J. Sholomskas, the recently named director of psychiatry at the new geriatric medical psychiatric unit at Masonic Home and Hospital in Wallingford. 
 The 15-bed unit was opened last October to meet the needs of a growing number of people over the age of 60 who have both psychiatric and medical problems.
"Such specialized care has not been available in standard psychiatric or medical-surgical units," Dr. Sholomskas said. "Instead, patients are shuttled back and forth between medical and psychiatric departments, which makes treatment complex."
Dr. Sholomskas was a consulting psychiatrist with Masonic Home and Hospital for eight years. A resident of Guilford, he has a private practice in New Haven, is an assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine and is attending psychiatrist at Yale-New Haven Hospital and the Hospital of St. Raphael.
"Depression is every bit as treatable in older people as it is in the younger population, and there are reasons for treating it," Dr. Sholomskas said. "For one thing, it will improve their quality of life, which is a benefit to everyone."
In a telephone interview, Dr. Sholomskas discussed the strong ties between disease and depression and the reasons depression is overlooked in older adults. He also offered advice to family members caring for elderly relatives who may be depressed. Following are excerpts from that conversation:
Q. What are the signs of depression?
A. The main symptom is a sad mood or a loss of interest in life. This is the basic symptom. There are a number of other symptoms, although not all of them have to be present, including loss of more than 5 percent of body weight, decrease in appetite and sleeping difficulties. Some people either slow down or become agitated and overactive. Other symptoms are feelings of guilt or worthlessness, poor concentration and inability to make simple decisions. And finally, recurring thoughts of death, dying or suicidal thinking.
At least five of these symptoms must be present for at least two weeks in order to define major depression. Additional symptoms not on the basic list include anxiety, aches, pains, headaches and constipation. Hallucinations can occur when depression is so severe that a patient is out of touch with reality. Patients may hear voices telling them they have a fatal disease, they are poverty stricken or that terrible things will happen to them. The symptoms have a negative, self-punishing flavor.
Older people are less likely to report clear-cut sadness or depression. Instead, for example, a patient may say, "I feel terrible since the doctor gave me that antibiotic a month ago," when he actually feels depressed. Sometimes you may have to infer that a patient is depressed when he can't report it to you accurately. For example, a patient who has Alzheimer's disease can be depressed, but he wouldn't be able to say so. You would have to infer it on the basis of changes in behavior.
Q. Is depression a normal response to aging?
A. No. But it may be related to other problems of aging, such as loss of a spouse.
Q. Why does depression often go undiagnosed?
A. People are supposed to become more dysfunctional as they get older, so it is overlooked. Secondly, sometimes physicians feel there is no use in treating this disorder in a person who is not going to live that much longer. There's also the reluctance of elderly people to seek help, because they have grown up in a time when psychiatric help was not sanctioned.
In the general population, recent estimates are that 85 percent of depression goes untreated, so I would think it's at least that high among elderly people.
Q. What is the connection between depression and alcoholism or chronic disease?
A. Many people, either upon drinking or withdrawal from alcohol, develop depressive symptoms. Others drink as a way of alleviating depressive symptoms. Finally, there are those who have depression and drink, but the relationship isn't specific. They have different problems.
People who are chronically ill have a higher prevalence of depression than people who are not. In fact, among older people with depression, probably 80 percent or more have chronic illnesses. Also, specific chronic illnesses may contribute to depression. In Parkinson's disease, for example, depression develops as frequently as 40 percent of the time, and there is a very high prevalence associated with stroke.
Q. What factors place people at risk for depression?
A. Living alone, lack of social support, acute illness, severe pain and surgery. Loss of anything that contributes to their being involved with the world, such as vision and hearing. I would add retirement, children moving away and economic difficulties.
Limited mobility is a big factor. One man came to me depressed, and I initially thought it was because his wife had died recently. But that wasn't the case. She had been ill for years, and he felt relief after her death. But he lost his mobility when he ran his car into a telephone pole and totaled it. He was depressed because he no longer had a car.
Q. What treatments are available?
A. It depends on the patient's age, the severity of the illness, the types of stressors, whether or not the patient has a past history of depression and his ability to collaborate with treatment.
There are a number of psychotherapies. Those most useful for elderly people are short-term and behaviorally oriented. That is, they are less concerned with longstanding personality issues and the past than they are with current problems and attitudes toward those problems. Patients work on the negative thoughts that may contribute to depression.
Also, medications have been developed over the last 10 years that have fewer side effects. Electroconvulsive therapy, or shock therapy, although controversial, is the most effective treatment of all for serious depression. It can save a life.
Q. Can you explain electroconvulsive therapy?
A. Some people are so suicidal that they need to be under constant observation. Medications may take three to eight weeks to work and may not be safe to take because of co-existing medical conditions. Electroconvulsive therapy can work in as little as two weeks and is often safer. There are ways of doing it that minimize the effects of temporary amnesia that have occurred in the past. It has been refined. Two electrodes are applied to the head, and the very brief, small electrical current that is given is less than you would have if you had a brain seizure.
Finally, psychosocial treatments can be useful, such as certain types of group programs. Another example would be finding a doctor for a person who has a problem getting medical care, arranging transportation so he can get to the doctor's office, finding a nurse to make sure he takes his medications safely and someone to help him locate financial resources.
Q. Can depression spread to other family members?
A. Other people in the family may be a bit demoralized or discouraged, although they probably won't be clinically depressed. As caretakers, they may become stressed, anxious or worried. Some family members may withdraw from the depressed person and protect themselves by distancing. Others become overanxious and try to do too much for the person. Or they become angry and frustrated. On the other hand, they may just deny there is a problem.
Q. What should I do if I suspect a member of my family is depressed?
A. It depends on the relationship you have with the person and the resources available. You can contact the family doctor, who may be able to evaluate the person and decide whether to send him for more formal mental health treatment or to counsel and treat the person himself. There are psychiatrists who specialize in geriatrics. And there are geriatric assessment clinics, where an elderly person's condition can be evaluated.
Sometimes it's difficult if the person refuses treatment. You try finding a person who can exert some leverage. That may be another member of the family or the family physician. If it gets too severe, you may actually have to take the person in hand and take him to an emergency room or doctor's office. Sometimes there's not much you can do except monitor them.
There are a number of ways you can get psychiatric help. One is by calling your family physician. They usually have consultants they work with. You can call the University of Connecticut or Yale medical schools or the Mental Health Association of Connecticut. You can also call a hospital and ask for a referral.

HEADLINE: New York Housing: Sellers Finally Sell

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
OWNERS of residential real estate in New York City, particularly those with co-ops, may look back on 1994 as the year when it once again became possible to sell their homes -- even studios and one-bedroom apartments. It still wasn't easy, and the big profits of the 1980's remained only a memory, but the increased demand and stable prices were a substantial improvement over the early 1990's, when market activity slowed drastically and prices fell.
The outlook for this year, however, is clouded by the specter of rising interest rates and fears that the region's economic recovery may be ending. Indeed, sales volume and prices for co-ops in Manhattan in 1994 -- though generally higher than in 1993 -- peaked last summer, according to the Real Estate Board of New York, and have been drifting downward for six months. 
 Mitigating this trend, though, is the fact that the traditional alternatives to buying real estate in the city have become unusually expensive. Market rents have rocketed in the last three years to near the peaks hit in the late 80's, largely because of the lack of new construction and a reluctance among many renters to buy. Suburban home prices, particularly in prime locations, are rising, too.
"New York City's real estate market has been making a slow, steady climb out of a recession," said Peter R. Marra, president of the William B. May Company, a Manhattan-based real estate broker.
Generalizations about real estate sales and prices in New York City are unusually risky, however. The market is as diverse as its population, and its trends are difficult to quantify. For instance, home sales prices rose by as much as 4 percent in 1994 in some parts of Queens, like Queens Village and Little Neck, according to an analysis of changes in single-family home sale prices by ZIP code in much of New York -- excluding Manhattan -- that was done for The New York Times by Case Shiller Weiss of Cambridge, Mass. In some parts of nearby Flushing, though, prices fell by as much as 8 percent.
Measuring the market is particularly confounding in Manhattan because the data are often sketchy, largely because the borough, south of 96th Street at least, is dominated by co-ops, for which sales are not publicly recorded; co-op sales are, technically, securities transactions and involve selling shares in a building rather than transferring a title to real property.
Elsewhere, the data can be even more imprecise. For example, in Brooklyn and the Bronx, where co-ops, single-family homes and condominiums are all found in large numbers, no central record-keeping of sales exists for any type of housing. In Queens, which also has a mix of co-ops, condominiums and single-family homes, only the sales of single-family homes are tracked by the New York State Association of Realtors -- but the figures are combined with those for Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and not broken out separately.
Only in Staten Island, where the market is made up mostly of single-family homes, is there reasonably exact data on sales volume. The number of homes sold there in 1994 rose 13.4 percent, to 887 from 782 in 1993, according to the New York State Association of Realtors.
Precise numbers also exist on the relatively small condominium market in Manhattan, where co-ops outnumber condominiums by about 6 to 1. According to data collected by Yale Robbins, a real estate publishing company, the number of condominiums sold in 1994 rose 16.5 percent, to 2,572, from 2,207 in 1993.
Though they are generally more expensive than co-ops, condominiums have increased in popularity since the late 80's, in large part because they have less restrictive ownership rules; in particular, they are easier for an owner to rent out. Common charges on a condominium, even after adding on property taxes, are also often lower than maintenance fees at comparable co-ops.
Further, buyers who are not citizens, or those who do not wish to divulge their finances, can buy a condominium without having to be scrutinized by a co-op board.
Elsewhere in the city, the volume of sales can be gleaned only from anecdotal evidence or, in the case of Manhattan co-ops, from reports prepared by real estate brokers surveying only a slice of the market.
In one of the larger surveys, produced by the Real Estate Board of New York, which incorporates transactions reported by several of the city's real estate brokers, the number of co-op sales in Manhattan rose by 26.8 percent, to 1,703 in 1994 from 1,343 in 1993; that number represents about 25 percent of the sales in the borough last year, according to the board.
The rise is generally attributed to relatively low prices, the increasing availability of financing, high rents for comparable apartments and a growing demand for larger co-ops because of an increase in households with children.
"Nineteen ninty-four was the year the co-op and condo market made its comeback," said Clark Halstead, founder of the Halstead Property Company, a Manhattan real estate brokerage.
Still, many apartment owners are having a difficult time selling. Laura and Gordon Hall, for example, have had their fourth-floor, two-bedroom, 1,100-square-foot apartment at 70 East 96th Street between Park and Madison Avenues on the northern edge of Carnegie Hill in Manhattan on the market for three years. They're asking $229,000; their maintenance is $1,023 a month. They have even had a few offers.
"We're optimistic," Mrs. Hall said. "We're getting more traffic. We're priced right."
As for sales price gains and losses in 1994, the picture in the city is even more difficult to capture than it is for sales volume. The annual report of the National Association of Realtors stated that the median home sales price for the city fell by 2.5 percent in 1994, to $168,700 from $173,000. That figure, though, does not include co-ops or condominiums, and it includes parts of Northern New Jersey, Long Island, Westchester County and Connecticut.
Even though the report is broad geographically and restricted to single-family homes, it does reinforce the widely held view among economists that the city's real estate market, overall, is in a period of relatively flat price appreciation, meaning a range from decreases of 1 percent or 2 percent year-to-year to increases of 2 to 4 percent, which is about the rate of inflation these days.
Part of this lackluster performance comes because of the waning influence of the baby boomers -- who as adults entered the starter-home market at the same time in the 80's and helped swell prices -- and the migration of young, educated workers and their families out of the city to the suburbs and, increasingly, other parts of the nation.
Indeed, Ms. Hall noted that should she sell her apartment she may move her family to Connecticut. "We have two kids, and there's more space, better schools," she said.
More important, perhaps, the economic recovery in the city in the last two years has been weak and appears to be fading.
"The New York City area has stalled and, frankly, the region is flirting with recession," said David G. Hensley, a vice president and economist with Salomon Brothers in New York. "The culprits are downsizing on Wall Street and in government."
The co-op market, in particular, has been the source of much negative publicity in the last five years, which has raised fears among many potential buyers. The publicity generally concerns complex financial troubles involving newly converted co-ops or large losses suffered by those who bought overpriced studios and small one-bedroom apartments in the 80's and then saw prices plunge by as much as 40 percent.
"I'll never buy in the city again," said Shelley Warren, who owns a 1,000-square-foot one-bedroom co-op at 317 East 70th Street on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. "I don't want to deal with the boards. I hear horror stories."
Ms. Warren, a garment saleswoman, has had several offers to buy her co-op for $145,000. She has, however, decided against selling -- except, perhaps, at a higher price -- because she wants to rent but can't afford a rental comparable in size and locale.
"I'm not sure what I am going to do now," she said.
Despite the lingering fear of co-ops, sale prices in 1994 appear to be rising off the bottoms hit in 1992 and 1993, as the memory of the real estate recession fades. Many co-op prices have also fallen so low that they are now cheaper to own and maintain than a rental apartment.
"Overall, we expect to see a modest increase in values, probably 1 to 3 percent," said Caroline Blakely, vice president with the National Cooperative Bank. "The hottest markets are the upper end -- the Upper East Side, Upper West Side, downtown."
These gains, however, are little more than estimates. The main method used by most brokers to measure appreciation -- comparing median sales prices in a given area -- is generally considered by economists and statisticians to be of limited use in a real estate market because its results can be skewed by a lack of market activity or a pattern of dissimilar sales in different years. The data from the Real Estate Board of New York, for example, on quarterly price appreciation for co-op apartments by room size for the entire borough is based on fewer than 100 sales in most quarters.
The Real Estate Board's data is also biased geographically, with 75 percent of the sales occurring between 57th and 96th Streets and slightly more than half coming from the Upper East Side. It also reflects sales made with the record bonuses paid out on Wall Street last spring, as well as mortgages with interest rates that were close to 20-year lows during the early parts of 1994. Since then, interest rates have increased by more than 2 percentage points, and Wall Street, pummeled by losses in the bond market last year, has cut back on bonuses and increased their pink slips.
Nevertheless, the numbers, and similar samples of broker sales figures, are the only statistics that exist for co-ops in Manhattan. According to the Real Estate Board of New York, median sale prices for studio apartments rose from $34,000 at the end of 1993 to $40,250 per room at the end of 1994; studios generally have one to two-and-a-half rooms. One-bedroom apartments rose from $51,548 to $55,000 per room; two-bedroom apartments rose from $72,889 to $78,889 per room; three-bedroom co-ops rose from $112,500 to $113,571 per room and those with four or more bedrooms fell from $187,500 to $158,750 per room.
Though the price per room for the largest apartments fell on a fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter basis, it rose -- to $172,822 from $168,182 -- when sales are compiled and compared for all of 1993 and 1994.
Brokers generally believe that the latter method gives a fuller and more accurate snap-shot of what is happening in the market these days.
"The market for luxury or family-size apartments is very competitive," said William Hunt 3d, co-founder of Hunt Kennedy Inc., a Manhattan real estate brokerage.
"More than any other area of the market, prices for luxury residences are being spiked up by a population explosion and baby boomlet," Mr. Hunt said. "New Yorkers are having children and buying more bedrooms."
For condominiums, the median price per room, according to Yale Robbins, stayed the same for studios and one-bedroom units -- about $60,000 for studios and $51,000 for one-bedroom apartments. For condominiums with two or three bedrooms, however, the per-room price increased from $94,400 to $110,000, further highlighting the demand for large apartments.
In an even more rarefied sector of the Manhattan real estate market, there were 53 town house sales in Manhattan last year compared with 46 the year before, according to Douglas Elliman, a Manhattan real estate broker. Many of them sold for $1 million to $2 million.
"When town-house sales dropped so substantially a few years ago, people came to realize that for the price of a rather expensive co-op apartment they could actually own a house," said Elizabeth Stribling, president of Stribling and Associates, a Manhattan real estate firm.
Outside of Manhattan, for a survey of price changes in single-family homes -- excluding condominiums and co-ops -- in Staten Island, the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, The New York Times used a computer analysis by Case Shiller Weiss. The company compares sale price differences in pairs of homes in the same area that were resold in 1993 and 1994. An average of 44 home sales were surveyed in each ZIP code.
That survey showed that prices of single-family homes rose the most, by at least 2 percent, in some instances by more than 4 percent, in Jamaica, Floral Park and a few other places in Queens as well as in parts of the Bronx and Staten Island. Prices also dropped the most in parts of Flushing -- by as much as 7 and 8 percent in two ZIP codes. They also fell by as much as 2 percent in other neighborhoods in Queens, like Long Island City, and in parts of Brooklyn.
"We see stable prices in Brooklyn and Queens," said Ms. Blakely with the National Cooperative Bank.

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES;
For Social Security Recipients, Higher Rates Loom

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
AS their 1994 tax returns are prepared, many retirees will discover that a much bigger chunk of their Social Security benefits is taxable.
The situation is quite irksome to Joseph Feinberg, a retired salesman who works part-time to supplement his retirement income. He puts in roughly 20 hours a week at the Bergen Tile Corporation in Brooklyn and would be happier to work more hours to earn more -- if those extra earnings were not going to tip the Social Security scale and devour more of his benefits. 
 "That money could pay for medications or other essentials that we need, especially now that my income is more limited," he said. "If I could work another 10 hours a week without being penalized, I'd do that."
The situation is also irksome to the Republicans, newly in power, and there is talk in Washington about rolling back the tax increase, which was passed as part of the 1993 tax act and took effect last year. Better-off Social Security recipients face paying income taxes on up to 85 percent of their benefits under the new law, compared with 50 percent under the old law.
Despite the complaints, tax experts do not foresee a rollback.
There will be a big wrinkle in the debate when Congress picks up the Social Security tax issue: money generated by the increase is dedicated to the Medicare trust fund. Hence, eliminating that source of revenue would require new sources to be found, and those could prove even more politically unpopular than the higher taxes on Social Security, experts say.
"I'm predicting that when Congress gets serious about examining the proposal, by the time the Senate looks at it, they might decide it's the lesser of two evils," said Pamela Pecarich, director of tax policy for the accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand, in Washington. "It may be easier to keep the new rules intact than reduce Medicare further."
Indeed, the cost of eliminating the increase would be great. The Treasury Department has estimated that the new tax on benefits should raise $15 billion in revenue during the first five years and $48.5 billion by the year 2005. Repealing the tax increase would be the fourth most costly item in the Republicans' Contract with America, the Treasury Department has calculated.
Because doing so would yield political pluses, "they'll try to do it, but it will be very difficult," said Richard A. Grafmeyer, a tax lawyer with the accounting firm Ernst & Young, in Washington.
Retirees under age 70 who have filed for Social Security benefits and then gone back to work, even part time, have long faced tax consequences, and those basic Social Security rules on benefits are not changing. People under age 65 must give up $1 in benefits for every $2 they earn over a certain amount, which is indexed annually for inflation; in 1994, that amount was $8,040, and for 1995 it will be $8,160. Retirees aged 65 through 69 forfeit $1 in benefits for every $3 earned above $11,160 in 1994 ($11,280 in 1995). People older than 70 can earn as much as they like without relinquishing any benefits.
Currently, the Internal Revenue code further subjects retirees to income taxes on 50 percent of their benefits when their adjusted income exceeds $32,000 for couples and $25,000 for single taxpayers. (Adjusted income includes adjusted gross income, tax-free interest, one-half of Social Security benefits and certain foreign-source income.)
But the new tax law goes a painful step farther, taxing up to 85 percent of the benefits of retirees whose adjusted income surpasses a second threshold: $44,000 for couples and $34,000 for singles.
"What's unfair about the 85 percent bracket is that people collecting Social Security contributed to the fund and paid tax already on the money," said Lou Lieberman, a Long Island accountant. "Why should people be penalized because they were able to accumulate wealth?"
Still, many people overestimate the impact of the new rule because they look at the total amount of benefits taxable, not just the increase. Because the tax is highly progressive, "it hits hardest at upper-income taxpayers, not so much at people with moderate incomes" of $55,000 or less, Ms. Pecarich said.
For example, a retired couple earning $54,000 would pay only $1,550 more in tax, she figured. By contrast, a couple earning $100,000 would pay $4,900 more.
To figure the actual increase, one must work through a complicated formula.
For example, a married couple with adjusted income of $47,000 and Social Security benefits of $14,000 -- about the maximum for 1994 -- exceeded the old $32,000 threshold by $15,000. So they paid taxes on $7,000, which equals the lesser of one-half of that excess or one-half of their Social Security benefits.
Now their adjusted income exceeds the new threshold of $44,000 by $3,000. Eighty-five percent of that excess equals $2,550. Add that to $6,000 (the lesser of their prior taxable amount of $7,000, or one-half the difference between the old threshold of $32,000 and the new one, $44,000) for a total of $8,550. That's the taxable amount, because it is less than 85 percent of their total Social Security benefits, which equals $11,900.
So their new taxable amount of $8,550 is $1,550 more than the amount on which they would have paid taxes in 1993.
There are very few ways to wiggle out from the tax increase.
One option for single retirees, both of whom collect Social Security, and who are thinking of marrying is to skip the wedding. This lets them sidestep the substantial "marriage penalty" built into the new tax rule.
The penalty arises because the new, higher threshold for the tax on Social Security benefits for single filers is only $10,000 less than that for married filers, allowing single persons to earn proportionately much more than married couples before their new threshold kicks in.
For example, two single retirees each with total income of $37,000, $12,000 of which was from Social Security, would each be taxable on $3,000 of their benefits because their adjusted income, $31,000, did not exceed the new threshold for singles, Ms. Pecarich said. If they married, they would immediately pass the second-tier threshold, and $20,400 of their total Social Security benefits would be taxed, an increase of $14,400.
Another option for retirees, single or married, is to try staggering income, thus creating alternating years of lower and higher income. Depending on income level, this strategy may result in their Social Security benefits being taxed only every other year.
There are several ways to manipulate dates of income. People can time withdrawals from individual retirement accounts, redemptions of United States savings bonds or sales of appreciated property to occur in alternate years. Social Security recipients might also try to stagger the dates that any United States Treasury bills fall due.

HEADLINE: A SENSE OF PLACE

BYLINE: By Glenn Collins 

 BODY:
WELL, who's this, making a surprise visit? Why, it's Mr. Toll, the legendary New Jersey Department of Transportation answer man. He is ready to respond to all those thorny travel-related questions about New Jersey's highways and byways. Here are some of the most commonly asked questions about the state's newest controversy.
Mr. Toll, what should we make of all this publicity about a merger of New Jersey's major highways? 
 I'm so glad you asked -- because this is the hottest topic right now in New Jersey transportation. It's true: Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said she'd like to merge the state's three largest toll-road authorities into one mega-agency. This would consolidate, and run, the Garden State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike and the Atlantic City Expressway. And we hope all of them will be run by the Department of Transportation.
The new statewide highway, or parkway, or turnpike, or expressway -- what will it be called?
No formal name has been chosen. But several possibilities are being considered -- the New Jersey Turnparkway, the Garden State Expresspike and the Atlantic City Turnway, not to mention a dark-horse candidate, the Garden Refinery Roadway. Until the state's voters can put it to a referendum, though, Mr. Toll can reveal that the working title, here at our agency, is: the New Jersey Dotway.
Why Dotway, Mr. Toll?
You know. For D.O.T., the Department of Transportation.
Oh. Well, why can't the Governor leave well enough alone?
Governor Whitman has said that merging the parkway, the turnpike and the expressway could eliminate bureaucracy, provide economies of scale in purchasing and ultimately reduce costs to motorists.
Will highway service be improved?
You have Mr. Toll's guarantee about that. Just consider: all of those traffic jams on the turnpike, the parkway and the expressway will now be merged into one centrally consolidated, less bureaucratic traffic jam on the sole state highway, the New Jersey Dotway. This concentration will insure that congestion is both easier to identify and to avoid. Unless you are unlucky enough to be stuck right in the middle of it.
How will tollbooths be affected?
Tollbooth imbalance is a serious matter that will be dealt with quickly in the initial merger of the three current New Jersey highways. A crash program of tollbooth construction is planned for the turnpike and the expressway, which are relatively devoid of tolls, to bring them in line with the optimum average on the Garden State Parkway, where tollbooths are currently placed on approximately every 25 feet of roadway.
How soon will the merger occur?
The plan will be approved very quickly, just as soon as consultants have been selected to study the feasibility of the merger. After their report, and the selection of the all-important secondary consultants who will carefully review the recommendations of the first, or original, consultants, rapid approval will be forthcoming. Of course, the merger is contingent upon the final consultant consensus that will be achieved, thanks to the third set of consultants that will be hired to review the work of all the previous teams.
But Mr. Toll, won't motorists be confused by the signs for the old turnpike, parkway and expressway?
Certainly not, since they'll be directed to their destinations by the bright, easy-to-read new signs that will replace the state's old, familiar highway logos.
But how will motorists know how to find the new highways if the old turnpike, parkway and expressway signs are gone?
Why, just look for the new statewide logo of the New Jersey Dotway. Mr. Toll refers to Dottie, the cute, cartoon-figure boa constrictor that extends its perky coils all over the Garden State. The logo was designed by the very same sophisticated minds who gave the state those New Jersey specialty license plates showing a lighthouse emblazoned with the slogan "Shore to Please."
Mr. Toll, will the new merged highways be privatized?
There is every possibility that such an enrichment to the state coffers can be achieved. Active negotiations for a potential sale are currently being conducted with a variety of respected firms in the private sector that have often done business with the state. The field has narrowed down to some especially spirited bidders, like the Hoffa Corporation and the Wiseguy Group Ltd.
How will highway tolls be affected?
Thanks to the cost of new signs, advertising and administration costs, tolls on the new Dotway will undergo a minimal surcharge of only 50 percent during the initial, or merger, period. Eventually, thanks to the long-term demands of consolidated highway management, tolls will no more than double.
Mr. Toll, will there be resistance to the planned consolidation of the highways?
In addition to the three highways' 3,500 employees, who rightly fear job reduction during the consolidation, some New Jerseyans will object because they have a nostalgic preference for the highway names of yesteryear. Mr. Toll is delighted to reveal, however, that no opposition is expected from Local 509A of the International Brotherhood of Bridge and Tunnel Trolls. The membership has voted overwhelmingly to support the merger unless its bridges are directly threatened in the new highway era.
Will other revenue-enhancing innovations be part of the merger?
Certainly! One that can currently be revealed by Mr. Toll: The Department of Transportation will start charging standard billboard advertising rates for the annoying little stickers that people place in the tollbooth coin baskets to get free publicity for their products.
Will the three different highways be made to resemble each other?
Yes. A three-phase plan is currently contemplated for the gradual integration of the visual environment of the three formerly independent roads. In phase one, scheduled for 1995, refinery accents will be added to the green environs of the Garden State Parkway and the Atlantic City Expressway. In phase two, scheduled for 1996, the refinery corridor of the turnpike will be reforested by the State Department of Environmental Protection. And in phase three, scheduled for 1997, sea gulls, salt marshes and gambling-casino stretch limousines will be transplanted from the Atlantic City Expressway to the turnpike and the parkway.
Mr. Toll, please tell us: Why have so many previous merger attempts failed?
Because powerful vested interests have selfishly chosen to oppose such reform.
But what has now changed, to make a merger possible?
Officials and workers on every level of the New Jersey highway-authority bureaucracy have accepted the necessity of the consolidation plan, and they are delighted to sacrifice their continuing employment for the greater good of the state.
Are you kidding, Mr. Toll?
Of course. Mr. Toll has always been famous throughout the state for his wry wit -- not to mention his jocular effervescence.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Emerging Markets Still Have Appeal

BYLINE: By Paul Lewis 

 BODY:
"POOR Mexico! So far from God and so close to the United States," said then-President Porfirio Diaz at the turn of the century when he sought sympathy for his country's predicament. Today he would have to admit that being America's neighbor has its advantages.
Now, when Mexico's economic luck runs out, Washington promptly declares a "systemic crisis" that threatens to send a recessionary shock wave throughout the developing world and mobilizes a $50 billion rescue package. The all-American $20 billion slice of that package was approved last week. And in an immediate sign of reviving confidence, private investors Wednesday only sold back to the Mexican Government $1.4 billion of short-term bonds, called tesebonos, although it offered to redeem $2 billion worth. 
 But unanswered questions remain. The International Monetary Fund has agreed to find another $17.8 billion. But where is the $10 billion that the Europeans are supposed to provide through the Bank for International Settlements, to say nothing of $3 billion promised by American and other private banks? And what about those new long-term bonds that Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz said "the finest minds in America" were designing to replace expiring tesobonos so Mexico need not redeem them for dollars?
The Mexican Government admits that it no longer expects 1 percent growth this year, not with interest rates at well above 40 percent on an annual basis.
Finance officials are putting the finishing touches on a revised stabilization plan that will take into account that their initial estimates of the crisis were far too optimistic. A group of American economists led by Jude Wanniski and backed by such Republican heavyweights as Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, and Jack Kemp, the Housing Secretary in the Bush Administration, want Mexico to use its emergency aid to buy its own currency and revalue the peso back to 3.5 to the dollar.
All these concerns are keeping many international investors wary of Mexico's markets, though not of other emerging markets. Judging by what fund managers say, the emerging markets game is far from over despite the reverses in Mexico.
"It's a bit early to look at equities in Mexico, but we'll probably be putting more money into other emerging markets this year," said Robert Heisterberg, senior vice president at the Alliance Capital Management group. "The developing world has the best growth."
Most emerging markets weakened perceptibly in the immediate backwash of Mexico's botched devaluation on Dec. 20, which is why the United States and the International Monetary Fund declared a "systemic crisis," fearing massive capital flight from all such markets.
But today the performances of Asian and Latin American markets are diverging.
Since Dec. 19, the day before the Mexican peso was devalued, Baring Securities' global emerging markets index has fallen 22.6 percent in dollar terms. But its Asian index is only down 3.79 percent while its European index, which covers Portugal, Turkey and Greece, is down 0.14 percent.
Its Latin American index, however, has tumbled a substantial 37.94 percent over the same period. But even within Latin America, differences are emerging.
While the Mexican portion of Baring's Latin American index is down 49.3 percent, the fall for Brazil is 38.06 percent, for Argentina 30.05 percent and for Chile, 13.47 percent. The Mexican crisis no longer looks systemic.
Taking a long view, investors who entered emerging markets early are still well ahead. The International Finance Corporation's global emerging market index, which started life at 100 in December 1984, stands today at 489.40, down some 15 percent from its September 1994 high of 623.87.
So it is not surprising to find many money managers still interested in emerging markets. Bill Wilbey, who runs Oppenheimer's Global Equity Fund, has 17 percent of his money in emerging markets. He has recently been moving back into Hong Kong and other Asian markets, though his exposure is well below the 40 percent he had there in 1993.
Justin Scott of the Putnam Group dislikes Latin America as a whole but says he will probably go back into Asia this year after reducing exposure there to 10 percent from 25 percent during 1994.
Michael Howell at Baring Securities keeps 20 percent of funds in emerging markets, mainly in Asia but also including Poland and Turkey.
Clark B. Winter, who runs the New York office of the London-based Global Asset Management fund group, says his GAM International Fund has always preferred Asia to Latin America and finds some shares there "very cheap."
For Morgan Stanley's Marianne Hay, however, the lesson of the Mexican crisis is that while emerging economies have the fastest growth and the highest profitability, their stock markets "now all offer much better value than they did a year ago."

THE ECONOMY
 
Greenspan Speaks, and Stocks Chalk Up Another Round Number
On Wednesday, Alan Greenspan spoke the magic words that people have waited a year to hear: the economy, he told Congress, "may finally be slowing." What he meant -- or what the markets assumed he meant, because he wields such vast power that he's got to be vague -- was that the Federal Reserve may be ready to stop tightening the screws with that drumbeat of interest-rate increases. And the next day, the stock market, which stalled out a year ago when those rate rises started, chalked up another milestone, with the Dow industrials closing over 4,000 for the first time ever -- and, yes, inched to another record on Friday. Whoop-de-do, some traders said -- no inflation, no recession, smooth sailing. But others cautioned that perhaps any celebration is premature. After all, the Dow is up just 0.8 percent in 13 months. 

Budget, Budget, Budget
That 100 days -- you know: the time it'll take Republicans to recreate the world -- came to its halfway point last week, with the budget, as always, a hot topic. In the House, the budget-cutters looked everywhere for trims. One proposal would take a huge bite -- $5.7 billion -- out of public housing. Another was far more modest but powerful in its symbolism -- a $171,000 cut for the Executive Office of the President. And the push to get a balanced budget through the Senate got two big allies in Tom Harkin and Joseph Biden, surprising Democratic defections.
 
Penn Station: Get Used to It
New York City would be wise not to expect any political favors these days -- like, say, Federal money to rebuild that rats' maze called Penn Station. Last week the House voted to take back $40 million already set aside for the project; if the Senate goes along, it'll be the death of travelers' dreams. The House said the money was needed to help put $3.2 billion into the military, but Representative Nita Lowey, a Westchester Democrat, had another explanation, saying, "New York-bashing is always in season." For surely Amtrak's busiest station deserves something like the glories of Washington's Union Station.
 
Can New York Live With It?
The death penalty. Swift and simple. A balm to the irate citizenry. And to put cold dollar signs on it, pushing some button is surely far cheaper than housing a murderer for life. . . . Wrong, all wrong. Because, quite simply, lawyers earn a lot more than guards. And it's lawyers who fly into action after a death sentence -- with appeals, appeals and more appeals. Not that a civilized society would have it otherwise; the legal process must be wrung dry. By one study, each execution in North Carolina cost $2.16 million more than life imprisonment. By another, reinstating New York's death penalty would cost, over five years, the same as hiring 250 police officers and building prisons for 6,000 inmates.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Good Neighbors
So, was that Mexican rescue plan wise? Imagine a rich family's house in a row of attached houses. The family clearly has an interest in not having the house next door collapse -- its own walls could be damaged. And the teen-ager next door is a good babysitter. Does the analogy hold? Perhaps. "Mexico was unique," said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. Mexico spends nearly as much on American goods as Japan does. But Alan Greenspan, calling Mexico the "first casualty of the new international financial system," stressed the hazards of a precedent -- of, basically, sending all the neighbors the message that the rich folks will fix the roof.
 
Russian Ads: Smoke-Free
With all the flak they get at home, American tobacco companies love foreign markets. Russia, where nearly 70 percent of adults smoke, is a gold mine. The companies are building plants all over Russia, and ads have appeared everywhere, with one public health expert calling the Marlboro Man the nation's "most popular man." But a less popular man named Boris Yeltsin decided last week that something should be done about skyrocketing cancer and heart disease rates. So, in an instant decree, he banned all tobacco and alcohol ads. The big question now is whether, in Russia, the ban will stick.
 
Don't Count Her Out Yet
One of the more grisly investments imaginable is a bet on when someone will die. Yes, yes, that's what life insurance is all about. But that's abstract death. Thirty years ago, a French lawyer bet on a specific life, exchanging a $500-a-month annuity for the rights to a 90-year-old woman's apartment when she died. To date, he's paid $180,000, three times what the apartment's worth. Last week the woman, Jeanne Calment, celebrated her 120th birthday. On her birthdays, she always writes the lawyer, "Sorry I am still alive." So there.
 
Crossing the Wrong Line
With Republican budget-slashing in the air, President Clinton badly wanted to come up with some revenue ideas of his own, and his eye alit on this nation's borders. Why not charge, say, $3 per vehicle to cross them? That would throw $400 million a year into the coffers, to be used to fight illegal immigration. But that modest proposal loosed a flood of outrage in border states, and last week, as he was to leave to see Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Mr. Clinton scrapped the idea. He's still for allowing states to impose border fees, but there's not much chance of that. Next idea?
 
COMPANIES
 
A Career Move to Watch
It was a snapshot that showed a far larger picture. There's a lot of talk about the decline of the old media, the rise of the new. But a single mid-life job hop last week summed it up at a stroke. Howard Stringer restored CBS's might after becoming its broadcasting president in 1988, but times have been rough lately -- ratings are down, it's the only network with no cable stake and rumors of a sale abound. And last week, after 30 years at CBS, Mr. Stringer quit to join a media-technology venture formed by three phone companies. It's rare "at this age to do something new and exciting," he said. "It's a big leap of faith" -- the type of leap the whole media universe is taking.
 
Whose Tax Refund?
It's that time of year. Christmas bills still aren't paid, heating bills are high, and it sure would be nice to get that tax refund quickly. Some people, in fact, want it so badly that they pay unmentionable interest rates to get the money in a day or so, with the I.R.S. sending the refund right to the lending bank. But the I.R.S. says the haste makes "refund anticipation" loans a hotbed of fraud, so it decided to send refunds to taxpayers instead, at the usual snail's pace. But a big lender, Beneficial National Bank, cried foul last week, saying that perhaps 30 percent of the time it would never see its money, and sought a court order to block the I.R.S.
 
Do You Smoke? You're Enrolled
When a New Orleans judge approved that class action against tobacco companies a week ago, it opened a floodgate. Smokers and ex-smokers called lawyers, newspapers, television stations, in-laws -- mainly with a single question: How do I get in on it? The answer: You're already in, whether you smoke or you've quit. If the class action wins any money from tobacco companies, you could get a cut. You need do nothing now. Yes, the lawyers will do an advertising blitz to notify you, and will set up a "900" toll number to field questions (given the interest, an "800" number could prove too costly), and you can officially join the class if it makes you feel better. Or you can just watch the show. O.J. it's not, but it could put money in your pocket.
 
A Report Card for H.M.O.'s
The scary thing about today's broad health care changes is that all these H.M.O.'s are such unknown quantities. As people are swept into these plans, they fear uncertainty in such a crucial area. But last week came the most thorough report yet on the quality of managed-care plans, possibly giving the innocent citizenry something to go on. Overall, 89 percent of plan members were satisfied -- and if that seems high, it should be noted that the plans volunteered for the survey. The bad ones are no doubt happy to stay in the shadows. Another caveat: geography matters. One survey found that people in New York City "don't like anything, while those in Rochester like everything." New Yorkers surely aren't such grumps, but a Rochester plan did rank first in satisfaction, while H.I.P. of New York came in last.

HEADLINE: At Work;
How the 'Compassion Crowd' Lives

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
ASK many people about their careers and they will tell a story of how they meandered serendipitously from ambition to opportunity to luck, good or bad. Mostly they seem surprised to find themselves where they are. But ask Barbara Fazio-McGrory, 41, to take stock of her career and she recounts an almost comical symmetry between her deepest self and her 14 years in social work, as if there were some sort of cosmic plan, which, she says, there wasn't.
Ms. Fazio-McGrory is a master's level social worker in the AIDS Center Program at St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital Center on Tenth Avenue in Manhattan, one of several facilities in the city that offers comprehensive care to people with AIDS. She is part of an interdisciplinary team of hospital personnel who apply their different skills and knowledge to the care of patients with full-blown AIDS. Many of their patients are in the final stages of the remorseless disease, wary of its malevolent endgame surprises and down to choices that mock the very idea of free will. The dichotomy is more illusory than real, but to the extent it exists, doctors and nurses and other people with medical training tend to the patients' bodies. Ms. Fazio-McGrory takes care of their psyches. She is a comforter, a counselor, a reality check, a broker of services, a massager of the system. She helps patients, and sometimes her own colleagues, cope. 
 As such, she is a card-carrying member of what some have taken to dismissing as "the compassion crowd," one of the "permanent social welfare establishment" supposedly undermining the American economy. Ms. Fazio-McGrory says she is "in denial" on the subject of Newt Gingrich, though she and her social work colleagues frequently talk about their fears for the future of the profession. However wise they are to worry in the short term, labor market projections rate social work as an in-demand career for quite a few years, if for no other reason than an aging population of cranky baby boomers will need its advocates. Ms. Fazio-McGrory's decision to enter social work had almost nothing to do with labor market projections. She was in her mid-20's, living in Manhattan and trying to have an acting career. "That meant I was doing a lot of waitressing in New York," she said last week during an interview in her office on Floor 9-B, down the hall and around the corner from the patients' rooms.
As she recounts it, she was probably always a social worker waiting to happen. "I was a hurt kid from a big dysfunctional family," she said of growing up in the North Bronx as one of nine siblings. She got a master's degree in social work at Fordham University and her first professional job was working with parents who abused their children. Before she landed in her current position at St. Luke's/Roosevelt, she also worked with recovering alcoholics and addicts, with clients in private practice and at Roosevelt's inpatient psychiatric unit.
When the opportunity to join the AIDS care team came up in 1990, she spent some time researching the disease before she accepted. "I was a new mother, I had some qualms," she said. "I learned things about infectious diseases." A close friend who was HIV-positive pushed her over the top. He said, "Go, do it, you'll be able to take care of me when I need it," she remembered.
Ms. Fazio-McGrory spends part of her day in a windowless but otherwise pleasant office. Pictures of her husband, Ken, and two young children, Marie and Nathaniel, soften the decor. A plaque with the Serenity Prayer -- "God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference" -- is a constant reminder of the limitations of earthly ministrations. It is a sentiment that no doubt comes in handy under circumstances both weighty and light, including when she must hang on the phone with other providers of medical and social services in Manhattan, negotiating help for her patients, or work through the stack of forms the hospital requires for documentation.
It is the phone and the endless reports that keep her from doing more of what she went into social work for: bedside counseling. But that remains the nut of her job and is what gives her the most satisfaction. She has often been asked the question about how she can stand work that involves so much loss and grief. She attributes her ability to face death head-on to surviving the loss of her parents and a brother by cancer. "Cancer and AIDS are similar," she said. "They suck the life out of people. My experience helps me extend myself." In a peculiar way, her background in theater has become useful. "The high drama of AIDS is captivating to me," she said. "I do well with drama. I survived my family. It is gratifying to help people in these situations."
Naturally enough, the hardest patients to lose are those with whom she has a real history. "I followed one man from the day he was diagnosed to his memorial service. He died the day my mother did," she said, pausing for a moment. "You go in one day and the name plate is gone from the door or a new person is in the bed. That's how you find out." In those moments, Ms. Fazio-McGrory says, she has no choice but "to stop and get real sad. I talk to someone I trust. I'm a crier. I have to give myself a mourning moment."
Ms. Fazio-McGrory's main regret about her job is that her schedule keeps her from spending more time with her children. Does she think about doing other work? She responds without hesitation: "Flower arranging. I always talk about flower arranging. I can't wait to be 65 and retired. I want to be a blue-haired lady. I want to deliver flowers to people on a pushcart."

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES;
401(k) Withdrawals Can Mean Trouble

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS 

 BODY:
EVEN after being advised against it, people are often tempted to take the money out of their 401(k) retirement accounts when leaving a job. A pressing need, like paying the mortgage, or a strong desire to have a cushion, say during a period of unemployment, can put long-term plans on hold.
The backlash, though, may be severe. 
 Twenty percent of the money will be skimmed off the top, as a required withholding tax. Then if the money is not rolled into an individual retirement account or another company's 401(k) plan within 60 days, the employee will have to pay a 10 percent tax penalty for early withdrawal, as well as income taxes.
Even someone who uses the money for a short while and plows it into a retirement account has to do some fancy footwork. Say the investor had $10,000 and got an $8,000 check after the employer withheld $2,000. If he rolled over only the $8,000 within the 60 days, he would still face a tax penalty if he is younger than 59 1/2 because the Internal Revenue Service would classify the missing $2,000 as a plan distribution. The $2,000 would also be taxable as regular income. Legally, the payout is considered to be $10,000, and that amount must be redeposited.
"So you'd better be sure you can get your hands on an extra $2,000 in a hurry," said Seymour Goldberg, a lawyer with Goldberg & Ingber of Garden City, L.I., who specializes in retirement issues.
The only chance to recoup is at tax filing time, when the investor can claim the $2,000 as a tax credit, if the full amount was deposited in some type of retirement account.
In the long term, money that comes out of an employer's plan loses certain tax benefits as well. A lump-sum withdrawal at retirement from an I.R.A. does not qualify for five-year averaging, said Barbara Josefowicz, an employee benefits specialist with Grant Thornton, a national accounting and management consulting firm. Five-year averaging generally lessens the tax pinch by allowing a sum to be taxed as if it were withdrawn over five years. But it is available only for a distribution directly from an employer's plan.
For this reason, Ms. Josefowicz advises clients to transfer the money into a new employer's 401(k) plan whenever possible. Herein lies another pitfall. The money can be transferred to another employer's plan only if it has not been mixed with other retirement money. That means opening a separate account for any 401(k) money.
The considerations are quite different for state and local government employees, particularly those who are losing jobs in budget cuts or who may be unnerved by the losses of Orange County, Calif., employees.
Instead of a 401(k) plan, these workers may contribute to a Section 457 retirement plan, which is subject to fewer regulations and which belongs to the employer even though the employee has money deducted from pay. Withdrawals from these plans cannot be rolled into an I.R.A. or a 401(k) plan, Mr. Goldberg said.
The employees will have to pay income tax on the entire amount unless they leave the money intact -- something employers must permit if the account total exceeds $3,500.
But withdrawals from a 457 plan have certain advantages. They are not subject to the 20 percent withholding requirement. Nor are they subject to the 10 percent penalty for early withdrawal, Mr. Goldberg concluded. He said that was the informal opinion of a high-ranking I.R.S. official to whom he recently posed this question on behalf of a client. An I.R.S. spokesman said there had been no formal ruling on the matter.
Withdrawals from a 401(k) plan remain troubling. Unless the money is needed for an emergency, in which case the employee should ask if he qualifies for a penalty-free hardship withdrawal, the money is best used only as a last resort.

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES;
Toiling to Reduce Taxes in a Changing Environment

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NO one expects the Supreme Court to declare the income tax unconstitutional, as it did after the Civil War, or Congress to spare so many people that the wealthy will take out newspaper ads to boast of paying, as they did early in the 20th century. But practically any other change in the tax law seems possible these days.
First came a batch of proposals in the Republicans' Contract With America. Then the Clinton Administration issued its response. Now, momentum is growing for radical overhaul in the form of a flat tax or a consumption tax. 
 After years of relative stability following a tax overhaul in 1986 -- remember when you could deduct the interest paid on your car loan? -- uncertainty about taxes is back with a vengeance. Although there are few changes to absorb since last year, an important part of preparing each year's return is looking ahead to reduce future tax liabilities. Planning becomes especially difficult when Congress threatens to spew new laws that may drastically change the landscape.
All the talk about change simply "freezes people," said Randy L. Scritchfield, a financial planner at Montgomery Financial Group in Damascus, Md. "It's one of my jobs to get them out of freeze mode."
 
 
Change May Come Soon
 The challenge is formidable, given that opinion is split on what is best for the economy and fairest for taxpayers. Futhermore, some changes could come as soon as summer, including a cut in the tax paid on capital gains, while a proposal to replace the income tax with a consumption tax may not even get a serious hearing for years.
Accountants, finanical planners and tax specialists offer several suggestions to get paralyzed taxpayers moving again. Using "what-if statements" to work through decisions, these tax experts point to how policy makers are inclined to act.
For example, raising the nation's dismal savings rate, now about 3 percent, is a top priority for many legislators both because of international competition and because baby boomers will begin retiring in 15 years.
What, then, is the attentive but disoriented taxpayer to do? First, almost all professionals agree, is to make maximum use of individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans, which are already powerful tax-deferment vehicles and might be improved. The Republican contract calls for an American Dream Savings Account, a variation on the individual retirement account. Taxpayers would have to pay income tax on contributions but not on withdrawals used to buy a first home, cover retirement needs or pay for college or medical care.
If tax rates are constant, the result is the same no matter whether the tax deduction is up front on I.R.A. contributions or later, said C. Clinton Stretch of Deloitte & Touche, the big accounting firm. But if tax rates were to decline, the "back end" Republican version would be superior to the current I.R.A.
Much of the uncertainty about legislation this year centers on the proposed tax cut for capital gains, profits made on assets held more than a year. The Republican contract seeks to halve the capital gains tax through a 50 percent exclusion.
If you think there will be at least some cut -- and that it will be retroactive as in 1986 -- you need not change course. But if a cut should take effect on some future date, it would make sense to postpone a sale or, if possible, arrange for a deferred payment.
Although a lackluster 1994 stock market has made gains illusive for many investors, Rebecca S. Whitmore, a senior manager in the personal financial services group at Price Waterhouse in St. Louis, has been advising executives to exercise stock options to start the clock running on the capital-gains holding period. (A stock must be held more than a year before its sale counts as a long-term capital gain.) "We have encouraged clients to do that for a couple years," Ms. Whitmore said.
A related element of the Republican contract would index capital assets for inflation so that no tax is due on phantom profits. The idea has long-standing appeal but would be an administrative nightmare. "Economically it makes sense, but politically it's inconceivable," Mr. Scritchfield said.
 If you are one of the few who think indexing will be adopted, be sure to keep meticulous records, since the adjustment would apply to inflation after Dec. 31, 1994, under the Republican proposal.
Another subject that professionals mention when asked to look ahead is estate taxes. The $600,000 exemption, which allows each person to leave that amount tax-free to heirs, could be increased to offset years of inflation.
The Republicans are talking about raising the threshold to $750,000, which would encourage people with substantial assets to create credit shelter trusts, explained Joseph D. Freney, a tax manager at Meridian Asset Management in Reading, Pa. With such a trust, a couple could pass $1.5 million to their children before the estate tax, which starts at 37 percent and rises to 55 percent. . At the death of the first spouse, $750,000 in assets would be put into a credit shelter trust, providing lifetime income for the surviving spouse. When the second spouse dies, the money in the trust would revert to the children, and $750,000 in other assets could be passed along free of taxes.
Although various elements of the contract could be enacted this year, financial advisers recommend keeping an eye on long-term trends.
Recognizing that workers will have to provide an increasing share of their retirement income, the Government could become a sustained promoter of efforts to encourage savings and discourage consumption, with expanded I.R.A.'s only one step in the process.
In such an environment, the mortgage deduction on a second home might disappear, while the tax code might become more friendly toward stock investments, suggested Jonathan Francis, chief global strategist at Putnam Investments.
The Government could also lose whatever grip it has on its budget and run deficits so large that tax burdens would climb signficantly, a prospect envisioned by Ric Edelman, president of Edelman Financial Services in Fairfax, Va. "The pressures on middle incomes and high incomes will be huge," Mr. Edelman predicted.
 
Talk of a Flat Tax
 Another possibility is the adoption of a flat tax, which would wipe out nearly all deductions, eliminating the need for tax-deferred annuities, crippling charities and, if mortgage interest were no longer deductible, driving down the value of houses.
Although momentum is building for fundamental change in the income tax, the obstacles are great.
"Even sophisticated people are fairly naive about the implications of reform," said Mr. Stretch of Deloitte & Touche. And while he guessed that eventually the United States would substitute a value-added tax for payroll levies and keep the income tax, there's little ground for building a solid strategy.
So to the short list of life's enduring certainties -- death and taxes -- it may be time to add a third: the prospect of change in the monumentally complex tax code.

HEADLINE: THE NATION: A Cash Crop Since Columbus;
Gone Are the Days When Tobacco Brought Only Wealth

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
Anyone wondering why it has taken so long for the tobacco industry to suffer legal defeats, many decades after the dangers of smoking became well known, should consider two factors: a history dating from America's colonial days and the economics of a $50 billion business.
 The economics, however, are shifting, and not just because judges this month stripped away the legal defenses that have enabled the tobacco companies to avoid having to pay a dime in court-ordered damages. The costs of treating lung cancer, emphysema and other tobacco-related illnesses are only now outweighing the revenues to tobacco farmers and corporations. Even so, the industry's extraordinary prosperity still commands deference from politicians, arts groups and investors. And those who think themselves free of tobacco's stain sometimes find tobacco is closer than six degrees of separation. 
 In the 1920's, Doris Duke's tobacco inheritance earned her the title of "richest girl in the world." Today, the benefits are spread among 42,900 tobacco manufacturing employees, at least 136,000 tobacco farmers, millions of shareholders and mutual fund owners and tens of millions of arts patrons. Tobacco contributes $4.2 billion to the U.S. side of the trade ledger: Toyotas in, Marlboros out.
 The first tobacco export took place in 1492, when Columbus took souvenir tobacco leaves to Queen Isabella. A century later in Elizabethan England, Sir Walter Raleigh taught courtiers to smoke the leaves from his Roanoke colony.
 Even though Elizabeth's successor, King James, railed against smoking -- "a custom loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain, dangerous to the lungs and in the black stinking fume thereof nearest the horrible Stygian smoke of the pit that is bottomless" -- the Jamestown settlers planted tobacco everywhere, including the street. In Virginia, tobacco became a gold standard, as notes issued against tobacco in warehouses served as currency.
 Americans followed up on their cash crop with mechanization and marketing. Miss Duke's father, James Buchanan (Buck) Duke, transformed the industry from making cigars and chewing tobacco by hand to making cigarettes by machine. A skilled worker could wrap 300 cigarettes an hour, the first perfected machine, more than 12,000.
 By 1890, Mr. Duke's American Tobacco Company monopolized the business, making 9 of 10 cigarettes. "If John D. Rockefeller can do what he is doing in oil, why should I not do it in tobacco?" he said. At Trinity College in Durham, N.C., where firebrand professors had decried his tobacco trust, he promised trustees a $40 million bequest, in 1924 dollars -- and $67 million more in his will -- if they would rename the school after him.
 Richard J. Reynolds, intent on surpassing Duke, used an unprecedented advertising budget to make Camels the dominant national brand. "Turkish & Domestic Blend," the packs said, though behind the tableau of camel and pyramids stood just a smidgin of imported leaf. By 1919, about 8 billion of the 21 billion cigarettes sold were Camels.
 Tobacco companies have been among the nation's most visionary marketers ever since, handing their products out free to soldiers abroad and introducing Marlboro cowboys and Virginia Slim anorexics to sell the spirit as well as the smoke. Their advertising curbed and burdened with warnings, the tobacco companies have become expert at computer-targeted couponing, merchandise tie-ins and philanthropic ostentation. Marlboro matured into the world's most profitable brand, more so than Coke and Pepsi combined, helping Philip Morris stock rise tenfold from 1984 to 1992.
 The tobacco business has been most generous lately to Wall Street dealmakers who know more about auctioning convertible subordinated debentures than Burley tobacco. Lorillard has ended up in a Tisch family playpen that includes CBS, while RJR Nabisco, after the largest corporate takeover ever, became one of Henry Kravis's toys.
 The most recent legal threats have knocked a point or two off some tobacco stocks. Last week, the State of Florida sued to recover more than $4 billion in Medicaid costs and damages. The week before, a Federal judge cleared the way for the first nationwide class action on behalf of 100 million current or former smokers.
 But the health of the brand names worries investors the most. On Marlboro Friday two years ago, when Philip Morris, beleaguered by discount brands, cut the price of a pack by 40 cents, its shares fell and left shareholders $13 billion poorer.
 The medical costs of smoking, meanwhile, have gone from $21.9 billion in 1987 to $50 billion in 1993, according to the Centers for Disease Control, as general health care costs rose and more smokers reached their emphysema years.
 But finding the true bottom line can be tougher than winning a tobacco case, in the view of W. Kip Viscusi, the George G. Allen professor of economics at Duke ("This is a non-tobacco chair," Mr. Viscusi explains. "He was the first president of Duke. But there is an R.J. Reynolds professorship in the business school.") He sees smoking as a money-maker for society even apart from corporate profits. Because smokers lose an average of 2 2/3 years of life, their lower Social Security, nursing home and pension costs more than pay their medical expenses.
 Too bad the tobacco companies have given their customers some life expectancy (and retirement benefits) back by cleaning out so much tar, he said, "because you don't get as many financial savings from death."

HEADLINE: The World;
Sometimes, a Hitch In the Ordinary Exchange of Spies

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Like Claude Rains in "Casablanca," French officials were shocked, shocked, last week that a Government report charging the United States Embassy with spying on its oldest ally was splashed all over the newspapers.
 The French, who invented diplomacy, know perfectly well that one of the things diplomats are supposed to do is to spy -- strictly in accordance with the rules of protocol, of course -- the same rules that give them immunity from being sent to jail for ignoring parking fines, skipping the rent and even for overstepping the fine line between diplomatic reporting and espionage. 
 The usual practice for violators is to give them a chance to quietly pack their bags and go home. But in this case, in the middle of a closely fought French presidential election campaign, somebody leaked the news that five Americans, including the C.I.A.'s departing station chief at the embassy and three other diplomats, had been caught, and the embassy asked to withdraw them.
 It was probably no coincidence that the French counterespionage services report to Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, that Mr. Pasqua is the leading cabinet supporter of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's candidacy for the presidency, and that Mr. Balladur's poll ratings have plummeted in the wake of a scandal about a telephone bugging operation orchestrated by Mr. Pasqua.
 Mr. Pasqua modestly disclaimed credit for the leak and, bizarrely, tried to pin it on Ambassador Pamela Harriman, who said the charge was "neither true nor credible."
 Open warfare, the extension of diplomacy by other means, has not broken out, if only because diplomatic rules have never prohibited hiding spies under diplomatic cover.
 That is standard practice, and there are even terms of art for it. The former American station chief was what is known in the trade as a legal resident, meaning that he wasn't pretending to be a businessman or a journalist but was working in the embassy as a diplomat.
 In the case of a NATO ally like France, he would have been discreetly introduced to the appropriate French officials so that they would know him by function and first name.
 It was not that spies were masquerading as diplomats that had the French upset -- it was, they charged, that the spies had been paying cash bribes, in 500-franc notes, to high officials in Paris to get information.

 
 
Daily Business
 Only a few of the 130 diplomats in the U.S. Embassy in Paris work for the C.I.A. The rest do mainly two things: reporting things of interest back to Washington and representing American interests in France. Diplomats do these things endlessly -- at cocktails, at dinner parties and at vast receptions on their national holidays, when some occasionally wear formal striped pants.
 Mrs. Harriman has been very active and successful on the social scene here, winning a lot of good will for herself and for the United States. That was what she thought she would be doing Jan. 26, when she was summoned by Mr. Pasqua. Instead, he laid the spying charges on her.

 
 
A Quiet Life
 That talk was in confidence.
 Confidentiality is the basic rule of diplomacy, a delicate art that rarely withstands the light of publicity. Ambassadors go to glittering dinners, but beneath them, legions toil anonymously -- the political section cultivating the parties and leaders who might win in the next elections, the culture section arranging artistic exchanges and so on. Some diplomats just stamp visas or help stranded Americans.
 But diplomacy is increasingly about economics these days, and the Clinton Administration encourages embassies to push American trade and commercial interests. Embassy economic sections try to land contracts for American companies. Commercial sections have become clearinghouses for foreigners looking to invest money in the United States and for American businesses trying to make deals in Europe.
 What the accused spies in the Paris embassy were looking for, according to the newspaper Le Monde, was information on the French negotiating position in the crucial end game of the global trade talks in 1993, and on its plans to protect the French entertainment industry from Hollywood.
 It was a sign of the times, and of the new diplomacy.

HEADLINE: Child's Portion;
Displaced by the Welfare Wars

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

 BODY:
Behind the national welfare debate is a deep but usually unspoken moral and political question: What will happen to children whose families are denied part or all of their cash benefits?
 Over a half-century, social welfare has evolved into a system so vast and complex that for every innovation, regardless of motivation, the law of unintended consequences prevails. The real impact of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's approach may have less to do with philosophical disagreements over the merits of orphanages than with the reality of how much cash is available to care for young refugees from the welfare rolls. 
 Under the Republican agenda, families -- typically, mothers and their children -- would lose all cash benefits after the mothers reached a lifetime limit of five years on welfare. Then, many children might wind up in foster care, if only because their mothers could no longer feed, clothe and house them.
 The people who work in the scruffy, overburdened offices of child welfare agencies, places that already teem with squalling children and bewildered parents, always knew that the national politicians indignantly scolding each other about orphanages were missing the point.
 As the debate progresses, though, few of the participants seem to be asking a fundamental question about the future: If welfare time limits are adopted, what happens to the children of mothers who failed to make it in the marketplaces of work and marriage?
 
The Logic Is Economic
 The Federal Government does not control where neglected and abused children are placed; states and counties that get custody of the children make those choices. And there is a relentless economic logic to foster care, the one program that has become the linchpin of local services for children. Caring for children in institutions costs at least two to three times more than placing them in foster care.
 In New York City, for example, group care costs $47,000 a year for each child, compared with $16,000 for family foster care. Child welfare professionals believe that nurturing family foster homes are not only cheaper, but far better for most children. But in New York City, and in other areas where there are heavy concentrations of the very poor, the bulging foster care case loads are being managed on budgets that are always stretched too thin.
 To pare social programs and turn them over to the states, House Republicans would also limit total Federal funding for foster care, adoption and other child welfare services and combine it into a block grant, as House Republicans have already proposed doing with the national school lunch program, which feeds pregnant women and preschool children, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the basic welfare program.
 The block grants, giving lump payments to the states and eliminating many Federal oversight and regulatory functions, would not automatically increase during recessions when more people need help.
 The House Republican leadership, bowing to pressure from farm states, last week abandoned a proposal to replace food stamps with block grants. The states, said Representative Bill Emerson, the Missouri Democrat who is chairman of the Agriculture Committee's subcommittee on nutrition, have "a full plate" of new responsibilities.
 Republicans in the House say a five-year cut-off would pressure many, if not most, of women on welfare to go to work, get married or have fewer illegitimate children. For some, if not many, it would undoubtedly be a prod.

 
 
Sacrifice or Salvation?
 Representative Jim McCrery of Louisiana, a member of the subcommittee on human resources, acknowledges that he has, as he put it, no idea how many women would fail to become self-sufficient within five years. But he said that the price to those families is not excessive if it means ending welfare dependency.
 "If a single woman with a couple of kids just can't find or keep a job, or get help from family or neighbors," Mr. McCrery said, "she will have an option to give her children up for adoption, place them in a group setting or foster care. Will some people have a hard time? Yes. Is that price worth it for the good of generations to come? Yes."
 Moreover, the congressman said earlier this month, "the Democrats who have controlled these programs for 30 years have very little moral authority to accuse us of being heartless and cruel. It is the current programs that condemn millions of children in this country to lives of hopelessness and desperation."
 While their House counterparts spin out proposals, Senate Republicans have not yet taken up welfare reform. The Clinton Administration has sharply criticized elements of the House proposals, but the President has not yet threatened a veto.
 Currently about 420,000 children are in foster care programs. And about half the 10 million children receiving welfare today have been on the rolls for five years or longer. If even a small fraction of those children were removed from the rolls and wound up in state custody, the already stumbling foster care system could be overwhelmed.
 Then what? If recent history is a guide, state and local child protection officials would place the children wherever beds could be found. Well-designed orphanages take years to develop, fund and build and are expensive to run. And each new solution to the plight of children in crisis has tended to fall short -- or beget problems of its own.
 In the 1960's, a heroin epidemic flooded shelters with children awaiting foster care. Babies and toddlers remained in in the overcrowded, barracks-like shelters a year or longer. "It was custodial care," said Lois Hines, a social worker at the cavernous Children's Center at Fifth Avenue and 104th Street in the 1960's. "They were being fed, kept dry. But they did not have that love and caring."
 When crack cocaine hooked tens of thousands of poor mothers in the late 1980's, foster care was overwhelmed again. In Miami, crack-exposed, newborn "boarder babies" were stuck for months in hospitals. Cities like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago -- all then under under Democratic administrations -- turned to relatives who were paid to care for children.
 Kinship care was expanded to keep children with their extended families. But grandmothers and aunts get more to care for the children than the mothers received to support them under welfare, undermining efforts to reunify families. Similarly, programs to house the homeless during the 1980's got people off the streets, but produced a network of impersonal congregate shelters and nightmarish welfare hotels.

 
 
Less Money, Less Time
 Child welfare agency executives fear that foster care's existing problems will only be exacerbated. Investigators would have less time to look into child abuse and neglect complaints. Caseworkers would be harder pressed to supervise visits between children and their parents or steer addicted mothers to drug treatment -- steps that judges require before children can legally be returned home or freed for adoption.
 The House Republican agenda would end the entitlement of poor, welfare-eligible children to federally-funded foster care and adoption services though the block grant. Overall spending limits also would be imposed in each of the next five years.
 "The untold story of the welfare debate that nobody seems to have noticed is the dismantling of the child welfare system," said David Liederman, executive director of the Child Welfare League of America.

HEADLINE: The World;
In Africa, West Can Pay Now, Or Later

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast

 BODY:
Having struggled across the Sahara, 250,000 starving Sudanese refugees assemble on the Moroccan coast, hoping to cross the Straits of Gibraltar to Europe. As an armada of camera crews film them, the refugee's leader launches this challenge to European Union coastal guards who would stop them: "All we ask of you is, watch us die." 
 The event is pure fiction, the final scene of a 1990 BBC television drama. But development experts say it neatly illustrates a stark choice looming for the industrialized world: Pitch in more energetically to bring Africa into the global economic fold, or wait and watch as the continent descends into a quickening spiral of disaster.

 
 
An Exploding Population
 With its population due to double to about 1.2 billion in less than 30 years, and expected to reach 2 billion by 2050, an Africa in crisis could well become the desperate stage for a mass emigration the likes of which have never been seen.
 Despite such warnings, however, the West seems to have grown only more indifferent to Africa's fortunes. Some American congressmen have recently likened aid to the continent to throwing money into a rathole; Britain has said it will cut its contributions to Africa through the European Union, and even France is grappling with ways to reduce obligations to its former possessions.
 In response, frustrated development experts and new democratic leaders in Africa have argued that would be far cheaper to help the continent out of its problems now than to rescue it later.
 To get a sense of scale, it helps to look at two examples where extremely rapid population growth rates -- well over 3 percent a year -- are expected by United Nations statisticians between now and the year 2000. They are Nigeria, which in the early 1990's had 116 million people and a gross national product per capita of only $350, and Kenya, which had 25 million people and produced just $340 per person.
 Nevertheless, the experts on Africa recognize that in an era of austerity at home, arguments about investing abroad today to prevent crisis tomorrow have limited appeal. They now argue that traditional aid grants are not necessarily the answer. "The most effective thing that could be done for Africa right now doesn't involve new money, but systematic debt relief," said Thomas Callaghy of the University of Pennsylvania. "You could write off all of Africa's debts tomorrow, and it wouldn't affect international financial markets." But then, "When you look at what has just happened in Mexico you realize just how hard a thing this is to sell politically."
 If Africa's approaching peril is not enough to motivate the West to act with greater generosity, many hope that old-fashioned appeals to profit might. Whether it was spices or gold or slaves or vast quantities of gems and minerals, the continent has always been a rich, if risky, El Dorado for the venturesome outsider.
 Following Ghana's independence, Kwame Nkrumah, its first president and a pioneer of the continent's ultimately disastrous fling with socialism, defined the historical problem, noting the "paradox" that Africa's "earth is rich, yet the products that come from above and below the soil continue to enrich, not Africans predominantly, but groups and individuals who operate to Africa's impoverishment."
Now, throughout much of the continent, several years of dramatic efforts to remove barriers to trade and investment, trim bureaucracies and rejoin the global economy have mostly swept away the legacy of three decades of Mr. Nkrumah's brand of socialism. Ghana and Uganda are prominent examples, and investment in South Africa can at last be viewed as an investment in the continent as a whole.
Because of these changes, Africa's riches are again up for grabs. But so far, the international business community has largely disappointed the development experts. Mali, for example, can't find a partner to help finance a new power company, even though companies from the United States, Australia and Canada rush to explore for gold and diamonds and oil there. Their hope is for the kind of quick extraction of wealth that led to the continent's early disenchantment with capitalism.
 If Africa still requires a more cooperative form of economic involvement, development experts say, it is because the years under socialism did little to alleviate deep social problems that include an undereducated population whose needs grow faster than weak governments can possibly cope with, poor roads and communications, a lack of managerial expertise, and most of all a shortage of capital.
 So Africa is in a bind: major foreign private investment in productive new industries is unlikely unless these problems are solved first, but the only sources of help to fix them is overseas.
 "People cling to the myth that if only these countries would get their policies right, everything would be okay," said James Gustave Speth, the administrator of the United Nations Development Program. "There is no reason to believe that Africa can't make it, but right now this is a continent that is bleeding and without substantial outside help, there is no hope."
 In addition to cutting debt burden, economists say the West should drop barriers to goods like textiles that are often entry-level transformation industries for developing countries. In this, they say, there could be a payoff for the West as well.
 "Aid to Africa is not welfare," J. Brian Atwood, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, wrote recently in The International Herald Tribune. "Africa is today what Latin American and Asian markets were a generation ago. It is the last great developing market." But what many see as a sensible management of long-term interests collides with political expediency. "Putting people on their feet is just good business sense" said Edward V. K. Jaycox, vice president of the World Bank. "But it is a question of old-fashioned industrial structures in the north, where a lot of people are engaged in activities that they are loath to give up." By that he meant something very much like what Mr. Nkrumah used to say: If the West really wants to see an Africa healthy for investment, it should stop raiding the gold veins and diamond mines and open not just its wallets but its markets as well.

Technology Monopolies Are Big, but Often Brittle

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Remember the "I.B.M.-compatible" computer? Only 10 years ago, I.B.M.'s power was so great that it singlehandedly decreed the technical standards for most personal computers. But today, that phrase is quaintly out of date. The once-mighty Big Blue, plagued by billions of dollars in losses over the last several years, no longer sets the standards and is now merely one of many rivals in the market.
 Today, however, a new company has transfixed the country, and the Federal Government, with its seemingly awesome power. Microsoft Corporation, started from scratch in 1975, arguably generates even more fear and loathing in some quarters of the industry than I.B.M. ever did. Its two core products -- MS-DOS and Windows -- provide the basic operating instructions for about 80 percent of all personal computers. It has expanded ferociously into almost every other corner of the software industry. Its stock-market value rivals that of General Motors, and its chairman, Bill Gates, has a net worth of more than $6 billion. Rivals accuse it of bullying tactics, arrogance and dirty tricks. 
 Now a Federal judge here has joined the fray. Judge Stanley Sporkin angrily rejected an antitrust consent agreement that Microsoft reached with the Justice Department. In a ruling earlier this month that suggested Microsoft is nothing less than a threat to the economic pillars of America, Judge Sporkin said the Justice Department's pact was too narrowly tailored to a few licensing practices and would do little to curb Microsoft's power.

 
 
They Might Be Giants, Briefly
 Whatever its outcome, however, the antitrust case explains very little about the sources of Microsoft's power -- and may have very little to do with its ability to hold onto it. As the woeful decline of I.B.M. demonstrates, dominance in the information age is far more fragile than it first appears. I.B.M. ruled the world of mainframe computing -- until mainframes themselves were overtaken by networks of powerful new desktop computers, a development that plunged the company into a hellish decline.
 And I.B.M. is hardly alone. Industries based on technology have a way of fueling the rise of quasi-monopolies, largely because companies have a powerful need for common technical standards. They also have a way of knocking them down when a vastly superior standard comes alone. In a world where just about everything is becoming interconnected, there is an intense need for common languages and protocols. The company that develops a key standard has a monopoly of tremendous value -- while it lasts.
 Microsoft's real power came from I.B.M., which selected MS-DOS as the operating system for all its personal computers and which prompted scores of other companies to follow suit. MS-DOS and Windows are not as elegant or easy as Apple Computer's rival operating system, even after 10 years of trying to catch up with it. But it was the closest thing anybody had to a standard. If Bill Gates hadn't come along, the industry probably would have anointed someone else.

 
 
Hey, Victrolas Were Big Once, Too
 But that kind of power can evaporate with astonishing speed. Recall the "Hayes-compatible" modem, once the absolute standard for devices that transmit computer data over telephone lines. Hayes Microcomputer is now in bankruptcy. And there was Visicalc, the country's first spreadsheet program and a product that claimed 90 percent of the market at one time. It is now long gone.
 Very few people even remember something called CP / M, produced by a company called Digital Research. But in the late 1970's, CP / M was the "operating system" used on the overwhelming majority of all personal computers. Digital Research became enormously successful, so much so that its founder snubbed an opportunity to meet with I.B.M. about designing an operating system for its new computers. That led to an opportunity for Mr. Gates, and the rest is now history.
 Toppling a standard is never easy, and it requires more than just coming up with a better product. I.B.M., having literally handed Microsoft the keys to the kingdom, is now fighting back with a rival operating system of its own. This system -- OS / 2 Warp -- has won praise from many critics and trade publications. But it has yet to make a dent in the market, because the entire industry is fixated on building computers and programs around MS-DOS.
 But if a product is 10 times better than the standard, or 100 times better, the seemingly invincible standard can fall quite suddenly. That kind of advance is the norm in information technology.
 The speed and capacity of computer chips have doubled every 18 months for several decades; the storage capacity of a plain vanilla computer has soared from about 10 million bytes of data in 1984 to more than 200 million bytes today. Today's computer programs are vastly more sophisticated, both more powerful and easier to use.
 "People seem to think that Microsoft will last forever, but I don't think their longevity is assured," said Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, a newsletter on the computer industry. "The only way to get rid of them is through a revolution. A revolution will occur, but it will occur in the marketplace and not because of government action."

 
 
'Content' Over Software
 Ms. Dyson also argued that the basis of power is changing quickly, thanks in part to the soaring use of the Internet and commercial on-line services. The value of software to bridge the gap between computers will be crucial, but she predicted it will increasingly be overshadowed by the value of the "content" -- the information, television programming or whatever -- that will be transported over different networks.
 Thus, even some of the software companies that dwell in Microsoft's shadow say they are confident about the future.
 "The nature of this business is to be competitive," added Gordon Eubanks, president of the Symantec Corporation of Cupertino, Calif., which manufactures anti-virus and other utility programs that work with Windows.
 "We of all people should be aggressive about taking action against Microsoft, because they compete with us on some products and we depend on them for early and detailed information," said Mr. Eubanks. "But by and large, this is an industry that is vibrant and healthy and is a great American success story."

HEADLINE: On Tiptoes, U.S. Shies From Salinas as Head of Trade Group

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has determined that its candidate to head the World Trade Organization, former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, stands no chance of winning, and the White House is searching for a graceful way to drop its support.
Officially, the Administration insists that it is still behind Mr. Salinas, who was struggling for the post even before he was blamed for ignoring many of the economic problems that brought on Mexico's financial crisis. But several top Administration officials say the competition between Mr. Salinas and two other candidates, a top civil servant from Italy and a South Korean economist, has resulted in a stalemate. 
 "People are already meeting to find a way to ease Salinas out," said one top official involved in the issue. "It's a very delicate problem, and frankly no one knows what the alternative will be."
The dispute has badly marred the start of the trade organization, the rule-setting and dispute-resolution body that was created on Jan. 1 as a more powerful successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade organization. Unlike the GATT, which was widely criticized as lacking authority and enforcement power, the W.T.O was envisioned as a muscular arbiter among more than 120 member nations. The first president is expected to set the tone for the organization.
But the race to run the W.T.O. soon divided three continents: Europe, the Americas and Asia. The Europeans have backed a longtime European Union civil servant, Renato Ruggiero, who has won the support of 57 nations, including most of Europe's former colonies.
With the backing of Japan and other Asian countries, Kim Chul Su, a former Trade Minister for South Korea, is in second place with 29 votes. Mr. Salinas, running with President Clinton's personal endorsement, has 28 backers.
It is not clear exactly what the election rules are. A simple majority is not enough, and it seems apparent that no one can take the seat without the acquiescence, if not the enthusiasm, of the world's biggest economic powers. But over the last few weeks it has also become clear that no candidate would get a majority of the vote. "There is a total stalemate," said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative. "No one is moving, so it's going nowhere."
Finding a way to abandon Mr. Salinas, however, is a delicate task for the Clinton Administration. Initially the Administration thought he was the perfect candidate -- a recently retired President of a country that was a symbol of deregulation, democratization and free trade.
Its support did not waver during the early days of the peso crisis. But in recent weeks, it has been increasingly evident that Mr. Salinas ignored signs that the Mexican economy was borrowing too much too fast last year, and that he refused to devalue the peso gradually for fear it would hurt his reputation and his party's chances in the Presidential election last fall.
Mr. Ruggiero has argued that since he has attracted the greatest number of votes, he should simply be given the post. Mr. Kim contends that the organization should not be run by a European, because Europeans dominate so many international economic organizations, and it should not be run by Mr. Salinas, because he has been discredited.
Seeking a graceful way out, Booth Gardner, the United States delegate to the trade organization, suggested this week that all three candidates should withdraw, and the search for the first leader of the organization should start anew. But Mr. Gardner was apparently out in front of the Administration, which has discussed that option internally but not yet approved it. In a less than ringing endorsement of Mr. Salinas today in Brussels, Ronald H. Brown, the Commerce Secretary, said Mr. Gardner's idea "has never been an officially or publicly stated position, as far as I know."
"We have a candidate," he said, referring to Mr. Salinas.
New Zealand has quietly proposed to break the impasse by offering Philip Burdon, its Trade Minister, for the post. The argument in Mr. Burdon's favor is that he lives in the Pacific, but represents an English-speaking former European colony that poses a trade threat to very few countries. European officials are less than enthusiastic because New Zealand opposes agricultural subsidies.

HEADLINE: ECONOMY REELING, MEXICANS PREPARE TOUGH NEW STEPS

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Clear signs that Mexico's economic crisis is worsening have forced the Government to concede that its original economic stabilization plan has failed and that a tougher new plan of budget cuts and tax increases will have to be enacted soon.
President Ernesto Zedillo announced his original damage-control plan on Jan. 3, but Mexican officials say it failed to arrest stampeding inflation and an impending recession largely because the United States took too long to deliver the vital financial assistance that President Clinton offered to help Mexico. 
 Ever since the $20 billion American rescue package was finally signed on Tuesday, President Zedillo has been busy telling Mexicans the crisis is under control. Meanwhile, his top financial advisers have been drafting a darkly realistic new rescue plan that shows Mexico is slipping further into the inflationary whirlpool of rapidly rising wages and prices that it had vowed to avoid.
Government officials who have worked on early drafts of the new plan, which Mr. Zedillo said would be announced "very soon," say it slashes predictions of economic growth for 1995 from 1.5 percent to zero or even negative growth, which would mean that the Government is finally acknowledging the inevitability of a recession. Many economists say one has already begun. Inflation, which was projected at 19 percent in the original plan, is now expected to soar to almost double that figure.
The projected exchange rate of 4.5 pesos to the dollar, on which the economic projections of the plan were based, is replaced with an imposing new rate of 5 to 5.5 pesos to the dollar. This means that the peso would be worth no more than 18 to 20 cents, rather than 22 cents.
The new plan anticipates that taxes will be increased sharply, prices for gasoline and electricity produced by the state will rise, and the federal budget will be cut severely to produce the surplus of five-tenths of 1 percent that United States officials demanded as one condition for signing a $20 billion rescue package. The American assistance will go a long way toward resolving Mexico's most immediate problem -- paying off billions of dollars in short-term debt -- but it will do little to solve the economy's fundamental problems.
"Since Jan. 3, we've been fighting not to adjust the economy but simply to control a situation of economic panic," President Zedillo said during an informal talk over tequila and chimichangas after several optimistic speeches on Thursday in the central state of Zacatecas, where he had gone to raise the spirits of Mexicans. He said the original plan might have been successful in controlling Mexico's out-of-balance current account deficit, the broadest measure of a nation's goods and services, "but now we know the problems go far deeper than that."
Mexican officials working on the new economic stabilization plan also say it will differ from the original because it abandons the social pact between Government, labor and business that has long characterized the preferred method of controlling the economy.
Instead of sitting down with labor and business leaders to negotiate the kind of wage and price controls that so far this year have failed to hold the line, officials say the Government will act on its own powers. That will entail sharply cutting the federal budget and maintaining interest rates at historically high levels to restrain inflation and stabilize the exchange rate.
Minimum wages might be raised by 5 percent, but the increase will not be used as a guideline for union contract wages, which will be negotiated separately, officials said.
The Government is also preparing an emergency employment program to relieve the pressure of the budget cuts from areas where social and political tensions have been high, like the southern states of Chiapas and Tabasco.
Mexican officials say their initial plan of Jan. 3 was intended to work in tandem with a quick infusion of money from the United States. One important member of Mr. Zedillo's economic team, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the assistance was expected to come a few days after President Clinton and Congressional leaders in Washington announced on Jan. 12 that the United States would provide $40 billion in loan guarantees.
Despite the strong initial backing of President Clinton and Congressional leaders, that offer of help met stiff opposition in Washington and was eventually abandoned. Mr. Clinton used his executive powers to put together a $20 billion package that did not need Congressional approval.
"In the end it really took quite a long time for the money to come," the Mexican official said. "In the meantime there was a lot of nervousness in the market. People were getting worried. Investors wanted to see a signed agreement. As time passed, the uncertainty affected interest rates and the exchange rate."
The official said it was clear that as inflation and unemployment worsened and prices headed for the heavens, the economic targets of the Jan. 3 stabilization plan had become impossible to reach. "But," he said, "it wouldn't have made any sense for the Government to put out new figures until the American package was signed."
Even the signing of the agreement with the United States on Tuesday has failed to calm Mexico's financial markets. Since Tuesday morning, the Mexican stock exchange has fallen 212 points, including a drop of 57.8 points, or 3.6 percent, on Friday. In all, the exchange's index dropped 15 percent this week.
The conclusion of the American assistance package on Tuesday also did not help the peso much. On Friday, its value fell another 3 percent to close at 5.875 to the dollar. Since its devaluation in December, the peso, once worth almost 29 cents, has lost 41 percent of its value and is now worth just over 17 cents.
There are several other signs that Mexico's economic crisis is deepening. The Bank of Mexico reported on Thursday that inflation for the first half of February was 2.2 percent, which would amount to 67 percent on an annual basis, another indication that the initial stabilization plan failed to control prices.
Interest rates also have soared to historic levels in Mexico, causing further havoc with the economy. Just this week, rates on Government treasury certificates reached 59 percent, while an important interbank interest rate soared to 74 percent. That bank rate is used to determine interest for mortgages, car loans and credit cards, which now charge 97 percent annual interest.
Those interest rates have forced many debtors to fall behind on bank loans. The Government this week required banks to increase their reserves to cover uncollectable loans.
Mexico's businesses have also been hammered by the interest rate increases and other effects of the peso's devaluation. The president of one of Mexico's most important business councils, Luis German Carcoba, estimated this week that 250,000 jobs had been lost since January.
Mexican officials say they think the new plan being worked on at Los Pinos, the Mexican White House, will not put the economy back on track before the end of the year. They call it an adjustment of the original, which they say was at least successful in reducing the trade imbalance that contributed to Mexico's economic woes.
Figures released on Thursday show that Mexican exports shot up 35 percent in January, largely because the devaluation has made the country's products cheaper. But imports increased 7.9 percent, indicating that Mexicans' craving for foreign products has not gone away.
Mr. Zedillo told cheering supporters in Zacatecas on Thursday that Mexico "will not be conquered by a temporary crisis," but members of his administration say there have been serious setbacks and the future remains uncertain.
"We have had to recognize that the financial markets haven't evolved as we thought they should," said a presidential adviser familiar with the new recovery plan. "The shocks to the market have been longer and deeper than we originally thought. How much longer or deeper will they go? I couldn't say."

HEADLINE: Revived California Economy Confronts New Base Closings

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 25

 BODY:
With its long ailing economy finally rebounding, the news that California could lose more than 6,000 jobs with the proposed closing of two of its military bases was met this week with dismay but not alarm. After all, some economists said, the state is expected to add as many as 400,000 new jobs during 1995.
But the picture looks considerably darker from the perspective of the ill-prepared communities next to the bases, where the closings could prove devastating. That is especially true of Long Beach, the big port at the southern end of Los Angeles County, which is suffering from a deep post-cold-war hangover. It already has one of the highest unemployment rates of any urban area in the country because of previous cuts by the military industry. 
 Indeed, the latest bad news merely confirms the view that the economy of this once prosperous, blue-collar community is in for a wrenching change in its whole economic structure. Long Beach is expected to lose its Naval Shipyard and 3,100 jobs along with it. That would complete the closing of a series of Navy installations that employed 16,100 people just four years ago and would come on top of the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in factories that once manufactured jet fighters and missiles.
The other proposed closing is of an Army transportation base in Oakland, where more than 2,000 jobs would be lost. Oakland has also suffered deeply in the state's stubborn recession.
The proposals have spurred frantic rescue efforts and warnings that the beleaguered residents could become fierce opponents of the Clinton Administration less than two years away from a Presidential election.
"Don't forget, this state has a lot of votes," said Louis Rodriguez, president of the union local that represents most of the Long Beach base's workers. "People here are not going to forget what this Government has done to them again and again. Everyone is uncertain, and the uncertainty is making them angry."
The 3,100 jobs that are threatened at the shipyard would mean the loss of $175 million in direct annual wages and another $280 million in spending for base operations, the Navy said. The jobs pay about $14 to $15 an hour, Mr. Rodriguez said.
Sixty percent of the jobs are held by minorities, so the blow would fall heaviest on the black, Asian and Hispanic members of this community. Long Beach already has an unemployment rate of well over 10 percent, according to Jerry Miller, head of the city's economic development bureau, and it has been struggling to find a new economic engine in international trade and tourism.
Over the past few years, the McDonnell Douglas Co. has cut 30,000 of the 45,000 jobs from its factories in Long Beach.
The Clinton Administration is expected to make the official announcement on Tuesday of its plans to close about two dozen major bases around the country. A number of those bases are in the New York region, but the states of some powerful politicians, like Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, were spared.
Since California receives more military spending than any other state, it has absorbed the lion's share of the downsizing in recent years. The impact of the immediate job losses could be worsened by what economists call the multiplier effect.
Once those jobs are gone and spending is reduced, total losses could amount to as many as 12,000 jobs statewide, said Tom K. Lieser, an economic forecaster at the University of California at Los Angeles. "That is why when the losses are concentrated in one or two areas it can be very painful," he added.
"Our position is one base closing is one closing too many," said Judy Ann Miller, head of the state's Office of Military Base Retention. "We've been waiting for this day for a long time, and we intend to fight."

HEADLINE: The Best Ex-Job In the City;
After 13 Months Out of Office, Dinkins Is Basking in Affection

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
When he occupied the cozy office in City Hall's northwest corner, David N. Dinkins was fond of saying that no job was better than being Mayor of New York City. But in the 13 months since he left office, Mr. Dinkins appears to have found an even better job: former Mayor.
Everywhere he goes these days, Mr. Dinkins finds himself basking in the glow of New Yorkers' affections. He cannot walk down the street or enter a restaurant without someone shaking his hand and wishing him well. 
 "You've still got my vote," a Federal Express deliveryman said as Mr. Dinkins walked on Park Avenue South on a recent afternoon.
"You look wonderful," gushed a young woman, celebrating her wedding anniversary with a lunch at a modest midtown restaurant where Mr. Dinkins was having a quick cup of soup. "You look 10 years younger."
When he stops for a red light while behind the wheel of his burgundy Ford Crown Victoria, drivers in nearby cars hit their horns and wave enthusiastically, apparently astonished that a man who once traversed the city with a retinue of detectives and aides is now traveling solo.
Mr. Dinkins, 67, takes it all in with his customary reserve, enjoying the attention quietly and politely. He never notes that it is odd that he should be feted so warmly each day by the ordinary New Yorkers who so recently turned him out of office.
He simply accepts the response graciously, as he makes his rounds in the busy and public life he has fashioned for himself since departing City Hall. His schedule allows him to make a comfortable living and still indulge in many of the things he loves most: discussions of politics and government, family, social gatherings and tennis -- though not necessarily in that order.
He teaches one day a week at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, where he is a professor in the practice of urban affairs. Last fall, he taught a large lecture class on critical issues in urban policy. He has just begun a small seminar this semester on urban politics.
Mr. Dinkins also is the host, twice a week, of an hourlong interview and call-in show, "Dialogue With Dinkins," on WLIB-AM (1190). He presents his views on a range of issues, especially the administration of his successor, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Never a flamboyant speaker or prone to go for the political jugular, Mr. Dinkins nonetheless manages mildly to second-guess Mr. Giuliani quite often on the air.
Recently, for example, he criticized Mr. Giuliani's Police Commissioner, William J. Bratton, for saying that police officers could frisk someone who was drinking alcohol on a street corner. "The law as he states it I believe to be inaccurate," Mr. Dinkins said.
The former Mayor also works as a consultant for Ronald O. Perelman, the financier who is the chairman of the Revlon Corporation. Mr. Dinkins's office on Madison Avenue is next door to another politician-turned-consultant, Andrew J. Stein, the former City Council president.
Mr. Dinkins also sits on four corporate boards, including the American Stock Exchange and New World Communications, a company controlled by Mr. Perelman that owns television stations. He is a member of at least a dozen boards of nonprofit, charitable groups.
And while Mr. Dinkins is no longer a candidate for elected office, he is still out on the "rubber-chicken circuit," the litany of receptions, dinners, cocktail parties, benefits, fund-raisers and award ceremonies that are the staple of an elected official's existence. At least once or twice a day, he makes an appearance or gives a speech at a social gathering.
He recently presented an award to Kitty Carlisle Hart at a theater ceremony and enjoyed a dinner party afterward at the Russian Tea Room. He attended a ceremony at a recreation center in the Rockaways that was renamed in his honor, and he spoke at a party honoring a judge who is an old friend.
On many nights, he crams two or three parties into his schedule, which he fusses over with the attention that some people give to their stock portfolios.
"I genuinely like people," Mr. Dinkins said, explaining his active social calendar. "That which is a burden for some is a pleasure for me."
He even returned briefly to Gracie Mansion not long ago to attend a cocktail party for a retiring radio reporter. It was impossible to tell, by his practiced ease in chatting with other guests, whether he felt any discomfort at being back in the mansion that was his home from 1990 to 1994.
Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani joked about his presence. "You're welcome anytime," Mr. Giuliani said, before adding, "as a guest."
Mr. Dinkins's subdued grace no doubt obscures deeper emotions aroused by his narrow defeat in November 1993 to Mr. Giuliani, a white Republican who outpolled Mr. Dinkins, the city's first black Mayor -- a Democratic incumbent in an overwhelmingly Democratic city.
Mr. Dinkins's transition back to private life seems to have gone smoothly. For much of the last decade -- first as Manhattan Borough President and then as Mayor -- he was chauffeured by drivers or detectives. Caricatures of his mayorality often featured the aide who trailed behind him, carrying Mr. Dinkins's neatly pressed suit jacket on a hanger.
The retinue is gone now. His police security was withdrawn six months after he left office, as was Edward I. Koch's, under city tradition. Mr. Dinkins now drives himself. "It's like riding a bicycle," he said.
But he is also clearly disturbed that the city does not provide security to its former chief executives. He just will not say so directly.
"This is not the time for me to talk about it," he said. "I'll do that one of these days, when it's clear that it does not apply to me, when I'm talking about Rudy and his successors."
During a recent radio show, Mr. Dinkins was talking about Mr. Giuliani's attempts to shut down the city's fire-alarm boxes. His guest, Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler, a Queens Democrat who is the chairman of the Public Safety Committee, noted that the Council had approved a bill to block Mr. Giuliani's proposal by a vote of 47 to 2.
"With this Mayor," Mr. Leffler said of Mr. Giuliani, "you have to say he has the courage of his convictions. Forty-seven members of the Council disagree, but he wants to go ahead."
Mr. Dinkins then offered his own view. "Are you familiar with the story of the mother watching her son parading at West Point? She said, 'Look, everyone's out of step except my son.' "
Mr. Dinkins offered many other criticisms of Mr. Giuliani on his show, during his Columbia classes and in an interview. He said that Mr. Giuliani had apparently failed to include any black or Hispanic people among his core advisers; doing otherwise, he said, could have given him a broader perspective. And he said that Mr. Giuliani had been poorly served by Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson, who made several remarks that were widely considered to be racially charged.
Mr. Dinkins said, too, that Mr. Giuliani made a mistake by scheduling his inauguration last year on a Sunday morning, when many New Yorkers, including many black Protestants and Catholics, were in church.
He said the Mayor could save some vital social services from budget cuts by pressing the police and firefighters' unions for money-saving concessions. And he suggested that Mr. Giuliani should modulate his overall tone.
"I think that he would be better advised not to be combative on as many issues as he is, which doesn't mean that he is wrong on every issue," Mr. Dinkins said.
Mr. Dinkins carefully monitors the press, eager to protect his legacy. He has been quick to fault the press when he has thought it has been inattentive to his contributions. Mr. Dinkins noted on a recent radio show, for example, that newspaper articles on a dispute between Mr. Giuliani and the Council over creating an independent agency to monitor police corruption sometimes mentioned that it was the Mollen Commission that first recommended such a step.
"They seem rarely to go the next step to say that the Mollen Commission was appointed by Dinkins," he said.
Mr. Dinkins also appears to share the view of some of his political supporters, who believe the press, and the newspapers in particular, have treated Mr. Giuliani more kindly than they did him.
On his radio show not long ago, a caller said that some politicians and newspaper editorial boards had recommended a state takeover of the city's budget when Mr. Dinkins had been in charge, but that no such calls have been made while Mr. Giuliani struggled to balance the budget.
"It's plain and simple racism," the unidentified caller said.
Mr. Dinkins responded with characteristic indirectness. "I have said many times -- I don't dwell on it -- that racism exists in our society, but that most people are not racists," he said.
Then he added, "I think Rudy has had a free ride with the press, but I think it's coming to an end."

HEADLINE: Older Suburbs Struggle to Compete With New

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LAKEWOOD, Ohio

 BODY:
The grand mansions along Lake Erie here are still splendid, and the modest homes farther from the lakefront still neat and well kept. Even the affluent in this suburb next door to Cleveland send their children to its public schools. But all is not as stable as it seems.
Like hundreds of older suburbs across the nation, Lakewood is fighting to maintain its middle-class manner. But even as it struggles to fend off problems associated with cities -- rising crime, dwindling services and fading schools -- Lakewood finds that newer, more outlying suburbs are luring away middle-class home buyers and with them the tax base needed to stave off decline. 
 Even though last fall's Republican triumphs may have marked the rise of America's suburbs to political preeminence, the traditional antagonism between city and suburb has been joined by rising tensions between old and new suburbs. And so far, the older suburbs appear to be the losers.
"We still have this fantasy image of the suburbs of the 1950's, which tends to mean Ozzie and Harriet and the nuclear family in the backyard," said Peter Dreier, the E. P. Clapp distinguished professor of politics at Occidental College in Los Angeles, who was a senior adviser to Raymond L. Flynn when he was Mayor of Boston. "But all suburbs are not the same. Gritty, blue-collar suburbs and older suburbs are having the same problems as the inner city."
The 1990 census found for the first time that scores of suburbs farthest from their metropolitan cores were drawing the bulk of new industrial and commercial investment and the kind of residents who provide healthy tax bases. The center cities and nearby suburbs like Lakewood were the losers. Lakewood has not suffered the fate of East Cleveland, Cleveland's first suburb, once the home of John D. Rockefeller and now now pockmarked with boarded-up factories and rubble-choked lots.
But it is falling behind places like Rocky River, five miles farther west, where Michael McIntyre, a lifelong Lakewood resident, recently moved with his wife, Elizabeth.
"Our concern with Lakewood was taxes," said the 30-year-old Mr. McIntyre, a reporter with The Cleveland Plain Dealer. "Lakewood is an aging community that had a lot of character, but there are lots of people and not a lot of businesses to support the tax base."
Lakewood is Cleveland's second oldest suburb, with half of its housing built before 1918. The median home price is $73,000, offering the cheapest suburban housing in the Cleveland metropolitan area. Rents too are low, $382 for a one-bedroom unit, which attracts Cleveland residents looking for affordable suburban living. Half of Lakewood residents are renters. With 5.5 square miles and 60,000 residents, Lakewood is the most densely populated city in Ohio, with 10,858 people per square mile, compared with Cleveland's 6,566 per square mile. While the city's population declined from 70,000 in 1980, the number of low-income households headed by women is on the rise, undermining the tax base. Nearly 10 percent of the residents now receive some form of welfare. And social problems like pregnancies among unwed teen-agers are not as rare in the local high school as they once were. Older residents voted down tax levies for the local schools four times since 1993, helping create a projected $1 million deficit for the 1995-96 school year.
Once solidly white, Lakewood has managed to integrate itself with few problems and now has 4 percent minority residents. An aggressive program of backyard trash pickup, parenting programs for teen-agers, and tough housing inspectors who cite residents for even one broken porch baluster, have helped it keep its reputation as a good place to live. Most of the crime is juvenile delinquency; there has been only one homicide in five years.
The strains being felt here have their echoes across the country, particularly around older industrial cities in the the northern tier of states from Massachusetts to Minnesota. Officials in places like Lowell and Somerville outside Boston, Cicero and Harvey outside Chicago, the New Haven area and the suburbs around Minneapolis are worrying whether people, wealth and political power will continue to move ever outward and what the consequences might be for the areas left behind.
"We know we're in competition with those newer suburbs, so we're doing everything we can to maintain our housing stock, our services and our public schools," said Jo Ann Boscia, president of the Lakewood City Council.
Thomas E. Bier, director of the Housing Policy Research Program at Cleveland State University, sees no halt to the outward movement. The most extensive research on urban-suburban migration studies have been done in the Cleveland area by the university's urban center, using not only national census data but data from city and county agencies as well. In a 1993 study, Mr. Bier noted that home sellers moved farther from Cleveland and its near suburbs at five times the rate of those moving into the area.
David Harbarger, Lakewood's Mayor, said he considered the issues for people deciding where to move in the suburbs were equally schools, safety and city services. "If any one area is in decay," he said, "the others can't hold it up."
Paula Reed, a local real estate agent who described herself as a "died-in-the-wool Lakewoodite" said she was considering moving because the community had turned down the school tax levies.
"We've got two children, 10 and 13, and their most important school years are coming up," she said. "The people in Lakewood can't afford not to keep the schools up. If we can't afford to attract young families who can afford to keep these properties up, we're dead."
Fueling the outmigration in the Cleveland metropolitan area, said Timothy Hagan, president of the Cuyahoga County Commissioners, is the state legislature's recent decision to expand Interstate 90 to eight lanes from four lanes westward from just inside the Cuyahoga County line, about eight miles west of Lakewood.
"The suburban communities are calling for increasing the capacity of the highways to make it easier for those commuters to go from suburbs to suburb and from the fringe of one county to another county," said Mr. Hagan. "With those counties' expansion come sewers and water and spending that moves farther and farther away from the mother city, the county seat, the engine that generated this growth."
Ms. Boscia drove a visitor around on a recent overcast winter day, pointing out the private beach and beachfront homes that gave Lakewood the feel of a Sausalito on the frozen lake, as well as the two-family houses, or doubles, in the heavily ethnic, blue-collar Birdtown area.
For the moment, Lakewood remains stable. But the whether it will stay that way is doubtful. No limit to the movement outward is in sight, most analysts say.
"Who can begin to say where it ends," said Mr. Bier. "It's not unusual in the greater Los Angeles area to drive 100 miles to work every day. The outer reaches of Cleveland are 25 miles or so. You're living in the country at 35 miles so that by L.A. standards, we could continue for decades going farther and farther out. The whole landscape is moving outward and that's not good for cities or for their older suburbs."

HEADLINE: Little-Noticed Court Gains Scrutiny in Custody Fight for Twins

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PLYMOUTH, Mass., Feb. 22

 BODY:
In a decision that opens a window onto the uncommon flexibility within the most personal of courts, a county family judge has ordered the separation of identical twin girls, temporarily giving custody of one to her mother and the other to her father.
The 10-year-old girls, Tara and Sheena Raymond of Wareham, had been living with their father, Dana Raymond, since the parents divorced two years ago. After their mother, Jean Ardizoni, sued to modify the custody arrangement, both parents, their lawyers and expert witnesses went to Plymouth County Probate and Family Court here on Feb. 14, prepared for a scheduled two-day trial. 
 Instead, Judge James R. Lawton ordered that the girls be picked up from their elementary school, then talked with them privately for 20 minutes. He ordered that Sheena live with her mother until a hearing on June 30, canceled the trial and left that day for a 10-day vacation in Florida.
Judge Lawton's decision, viewed as Solomon-like by some and cruel by others, offered a glimpse into the normally private world of Probate and Family Court, where decisions on the most emotional and intimate of matters are handed down daily by judges guided more by their personal values than by strict legal guidelines common in criminal and civil courts.
Court officials say that judges must use every tool they can to clear their increasingly heavy dockets. The case is one of thousands choking the state's probate courts, which settle disputes over trusts and estates as well as personal issues like domestic abuse, child support, guardianship, the right to die and commitment of mentally ill to institutions.
Judge Lawton, in an interview with The Associated Press, said he "simply wanted to do what the girls said they wanted."
"I was not performing surgery on Siamese twins," he said.
Where some legal experts and court administrators see flexibility, John E. Murphy, the lawyer for the twins' father, said he saw caprice. He said consistency and predictability were "the whole idea of the law."
"Then you go into court and there's chaos," Mr. Murphy said. "In probate court the judge can go on his whim of the day."
Dorothy Gill, who represents Ms. Ardizoni, 34, said the judge's action was appropriate. "What the judge did was listen to the children and fashion something that addressed their concerns," she said.
Had the girls committed a crime or been the victims of one, their names and faces would have remained secret. But in Massachusetts and other states, family court records are open to the public unless sealed by the judge. Although the press normally does not cover such cases, this one has drawn widespread attention to the court as well as the family.
Although the blue-eyed, blond twins still see each other at school, they have said they were surprised and upset at being separated.
Mr. Raymond, a 44-year-old unemployed cable splicer, said he was enraged by the decision and by the cancellation of the trial. "The politicians, somebody, has to look at the immense power one man or one woman has to destroy a family," Mr. Raymond said. "We waited about 10 months for this trial. You have the right to a fair trial, the right to be heard."
Rosemarie Haigazian, a lawyer on Martha's Vineyard who practices family law and has represented children in divorce and custody cases, said decision making in probate court differed from that in other types of legal cases.
"In civil cases, there are dollar amounts and often the help of a jury," she said. "In criminal cases there are standards of what constitutes a crime and often the help of a jury. In probate cases, it falls to the judge to take the facts, which are many and conflicting, and the law, which is voluminous, mix them together and come up with a decision."
Other than state guidelines for child support, there are no rules to guide family judges. For example, Judge Catherine P. Sabaitis, who had handled the Raymond case earlier, refuses to talk to children in divorce and custody cases, because her philosophy is that children should be shielded from adult matters, said several lawyers who have presented cases before her. Judge Lawton, on the other hand, counsels new judges to listen to children.
John E. McNichols, court administrator for the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court Department, said such broad discretion for judges was essential.
"Can one establish guidelines to deal with that highly emotionally charged an issue?" he said. "I don't think so. If that were the case, you could put a computer behind the bench."
In a society that increasingly seems to look to courts -- or television talk show hosts -- to intervene in what once were private affairs, the 43 judges in Massachusetts' 14 probate courts are taking on new areas of family matters. For example, from fiscal year 1990 to 1994, paternity suits in state family courts soared to 17,808 from 7,575.
"Too many people rely on the courts to fix things. Maybe that's just the way society has changed over the past 20 to 30 years," Mr. McNichols said.
Only a few of the state's most senior family judges have secretaries. Others rely on harried typing pools. Most court orders are handwritten. A staff of six law clerks was recently approved for family court judges: in the state's criminal courts about 40 clerks serve about 70 judges.
Meanwhile, Tara and Sheena Raymond still attend the same class at Minot Forest Elementary School in Wareham and take karate lessons together three times each week. They say they used to play tricks on their teachers and friends before Tara's braces made it easier to tell them apart.

HEADLINE: Paterson, Used to Struggling, Struggles for Control

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PATERSON, N.J., Feb. 25

 BODY:
A short walk from the spot where a young drug suspect was shot by a rookie police officer earlier this week lies a stretch of abandoned textile mills, one after the other, dozens of mottled brick carcasses that once nurtured this city and clothed the nation.
Most everyone here learns in school that Paterson was a workhorse of the Industrial Revolution. There were so many thousands of looms earlier in the century that the din of machinery forever clogged the local air. It was a sound -- thwack, thwack, thwack -- that meant jobs. 
 The people in Paterson sometimes referred to the mills when they talked about the protests, looting and racial tensions stirred after the white housing police officer, Ronald Cohen, shot the unarmed black teen-ager, Lawrence Meyers, during the drug arrest on Tuesday. He died on Friday night.
"Everybody out here is struggling," said Raymond Brownfield, 22, an unemployed cook who was among the scores of young black men taunting police officers in riot gear on Thursday night. "It's hard to survive, to make ends meet. This used to be a real city of opportunity -- Silk City! -- but now there's nothing. Everything used to be here. It's a 'used to be' city. That's all."
With 140,891 people, Paterson represents a certain kind of urban America -- too large to readily make the transition to prettified suburbia, too small to demand the money and attention given to neighbors like Newark or New York City to overcome poverty, drugs and failing schools.
Though the city has rebounded slightly from the early 1980's, when it was called one of the poorest in America, the unemployment rate is stuck at 11 percent. The rate is 13.7 percent for black residents, according to the 1990 Census, and is certainly much higher for young black men. (National unemployment rates in December were 9.8 percent for blacks and 34.6 percent for blacks ages 16 to 19.)
The numbers are troubling to many here, but some local officials say they can also be misleading. To Councilman Thomas C. Rooney Jr., 67, a former Mayor who has lived his whole life in Paterson, jobs and history have little to do with what happened this week.
"What we saw in the last few days is a total contempt for law on the part of those who were making this minor riot," he said. "This has nothing to do with economics. It is the absolute breakdown of law, and that is a major, major difference."
To bolster his argument, Mr. Rooney points to the city's immigrant population, mostly from Latin America and the Middle East, which has transformed neighborhoods that last thrived in the days when Allen Ginsberg was a child here. He says they are evidence that anyone can make it in Paterson.
Many of the black adults who tried to soothe the anger of Mr. Meyers's friends and schoolmates disagree, insisting that it is impossible to separate Mr. Meyers's death and the resulting outcry from what they say are the discrimination and hardships faced by blacks in Paterson.
Martin Barnes, a former City Councilman and mayoral candidate who is black, said the young black residents who demonstrated this week would feel more confident that the judicial system would properly investigate the killing if they knew that more black people were in positions of power.
He pointed out some statistics: although the city is more than 36 percent black, fewer than 20 percent of the police officers are black, and virtually none are supervisors. Only in the last few years have black and Hispanic residents taken control of the City Council, which now has four Hispanic members, three blacks and two whites. The Mayor is white.
And, Mr. Barnes noted, even though blacks have arrived in City Hall, the municipal government is so hard-pressed that there is little money for social-service programs. Property values have declined and taxes have risen in a cycle worsened by abandonment and arson. The city's long-term debt has climbed sharply. The school system has performed so poorly that the state took it over in 1991. And Paterson, unlike the state's other large cities, Newark and Jersey City, has no big corporations to help out.
"Now we've gotten to the point where we've gotten some control of the political system, but we are still not doing anything because there is nothing there," Mr. Barnes said. "They've already milked it all gone, and that's when it all of a sudden got over to the blacks. They gave it to us when there was nothing left to give."
Kim Freeman, 35, a teacher's aide who is also black, said many of the parents and grandparents of the young black residents upset by the shooting of Mr. Meyers first came to Paterson from the South after World War II.
"Most people I know, their parents came up here to work in the factories," Mr. Freeman said. "Paterson was a magnet, the first industrialized city in the United States. Now it's a jobs depression. There are no jobs, no education and no housing, and that's a recipe for chaos."
One reason for the drop in fortunes is the steady decline in manufacturing, which has existed here since Paterson was founded by Alexander Hamilton in the 1790's. Hamilton envisioned factories generating power from the Great Falls, the 77-foot-high waterfall on the Passaic River, so he set up the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures, hoping to break the country's dependence on English manufacturing.
By the end of the 19th century, Paterson was the one of the nation's leading centers for textile and locomotive manufacturing. By the 1950's, though, many of those enterprises had left, fleeing labor unrest and high costs. About 36 percent of Paterson's jobs were in factories in 1990, as opposed to 48 percent in 1975, officials said.
But some companies have remained and prospered, and others keep moving in, searching for cheap space and ready labor. That is why, despite the depressing economic numbers, some city boosters are upbeat.
"In the last year, I have seen a tremendous upturn," said Deborah Hoffman, executive director of the Paterson Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit group. "Many communities don't welcome manufacturing. We do. When they are pushed out of the suburbs, we welcome them in Paterson."
Some businesses new to Paterson, like the Co-op Screw Manufacturing Company, said they were pleased by the city. Others, like Jean Wash, which dyes garments, said crime was a problem, as was finding qualified workers.
"I need people to run the machines, and I need girls to fold the garments," said Maurice Taieb, president of Jean Wash. "Girls I have no problem hiring. But people who are responsible to run the machines, I can't find those people. I went to the employment agency, and the people they sent were bad, not reliable. They didn't come on time."
Hispanic residents in Paterson, who are mostly from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and increasingly, Peru, appear to have largely stayed out of the dispute over Mr. Meyers's death. But Hispanic officials, like Councilwoman Maria Magda O'Keefe, said they shared many of the concerns that their black counterparts have over issues like housing and drugs.
Ms. Magda O'Keefe said Paterson had been good to many immigrants, who were starting to move from working-class or poor neighborhoods to areas that were once solely white. "We are getting better places, better homes, many are becoming homeowners," she said.
But both Ms. Magda O'Keefe and Councilman Rooney, who is known for his fiscal conservatism, said they feared that the publicity that Paterson had received this week might threaten efforts to revitalize the city. Mr. Rooney said he had received several calls from businesses worried about the violence.
"This is going to make it far more difficult for us to attract business to Paterson to create jobs," he said. "This is going to hurt all these young people because the jobs that could have been here won't come because of their actions."
"I am not optimistic, not from what I see," he added. "How could you be?"

HEADLINE: ON PRO HOCKEY;
In Quebec, Sale Rumors and an Arena Agenda

BYLINE: By Joe Lapointe 

DATELINE: QUEBEC

 BODY:
The early-season success of the Quebec Nordiques masks the never-ending intrigue in this special hockey city.
The owner, Marcel Aubut, who once traded Eric Lindros to two teams in the same day, now enjoys serious interest from potential franchise buyers in Phoenix and Denver. He wouldn't dare sell the team to two cities at the same time, would he? 
 The swirling sale rumors complement Aubut's arena-building agenda. Jean Martineau, a team spokesman, insisted the team wanted to stay in Quebec and said last week that the Nordiques wanted to finance construction through either a provincial lottery or through revenue from gambling casinos.
"That way, there's no tax money involved," Martineau said. "It's all voluntary." The arena should have 19,000 seats and 80 boxes, he said. The Nordiques are now filling 91 percent of their 15,399 seats in le Colisee.
Until an arena is built, Martineau said, the team wants a financial subsidy from the province. He did not give a dollar figure, but he said moving would abolish 600 jobs in the city and remove $10 million per year in provincial tax revenue. The overall economic impact, he said, would amount to $50 million annually. The team will lose $10 million this season, he said, and $12 million next season.
Another factor in the equation is the possibility that the 2002 Winter Olympics will be in Quebec. The city is one of four finalists, along with Salt Lake City, Ostersund, Sweden, and Sion, Switzerland. That decision will be made on June 18. A new arena would enhance Quebec's appeal.
"It's always a big fight here," Martineau said, referring to the political and economic considerations. "Mr. Aubut wants to keep this franchise in Quebec. If the officials don't have the vision to keep the franchise, it will be sad."
The team is also considering a new design of its uniform, and even that sartorial change is intertwined in the socio-political-economic fabric. The current version features several fleurs-de-lis, the insignia that adorns the provincial flag.
The Nordiques are considering using fewer of them in the new design, although they deny that the insignia will be eliminated altogether. When the Minnesota North Stars redesigned their uniforms three seasons ago, they dropped North from their name and then moved to Dallas a year later. With another referendum on provincial sovereignty approaching in Quebec, what French politician voting on arena financing would want to take the blame for the creation of the "Phoenix Sudiques"?
Furthermore, a move of the Nordiques could complicate National Hockey League expansion plans. The next two, four or six teams should sell for at least $50 million apiece, and probably more.
If Aubut moves into one of those markets, his N.H.L. partners don't get to share an expansion windfall. During the recent lockout, the wealthier N.H.L. teams promised to explore revenue-sharing possibilities. Perhaps Aubut's current dealings will encourage them to hasten their efforts.
On the ice, the robust Nordiques are enhancing their value to potential buyers as they prepare for their second of four games with the Pittsburgh Penguins on Monday night, at home.
In the first meeting last Tuesday night in Pittsburgh, the Penguins won by 5-4, pushing Quebec into second place in the standings of the Northeast Division, the Eastern Conference and the 26-team league.
Quebec's roster is the second-youngest in the league. The coach and the general manager -- Marc Crawford and Pierre Lacroix -- are both in their first seasons on the job. Thus far, the trade with Toronto for Wendel Clark appears to be the cement that has bonded this multilingual, multinational roster to play as a unit.
"I'm just one small part," said Clark, second in team scoring with 19 points on 10 goals and 9 assists, before Saturday night's game with Boston.
He said Crawford "is the main reason for the turnaround" because he has "full control.
"Everyone is following one game plan and respecting him," Clark said.
Clark speaks only high-school French, but he said the adjustment to his new culture has been "easy, if you're patient."
"It takes a little longer in restaurants," he said. "I'm picking it up as I go along."
Are the players -- from French Canada, English Canada, Russia, Sweden, the United States, Finland and Germany -- bothered by constant rumors of a new residence?
"Winning is the easiest way to solve all problems and end all rumors," Clark said. "If you win, the boat is rocked less. If you lose, the boat is rocked more."

'I've Walked in Their Shoes'

BYLINE: By JENNIFER FREY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: POMPANO BEACH, Fla., Feb. 25

 BODY:
He started around 8:30 A.M., shortly after his wife, Lana, left for work. For Curt Blefary, the drink of choice was whisky, a blend called Philadelphia. He took it with barely a splash of water and a handful of ice. By noon, he would have finished more than a quart.
 With the drink came the bitterness, and with the bitterness, the depression. While he drank, Blefary read the sports sections, checking, enviously, on the progress of his former big league teammates and friends. Gene Michael was running the Yankees. Bob Watson was in Houston. Frank Robinson in Baltimore. He would see no-name players -- guys who had less talent and less notoriety than he'd had -- get hired as coaches or instructors. 
 And he would sit home, alone and unemployed, his left hip crumbling from a disease exacerbated by the alcohol, and wonder why it had never worked out for him.
 "It was the same every day," Blefary said recently, sitting in the same easy chair where he used to pass his mornings. "I'd sit there drinking and drinking. I was in a total depression. I blamed everybody for my problems except myself."
 Nearly 10 months ago, Blefary started another morning with another drink, this time not even waiting for his wife to leave. But after a few moments, he looked at the drink in his hand and started to cry. Then he walked into the bathroom and told Lana that he was going to seek help.
 With the assistance of Sam McDowell, a former Cleveland Indians pitcher and a part of the Baseball Assistance Team that aids past players with problems, Blefary enrolled in a rehabilitation program on May 13. He was released 28 days later and has been sober since.
 "I was a drinker for 33 years," said Blefary, who is now 51. "I started when I was 18. By Triple-A, I was drinking hard liquor. In the big leagues, I was out of control."
 An outfielder and a catcher, Blefary was the American League rookie of the year in 1965, when he hit .260 with 22 home runs and 70 runs batted in for the Baltimore Orioles. He hit more than 20 home runs in each of his first three seasons, then tailed off slowly over the next five years, playing for four other franchises -- including the Yankees in 1970 and part of 1971 -- before being released by the Atlanta Braves in the spring of 1973. He was not yet 30 years old.
 "I had a problem when I was playing, but nobody ever had the guts to tell me," Blefary said. "Back then, people were more likely to bring you another drink than ask if you had a problem."
 In many ways, the game has not changed. Tonight in Port St. Lucie, minor league and replacement players for the Mets will be required to sit through an hourlong presentation about the dangers of drugs and alcohol. Absent from the game when Blefary played, the presentation is now an annual ritual. Often, though, the warning is not heeded.
 "We have sessions to help the players understand how to deal with a lot of issues -- alcohol education programs, drug abuse information, sessions about relationships with women," said Steve Phillips, the Mets' director of minor league operations. "What we have to do at the minor league level is respond to what we see going on at the major league level."
 On the major league level, the Mets have watched Darryl Strawberry and Dwight Gooden, two former rookies of the year, two members of their 1986 World Series champion team, battle with substance abuse problems that have resulted in both being suspended from major league baseball. In a report published last week, Strawberry and Gooden argued that their problems stemmed from being part of what Strawberry called a baseball "life style."
 Blefary understands that. He, too, was a rookie of the year. He, too, won a World Series early in his career, playing for the Baltimore team that defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1966. And, he, too, got caught up in the party.
 "You're a celebrity," said Blefary. "Yes, there were some who didn't, but there were lots who did. It was always there."
 Blefary can remember the spring day in 1965 when he showed up at breakfast still drunk, and was so sick on the bus ride to the park that he made the driver pull over so he could throw up. He remembers countless days when he sat in the whirlpool, sometimes even dunking his head, trying to get himself straight before a game.
 He picked his spots, drinking less before day games or doubleheaders, but he did not stop.
 Bitter when his playing career came to a premature end and his reputation as a drinker and carouser helped prevent him from getting a coaching job, Blefary continued to drink after he left the game. The years passed, and the drinking got worse. His kids visited more and more infrequently. He got laid off from a job driving a truck, then worked at a temporary agency for $4.25 an hour. He hated it, and he drank more.
 For a long time, he tried to fool himself into thinking he had gone straight, attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for nearly 11 years. He never took them seriously.
 "I'd go and try to point out all the things wrong with everyone else there," he said. "Now I have a sponsor I talk to every day. I understand."
 Blefary drinks cola now, and concentrates on recovering from hip replacement surgery performed by a local doctor, Paul Meli, who donated his time because Blefary long ago lost his insurance. He dreams about being given a second chance in baseball, about one of his old friends calling and offering him that coaching job. He talks about working with kids, giving motivational speeches that warn about the dangers of alcohol.
 And he still reads the newspapers, paying close attention to the stories about Gooden and Strawberry. He sees a lot of himself in those two, and it worries him.
 "It seems like everybody is telling them that it's going to be all right and they believe it," Blefary said. "Well, it ain't going to be all right, not if they're still in denial. I've walked in their shoes. I've been there. I know."

HEADLINE: Sanctions on Trade With Beijing Begin As Deadline Passes

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sunday, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Trade sanctions on more than $1 billion in Chinese goods, the largest punitive trade measure ever imposed by the United States, technically went into effect today as negotiations to avert a trade war passed a deadline set three weeks ago.
With trade negotiators from both sides still working in Beijing, and with prospects that the talks could continue even as the sanctions begin to be applied on Monday, neither Government openly declared that a trade war was on. 
 Nevertheless, both sides emphasized three weeks ago that American sanctions on items such as handkerchiefs and cellular telephones and Chinese counter sanctions would automatically go into effect if an agreement was not reached by 12:01 A.M. Eastern time today.
There were indications that the American strategy was to allow the passing of the deadline in hopes that this would build pressure on the Chinese and demonstrate Washington's resolve to achieve most of its demands. Washington wants the Chinese Government to begin shutting down the more than two dozen factories, most of them in southern China, that manufacture pirated versions of copyrighted software, music and videos.
Chinese officials announced early today that they had shut down two such factories, including a well-known company that was illegally copying American movies, including "Jurassic Park." United States negotiators are believed to be pressing for a broader enforcement program as well as for opening the Chinese market to the American goods that are often pirated here.
In Washington, Clinton Administration officials said that United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, had called a news conference for early Sunday afternoon in Washington.
The passing of today's dealine created a scene of significant confusion in Beijing as a game of brinkmanship was played out behind closed doors and over secure telephone lines between Washington and Beijing.
 In response to demands from the United States that it enforce copyright, trademark and patent laws, China has publicized a series of crackdowns on the sale of illegal compact and laser disks in the last week, confiscating pirated disks and arresting retailers.
But American officials have said they want to see a stronger symbol of China's commitment to enforce the laws, by going to the source of pirated copyrighted goods, and not just to those who market them. There are 29 factories known to be capable of reproducing compact and laser disks, most of them in Guangdong Province, near Hong Kong.
Perhaps the best known of all is the Shenfei Laser and Optical System Company, a maker of audio and video disks that is frequently cited by United States negotiators as a flagrant copyright violator. The closing of Shenfei was announced this morning.
One American official said last week that he suspected Beijing had been reluctant to prosecute Shenfei because its management includes relatives of senior Chinese leaders. The nation's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, made a well-publicized visit to Shenfei when he toured southern China in early 1992.
Whatever the reason for waiting until the last minute, the authorities appeared to be trying to dispel doubt about China's commitment to further action.
"Investigations have found that the Shenfei Company made illegal visual disks of the 'Jurassic Park' and other audio laser products for certain foreign businessmen," the news agency reported. "Its products were found not only available on the Chinese market but also on some overseas markets."
The report continued, "It has been a consistent stand of the Chinese Government to protect copyrights and to crack down on piracy."
The current round of talks began on Feb. 14, 10 days after Mr. Kantor, announced that sanctions would begin against China if no agreement was reached by today.
The talks intensified last week when the deputy trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, flew here from Washington, but in daily comments before and after negotiating sessions neither side revealed exactly what separated them.
In other trade negotiations in recent years, American and Chinese officials have employed a variety of tactics and bluffs, sometimes delaying final discussions until minutes before a deadline. All the while, other gestures have signaled hardening or softening at various points in the talks.
In what appeared to be one such carefully timed action, the Beijing Intermediate People's Court held a hearing on Friday in a case against two Beijing video stores. Eight Hollywood studios had accused the shops of illegally copying 18 films. A judge postponed the case until next month, requesting more evidence.
The film studios have urged American negotiators to concentrate on Chinese factories that copy Hollywood movies and export them across Asia, a practice that potentially costs the studios millions of dollars in lost sales.
Under pressure from the computer software industry, the American negotiators have also asked China to persuade Chinese companies and officials to pay for computer software, beginning with China's trade ministry, which the Americans say uses hundreds of pirated copies of Microsoft software.
"It's not surprising that there are differences in Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations," Wu Yi, China's trade minister, was quoted as saying in a New China News Agency report on Saturday. "What's important is that the controversies should be settled through consultations on an equal footing."

HEADLINE: February 19-25: Mexican Relief;
The Austerity Cure May Be As Lethal As the Illness

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
Bailing out Mexico was hard enough for President Clinton, who bypassed Congress after he discovered that loaning $20 billion to a foreign nation that can't pay its bills is not part of the Contract with America. But the bailout will be even harder for the Mexicans.
 When the deal was signed last week, it included American requirements that Mexico keep its interest rates sky-high -- they were 50 percent last week -- balance its budget and get Washington's approval for almost any major economic move.The fear now is that the cure could be as debilitating as the disease, that Mexico may be plunged into a recession. 
 Meanwhile, the Administration began sending quiet signals to its candidate to head the new World Trade Organization, Carlos Salinas, the former Mexican president now blamed for the peso crisis, that he might start thinking about another job. DAVID E. SANGER

HEADLINE: We Should Call It Profit Care, Not Managed Care

 BODY:
An article on Jan. 29 about a San Francisco hospital's adjustment to the new era of managed care drew a range of letters, most from physicians, citing the moral difficulties, both for individual doctors and for American society, of keeping an eye on the bottom line when a suffering patient awaits help.

To the Editor: 
 From the land of earthquakes and floods another potential disaster appears to be in the making. Under the guise of "capitation" hospitals will be known as "health companies" and "cost centers."
Once again the fact that health spending currently accounts for 14 percent of our gross domestic product is raised without explaining that care is not rationed here as it is in those countries to which we are forever being compared. Young men and women come to the United States from all parts of the world for training in our post-graduate medical system. We must be doing something right.
The proposed "managed care" in the capitation system will limit patients' choice of doctors and have their in-hospital care standardized using "clinical pathways" that outline details and duration of care according to each illness. Any experienced doctor can tell you that good care must be individualized and cannot follow a standard plan put forth by some partially educated person.
"Capitation" in no way decreases administrative costs, which now account for between 30 and 60 percent of the health care dollar in the United States, and certainly does nothing for those citizens currently uninsured! Managed care and rationed care are synonymous and it is important for all patients and potential patients to realize this.

HEADLINE: We Should Call It Profit Care, Not Managed Care

 BODY:
An article on Jan. 29 about a San Francisco hospital's adjustment to the new era of managed care drew a range of letters, most from physicians, citing the moral difficulties, both for individual doctors and for American society, of keeping an eye on the bottom line when a suffering patient awaits help.

To the Editor: 
 The brave new world you described may provide a quick fix for the rapidly disappearing fee-for-service form of medicine, but the evolving managed-care plans are unlikely to be sustainable. Hospitals with excess beds, tertiary care units, high-priced specialists and high-tech equipment are increasingly being taken over and managed by large for-profit H.M.O.'s and insurance companies controlled by highly paid managers and chief executives.
Competition among managed-care providers has resulted in ever-larger mergers in order to effectively contract with companies seeking ever-cheaper health plans for their employees. A past history of providing continuous medical care to an individual for 15 or 20 years does not guarantee that any particular doctor-patient relationship will continue; every week I see people being changed from one "plan" to another by their companies.
Pressure to create profits has not only caused hospitals to economize by closing floors and dismissing nurses, but it increasingly places physicians at risk as "gatekeepers." Ordering fewer tests, consultations and hospitalizations increases profit margins. But gatekeeping also creates adversarial relationships between health care providers and patients. In addition, as your article pointed out, managed care competition makes hospitals less likely to put resources into community programs. In their zeal to economize, "health companies" not only exhibit little compassion for their patients, but in attempts to maximize profits by avoiding high-risk and seriously ill individuals, they destroy the very purpose of health insurance.
The corporatization of medicine may provide "less of the art of medicine and more of the science of medicine," but eventually the societal penalties resulting from forming a second-class group of citizens based on sickness, disability, serious illness and uninsured status will prove these "health companies" to be disastrous for medical care in the 21st century.

HEADLINE: Budget Amendment Will Handcuff Presidents

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Newt Gingrich's "Beyond the 100 Days" (Op-Ed, Feb. 22) celebrates halftime achievements of the Republican Contract With America. Mr. Gingrich is right to celebrate now. Who knows how much will be there for him to celebrate at the end of the 100 days, what with the Senate's Democrats slowly waking up and even moderate Republicans (of whom there are a few left) having second thoughts about some of the radical ideas coming sometimes from both sides of the House? 
 The Contract With America deserves, however, an attempt at dispassionate analysis. Unquestionably, the first 50 days produced some legislation that was badly needed, like bringing Congress under the same regulations that business has to adhere to. The line-item veto could have potentially good effects, if used by a responsible President -- and it is the voters' job to put responsible Presidents in the White House.
 The importance of these laws passed pales, however, compared with the potentially calamitous harm that other parts of the contract can inflict on current and future generations.
 I would like to discuss only one, but arguably the most dangerous piece of legislation, the balanced budget amendment. Should it become part of the Constitution, it will tie the hands of political leaders in future recessions and prevent them from stimulating the economy, as Ronald Reagan did in the 1981-82 recession.
 Then Mr. Reagan gave a new dimension to the definition of fiscal stimulus, by increasing the deficit to unprecedented heights. While his motive in doing so had probably more to do with the cold war than the recession, the beneficial effect on the economic situation was undeniable.
 During the next recession in 1990-92, President Bush already had the stimulus of a large fiscal deficit at his disposal and was able, together with lowering of interest rates by the Federal Reserve, to more or less master the recession by the time President Clinton was inaugurated.
 The proponents of the balanced budget amendment would deny this powerful tool for the prevention of depressions to future generations of political leaders. At the same time they are telling us that we should trust future politicians to have the courage to break a constitutional mandate. The kind of courage that current leaders, according to their own admission, do not possess. Actually they use their own lack of courage as their principal argument for the passage of the amendment.
 Future generations of voters will curse them for this amendment, and if 1994 is any indication, will punish their own generation of politicians for the calamities they will have to suffer.

HEADLINE: House Hunters' Friend: Buyer Brokers

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WHEN Denise and Fred Weiss started looking for a house last spring, instead of going to a traditional realtor, they enlisted the services of a buyer broker.
"At the time we were in a rental apartment in Riverdale with our two young sons, and it was tight," said Mrs. Weiss who is 29. "Interest rates were low, so we figured it was a good time to get into the housing market. When we discussed it with our families, my brother-in-law, who is an appraiser, suggested that we go with a buyer broker." 
 At the time, Mrs. Weiss said, "I didn't know the difference between a buyer broker and a regular real estate broker until my brother-in-law explained that a buyer broker would work on our behalf, in our best interests, while other real estate agents work strictly on behalf of the seller."
Mrs. Weiss got in touch with Laurie Bell, a licensed real estate agent at Balch Realty, an exclusive buyer agency, with offices in Bronxville and Brewster.
"We had a long talk," Mrs. Weiss said. "I told her what we were looking for and how much we could afford to spend. That was in May, and in June we put a bid on the second place Laurie showed us, a two-bedroom, two-bath condo in Bedford Mews, and on Sept. 1 we moved to Bedford. We love it. It couldn't be better. There is a playground and a swimming pool, and my husband has an easy commute on the Saw Mill River Parkway to his business in the Bronx. We are very happy."
The advantages of using a buyer broker are many, Ms. Bell said.
"For one thing the home-buying process is made much simpler," she said. "For example, a buyer broker will search through an inventory of listings and show only those that closely meet the requirements of her client. The Weisses bought the second house they saw. And a buyer broker will also do the negotiating."
Not to be overlooked is that there is no charge for the services of a buyer broker. "Our compensation comes from the realtor's commission on the transaction, which is paid by the seller," she said.
The principals who founded the Balch agency are real estate appraisers, not real estate sales men and women, said Peter B. Bell, chairman of the board and Ms. Bell's husband.
"We've been appraisers since 1986, trained in being objective in assessing properties, so the role of buyer broker is a logical one for appraisers," Mr. Bell said. "Yet it took a long time for the concept of the residential buyer broker to make it from California, where it started, to the Northeast. Now there are buyer brokers in every state. We work with 12 different multiple-listing agencies in several states."
In the last six months, he added, the Balch agency has completed 40 transactions for clients. "One was for a $750,000 home in Scarsdale for a client that was referred to us by another buyer broker, Robert Daly of Carlsen's Country Heritage Realty in Washingtonville, which is in Orange County."
Mr. Daly said: "My client wanted to be closer to a new big job he took in Yonkers. Up here, we're near West Point. We have been seeing a very fast-growing market with numbers of clients coming from Westchester and the metro area who still commute to Westchester and into Manhattan."
Mr. Daly, who said he became a buyer broker after years of dealing with property acquisition for clients, added: "As a buyer broker I am the agent of the buyer and obligated to represent the best interest of my client throughout the transaction. People like that; business is good."
Ira Fischer, a real estate lawyer in White Plains, recently formed the Home Buyers Agency in White Plains exclusively as a buyer broker. "As a real estate lawyer, I know how to get the best terms for a client," Mr. Fischer said. "I can critique the situation like an engineer who is called in to inspect a home for a client."
Mr. Fischer, who relies on listings in the multiple-listing service in Westchester, said: "Basically, simply what I am doing is showing clients how to buy real estate. Most people don't have the foggiest idea. What I find interesting is that most of my first clients have been lawyers, who somehow understand the underlying concept better than most people."
Mr. Bell agrees. "At least 30 percent of our clients are professionals," he said, "mainly doctors and lawyers, people who realize the value of advocacy."
The buyer-broker method has been the routine way to buy commercial property for years, observed P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors, a trade group of 4,000 members.
"The buyer broker is still a fairly novel concept in this area in the home-buying sector, but an alternative that will appeal to certain consumers," Mr. Mercurio said. "However, I don't see buyer broker agencies in conflict with sales agents in real estate offices. Sales agents in those offices will simply work with buyer brokers as easily as they would with anyone else."
Antoinette Emerson, the president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors, anticipates an increase in buyer broker agencies.
"I don't see them as adversaries of the agencies we already have but as another way to stimulate all the overall home-buying industry," Ms. Emerson said. "As a matter of fact, it is conceivable that some of our member firms will be adding buyer-broker services."
Because the concept is of such interest to the home-buying public, Mr. Mercurio said, the role of the buyer broker will be a topic of a seminar at the Real Estate Expo '95, which will be taking place next Sunday at the County Center in White Plains.
"Representatives of the Balch agency will be conducting the seminar," Mr. Mercurio said. "The expo, which is now in its 11th year, is a tremendous opportunity for first-time home buyers or for anyone in the home-buying market to get their hands on information. It's worth attending for the guide alone. There's no puffery in it. We put out a solid 'how to' handbook, which contains 25 articles written by experts in the field that cover all aspects of home buying."
Expo exhibitors include realtors, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, real estate lawyers, appraisers, home inspectors, "and just about everyone associated with every aspect of buying and selling real estate in Westchester," Mr. Mercurio said, adding that seminars are also held throughout the day.
"Last year, more than 10,000 people attended the show. It's a hot ticket, and the price is right. Admission is free, and so is all the information that attendees will receive."

HEADLINE: The Controversy Over Plans To Trim the State's Budget

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
CLUTCHING their handmade suits and dresses, the old women at the Home for the Aged Blind in Yonkers were both proud and frightened -- proud that they had learned to sew again, although this time it was without their eyes, but worried that they would soon be shut out of the day-care program that taught them their new skills.
Under Gov. George E. Pataki's proposal to close a $5 billion budget gap and cut taxes, day-care programs like theirs, along with home-care programs for the elderly, would lose some of their financing. 
 Throughout Westchester in recent weeks, health-care officials, educators, providers of legal services for the poor and other social service administrators have been attempting to assess the impact of the Governor's budget proposal, unveiled on Feb. 1. Mr. Pataki has proposed a $32.4 billion budget for the 1995-96 fiscal year, down $1.1 billion from the previous year, which would reduce taxes for most residents.
At Purchase College and elsewhere in the county, there was outrage about how those tax reductions would be achieved. Nearly 200 students demonstrated at the Purchase campus on Feb. 14, blocking the main entrance and tying up traffic on nearby roads. They were objecting to proposed increases in tuition and cuts in student aid.
There have also been demonstrations by students and university staff and faculty members in Albany, and more are planned.
In White Plains, at the offices of Westchester-Putnam Legal Services, Michael D. Hampden, the executive director, has been struggling with proposed cuts in his agency's budget and the potential loss of a homelessness-prevention program for welfare recipients threatened with eviction. The budget in Albany, Mr. Hampden said, was being balanced at the expense of the poor.
In Hastings-on-Hudson, Dr. Vincent T. Beni, Superintendent of Schools, was complaining about the budget plan's potential impact on education. He said Mr. Pataki wants to freeze state aid to schools at current levels, place a three-month moratorium on the purchase of school buses, cap spending for special education and halt state participation in new building programs for 15 months, among other things.
Like other school administrators, Dr. Beni, who is also president of the Chief School Administrators of Southern Westchester, was worried about how to balance his budget at a time when enrollment was increasing.
Joseph J. Burns, president and chief executive officer of Visiting Nurse Services in Westchester, in White Plains, said: "Everyone's complaining. Albany will need the wisdom of Solomon to see who gets what."
But no one was saying anything at the County Department of Social Services, which oversees Westchester's welfare program and stands to suffer some of the deepest cuts. Statewide, the Governor's plan calls for cutting $343 million in welfare programs and $1.2 billion from Medicaid, based upon projected growth in those categories next year -- some of the most significant cuts to social service programs in the state's history.
When asked his opinion of the proposed cuts, Norman Shaw, a Department of Social Services spokesman, said, "No comment until more is learned about Mr. Pataki's budget." There was the same message at the offices of County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, where the word from a spokeswoman was that the budget "was being analyzed." Mr. O'Rourke, a Republican, said that he was generally supportive of the Governor's intent to reduce taxes.
A survey of a representative sample of cities and towns in the county showed that the municipalities could lose up to 10 percent in transportation aid for road improvements. But Mayor Frances S. Gibbs of Peekskill said, "We really just don't know the impact yet."
Meanwhile, Democratic state legislators from Westchester have been listening to the concerns of their constituents, and they vowed to return to Albany tomorrow after their winter recess with strong messages for the Republican administration.
After meeting with constituents for 13 hours last week, State Assemblywoman Sandra R. Galef, a Democrat from Ossining, said she would fight for health care for the elderly, tuition assistance for undergraduates and avoiding caps on public school expansion plans.
"What is clear to me," Mrs. Galef said, "is that a lot of people are going to get hit in Westchester. It is also clear that the Governor doesn't care about the elderly, even though this population is growing," she said.
Mr. Pataki wants to cut Meidcaid-financed adult day-care programs, forcing many older residents into already crowded nursing homes. He has also proposed eliminating at-home care for people, mostly the elderly, who need services like shopping, housekeeping or cooking, if such a cut would not result in a person's going to a nursing home. All other care would be limited to 25 hours a week. Mr. Burns, at Visiting Nurse Services in Westchester, said, "The elderly are going to die on the vine in their little apartments with no one to even boil an egg for them."
William R. Smith, executive director for St. Cabrini Nursing Home in Dobbs Ferry and the immediate past chairman of the New York Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, called the elderly "the voiceless minority, the forgotten people." He estimated that in Westchester there were about 1,100 older people in need of day-care services.
But State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Republican and Conservative from Yonkers, said: "The people of New York told us they want less government. They agreed cuts were necessary, but now they're saying, 'Don't cut us.' The reality is hitting home, and it's hard to take."
He said the lobbying efforts and demonstrations notwithstanding, the "bottom line is that there isn't much money for restorations."
Administrators at colleges and universities in the county, however, were hoping that Governor Pataki would restore at least some of their aid. They continued to lobby hard against the cuts, which they say would hurt poor and minority students the hardest.
At Iona College in New Rochelle, Brian Monahan, a vice president and director of enrollment, said reductions in the state-financed student-assistance program would "make it difficult for our needy students to continue their studies."
The maximum tuition assistance would drop by $500 to $1,000 from $4,050, under the new budget proposal and would affect hundreds of students at Iona, he said. Tuition at the private college, which has 6,000 students, is $10,900 a year.
At Purchase College, Renneth Sorhaindo, director of the education opportunity program, said cutbacks would affect students who fall below admission standards and poverty guidelines. About 170 equal opportunity students each year receive about $1,216 to pay for room, board and books. Under the program, the students are also eligible for tutoring assistance.
Walter H. Liebman, a spokesman for the college, said many of the 4,000 students enrolled "would be hurt in unimaginable ways" by the Governor's budget. Tuition there is $2,650.
At public schools across the county, administrators predicted that the budget that Governor Pataki had devised to reduce state taxes would increase taxes elsewhere.
Dr. Beni in Hastings said that the Governor "was careful not to call it cuts," but freezing state aid to schools without factoring in inflation amounted to a cut.
"And who will pay for it?" he asked. "The bottom line is, the local taxpayer." He predicted that school boards would tap the property owner to pay for building expansions and other programs.
At Westchester-Putnam Legal Services, Mr. Hampden was facing $88,000 in proposed cuts to his agency, whose total yearly budget is $1.9 million, along with the loss of the Homelessness Prevention Program, which he called "a moneymaker for the state," because of the high cost of sheltering the homeless.
He said there was a "complex mix going on around the country now of sociological biases against the poor -- it's almost in vogue."
Anne Erickson, a lobbyist for the Greater Upstate Law Project, which represents legal service organizations, said the state was "pushing more and more families toward the edge."
"Everyone is walking away from their obligation to help those in need," she said. "This is a mean-spirited budget."
But in Albany, Claudia S. Hutton, a spokeswoman for the State Division of the Budget, said that even with the proposed cuts New York would still be "the No. 1 spending state in the nation for Medicaid."
Miss Hutton also said that with the cuts the state would still have "the most generous needs-based financial aid program for students in the nation" -- $562 million, which is more than twice what each of the next two highest-spending states, Illinois and California, spend on student aid.

HEADLINE: Why Law Is No Fun Anymore

BYLINE: By Jeremy Waldron; Jeremy Waldron is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. His most recent book is "Liberal Rights: Collected Papers 1981-91."

 BODY:

OVERCOMING LAW
By Richard A. Posner.
597 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press. $39.95. 
THE Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has given his new book, "Overcoming Law," an odd title -- odd because we think judges should study and apply the law, not try to overcome it. But Richard A. Posner is no ordinary judge. Before his appointment to the bench in 1981, he was a professor of law at the University of Chicago, and for years he has been one of the most articulate spokesmen for the scholarly movement known as "law and economics."
The law and economics movement analyzes legal problems -- like who has the responsibility to foresee the possibility of an accident, or how a contract should be interpreted when its provisions are unclear -- in terms of the costs and benefits faced by rational, self-interested individuals. Alternative solutions are evaluated by asking which set of incentives and disincentives will promote the most efficient use of the resources involved. Should a construction company be liable for the enormous losses incurred when an employee accidentally cut through a power cable and closed down Newark International Airport in January? The answer, the economist would say, should depend largely on whether the cost to the airport of providing a backup power supply would have exceeded the cost to the contractor of having to determine where the cables were before he began his excavations.
Judge Posner's book applies that method to the legal system itself. It is about the economics of practicing and studying law: the incentives and disincentives faced by judges, lawyers and law professors. The book describes the legal profession as a collapsing cartel, a decadent guild coming to terms with market competition. To those lawyers who complain that their practice is no fun anymore, Judge Posner responds: "Naturally it is less fun. Competitive markets are no fun at all for most sellers; the effect of competition is to transform most producer surplus into consumer surplus."
Similarly, he describes judges and law professors not as paragons of judicial reason but as leisure seekers. The jurisprudential distinction between the decision in a case and the dictums (the wider arguments for the decision that have no standing as precedents) means that a leisure-seeking judge can avoid writing an opinion of his own; he can simply concur in another judge's vote without being bound, in a later case, by the other's detailed opinions. As for law professors, Judge Posner thinks they behave like wannabe judges, "writing, in the guise of articles, alternative judicial opinions" that no one takes any notice of, and for which they need take no responsibility.
Much of Judge Posner's discussion is penetrating as well as mischievous, but one wonders what it would portend for the legal system as a whole. Does "overcoming law" mean replacing the tired apparatus of courts, clerks and casebooks with cost-benefit analysis and panels of economic experts? Judge Posner says no: the rule of law is "a public good of immense value," with its norms of impartiality and predictability.
Indeed, the author is much more explicit in this book than he has been in the past in books like "The Problems of Jurisprudence" about the limitations of the economic approach, at least in determining substantive justice. Judges, he says, "should be wary of embracing totalizing visions that like Gradgrind's Benthamism in 'Hard Times' reduce individual human beings to numbers or objects."
Economics cannot determine ultimate assignments of rights, he insists. It cannot tell us, for example, whether the right over a fetus's life should be assigned to the mother or the fetus, "any more than the economist can decide whether the goal of our society should be to maximize the wealth of the United States or the wealth of the entire world." An economist can explain a lot about the structures of cost and benefit associated with a given set of rights, and he can sometimes discern which assignment of rights would be more efficient. But Judge Posner readily concedes that efficiency is not the be-all and end-all: "Our liberal intuitions are as deep as our utilitarian ones."
Many of the most striking arguments in "Overcoming Law" reflect the concerns of a liberal (or a libertarian?), not an economist. "Our statute books overflow with vicious, exploitive, inane, ineffectual and extravagantly costly laws," he writes. We are "the most penal of civilized nations," with our exploding prison population, our thirst for execution, the severe penalties we impose, often "for intrinsically minor, esoteric, archaic or victimless offenses." Judge Posner condemns the practice of handcuffing and thus humiliating anyone who is taken into custody: "The arrest of Joseph K in the first chapter of 'The Trial' is immensely more civilized than any arrest would be likely to be in the land of freedom at the threshold of the 21st century."
He compares -- startlingly -- our heavy use of pretrial detention, often for years in overcrowded jails, with conditions in Nazi Germany. Even his colleagues on the bench do not escape the comparison: "We should not suppose that our judges have a margin of moral superiority over our political leaders greater than the margin that the German judges of the Third Reich had over their Leader." The main reason, he maintains, that the United States has never had a judiciary in complicity with a Hitler is that it has never had a Hitler to be in complicity with. But the United States, he notes, has had slavery and laws against miscegenation and Red scares and the wartime internment of Japanese-Americans, "and most of our judges went along with these things without protest."
These are remarkable observations. But his remedy for the evils just cited would seem to be more law -- a greater emphasis on legality, rights and justice. What, then, is the "law" to which the title of the book refers -- the law that needs to be overcome? It is, according to Judge Posner, "a professional totem signifying all that is pretentious, uninformed, prejudiced and spurious in the legal tradition." The most important word here is "uninformed." The theme that dominates this book more than any other is the need for what the author calls "pragmatism" in the way voters, lawyers, judges and professors think about the law.
Pragmatism, in Judge Posner's hands, is not just a vacuous commendation of common sense, but an unflinching emphasis on future consequences -- the effects of our rules, rights and principles -- to the exclusion, if necessary, of precedent, analogy and doctrine, as these are usually understood in the legal world. Ronald Dworkin, perhaps our foremost philosopher of law, has made much of the fact that legal argument pays tribute to the past even as it seeks to do justice for the future. Judges, he says, continue to wrestle with the meaning of precedents, in a way that goes far beyond figuring out what people might have been counting on, and Mr. Dworkin seeks to explain this in terms of the community maintaining its "integrity."
For Judge Posner, however, Mr. Dworkin's analysis is superfluous, because the reverence for precedence represents the discredited worst in our judicial practice, not something worth retaining. Think of the uninformed way in which jurists use the method of analogy: "If they have a case involving the appropriate system of property rights for a new natural resource, say petroleum, they examine decided cases dealing with 'similar' resources, say water or rabbits. They do not go out and talk to petroleum engineers, ecologists or natural-resources economists."
JUDGE POSNER'S most scathing and extensive remarks are reserved for his former colleagues in the law schools. I will not go into details, for some of the chapters are little more than book reviews that have already been published. Many of them will date quickly, and they give the whole thing the feel of a miscellany rather than, as the author hopes, a sustained argument "meant to be read consecutively."
Nevertheless, Judge Posner does present a clear, unrelenting and salutary theme. Legal scholars ought to make much greater use of empirical evidence in suggesting judicial and legislative strategies to achieve a better or a fairer society. Law schools need to foster the basic research necessary for the development of analytical frameworks for organizing and evaluating this evidence. The law and economics movement is one such framework, but Judge Posner is open to the idea that there are others.
The title of scholar, he insists, is one that has to be earned -- particularly by those who expect to be listened to more than the ordinary citizen in their comments on public affairs. For Judge Posner, the title is not conferred simply by the weight of one's footnotes -- particularly when the footnotes in most law reviews consist of references to the writings of other law professors who have produced similarly uninformed work. The price of scholarship is a willingness to study the empirical reality of issues, and either to acquire the intellectual tools that are necessary to make that study useful or to engage seriously with scholars in other disciplines (economics, sociology, public studies) who already have them.
Will this advice be taken seriously? Judge Posner believes there is an increasing political gap between law professors and the judiciary, and I doubt whether the "leftward-leaning lawyers" who, he says, dominate constitutional scholarship will be disposed to pay much attention to the methodological advice of a Reagan appointee. It will be a pity, though, if this book is ignored or proscribed. It is by far the best -- the most scholarly, the most thoughtful, as well as the sharpest and most provocative -- of the current crop of commentaries on the plight of law today.

HEADLINE: ON THIN ICE, ONE LAST TIME;
Will Steger

BYLINE: By By Jon Bowermaster; Jon Bowermaster is co-author, with Will Steger, of "Crossing Antarctica."

 BODY:
INSIDE WILL STEGER'S WOOD-BURNING SAUNA, at the edge of Pickett Lake in Ely, Minn., in January, it's 150 degrees. Outside it's 10 below. Steger splits the difference, lying silently on a bench next to the pulsing stove, then sprinting out onto the frozen lake and diving through a rough-cut hole in the ice.
After a roll in the snow, Steger re-enters the sauna, dripping wet and smiling. At 135 pounds, he's not quite what you'd expect America's best-known polar explorer to look like. Yet on March 5 he will again put his wiry, 50-year-old body to the test, leading a six-member team in an effort to be the first to dog-sled across the Arctic Ocean in one season, from Siberia to Canada by way of the North Pole. 
 As Steger sweats in the sauna, his mind is racing with the myriad organizational loose ends that plague modern-day adventuring. He still has to come up with half of the $90,000 needed to fly his crew to the starting point in the Aleutians. In a week he's off to New York for an appearance on "Good Morning America" to promote the expedition. Meanwhile, here at his 400-acre compound on the Canadian border, two tons of equipment are being packed for the 120-day trip, including an assortment of high-tech communication gear that will allow the team satellite access to the Internet, and thus to classrooms, scientists and armchair adventurers around the globe. For Steger, the thought of finally being alone on the ice -- or as alone as one can get with millions of cyberviewers following every footstep -- is the one thing that gives him solace.
"Out there," he says, pointing north, "the rhythm becomes very Zen-like. It's harsh, very demanding. But for me expeditions are like a retreat, like a religion. They are the only times I truly relax."
Despite its 21st-century accouterments, Steger's expedition marks the end of an era. Each winter more and more small teams and individuals venture to the Poles. But there are virtually no big, team-effort polar expeditions anymore: they are complex and hard to finance, and there are fewer and fewer "firsts" to be accomplished. Steger has made a name and a career out of a seemingly antiquated pursuit by pure determination. Since the mid-1960's he has covered tens of thousands of miles across the Arctic, Canada, Greenland and the Antarctic on the back of a dog sled.
His public recognition, such as it is, comes from numerous awards and support from the National Geographic Society, the Explorers Club, teachers' groups and scientific associations, and is largely a result of two big expeditions. In 1986, he was a leader of the first unsupported trip by dog team to the North Pole. Adm. Robert E. Peary claimed to have reached the North Pole in 1909, but there is still a question of whether he truly did so or only came close. Thus Steger's brutal, 55-day grass-roots effort (most of the $500,000 budget was raised in small bundles, from friends not corporations) was a relatively untrumpeted American success story. On the strength of that expedition, Steger led a five-man international dog-sled team 3,741 miles across Antarctica in 1989. The trip took seven months; the team endured temperatures that dipped to 113 degrees below zero and one storm that lasted 50 days. No one had ever tried a polar crossing of such length; it is unlikely anyone ever will again.
The coming expedition, says Steger, will be his last big one. Dubbed the International Arctic Project, it is a stab at another first -- the crossing by dog sled of the Arctic Ocean in one season. Unlike Antarctica, the Arctic is not a body of land but an ocean, frozen in winter and treacherously less so as spring advances. In a season when most men his age are worrying about slipping on the sidewalk and the most strenuous thing they do in the cold is pull-start the snow blower, Steger is packing his dog sleds for what may be the most arduous expedition of his life.
STEGER IS IN MANY WAYS A throwback: simultaneously eccentric, quick-witted and ferociously focused. He has greeted with elan the Prime Minister of Japan, chatted with the Bushes in the Rose Garden, talked politics and the environment with Al Gore. Over the years he has charmed millions of dollars from corporate sponsors and thousands of hours of volunteer time from people who identify with his overriding cause: educating the public about the frozen world.
Steger also has what might be described charitably as a playful side. He has, after a couple too many Pisco sours, lofted butter patties from his spoon toward the Mayor of Punta Arenas, Chile. On July 4, 1989, just before leaving for Antarctica, he injured two fingers by holding onto an M-80 explosive a moment too long. He has been known to weep when one of his dogs dies and to beat them for disobeying. He keeps to himself, though he rankles at the suggestion that he is solitary. "That loner tag is something the media has invented," he insists. "It makes for a better image if I'm painted as some nut case living in isolation in the woods."
Some of Steger's former teammates regard him as egocentric, hesitant to share credit, more than happy to leave details to teammates. "The heaviest thing Will and I carried across Antarctica were our egos," muses Jean-Louis Etienne, the French doctor who shared leadership of the Antarctica expedition with Steger, whom Etienne nevertheless refers to as "my brother."
Yet others insist that, in a profession brimming with egomaniacs, Steger is refreshingly low key. "He's the most unprepossessing, most humble hero of exploration I have ever met," says Bill Graves, a former editor of National Geographic who brought Steger into the Society's fold in the mid-1980's and has helped finance each of his expeditions since. "I've never known anybody -- and I've known a lot of them, having run the so-called 'nut squad' at the Geographic for many years -- with less apparent ego and more absolute determination and courage. Yet he's such a tiny little guy. Until you look at his record you can't believe he is actually 15 times the size of the rest of us."
Exploration has long been the core of Steger's life. At age 12 he volunteered to help chart the northern lights as part of the 1957-58 International Geophysical Year project. ("I'd stare at the skies, trying not to blink, and when I'd see a shooting star I'd write down the time, the speed, the color and try and map the trail.") When he was 15, he and his brother Tom built a small boat and Huck Finned down the Mississippi. In 1964, at age 20, he made a 3,000-mile kayak trip from southern Alberta to northern Alaska. The next year he made three first ascents of peaks over 18,900 feet in the Peruvian Andes. In 1969 he made a 4,000-mile kayak expedition on the Mackenzie, Peace and Yukon Rivers, taking time off from his job teaching science in St. Paul.
"We didn't put any restrictions on any of our kids," says his 75-year-old father, William. The elder Stegers remain close to all nine of their kids, but particularly Will, their second, who only recently moved the last of his belongings from their house in the suburbs of St. Paul. "We encouraged them to do whatever they wanted," says the senior William. "Will just happened to stretch every limit."
The period of his 20's also found Steger hitchhiking, hopping freights, doing drugs and bumming around Los Angeles, before finally finding his life's focus at a Zen monastery in the Sierras. In 1970 he started buying land on the edge of the Boundary Waters outside Ely, Minn., and organizing winter skills trips, initially for juvenile delinquents from the Twin Cities. Steger grew all his own food, built a small cabin by hand miles from the road, lived on less than $2,000 a year and slowly bought up neighboring land.
Today, what he calls the Homestead covers 400 acres, with a dozen small cabins, a main lodge, a two-story guest cabin and a 50-foot-tall, half-built "castle" that he dreamed up while traveling across Antarctica. (He earned the money for construction mostly by licensing his name to Target, for such items as Will Steger adhesive bandages, lunch buckets and fireplace logs.) Steger envisions the Homestead as a kind of enviro-educational think tank in the wilderness, accessible to corporations and educators.
In the late 1970's, Steger bred a sturdy breed of huskies and started taking extended trips -- with just one friend, or his second wife, Patti, or alone -- deep into the high Arctic. Those early trips began at the back door of the Homestead, and he dressed in $30 worth of Salvation Army clothes. He remembers those trips as the best days of his life, "leaving and not telling anyone, coming home and not telling anyone." One trip across the Arctic by dog sled and raft covered 7,800 miles. In 1985 he traveled another 5,000 miles from Duluth, Minn., to Point Barrow, Alaska, to test equipment and teammates for the successful run at the North Pole the following year.
"Those were the good old days," he says. "On any day I'd much rather be trying to figure out how to get a team of dogs off thin ice than having to write another letter asking for money."
Indeed, the organizational stresses have taken a toll on Steger, who admits that on many days recently he has found himself wondering why he persists. The $1.5 million expedition has consumed him for four years and cost $250,000 out of his own pocket. And with fewer firsts to be achieved, corporations see less and less reason to sponsor polar ventures. "I'm still in favor of some adventure for adventure sake," says Steger. "But adventure has changed. It demands more creativity, and more responsibility, today than it did 20 years ago. Funding expeditions has never been easy, but now you have to be a lot smarter than just saying you want to get from Point A to Point B. Tying in high technology is a must if you expect sponsorship."
Steger still has his believers. More than 50 companies have donated to this trip, from Science Diet to Lands' End to Eveready, providing everything from dog food to long underwear to batteries. Charlie Orr, chief executive of the San Francisco-based Shaklee Corporation, which has put up $300,000 for this trip, is one of Steger's most ardent supporters. "He is a quiet, compassionate individual and this is a company, I guess, that has a lot of respect for quiet passion," Orr says. "He is also a Renaissance man for the 1990's: a real explorer, adventurer, educator, athlete, humanitarian, environmentalist, a bit of a scientist, world citizen and a businessperson. There are lots of people out there with good ideas -- few see them through like Will does."
NEXT SUNDAY, THE TEAM -- four men, two women and 33 sled dogs -- will leave the Russian Arctic island of Severnaya Zemlya. They hope to reach the North Pole by April 22, the 25th anniversary of Earth Day, and then continue south across the Arctic Ocean to Resolute, the northernmost town in the Canadian Arctic. About two-thirds of the way through the dogs will be flown out; unique canoes fitted with wood-and-plastic runners will be brought in, enabling the team to traverse the last 500 miles, much of it melting ice. Such a lengthy route -- 2,000 miles -- has never before been tried in one season, because the spring thaw turns the seas into a cold, dangerous wash covered by thin crusty ice. (The emphasis here is on the longest trip, not one accomplished without support -- supplies will be dropped off to the team five times during the crossing.)
Although the prospect of failure is rarely considered, two major obstacles could stop Steger: warm temperatures, meaning lots of open water, and uncooperative winds, which could force drifting ice -- and the team -- far off Steger's course. "I've gotten used to people saying, 'You won't make it,' " Steger says. "But I've studied these routes for years in advance. I've spent long months traveling in the Arctic. I know things about these conditions, these places that others do not. It's a very feasible trip if everything goes as planned. Which, of course, it rarely does."
Steger is most concerned about the first 40 miles. "The real challenge is going to be literally getting onto the ice; at that point it is moving past the island, even at the coldest temperatures, at five to eight miles a day. We could get there and be looking at 40 miles of open ocean." Other dangers are the extreme cold (the temperature averages 40 to 50 degrees below zero), storms that could cause the ice to break up around the team while encamped at night, and the ever-present danger of losing a sled or a team member through thin ice. Errant, hungry polar bears are also a concern. Consequently, each sled carries a 12-gauge shotgun.
All of this excites Steger. "This area is the most dynamic, moving surface on earth. From day to day you don't know what to expect. It could be perfectly clear in the morning and then by afternoon you've reached another stretch of open water. In the Arctic, unlike much of Antarctica, monotony is not an issue."
The team is a mix of ages and experience levels: Victor Boyarsky, a 44-year-old Russian with a Ph.D. in mathematics and physics, accompanied Steger on the Antarctica crossing. There's Julie Hanson, 41, a longtime Outward Bound instructor in Ely; Martin Hignell, 33, a former dog trainer with the British Antarctic Survey, and Ulrik Vedel, 28, an officer with the Danish Army who has spent years patrolling Greenland. The inclusion of Takano Takako, 31, a Japanese journalist and adventurer, helps introduce the effort to a Japanese audience.
For all its dangers, the expedition is intended to help draw attention to the importance of the Arctic ecosystem and the critical role it plays in sustaining a healthy global environment. Arctic currents strongly affect the temperature and flow of the world's oceans and exert a powerful influence on the weather patterns of the entire Northern Hemisphere. Around its periphery are found the world's most productive fisheries. It is home to some of the last remaining migratory herds, the caribou. It is also rapidly becoming a repository for a wide range of industrial contaminants; the same qualities that make the Arctic unique in our imaginations -- extreme cold and long periods of darkness -- also act to extend the shelf life of pollutants that drift there.
But it is the high-tech communications ability of the expedition that has Steger most excited about this trip. When Admiral Peary arrived at the North Pole (or said he did) in 1909, the news took months to reach New York and London by telegraph. When Steger visited the North Pole in 1986, he radioed the news to Resolute, some 1,200 miles away, which contacted Steger's home office in St. Paul by telephone and fax. This time around, Steger's arrival at the North Pole will be greeted by live television cameras from "Good Morning America" and the international press.
The expedition will also be followed closely by classrooms around the world. When Steger crossed Antarctica, hundreds of thousands of students were able to follow his daily progress through computer links. Building on that success, the International Arctic Program has developed curricula and study guides, enlisted schools and teachers and set up computers and modems so that classrooms from Japan to California, the Northwest Territories to Brazil, can check in every morning for a report on the team's progress.
Each day the team will radio its position and observations -- what they're seeing and doing, how the dogs are faring, what the weather is like -- to a base in Resolute. There, the details will be posted on the Internet. Updates will also be posted on Econet and the Scholastic Network, an America Online service for teachers and students. All told, some 20 to 25 million children and adults are expected to follow the expedition by computer. For schools without high-tech equipment, E-mail reports and weekly fax updates will be available.
"The Arctic is both my teacher and my classroom," says Steger. "The ice is my blackboard. This expedition lets me use my talents as an explorer to give something back to these children." (Steger is not alone in utilizing the new link between adventurers and classrooms. Earlier this month another Minnesotan, Dan Buettner, a long-distance bicycler, began a three-month tour of the Mayan ruins of Central America; his route will be dictated to him by classrooms around the globe. They will correspond with him through his laptop.)
When off the ice, Steger visits classrooms in person. "Despite the addiction kids have with Game Boys and Power Rangers," he says, "real-life heroes still mean something to them. That's a powerful reason for me to continue these adventures. Truth is, I would not have done this trip without the Internet, without the high-tech educational component. It just wouldn't make sense; the economic climate is not right to support 'just' an adventure.' I wrote my master's thesis in education in 1970 on the basic philosophy that real education comes from within the students. A lot has changed in 25 years and I'm even more convinced that via telecommunication the world -- the kids -- are going to see what we're doing. They're going to interact with us. It's going to draw them out."
FIVE WEEKS BEFORE departing Steger kneels on the floor of his Minnesota cabin poring over maps, pinpointing the few white spots he has yet to visit.
He readily admits this will be his last big expedition. He is tired of the nonstop pace, the constant money worries and the necessity of controlling his wilder urges out of allegiance to his corporate financers. Twice married and twice divorced, Steger would like to wed again soon. And he wants to spend more time around the house. "Pursuing these firsts introduces a lot of tension into your life," he says. "But in order to raise the money and interest the media, you've got to take on big challenges, attempt big things. Virtually everything we've done in the past 10 years has been a first. I want my next challenges to be building a garden, writing a book, kayaking around Ellesemere Island. To be honest, I'm sick of firsts."
He pauses for a moment, listening to the wind outside. "I'm making a 90 degree turn after this one. I'm giving my dogs to my teammates. I want to get away from the 'dairy farm' aspect, the responsibility of the office and employees. I want to start over again. Build a small team of dogs, go out and travel by myself or with one other person. I want to go on teaching. And I want to live a quieter life. I'm very happy to step out of the limelight. I've had my time."

HEADLINE: How One U.S. City Lends a Hand to Russia

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article on the growing health problems of Russians (front page, Feb. 19) describes just one of many areas of difficulty in Russian life. Illustrative of all of Russia, the focus of the article was Tula, the sister city of Albany. 
 Tula has recently received a small Agency for International Development grant to plan a demonstration managed health care project, with technical assistance from the Albany-Tula Alliance, a three-year-old, volunteer not-for-profit corporation, in partnership with Community Health Plan, a health maintenance organization, and the Albany Medical Center. We hope funds will be available to allow development of a clinic in connection with Tula's Hospital No. 1. It is one way to support Russia's fledging democracy and to help people in great need.
The cost to the United States to assist Russia and other former Soviet lands to attain democracy and participation in the global economy is minuscule compared to war or even preparation for war. Additionally, bringing Russia into the global economy opens new markets for American products. We are all winners if Russia succeeds in this conversion, but that country needs help.
The Albany-Tula Alliance has had successful educational and cultural exchanges, has connected more than 200 families in Tula with more than 200 families in the Albany region and has worked on economic development to benefit both regions.
Not surprisingly, those of us who have volunteered to help others, as our country was helped in its beginning stages by foreigners, have had our lives enormously enriched.

HEADLINE: Corporations Have Little to Teach Schools

 BODY:
To the Editor:
What is most intriguing about a new survey showing that "employers are divorcing themselves from the schools" is the reaction to this finding on the part of those who conducted the survey and you (front page, Feb. 20). Both take it for granted that the "divide between the schools and the workplace" is "troubling" and even "alarming." 
 This reaction, however, implies that our schools exist chiefly to turn out adequately skilled workers whose labors will help companies triumph over their counterparts in other countries.
This view -- which sees education as an "investment," children as workers in training, and corporate profitability as the touchstone against which to judge the success of our schools -- has led to a degree of business involvement in educational reform that may be far more alarming than its absence.
When corporate groups such as the Committee for Economic Development speak out, their suggestions include more carrot-and-stick controls, more standardized testing and curriculums, more hours in the school day and days in the school year spent doing more drill-and-skill lessons in narrowly conceived academic curriculum.
Never mind that this is precisely the pedagogical prescription that has led to the current state of affairs in which students drop out, tune out or act out -- and even the grade-grubbing "successes" have little interest in learning per se.
There is minimal overlap between business's agenda, which is predictably geared to its own financial success, and such goals as helping students to see intellectual exploration as intrinsically desirable, to become lifelong learners and questioners, compassionate and cooperative people who value democratic participation and social justice.
For those with such a vision of education, less interference by a constituency obsessed with "competitiveness" may be just what the teacher ordered.

HEADLINE: Financiers With a Real Place in History

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The crisis at Barings, a British investment banking firm that has endured for nearly 230 years, is in keeping with its history. More than most firms, it has shown a willingness to invest abroad, often in markets that its competitors had deemed far too risky.
It was Barings that arranged the financing for the United States' purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803. It was a transaction that seemed far too dangerous to some. "We all tremble about the magnitude" of the loan, a Barings executive wrote that year. 
 In recent years, Barings has staked out a position as a leader in research and trading in emerging markets, providing comprehensive evaluations of Latin American and Asian markets as those markets have zoomed and crashed. And it was a Barings trader in Singapore who was reported to have made the big bet -- on Japan -- that brought on the present crisis.
As recently as two weeks ago, the firm was hiring investment bankers for its emerging-markets group. It planned to open offices this year in Russia and Turkey.
Founded in 1762 by Francis Baring, the great-great-great-grandfather of Peter Baring, the current chairman, Barings has remained under family management for virtually its entire history. It is a history that has been close to the British establishment. It was a big financier of Britain's war against France in the Napoleonic age, and it remains a manager of part of Queen Elizabeth's fortune.
But that history has been shaky at various times, most notably just more than a century ago.
In 1890, Barings went broke largely as a result of bad loans to Argentina, a country it expected would grow prosperous. The firm was reorganized only with the support of the Bank of England, which had to keep loans outstanding to the firm until 1895, when they finally were repaid.
That collapse cost the leading members of the family dearly. Edward Charles Baring, the first Lord Revelstoke, was running the firm at the time and plunged heavily into Argentina. Most of his assets, including his art collection, were liquidated.
At the time, sympathy for the Barings was limited, recalled Philip Ziegler in his book, "The Sixth Great Power," which chronicles the history of the firm. Members of the family had been known for haughtiness.
"Fancy the Barings being brought so low," Randolph Churchill, the father of the future Prime Minister, wrote in 1890. "Lord Revelstoke will not be able to ride the high horse as much as he used to."
But, Mr. Ziegler wrote, "though their judgment had been faulty, their probity was undoubted, and the courage and resolution with which they accepted responsibility for the disaster and set about retrieving it, won the admiration of their sourest critics."
In 1890, The New York Times wrote that Barings was "the greatest banking house of all the world," whose "signature has stood always and everywhere as an absolute guarantee." Today, it clearly would not rank so high, but its crisis still is important.
If Barings is unable to continue in business, it will be a blow to emerging markets, many already reeling from the Mexican economic crisis. Barings is a leading investment bank in a great number of emerging markets and has played an important role in raising capital for many of those countries. Other firms may not be as eager as they would have been a year ago to rush in to fill the void with emerging markets' having lost some of their luster.
Those markets, however, were not where Barings' problem arose. It was in Japan, one of the world's most developed and liquid markets. That very liquidity evidently allowed a trader to make huge bets that Japanese stocks would rise this year. And it was those bets that may end the story of one of the most remarkable families in world financial history.

HEADLINE: U.S. Force Steps Up Haiti Arms Seizures

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Feb. 26

 BODY:
With responsibility for the security of Haiti scheduled to be transferred to the United Nations late next month, American troops here are accelerating efforts to seize weapons and quash threats that might interfere with the "seamless transition" they have promised worried Haitian officials.
During the last month, the number of military street patrols here has multiplied, and their scope and visibility has expanded. Searches for weapons appear to be more aggressive. In another show of force, two former officials who are widely known as leaders of the Tontons Macoute, the paramilitary militia of the former Duvalier family dictatorship, were summoned to American military headquarters where -- in the words of one diplomat -- an American general "read them the riot act." 
 The change came after months of pleading by both the Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and by United Nations officials, all of whom have expressed concern that the American troops were being withdrawn without finishing their mission of creating a more "stable and secure environment" in Haiti.
The more energetic stance also coincided with the arrival in mid-January of a new American military commander, Maj. Gen. George A. Fisher, and elements of the unit he leads, the 25th Infantry Division.
The American-led multinational force, which began landing here last Sept. 19 under the agreement that restored Mr. Aristide to power after three years in exile, is scheduled to be replaced by March 31 by nearly 7,000 United Nations peacekeepers. About 2,500 American troops, most of them from the Hawaii-based 25th Infantry Division, will remain as part of that force, which will be commanded by another American, Maj. Gen. Joseph Kinzer.
The more visible American military presence on the streets of Port-au-Prince, the capital, is in part a response to the increase in common crime that followed the collapse of the Haitian army and police last fall as President Aristide sought to weaken an institution that was responsible for his exile and establish a new civilian police force. The first American commander here, Lieut. Gen. Hugh Shelton, sought to keep his troops away from anything that smacked of police duties, saying "we are not rent-a-cops," but General Fisher seems to have "a more flexible view of things," one diplomat here said.
"Given the fact there really isn't an armed threat to the Government right now, the biggest threat to the economy and the stability of the situation is crime, and so one of our goals is to suppress crime," General Fisher said in an interview at the American military headquarters here. He added, however, that "the front line of defense in fighting crime" remains the interim Haitian police force and international police monitors.
Initially, American troops in Haiti were concentrated almost exclusively in Port-au-Prince and in Cap-Haitien, the country's second largest city. But in anticipation of the United Nations takeover, more troops are being moved to the countryside, where 70 percent of the population lives and where clashes between Aristide supporters and paramilitary groups continue.
"The fact that Port-au-Prince is fairly quiet has given us the capability to put more forces out in these areas than we might have earlier," General Fisher said. With parliamentary elections scheduled for June 4 and campaigning already under way in some places, he added, "additional coverage out in the countryside is desirable during the electoral process."
In both urban and rural areas, American troops have also paid return visits during the last month to about 70 Haitian military installations that American troops first searched last fall. In several cases, such as a raid conducted Jan. 27 on the former headquarters of the Haitian Navy, American troops reported finding large caches of weapons.
It is not clear whether the weapons had been there all along or whether they were moved to the base after the initial searches, General Fisher said. But given the "great concern in the Government and the population about weapons," he said, he wanted to allay those fears. Troops also continue to respond to reports of arms caches hidden by paramilitary groups.
Following complaints that paramilitary leaders and their followers were being allowed to remain at liberty and plot against the Aristide Government, steps have also been taken to curb those activities. In an action that was widely talked about here, Franck Romain, a former mayor of Port-au-Prince, and Williams Regala, a former defense minister, were recently called into American headquarters "to discuss a matter of concern to the multinational force," as an American press release delicately phrased it.
When asked to elaborate, General Fisher said, "We get a lot of information from various sources, and if we think we see something that could be a potential problem, then we will call an individual in and talk to him, just to be sure the problem doesn't materialize."
In addition, the United States seems to have adopted a harder line against paramilitary groups like the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti, or Fraph. After their arrival in September, the few American-led units in the Haitian countryside at times were reported to have treated the group -- which has been blamed for the killing and torture of thousands of people -- as an opposition political party. In several areas, these units have cooperated with its local leaders.
James Dobbins, the State Department's special coordinator for Haiti, said here last week that the United States has "never regarded Fraph as a legal or legitimate organization" and that "the U.N. doesn't either." Any American Embassy or military official who may have said otherwise in the past, he added, "was misinformed."
The more aggressive attitude and higher level of visibility by the American troops has generally pleased the Aristide Government, although one adviser to the President said that he thought a lot of the activity was "just for show." He noted that Mr. Romain and General Regala were quickly released, even though "they are two of the worst Macoutes in the country and ought to be kept under wraps."
The planned withdrawal of American troops has been a source of concern both to Haitian Government officials and to ordinary citizens, who worry that members of paramilitary groups may be tempted to test a new United Nations force that is both unknown and unproven. "To counter some of those rumors," General Fisher said, a campaign is now under way "to let people know that the United Nations is going to be very capable."

HEADLINE: U.S. AND CHINA SIGN ACCORD TO END PIRACY OF SOFTWARE, MUSIC RECORDINGS AND FILM

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The United States and China signed an agreement today to end a long-running dispute over how to protect intellectual property like movies, compact disks and computer software. The countries avoided a trade war and announced a plan to make life in China harder for pirates and easier for American investors.
The agreement includes an intensified six-month crackdown on copyright violators beginning on Tuesday, a series of task forces to collect evidence, expanded search-and-destroy powers for Chinese customs officers and the immediate removal of quotas on imports of American films. 
 United States officials described the pact as the most comprehensive and detailed copyright enforcement agreement they had ever negotiated with any country.
Negotiating tactics delayed the agreement until the last minute, and then some. The talks ended 12 days after the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, announced that trade sanctions on more than $1 billion of Chinese goods would begin today if no accord was reached.
The last-minute deal may well turn out to be a major victory for both the Clinton Administration and American business. But some American business leaders were cautious, saying enforcement was crucial. [Page D1.]
Indeed, the success of the agreement depends upon its enforcement by Chinese authorities, who so far have been inconsistent when it comes to Chinese copyright and trademark laws. Many United States companies with operations in China complain that local authorities often have little incentive to prosecute businesses that provide them with revenue and enjoy wide latitude on how to punish or excuse offenders.
"There is no question that the key to this agreement will be implementation," the deputy trade representative from the United States, Charlene Barshefsky, said at a news conference late tonight. "And implementation means vigilance on the part of the U.S. as well as political will on the part of the Chinese Government."
Chinese officials, who at times during the negotiations complained that some American demands would violate China's sovereignty, portrayed the agreement as an affirmation of their own commitment to protecting the rights of creative industries.
"We are determined to do well in protecting intellectual property rights, no matter whether an agreement is reached or not," said Wu Yi, China's Trade Minister.
Negotiators went 10 hours past the deadline, agreeing on the final wording of a 22-page document in English and Chinese only minutes before it was signed.
"It is a win-win agreement," Ms. Barshefsky said, asserting that the pact meant both increased access to China for American makers of films and music and improved enforcement against those who copy and sell such products illegally.
If neither side got all it wanted in the negotiations, the Chinese had more at stake. Out of $45 billion in goods traded between China and the United States last year, exports from China to the United States accounted for $37 billion.
Winning American approval on intellectual property protection is also an important step toward gaining membership in the World Trade Organization, a status that Chinese leaders have said they consider an essential element in modernizing their economy.
Ms. Barshefsky said the enforcement agreement, while not aimed at helping China gain access to the World Trade Organization, "would certainly be W.T.O.-compatible." She said the United States was ready to assist China in its application to the trade body, but she denied that there was any intention to support China's application in exchange for concessions in the enforcement agreement.
Ms. Barshefsky would not discuss concessions made by either side during the negotiations. But a person familiar with the negotiations, describing them as torturously complex, said that the final days were spent on the issue of market access for American film and music companies, which have been barred through a series of formal and informal obstacles from the China market.
Ms. Barshefsky said that all quotas would be lifted -- "starting now, today" -- and added that the Chinese had also agreed to allow the establishment of joint ventures for audio and video production, first in the large cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou and expanding to a total of 13 cities by 2000.
"Legitimate U.S. products will be able to replace pirated goods," Ms. Barshefsky said.
The person familiar with the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also said that the Americans dropped their initial demand that the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation in China pay for all the pirated computer software being used inside its own offices. This person said that Chinese officials disputed the United States estimates that 95 percent of computer software used in China was pirated and asserted that it was closer to 25 to 30 percent -- and that they would take steps to lower that amount.
But the United States negotiators were apparently unyielding on their insistence that Chinese officials close down several suspected pirates among the 29 production lines capable of making compact and laser disks.
Ms. Barshefsky noted that Chinese authorities had closed seven compact- and video-disk producers in recent weeks, including the Shenfei Laser and Optical System Company in Shenzhen, which she characterized as the "most notorious" of flagrant copyright violators.
Asked if China's failure to close Shenfei would have prevented an agreement, a deputy assistant trade representative, Lee Sands, said, "That's one way of looking at it."
As part of their efforts to monitor enforcement, American officials will receive data from China each quarter on the number of establishments raided, products confiscated and fines imposed.
"There will be ample opportunity for consultation and verification," Ms. Barshefsky said.
China's cooperation with the United States on the issue of intellectual property rights grew out of a 1992 memorandum of understanding, which then led to China's establishment of stronger copyright and trademark laws.
Disagreements between China and the United States, often about enforcement of those laws, inevitably has led to public bickering. At one point, the official Chinese press personally attacked Mr. Sands.

HEADLINE: As Balanced-Budget Vote Looms, Several Senators String Out the Suspense

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Senators get to be senators because they are good politicians, and so it is not unheard of for one of them to withhold some pronouncement on an issue until the last moment, seeking to increase influence or hog the spotlight. But seldom has a circle of attention been so crowded as the one surrounding the vote scheduled in the Senate for Tuesday.
The vote is on the adoption of a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, almost certainly the most important vote of the year. Sixty-seven votes, or two-thirds of the Senate, would send the current version of the amendment to the states for ratification votes and, advocates say, set the stage for a profound reshaping of Federal spending priorities. 
 Supporters of the measure say they are one or two votes short of the number they need. And as of this evening, not one but five Senators were still mulling the matter over. The five, all Democrats, are John B. Breaux of Louisiana, Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky, Sam Nunn of Georgia and Kent Conrad and Byron L. Dorgan, both of North Dakota.
"The way we put it in Western Kentucky," Mr. Ford said this week, "is, 'When you're thinkin', you're cogitatin'.' And I'm doing some real cogitating."
No doubt that is true. Still, Mr. Ford's cigarette-rasped twang masks two decades of Washington political experience that have made him the Senate's second-ranking Democrat. Mr. Breaux, the third-ranking Senate Democrat, is widely regarded as one of the country's cannier politicians, and Mr. Nunn has built a considerable reputation in no small part on his habit of being the political weight that tips the scales.
So while the 95 other senators have declared themselves on an issue that has been debated for nearly a month this year, and for many months more in the preceding dozen years, the holdouts continue to wait for a sign that in most cases only they can identify.
"We're down to the fab five, aren't we?" said Thomas Mann, the Congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution and a critic of the amendment.
"People who decide late on issues subject themselves to an unbelievable amount of pressure and scrutiny," he said. "One reason some of them hold out is that they feel that being the pivotal vote attracts some kind of political payoff," like publicity. "Others may feel they can extract something for it -- a change in the amendment; some kind of favor on the side. And others may just be paralyzed with fear."
If votes could indeed paralyze politicians, Tuesday's would be a good candidate. As now written -- there are 23 amendments to be considered before the final vote takes place -- the balanced-budget amendment would be the tightest fiscal straitjacket Congress has ever donned. It would bar the Government from running a deficit as soon as seven years hence, unless 60 percent of members voted otherwise.
Simple mathematics says that a yes vote on Tuesday is an endorsement of at least $1.2 trillion in cuts from the spending that is now anticipated through 2002 -- or, failing that, an increase in taxes.
Although the amendment is wildly popular in most opinion polls, even some Republican senators say privately that they believe its popularity stems from the fact that most voters do not appreciate how much it would affect them.
Skeptics say simple political calculus has led some Democrats to support the amendment even though they do not like it, because they face re-election next year, before its major effects would hit home. Of the 12 Democrats who publicly support the measure, three who are up for re-election in 1996 voted against it when a similar version came before the Senate last year.
The undecided Senators have no such considerations. Messrs. Breaux, Ford, Nunn and Dorgan all supported the amendment in 1994; Mr. Conrad opposed it, but he does not have to run again until 2000.
Rather, other factors -- including, of course, sincere indecision over what is right -- seem to be at work.
Mr. Nunn, a pivotal vote, has staked out his bottom line. On Thursday evening, he said he would oppose the amendment unless Congress approved a change on Tuesday that would prohibit the Federal courts from interpreting the law, and thus making their own fiscal policy.
Democrats say Mr. Nunn is unmovable on the issue and is using his leverage to get what he wants, as he has on issues ranging from confirmations of Presidential nominees to approval of missile treaties.
Mr. Breaux is officially on the fence, but almost everyone believes he will vote for the amendment if he can bring other undecideds along with him; he is believed to have held his silence in part so he can work as an honest broker with fellow Democrats.
Mr. Dorgan, too, is counted by many as a yes vote. But both he and Senator Conrad, who is a likely no vote, are said to be worried by the amendment's failure to guarantee that the annual surpluses in the Social Security trust fund -- $630 billion, with interest, between now and the century's end -- will not be used to pay down the deficit.
Economists dispute the wisdom of those fears, but the concerns have a solid political basis. In today's Bismarck Tribune, North Dakota's third-largest newspaper, the American Association of Retired Persons flatly states in an advertisement that should the amendment be adopted and approved by the states, "by 2002, each Social Security recipient in North Dakota will lose $2,025."
Mr. Ford, squarely in the middle, is said to support the amendment in principle but question how it would work in practice. He, too, worried in an interview about the Social Security fund and court interference in fiscal issues.
Most of all, he does not trust a Republican Congress to implement the amendment fairly. "The gut stopped at the middle aisle in '93," he said sourly, noting that Democrats had enacted $500 billion in new taxes and cuts then without a single Republican vote. "Now they'd be glad to work with us. So what?"
Mr. Breaux said on Thursday that he would announce his decision on Friday, then issued a press release on Friday saying he had changed his mind. Mr. Dorgan was rumored to be planning an announcement on Friday, but made none.
Mr. Conrad, on CNN, said he would vote against the amendment unless he got "assurances" on the courts and Social Security. Otherwise, he said, "it's a very, very difficult vote for me."
Difficult, yes. Whether it is impossible, voters will learn this week.

HEADLINE: Foreign Aid Budget: Quick, How Much? Wrong.

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
As Congress moves to cut foreign aid and overhaul the apparatus that delivers it, supporters of such assistance are gathering evidence that Americans have little or no idea how small the aid budget actually is.
When confronted with figures, poll takers are discovering, American voters often seem to be instinctively more generous than their representatives in Washington. 
 A survey last month, conducted jointly by two independent policy centers -- the University of Maryland Center for International and Security Studies and the Center for the Study of Policy Attitudes -- found that Americans were wildly off the mark in guessing how much their nation spends on foreign aid.
Among the 801 people surveyed, 15 percent was the median figure given when Americans were asked about how much of the budget went to foreign aid. Other recent polls, including a Harris Poll in November 1993, indicated that Americans thought the Government devoted 20 percent or more of its spending to foreign assistance.
The figure is about 1 percent of the Federal budget. Total foreign aid -- military and non-military combined -- is now about $13 billion a year. About half that, devoted largely to human-development programs relating to health, family planning and economic self-help, is administered by the United States Agency for International Development.
When asked about an "appropriate" expenditure for aid, respondents to the January poll said about 5 percent of the budget, or about five times what is spent now.
Measured another way, by per capita gross domestic product, the United States devotes only 0.15 of its G.D.P. to foreign aid, far less than all other industrial countries. And the figure has been steadily declining in recent years.
According to the Agency for International Development and the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, which tracks the economies in richer nations, about $44 of the taxes paid annually by an average American family would go to foreign aid. In Denmark, the equivalent figure would be $900.
"There are four very common myths about foreign aid," said Catherine Gwin, vice president for studies at the Overseas Development Council, an independent policy and research organization in Washington.
"One is that we spend an awful lot of money," Ms. Gwin said in an interview. "All the polling data show that the gap between what we spend and what Americans think we spend is astronomical."
"The second myth is that Americans are very generous as a nation, despite the fact that the percentage we spend is lowest in the O.E.C.D.," she said.
This myth, however, does not extend to personal contributions to private groups, donations that continue to rise, said John W. Sewell, president of the policy and research organization.
"The third myth is that aid is money down a rat hole, and that there have been no successes," she said, referring to a comment on such aid made by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina. "And the fourth is that there is no direct, immediate payback to the U.S."
There are reasons for the "rat hole" argument, Ms. Gwin said.
"During the cold war, we allocated foreign aid money on cold war rationales and then critiqued it on the basis of development effectiveness -- so we get a Zaire," she said, alluding to United States support an anti-Communist Zairian leader who has been widely viewed as corrupt and authoritarian.
Or a Vietnam. Ms. Gwin said many supporters of aid became disillusioned after large amounts of money were spent trying to prevent the South from falling to Communism. "We have never really recovered," she said.
"During the cold war, we gave aid for one reason and then judged it for another," she said. "But in countries where the aid was given for development reasons, the anecdotes are much more positive -- and there are many of them. Americans don't know what's been happening in literacy rates, in population and fertility decline, and how much of a change has occurred."
J. Brian Atwood, the Administrator of the Agency for International Development, said in an interview that the United States "has been a leader in the world."
"For example," Mr. Atwood said, "43 percent of all the family-planning services offered to women around the world are from A.I.D."
If other donors joined the campaign with similar commitment, he said, "we can indeed achieve the goal of stabilizing world population by the year 2030.
"There is nothing right about the words 'foreign' or 'aid,' " he said. "It's not charity. It's not a gift. It's something we do in our own interests."
Whether stemming the spread of epidemic diseases, helping to create jobs that keep would-be immigrants at home or sustaining and nurturing new democracies and their shaky private-sector economies, the job of aid, Mr. Atwood said, is to keep countries from "falling off the edge," with global results. He said Americans understand that the United States cannot escape the consequences.
The development agency points to a July 1993 Gallup Poll that said only one in four Americans agreed that the United States "should avoid becoming involved with other nations as much as possible." In the mid-1980's, Gallup found that 3 in 10 Americans took that position.
"Because of the impression that has been created that our foreign aid program is nothing more than an international welfare program, it has been possible for demagogues, isolationists and populists -- some all in the same person -- to exploit that," Mr. Atwood said.

HEADLINE: Group of 7 Defines Policies About Telecommunications

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The Governments of the seven largest industrialized countries, seeking to find common ground on the future of the global information network, today backed broad concepts of competition, deregulation, the protection of intellectual property rights and security of data.
The statement came at the end of a three-day meeting of officials of the so-called Group of Seven countries who were trying to prepare a common policy on how to approach the future of telecommunications. 
 "We made a giant step forward," Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown of the United States said at a news conference today, adding that the accord among the group "far exceeded the expectation going into the meeting."
Heading into the conference, some officials believed that France and Canada, worried that the giant American telecommunications and broadcast companies would overwhelm their industries, could set major obstacles to an accord that bases the future of telecommunications on free markets and free competition.
Yet the conference ended in remarkable harmony, as the nations managed to put aside their differences. Even the French, while stressing that governments would need to monitor world information systems, supported a joint statement that effectively embraces a vigorous free-market approach.
"A year ago the question was whether we could reach this kind of agreement," an American official said. "But even they seemed to realize that you have to open these markets. You can't afford to keep them closed."
The conference was sponsored by the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union. Commission officials have strongly supported the opening of telecommunications to competition. Most of its member states, though, including Germany and France, have maintained telecommunications monopolies and do not plan to deregulate telephone and data transmission until 1998. Of all the European Union member countries, only Britain and Sweden are considered to have open markets in telecommunications.
At the conference, the first held by the group to deal with what was called the global information infrastructure, German officials clearly supported open markets. "Private sector competition must be the driving force," Gunther Rexrodt, Germany's Economic Minister, said.
The joint statement, which addressed a number of concerns raised by France and Canada, called for "ensuring universal provision of and access to services," "promoting equality of opportunity to the citizen," "promoting diversity of content, including cultural and linguistic diversity," and "recognizing the necessity of worldwide cooperation with particular attention to less developed countries." The Group of Seven countries comprises the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
Martin Bangemann, the European Community's Commissioner for Industry, said that "we must insure that the information society is not divided up into the have's and have-not's."
Indeed, a tone for the conference was set on Friday night when at the opening dinner, Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's First Deputy President, told conferees, "The reality is that there are more telephone lines in Manhattan, New York, than in the sub-Sahara Africa," adding that half of the world's population had never made a telephone call.
Governments in Europe had earlier expressed fears about deregulation. For example, some were troubled that the privatization of their state-owned telephone monopolies would create significant unemployment in a Europe that is already saddled with its highest unemployment since World War II, with 17 million people unemployed.
Dismantling those monopolies will probably mean considerable reduction in employment in those sectors, as well as fights with strong telecommunications unions. But conference attendees apparently agreed that the inflow of new investment, and the ensuing economic growth, would more than compensate for the short-term loss of jobs.
And the conference also concluded that open telecommunications markets would not eliminate cultural diversity, but promote it, as it makes access to broadcasting available to small cultural groups.
Some attendees said the meeting helped define a clear set of principles for the speedy opening of markets. Stuart E. Eizenstat, the United States Ambassador to the European Union, said he believed that as a result of the conference, some European countries would deregulate their telecommunications markets before the 1998 deadline set by European Commission regulations.
 The conference also proposed 11 pilot projects as the first concrete step in advancing the information superhighway. The projects range from establishing links among libraries, museums and classrooms around the world to sharing information on the environment, natural disasters and disaster management to building compatible links between global information systems.

HEADLINE: Japan's Ghost In China Pact;
U.S. Tries to Avoid Old Trade Mistakes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
The deal struck at the last minute yesterday between China and the United States may well turn out to be a major victory for both the Clinton Administration and American business, proof that the right mix of bluster and economic incentives can convince China's leaders that their only choice is to operate by the world's trade rules, rather than their own.
But just beneath the surface, the argument over China's piracy of Whitney Houston's songs and Microsoft's MS-DOS was just the first big skirmish in a struggle that will probably last for years. It is a fight to make sure that the United States does not make the same mistakes with China that it made for decades with Japan. 
 Whether Washington prevails this time may not be clear until 2010 or so, but as Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said the other day, "you have to start somewhere."
Throughout most of Japan's post-war rise, Washington found every reason possible not to make trade -- and America's own economic health -- the No. 1 issue with a close ally. The cold war was on, and the Japanese islands were America's unsinkable battleship in the Pacific. By the time anyone realized the enormity of the American mistake, it was already far too late.
In some respects, China today is about where Japan was in the late 1960's, a powerhouse of growth, a huge exporter, and the leading candidate to overtake the United States someday as the world's largest economy. To get there, Beijing's economic planners have surveyed the world and found their role model -- Tokyo.
So while the argument over the last few weeks was ostensibly about pirated copies of the movies "Jurassic Park" and "The Lion King," the real worry was about the future of McDonnell Douglas jet technology and Chrysler designs for mini-vans in a country that seemed determined to let 1,000 pirates bloom. That is why American business stuck by the Administration, even if it meant angering the same Chinese officials with whom they were striking deals left and right.
"Everyone realized that piracy is not just a problem, it is a fundamentally ingrained part of China's economic plan," said Gregg Mastel, a senior fellow at the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington and a specialist on trade with China. "And that is why so many people are skeptical that this agreement, or any agreement, can stomp this out. But you have to give the Administration credit for recognizing the problem and getting serious about it."
By sticking to its guns, the Administration has won a series of remarkably specific commitments requiring the Chinese authorities to inspect every compact disk factory and software house, and to close down the offenders or force them to license the technology they use.
It is a far more invasive procedure than China would ever allow an outside power to dictate in other realms -- human rights, for example -- and all the more remarkable because so many of the factories are enormous sources of revenue for the Chinese Army and the families of the leadership. That is why so many people inside and outside the Administration suspect that new piracy factories may spring up as quickly as old ones are closed.
But the reason the Administration won this round, at least on paper, is that it holds the keys to something Beijing's leaders want desperately: entree into the World Trade Organization, the newly created United Nations of commerce. Beijing has insisted that it be admitted on special terms, exempt from many free-trade rules because of China's status as a huge but still developing nation. Mr. Kantor has said no way.
The only choice, he has said, is for China to join "under commercial, not political terms," an issue he probably will take up in an expected trip to China next month. And without protecting the intellectual property of Americans and others who operate in China, he said, the country could kiss the W.T.O. goodbye.
"We're determined not to get into the same position we got into with Japan," Mr. Kantor said in a telephone interview yesterday. "We had a cold war strategy with the Japanese and Europeans that worked, making them bulwarks of democracy by letting them export freely to our markets even while their own were closed. But those sanctuary markets soon became a matter of entitlement. And it's been hard, to say the least, to break that."
By some measures, it may already be too late in China's case. Its trade surplus with the United States grew by 30 percent last year, to about $30 billion, making it half the size of Japan's. China already exports to the United States four times the goods, measured in dollar terms, that the United States sends back to China. The ratio of imports to exports with Japan has never come close to a gap that large.
Moreover, America's dealings with China in the last year or so have left Washington's economic leaders so bruised that they are pining for the simplicity and predictability of dealing with Japan -- preferring, in short, to clean the teeth of a wily old crocodile than an unpredictable lion. "We've done this for so long in Japan at least we know who is making the decisions and how they are likely to react," one senior Administration official said.
"In China, we get one intelligence report after another," the official added, "and we still don't really have a clue who calls the shots on these kinds of issues." The problem will only worsen, many experts suspect, if the country's political succession crisis deepens.
For Mr. Clinton, who has made international trade the linchpin of his strategy for economic expansion, there is probably limited joy in the agreement reached yesterday. He is bound to be criticized for holding China's feet to the fire on intellectual property in a way that he never did on human rights. (Mr. Kantor, however, says the new agreement will also help the human rights cause, because China has agreed to accept an unlimited number of American movies and to open more markets to American companies. The process, he says, is likely to spread understanding of democracy's reach.)
And if Mr. Clinton succeeds in changing China's economic behavior, the evidence will not be clear until well after his Presidency is over, even if he serves two full terms.
He would hardly be the first President to discover that prying open China's markets is not a big political victory in the heartland. One of Mr. Clinton's predecessors, Mr. Kantor noted at a news conference yesterday, wrote to the Chinese that if companies on both sides of the Pacific "will trade, there should be rules, so that they shall not break your laws nor our laws." The letter was sent by John Tyler in 1843, and resulted in a historic first treaty with China the next year.
It didn't help him much: Tyler failed to get his party's nomination for a second term.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "What China Agrees to Do"

HEADLINE: A Tennessean Quietly Prepares To Make His Move for President

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
After a recent national television interview, Lamar Alexander invited his advisers to pick him apart in a New Hampshire hotel room. But he was his own toughest critic, conceding that he needed to punch up his meandering presentation and remarking dryly, "After awhile I get to the point."
The mild-mannered Mr. Alexander -- a Tennessee stalking horse of sorts -- lacks the caustic tongue of the two other leading and far better known contenders for the Republican Presidential nomination, Senators Bob Dole and Phil Gramm. 
 But because of his dogged organizational efforts and the zeal with which he has positioned himself as the Washington outsider, Mr. Alexander, who on Tuesday plans to declare his candidacy in his hometown of Maryville, Tenn., has propelled himself to join the top tier along with the two Senators.
"He's the most dangerous because no one's paying attention to him," said David Carney, a senior adviser to Mr. Dole.
The 54-year-old former Tennessee Governor describes himself as a conservative, preaching a grass-between-the-teeth populism that favors dismantling billions of dollars in Federal programs and returning them to the states.
The morning he invited his aides to critique him at the Holiday Inn in Manchester, N.H., Mr. Alexander took notes as Mike Murphy, his chief consultant, instructed him on sharpening his message: "You are different from all these guys: Businessman. Governor. Nashville. And I have a vision of where I want to take the country, which is out of D.C. Back to families. Boom. That's the mission." Mr. Alexander repeated those points at two events that day.
Still, there are important questions about whether Mr. Alexander, a millionaire and New York-educated lawyer, can convincingly present himself as an outsider -- or as a conservative. Though he does not highlight it in his campaign speech, Mr. Alexander knows his way around what he calls the "arrogant empire" of Washington.
After serving as president of the University of Tennessee, he was President George Bush's Secretary of Education for two years. He started out in Washington as a legislative assistant to his mentor, then-Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, and worked in the Congressional relations office for President Richard M. Nixon.
Mr. Alexander's conservative bona fides are also suspect, because he has the reputation and record of a middle-of-the-road Republican who is not driven by ideological passion.
For instance, he raised taxes during his two terms as Governor from 1979 to 1987, a fact that he defends, saying it was "to pay teachers more for doing well and for building the best road system in the states." He says he is against abortion but does not have a well-articulated view of how the Republican Party should grapple with the issue. And some conservatives do not take seriously his call to abolish the Education Department, his old agency.
"There's some reinvention," said Edwin C. Hargrove, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University. "He's not a natural populist, but he's turned himself into one. It's a little bit of an act. He's not an ideologue like Phil Gramm. He doesn't come with a heavy set of dogma. His values are to believe in limited Government."
Mr. Alexander is hitching his candidacy to the success of popular Republican Governors, like John Engler of Michigan and Stephen Merrill of New Hampshire. He is saying, essentially, trust the governors, not Washington, to change welfare, health care and job-training programs.
He asserted at a forum in New Hampshire last week: "The question of whether you have two-year limits on welfare is not for my friends here from Washington to decide. It's for Governor Merrill and the citizen legislature and the town councils of New Hampshire to decide."
If voters accept Mr. Alexander as a conservative and a populist, another question arises: Even at a time when returning power to the states is in vogue, do Republican primary voters want a President who talks more about process and states' rights than ideology?
"I don't think a process argument that, 'I'm going to send all these programs back to the states,' is going to carry him through to get the nomination," said Robert M. Teeter, Mr. Bush's campaign chairman in 1992. "It's got a body of thought behind it, but it just doesn't strike me as a gut issue enough. The Presidency is about leadership, about setting national economic policy, leading the Congress, foreign policy -- the big issues."
Jim Pinkerton, a Republican theoretician, warned that Republican voters may want a more direct message. "Will they go for, 'Elect me, and I will kick down the welfare state,' " he said, "or Alexander, who says, 'Elect me, and I will help the Governors do it one by one by one.' "
Already, Mr. Alexander has found himself retreating a bit. His catchy rallying cry about turning Congress into something of a part-time citizens' legislature -- "cut their pay and send them home" -- played well in the 1994 campaign. But now that the Republicans have swept Congress, he has largely shelved that approach for variations with less bite, like, "We know what to do."
Despite questions about his message, Mr. Alexander, a graduate of Vanderbilt University and the New York University Law School, is widely viewed among Republicans as a shrewd, disciplined contender who has put populist imagery to good use.
After losing a bid for Governor in 1974, he tried again in 1978, donning a lumberjack shirt and walking 1,000 miles across the state to end up in the Governor's mansion. Laying the groundwork for this Presidential campaign, last summer he drove 8,800 miles around the country, trying to portray himself as a friend of ordinary Americans. He furthered that effort, and built a network of support, by hosting a satellite television show that featured Republicans around the country and was broadcast out of a studio that was once home to "Hee-Haw."
With his easygoing, if not compelling, personal style, Mr. Alexander's hope is that voters will search for a fresher face. He also hopes that a sitting governor does not jump in the race and usurp his anti-Washington message.
"If the party wants a senior, experienced leader who's made a career in Washington, then they'll choose Bob Dole," he said in an interview. "If they want somebody who's a Washington outsider, then they'll choose me."
Mr. Alexander has forced Republicans to take notice because he has surrounded himself with smart advisers and has signed an impressive roster of fund-raisers for former Presidents Bush and Ronald Reagan.
While there is no evidence in early polling that Mr. Alexander's organizational efforts have paid off, other campaigns are watching closely. Though Mr. Gramm depicts the race as between himself and Mr. Dole, Charles Black, a senior adviser to Mr. Gramm, said of Mr. Alexander, "I see him as a potential threat."
Mr. Black added: "But I'm not sure that the '94 election didn't repeal his message. It's hard to talk about cutting their pay and sending them home when them is us."
Some White House officials contend that Mr. Alexander might be the most competitive challenger to Mr. Clinton because he comes off as a steady leader who is not as driven by rigid ideology.
But the challenge for Mr. Alexander is to persuade voters that he has not reinvented himself. He said he had scoured his past and found several examples of conservatism, including his support for a moment of silence in schools and his shutdown of Tennessee's offices in Washington.
"I'm not always thought of as especially conservative," he said. "It's almost a matter of disposition and temperament." But Mr. Alexander also said there had to be room for Republican moderates. "If we become too rigid, if we seem too intolerant," he said, "if we sound like we're making lists of people we don't like, we're going to run off enough people that we'll lose the election -- and deserve to."
Mr. Alexander emphasizes his soft side -- he is an accomplished classical and country pianist -- as an apparent contrast to Mr. Dole and Mr. Gramm. Yet he has to demonstrate that he has the temperament to endure a national campaign.
On a recent morning, aides to Mr. Alexander invited a reporter to his hotel suite in New York to sit in as he made telephone calls to potential supporters. The usually calm candidate grew prickly and uncooperative, insisting that he rarely made phone calls.
And he ridiculed the widely held notion that candidates frequently use the phone to woo supporters. "Let me tell you the deal about telephone calls in Presidential campaigns," he said. "They're not the way you make political contacts."
Mr. Alexander later apologized, saying he was embarrassed by what he called his rude behavior. He said that he was not quite used to what a candidate has to go through to run a national campaign.

BYLINE: By William Glaberson 

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis.

 BODY:
ACCORDING to Frank Denton, the editor of the morning paper here in the capital of Wisconsin, people are sick of old-fashioned journalism that simply points out problems.
He says he has found a solution. "Our journalism is not here to fry people -- although we fry people all the time," Mr. Denton said. "Our main goal is in helping the public find the solutions to problems." 
 Mr. Denton's 86,000-circulation daily, The Wisconsin State Journal, is a leading practitioner of what is called civic or public journalism, an approach that is being tried by more than a dozen news organizations.
Advocates of public journalism say news professionals should actively work to improve public life rather than simply describe its breakdown. These advocates say news organizations should focus less on conflict and more on educating citizens and providing them with ways to participate in public issues.
Public journalism has begun to attract widespread attention only in the last year or so, but it already has a cadre of national spokesmen and critics. Advocates say traditional journalism has failed, while critics say the job of journalism is to report on society, not to participate in it.
That discussion often veers into the academic. But in Madison, where The State Journal has been experimenting with public journalism for more than two years, the debate is no longer theoretical. The discussion that is beginning here over the benefits and dangers of public journalism is likely to be repeated in communities across the country.
For example, the Mayor of Madison, Paul R. Soglin, said he was troubled by the methods being used by The State Journal in one of its most visible public journalism experiments, a long series called City of Hope, which has explored problems of crime, poverty, racism and unemployment in the region.
To make the process less confrontational and to increase the possibility of finding solutions, Mr. Denton said he had invited city, state and community leaders to periodic meetings at the paper while his reporters prepared their articles.
Reporters and editors discussed their findings and potential solutions at the meetings. In a sharp break with tradition, the reporters and editors gave the leaders detailed briefings on what would be published in their articles. One result was that the group called together by the newspaper convened a "jobs summit" to develop an economic development strategy for the area.
Mayor Soglin says the experiment has been awkward. The State Journal, the most powerful editorial voice in the region, has been "wearing two hats" by reporting a story it helped to create, he said. And Mr. Soglin says he worries about the "top down" nature of a process in which a group selected by editors, rather than by voters, is making policy proposals.
But mostly, he said, he worries that by mixing the roles of creating news and reporting it, the newspaper may get too much power.
Some of Mr. Denton's reporters have expressed concerns about whether they are getting too close to public figures. Mr. Denton says the paper's news professionals must never advocate one policy or another because that could hurt the credibility of the paper.
But he said that gathering influential people and giving them advance information was an innovation that made journalists less adversarial with prominent people in the community. "Instead of making them feel like targets -- and almost victims -- of our journalism we are trying to make them, ultimately, instruments of solutions," he said.
Dave Zweifel, the editor of The Capital Times, the afternoon newspaper here, says he fears that journalists lose perspective when they orchestrate the news. The Capital Times, with a circulation of 23,000 and old sympathies for Wisconsin's progressive political movement, competes for news with The State Journal, which has always been much more politically conservative. The papers have different owners but share many business operations.
Mr. Zweifel said he thought the concept of public journalism and the movement that is growing up around it have made some journalists lose sight of the most important traditions of their profession. "My idea of public journalism," he said, "is finding out what's going on and raising hell about it. But I don't think I should go down to the mayor's office and hold his hand."
Not all of The State Journal's public journalism experiments have raised hackles. The paper has sponsored a series of town meetings, public hearings and "citizen juries" in partnership with public television and radio stations in Wisconsin, a local public relations firm and the CBS television affiliate here.
Since 1992, the events, called We the People/Wisconsin, have included town hall meetings on various issues and public events in which the public, rather than journalists, question politicians. Citizen panels have grappled with policy options on complex questions like what should be done about local property taxes and revamping health care.
The newspaper and broadcast stations have coordinated coverage. Readers, viewers and listeners have been able to view the events, read about them in The State Journal and request more detail and analysis.
The series has been praised as a sophisticated effort to help people understand public issues. But while public journalism may occasionally be noble, it is not always scintillating, said Marc Eisen, editor of Isthmus, an alternative weekly in Madison. "It becomes something you respect and admire," Mr. Eisen said, "but you don't necessarily rush home to watch it."

For Endangered Species, Humans Present 'the Cooked Frog Problem'

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:
NOAH'S CHOICE
The Future of Endangered Species
By Charles C. Mann and Mark L. Plummer
302 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $24.
The biblical Noah had it easy, write Charles C. Mann and Mark L. Plummer in their new book, "Noah's Choice: The Future of Endangered Species." He had clear instructions from God, the material to build the ark, a known number of animals to save and the right amount of space to keep them. "He and his sons just stood on the gangplank and let everything in," the authors write. "When no creature was waiting outside, he shut the door and waited for the rain." 
 But today, "in the role of modern Noahs," the authors continue, we confront choices that are both momentous and tragic. We have no instructions. "We don't even know the number of potential passengers, although we know that whatever ark we choose to build will be unable to accommodate everything. What will be saved and what will be left behind? There is no automatic answer."
Mr. Mann, a magazine writer, and Mr. Plummer, an economist, together wrote "The Aspirin Wars: Money, Medicine and 100 Years of Rampant Competition." They therefore bring a broad background to the problem of endangered species. But unfortunately, the answers they provide in this book plunge us only deeper into the problem.
To illustrate the difficulties of their subject, they consider in particular the cases of the American burying beetle (Nicrophorus americanus Olivier); the Karner Blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis); the whooping crane, or American crane (Grus americanus); the snail darter (Percina tanasi), and two birds, the black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapillus) and the golden-cheeked warbler (Dendroica chrysoparia).
These reports are lively and entertaining. Of the burying beetle they write, "The larvae rear up and stroke the jaws of their parents to get breakfast." An expert tells them: "It's traditional family values. You don't see that much with insects."
Of the whooping crane: "Unaware of us, the birds walked with the intelligent gravity of the benign aliens in a science fiction film. Their yellow gaze was cool, quick and remote. Legs bent widdershins, straightened, bent again." Descriptions of such creatures make one root all the harder for the endangered-species legislation that was intended to protect them.
Yet the authors' aim is precisely in the opposite direction, to call into question this country's approach to the problem of species extinction. They introduce the burying beetle to show how protecting a species of dubious value can impede a humanitarian project, in this case a highway to help poor Choctaw Indians get to a hospital more easily. They write about the Karner Blue butterfly to dramatize the complexity of the changes "necessary to reverse the damage we have done to biodiversity."
They touch upon whooping cranes to raise the question why species should be saved in the first place. Should we do so for their utilitarian value to humans? The authors say no, because "biodiversity as a whole has overwhelming utilitarian value, but most individual species do not." Certainly the species of monkey in which the AIDS virus originated did not prove useful to people.
Then should we save species for the sake of what the authors call the Noah principle, "because losing species that have long been on earth lessens the total value of the planet"? Again they say no, because the Noah principle creates an attitude toward all species that "thinkers since Kant have called a perfect duty."
And they continue: "The problem with creating a perfect duty to biodiversity is twofold. It is unethical, because trying to save every species perfectly would force our society to destroy many or all of its other accomplishments, an act of self-immolation that the ecologically concerned cannot force on others, who may have different but equally worthy goals. And it is impracticable, because this perfect duty is impossible to fulfill, even if our society were willing to turn back 300 years of its history."
Yet this perfect duty to species is what the authors believe has been embodied by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which, they insist, has transformed Federal biologists into "ecological mandarins" and allowed species like snail darters, black-capped vireos and golden-throated warblers to stand in the way of worthwhile human endeavors.
What the authors would prefer is for environmental laws to use what they call Noah's choice instead of Noah's principle. They would accomplish this end by unlinking the two stages of action required by the Endangered Species Act so that the decision to list a species as endangered would not automatically lead to the design and enactment of a program to conserve that species. Instead the decision to conserve or not would be weighed against human needs through "a countrywide debate on the value of biodiversity, and a democratic vote on the means of its protection."
All of which makes good sense up to a point. The trouble is that beyond that point the authors fail to consider the root cause of environmental problems, which surely is human population growth. If people continue to proliferate and the decision to save species is balanced against basic human needs, the choice will inevitably favor people.
Without some limit on population growth, the world is bound to encounter what the authors call "the cooked frog problem," which they define this way: "Drop a frog in a pot of boiling water, they say, and it will immediately leap free. But put that same frog in a pot of cool water and gradually turn up the heat, and the frog will happily sit and be cooked to death."
Balancing species and human needs without controlling population growth sounds like a perfect way of gradually turning up the heat on the earth's species. And as the authors make so clear in this otherwise sensible book, there is no way to uncook the frog.

HEADLINE: CS First Boston's Exit Leads to New Bond Firm

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Just two weeks after the CS First Boston Corporation decided to get out of the public-finance business, some of its top employees said Friday that they were starting their own municipal bond house to be made up largely of former CS First Boston municipal bankers.
The new firm is starting with $25 million in capital and is headed by three top CS First Boston municipal bankers: Bradford Higgins, Thomas Barry and Donald Carey. The firm, called Cambridge Capital Partners, plans to build on its relationships with former CS First Boston clients and will recruit extensively, but not exclusively, among former CS First Boston employees. 
 Mr. Higgins, a former CS First Boston managing director, said the firm would not be "a second Boston or a little Boston."
"We're Cambridge and that's different," he said.
The firm will build on relationships that Cambridge's founders have maintained with municipal issuers over the years. Some of CS First Boston's biggest municipal clients are New York City and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
"We've been working around the clock to take the franchise," Mr. Higgins said. "We want to look like the same team, but under a different name."
Earlier this month, CS First Boston announced that it was closing its municipal bond department, which had employed 110 people and usually held the fifth or sixth position in volume of bond underwritings.
In January, the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation announced that it was leaving the municipal bond business. Rising interest rates have caused fewer municipalities to issue bonds, shrinking the profits for brokerage firms. The last year was considered one of the worst in memory and there is little hope in the industry that 1995 will see a great increase in volume.
Still, Mr. Carey is confident. He said that CS First Boston's municipal department was profitable in 1994 and that he disagreed with the decision to leave the business. "It was a mistake," he said. "We're a good group who can make money even in adverse markets. Our theory about this venture is like 'Field of Dreams.' If we build the firm, the clients will come."
Mr. Carey is the son of former Gov. Hugh Carey of New York, who will be an adviser to the firm. The younger Mr. Carey would not identify the source of the $25 million in capital, but he said none of it had come from CS First Boston. The investors, which he said he would identify this week, include other Wall Street firms, dealers, banks, private investors and the firm's partners.
The firm anticipates hiring about 30 to 35 people, mainly, but not solely, from CS First Boston, he added.
"By getting out of the business, First Boston gave us an opportunity," Mr. Carey said. "It's like the person who used to date your wife or your husband before you did. When they broke up, they were doing you a favor."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Seizing on Pataki's Budget as Issue, Democrats Begin Assault on Cuts

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 26

 BODY:
As they struggle to rebuild their party from the ashes of last year's electoral defeats, New York State's Democrats have seized on an issue they believe will rally their demoralized troops: Gov. George E. Pataki's state budget.
In speeches across the state, in political literature, in television and radio commercials, Democratic leaders and their allies have begun a full-scale assault on the deep cuts in Mr. Pataki's budget, calling them a boon for the wealthy but devastating for the middle class. 
 Their strategy seems transparently simple: to reclaim the working-class and middle-income voters from upstate and suburbia who fled the Democrats last fall to help Mr. Pataki, a Republican, defeat the incumbent Democratic Governor, Mario M. Cuomo.
But the plan carries an equally clear risk. In opposing a budget that meets Mr. Pataki's campaign pledge to make government smaller, the Democrats could open themselves to charges of supporting the tax-and-spend, big-government policies that voters so soundly rejected last year.
Such concerns are shrugged off by the Democrats' leading spokesman, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who has traversed the state in recent weeks arguing that the painful details of the Pataki budget will ultimately drive voters back into the Democratic fold.
In Buffalo last Wednesday, Mr. Silver told several hundred Democratic contributors that Mr. Pataki's proposal to cut state income tax rates by 25 percent or more will benefit only the wealthy. "This is not a tax cut, this is a tax switch," he said, contending that the Pataki plan would reduce state aid to local governments and cause them to raise property taxes that fall heavily on the middle class.
The next day, Mr. Silver warned a gathering in Buffalo of Jewish community leaders that Mr. Pataki, to pay for his tax cuts, would slash government services that the middle class depends on, from urban mass transit to state colleges to suburban road repair programs.
"The wealthy as a rule don't send their children to state university," he said, warning that state college tuition could rise by $1,300 or more a year under Mr. Pataki's budget plan. Mr. Silver told the group that Mr. Pataki's cuts in health care spending show that "prolonging life is not a priority of this Governor."
Notably absent from Mr. Silver's presentations have been discussions of the poor, even though Mr. Pataki has proposed cutting $1.9 billion for social-services programs.
Rather, Mr. Silver tells his mostly middle-class audiences that welfare cuts will increase the number of homeless people living on their streets. And he warns that cutting Medicaid, the health care program for the elderly, poor and disabled, will hurt the quality of care for all people, regardless of income. "Whether a nurse shows up in 30 seconds or in 10 minutes is affected by Medicaid cuts," he says.
With voters showing little sympathy for welfare recipients, Mr. Silver's strategy of linking middle-class to lower-class interests might be the only way to protect programs for the poor this year, Democrats and political analysts say.
But analysts also said the strategy could backfire if the Democrats were cast as defending bloated and inefficient government programs. "They won't come off as credible if they come off as shills for the health care industry," said Fred Siegel, a history professor at Cooper Union in Manhattan.
To bolster Mr. Silver's campaign, a coalition led by labor unions close to the Democratic Party began running radio and television commercials this weekend that attack Mr. Pataki's proposed Medicaid cuts. The unions include Local 1199, the health and hospital workers union, and District Council 37, the municipal employees union.
One of the commercials, which will run predominantly in Republican Senate districts upstate, shows a middle-class couple in their kitchen fretting that Medicaid cuts will end home-care services for their elderly mother and force them to put her into an expensive nursing home. The camera pans to show the mother anxiously eavesdropping on the argument from the dining room.
Then, an announcer's voice says: "Tell your state legislators our families are too important. Stop Pataki's Medicaid cuts." A closing panel says in writing, "If they don't, we'll remember."
Vic Fingerhut, a Democratic pollster and media consultant who designed the commercials, said Mr. Pataki was politically vulnerable on Medicaid because, according to his polls, voters already think Republicans don't care about the elderly. "When we get him on the defensive, his numbers will go down and all Republican numbers will go down," he said.
If the figures do fall, it will mark an important initial victory for Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who is the first non-governor to lead the party in 20 years. Soft-spoken and deliberative in manner, Mr. Silver has not always seemed comfortable with his new role. Unlike Mr. Cuomo, he does not seem to relish heated debate, and he jokingly acknowledges that he does not speak in "10-second sound bites."
Colleagues who admire his leadership in the Assembly say he has been somewhat slow to reconstruct the party's machinery or to set the party on a clear new course. He has also yet to recommend a new state party chairman or begin preparations for the 1996 Presidential and state legislative races, a task that begins with repaying the party's $750,000 debt.
"The more time that is allowed to lapse here, the greater the grumbling becomes and the greater the possibility for a disharmonious process to develop," said Judith Hope, a Suffolk County Democrat, referring to the process of picking a new state chairman.
Clearly, Mr. Silver has heard some of that grumbling. In recent weeks, he has met with scores of county party leaders, assuring them that the state party will be more grass-roots oriented, that they will play a greater role in running it. "There's a sense that the party has been too dominated at the top by the Governor," he said.
He also says he is considering having two people share the party chairmanship, one from upstate and one from downstate, to allay geographic tensions. Prominently mentioned to fill those posts are Ms. Hope and John Sullivan, a lawyer from the town of Oswego on Lake Ontario.
And as if in response to critics who say he has been slow to develop a plan of attack against the Pataki budget, Mr. Silver plans in the coming week to get a Democratic tax-cut bill passed in the Assembly that he says is better for people earning under $100,000 a year than Mr. Pataki's plan.
The Assembly will also soon release an economic forecast showing that the state has more money to spend than Mr. Pataki's budget allows for -- a key step toward staking out the Democratic position in budget negotiations. And before the fiscal year ends on March 31, Mr. Silver has pledged passage of a Democratic version of the budget that shifts spending cuts away from middle-class services.
Pointing to a recent statewide poll by The Buffalo News showing that less than half of the electorate rates Mr. Pataki's job performance as good or excellent, Mr. Silver suggested that the Democrats are not as weak as they might seem.
"His honeymoon period is starting out at a pretty low level," Mr. Silver asserted. "And there's no place to go but down."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
When Welfare Is Gone: A Cautionary Message

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
EVER since Gov. George E. Pataki announced his plan to put a 90-day limit on Home Relief benefits for childless, "employable" adults, observers of the welfare system have tried to foresee the consequences. Alarmists predict a precipitous rise in homelessness; supporters foresee a cadre of newly productive workers. But most admit they don't know what to expect.
Now comes a glimpse into the future from Michigan, which eliminated its entire home relief program -- called general assistance -- in October 1991. That made Gov. John M. Engler a role model for Republicans everywhere; Mr. Pataki even hired Michigan's budget director, Patricia W. Woodworth. 
 But what's happened to the 82,000 people who lost Michigan's support? A study by the University of Michigan's School of Social Work, to be published today, provides a cautionary message: success depends upon very careful selection of those deemed capable of becoming self-sufficient.
The study, financed by the Ford Foundation, found that while predictions of Dickensian trauma were exaggerated, most of the former relief clients are in precarious shape. Though most are trying to work, only a small fraction can find or hold a regular job. Those considered "young and able-bodied" are doing better than others, but they are hardly thriving. And a surprisingly small number -- about a quarter -- are young and able-bodied. The great majority are elderly, disabled or ill.
"We found that most recipients do not work in the labor market, have health problems and totter on the edge of subsistence," the study concluded. It tracked a random sample of 426 former recipients with face-to-face interviews over two years.
THOUGH Governor Engler tried to dismiss the study during an appearance on ABC's "Nightline" last week, a spokeswoman for his Department of Social Services, Karen Smith, later said that his administration accepted the findings. "We don't think it is flawed," she said. But she and Mr. Engler take some comfort from the finding that a third of the former recipients no longer draw Federal food stamps, concluding that they no longer need them or were never entitled to them. It may also mean, however, that they left the state or cannot prove eligibility.
In 1993, two years after benefits were stopped, the study found the former recipients arrayed like this:
*20 percent were regularly self-supporting.
*30 percent relied on different forms of government subsidies -- mostly disability benefits.
*17 percent were working in odd jobs, like raking leaves or collecting cans.
*16 percent received help from friends or family.
*4 percent were getting unemployment insurance, workers compensation or private pensions.
*12 percent had no cash support of any kind.
Canceling the program, therefore, put a greater burden on the Federal Government, which has to pay for most of the disability benefits from Social Security funds. Cancellation also put a greater burden on Detroit. The homeless population of that city grew dramatically, and JoAnne Klocke, director of the city's Homeless Coordination Department, cites cancellation of home relief as one reason. The increase was so great that even as the state saved money on general assistance, it was forced to spend more for emergency shelters.
Probably the study's most troubling discovery was that most of the former relief recipients were weak candidates for full-time jobs. Only half had high school diplomas. About 70 percent reported chronic illnesses, and many were depressed. More than three-fourths of those over the age of 40 were in poor health.
"These are not lazy people hanging out on the dole," said Mark Elliott, a program officer at the Ford Foundation. "Many are doing some kind of work. But health, mental health, physical ability or changes in the economy have diminished their ability to support themselves. We are kidding ourselves if we think a majority of these people are going to become self-sufficient."
ABOUT a quarter of the former beneficiaries were deemed "young and able-bodied" because they were under age 40 and reported no health problems. That, presumably, is the same "employable" population that the Pataki plan would support for only 90 days a year. New York City's Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, would go further and keep such people off the Home Relief rolls for two years.
In Michigan, a majority of these younger, healthier people had worked at casual jobs during 1993, but only a third were employed when interviewed. Another third said they searched for cans to raise cash, and many of the rest were begging or pawning goods.
The findings are not inconsistent with the experience of Mary E. Glass, New York's State Social Services Commissioner, who ran the Westchester County workfare program for Home Relief recipients. New York now assists 311,000 households with relief payments of $350 a month and Medicaid services. The Governor intends to give only 90 days' support to those judged to be employable and to refer the rest to health, drug or training programs. How those programs will be financed is not clear.
How many are truly employable? In Westchester, Ms. Glass estimated the number at just over a third of the Home Relief population. The rest were ill, aged, incapacitated or addicted to drugs or alcohol. The Michigan study did not examine the nature of the widespread illnesses it encountered, but experts say substance abuse is a common problem among relief recipients.
Dr. Sandra K. Danziger, co-author of the Michigan study, advises New York to be very careful about how it decides whom to throw off Home Relief. "People should work," said Dr. Danziger, of the Michigan School of Social Work. "But for people who are older, or ill, or for people who were trained in manufacturing and there's no job for them, it's a very vulnerable situation."

Visigoths at the Gate

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
At this early date the new Republican leadership has pushed an extraordinary volume of legislation through the House of Representatives or its committees. In that mass of bills, can a theme -- a common purpose -- be identified?
States' rights might be one. Newt Gingrich and his colleagues have talked a good deal about the need to shift power and responsibility from the Federal Government to the states. 
 But that possibility is ruled out by the pending bill to limit law suits over personal injuries. Tort law, which governs such cases, has been a matter for the states throughout our history. The Republican bill, laying down rules for the whole country in major areas of tort law, would displace state legislatures and courts: the most breathtaking nationalization of the law in a very long time.
Market economics is another possibility. "Let the market decide instead of the Government" is a favorite conservative saying.
But again, the slogan conflicts with what House Republicans have done. In voting to end the nutrition program for pregnant women, infants and children (WIC), folding it into a block grant to the states, they rejected a proposal to require competitive bids when a state buys infant formula. Such competition -- reliance on the market -- saved the Federal Government $1 billion last year in the WIC program.
Evidently one must look not at what the Republican leaders say but at what they do. These are some of the measures that have passed the House or are on their way to the floor:
* Repeal of the National School Lunch Act, which has fed hundreds of millions of children free or at low cost over the last 50 years. It would be replaced by a block grant, with less funding, that would let the states provide meals if they wished. Thousands of schools are expected to drop out of the program if the change is made.
* Ending the WIC program. Just as the school lunch act has raised nutritional standards for children, WIC has reduced infant mortality and the number of low birth-weight babies, who are more likely to have developmental problems.
* Legislation making it harder for investors to sue over claims of securities fraud. This bill is a companion to the one that would discourage personal injury suits by such steps as limiting damages.
Not yet ready for action but strongly supported by Speaker Gingrich and hence likely to move ahead is legislation aimed at the Food and Drug Administration. It would make the F.D.A. ease up on its standards for new drugs and medical devices or, alternatively, move the testing and approval functions to a new, less rigorous agency.
Another planned attack is on payments for children with disabilities, under the Supplemental Security Income (S.S.I.) program. Some 900,000 poor children suffering from cerebral palsy, mental illness or other conditions now receive a maximum of $458 a month.
Looking at that list of actions taken and planned, one can hardly miss the theme. The purpose of one measure after another is to enrich those who have money and power in our society and reduce the modest help this country gives to the poor and the weak. Manufacturers and drug companies would gain. Sick children and poor mothers would lose. But the harm would not be limited to those particular classes. All of us would be affected.
Anyone, rich or poor, may be hurt by taking an untested drug. Or by eating meat containing bacteria that cause food poisoning.
When the House last week considered a Republican bill to forbid new Federal regulations for a year, an amendment was offered to let the Agriculture Department go ahead with stricter meat inspection rules drafted after some fatal food poisonings. Republicans rejected the amendment. But they agreed to loopholes for regulations that business wants.
There are faults in our legal system and in Federal regulations. But this will not be a better country for any of us if it is an America with more defrauded investors, more injured people without legal recourse and more ill-nourished children.

HEADLINE: Unbalanced Amendment

 BODY:
Tomorrow's vote in the Senate on the balanced-budget amendment is crucial for the Republican agenda to chop Government programs into bits. The outcome is also crucial to the nation because the pernicious amendment would do enormous fiscal damage. Proponents are alarmingly within three votes of winning.
The core of the amendment would require the Government to balance its books unless three-fifths of the House and Senate vote to run a deficit. To the wavering Democrats -- John Breaux of Louisiana, Sam Nunn of Georgia, Wendell Ford of Kentucky, and Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota -- here are five unassailable reasons to vote no. 
 Unnecessary. Federal deficits have indeed been too high. That poses a threat that borrowing will siphon savings away from productive private investments.
But the fact that borrowing must be contained does not imply it ought to be eliminated -- any more than family borrowing, to buy a house or pay college tuition, need be eliminated. A prudent rule would keep Federal debt growing less quickly than incomes. This rule would justify deficits of about $200 billion a year, close to current levels.
Misleading. Proponents claim the amendment would protect future generations against ruinous interest payments. True, today's children will owe taxes when they grow up to pay interest on Federal debt. But proponents ignore the fact that the tax payments will flow right back to these children as owners of Government bonds.
Unenforceable. Because key terms of the amendment -- like outlays and receipts -- are undefined, Congress will be able to manipulate and evade. Can Congress create independent agencies or find other ways to spend and borrow off the Government books? A Senate committee has already written into the legislative record, used to guide future court decisions, that the Tennessee Valley Authority would be exempt from the amendment. It should take lawyers five minutes to stretch whatever "principle" guides that exception to scores of other Government programs.
The amendment also fails to provide an enforcement mechanism. It might simply become an empty gesture or, worse yet, the courts might step in to tell Congress how much it should tax and where it should spend.
Irrational. Federal bookkeeping lumps ordinary spending with long-term public investments. Congress, forced by the amendment to cut quickly, would go after hugely expensive, though vitally important, investments, such as scientific research, costly laboratories and equipment, job training or other investments that would not produce benefits for years, if not decades.
Reckless. When the economy slows, tax revenues fall off and spending on unemployment insurance and food stamps rises. This automatic rise in the deficit, by triggering spending, serves to mitigate the slowdown. But under the proposed amendment, Congress could easily turn a mild downturn into something worse. Unless a three-fifths supermajority saves the day, Congress would have to raise taxes and cut spending in a slow economy -- the opposite of responsible stewardship.
Take another unintended consequence. When savings and loans went bankrupt during the 1980's, the Federal Government bailed out depositors with borrowed money, thereby preventing a banking panic. But under the proposed amendment, the Government could not react instantly unless a supermajority in Congress approved.
The balanced-budget amendment appeals to taxpayers who demand that the Government spend their money wisely. But Senators Nunn, Ford, Conrad, Dorgan and Breaux need to recognize that this honorable sentiment cannot be wisely embedded into the Constitution.

HEADLINE: White House Is Joining in Efforts To Loosen the Limits on Banking

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration plans to call this week for legislation that would allow commercial banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge, forming giant financial services companies that would offer everything from checking accounts to mutual funds and life insurance, Federal officials say.
In a speech prepared for delivery in New York on Monday and in Congressional testimony scheduled for Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin will urge Congress to repeal the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, the officials said. For more than 60 years, the law has forced financial concerns to choose between owning commercial banks or owning securities companies like brokerage firms and investment banks, but not both. 
 Mr. Rubin also plans to call for broad changes in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which has effectively barred most financial concerns from owning both commercial banks and insurance companies, said the Federal officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mr. Rubin's speech will represent the first time that the Administration has taken a position on eliminating the legal and regulatory barriers among financial industries.
Regulatory changes in recent years have already allowed commercial banks, like Citibank, to begin selling stocks and mutual funds on a limited basis. But the Glass-Steagall Act still bars Citibank, for example, from merging with a brokerage firm like Merrill Lynch or an investment bank like Goldman, Sachs, which provides corporate investment advice and helps companies issue stock. The Bank Holding Company Act bars Citibank fom merging with a big insurance company like Prudential.
The Administration's plan would allow such deals, provided they complied with antitrust laws. The plan would pave the way for new consolidation in the financial system.
Because many House and Senate Republicans already want to allow mergers of commercial banks and investment banks, members of Congress said the odds were high that some sort of legislation to do so would pass in this session of Congress. "I think that's very likely," said Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who is the chairman of the House Banking Committee and has already introduced a bill to eliminate Glass-Steagall.
It remains less clear whether the Administration will succeed in allowing commercial banks to merge with insurance companies. Mr. Leach has strongly resisted this idea in the past, but said in an interview on Friday night that he was willing to let his committee decide the issue.
By contrast, some Republicans want to go much further than the Administration, allowing any business, including insurance companies and corporations outside the financial industry, to merge with banks.
Supporters of greater consolidation say competition will drive down fees for everything from checking accounts to stock trading. Opponents say the giant companies that may result are unlikely to be sensitive to the needs of individuals and small businesses.
All the plans under consideration would require that federally insured deposits be used only in commercial banking, and not in securities trading or other industries. But some critics have questioned whether such rules can be enforced and warned that allowing the combination of commercial banking with other industries might result in costly Federal bailouts.
The risks of securities trading were highlighted today when Barings P.L.C., a British bank older than the United States, disclosed that a single trader had lost all the bank's capital while betting on the direction of Japanese stock prices.
Important differences remain among the Administration's plan and competing Republican proposals. The details will pit lobbyists for small banks and insurance agents against big banks, securities firms and insurance companies.
The Federal Reserve, which blocked an Administration plan last year for the consolidation of bank regulators, supports the combination of commercial and investment banks, but wants more regulatory authority over these combinations than the Administration or many Republicans want to give it.
Mr. Leach is under pressure from younger Republican members of Congress who want much broader deregulation. Representative Richard H. Baker, a Louisiana Republican who heads the House Banking Committee's panel on capital markets and securities, has already introduced a bill that would allow mergers among commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies and even nonfinancial companies like General Motors or AT&T.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, has introduced legislation in the Senate identical to Mr. Baker's.
The Clinton Administration proposal developed by Mr. Rubin amounts to a compromise between the two Republican positions. The Administration would allow banks to merge with insurance companies but not with nonfinancial companies.
Repeal of Glass-Steagall had been sought by banks for years, but blocked by Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, the longtime chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. But when the Republicans took control of Congress, they not only removed him from the chairmanship but also gave the issue to the House Banking Committee, where support for repeal has long been strong.
Mr. Rubin is a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, which opposed the repeal of Glass-Steagall until recently. But while Goldman has not taken a clear position this year, other securities firms mostly favor the position of Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Baker.
During the Depression, Congress banned commercial banks from investment banking because of a widespread perception that stock market speculation had led to the collapse of many banks. But more recent economic research has found that few if any banks failed then because of losses in the market crash. Most economists now believe that the banks failed because they lacked adequate reserves and because many people failed to repay loans.
Small banks and insurance agents have long opposed the repeal of Glass-Steagall. The small banks, which have considerable power on Capitol Hill because of their sheer numbers and the political alliances of their executives, are worried that they will not be able to compete with the giant new financial services companies. Insurance agents are frightened that banks will drive them out of business by using their branch networks to sell insurance.
Kenneth A. Guenther, the executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of America, which represents small banks, said, "The question now is whether you allow the common ownership of G.M., Citicorp and Merrill Lynch -- it would open the door to a level of financial concentration that this country has never seen."
But Mr. Guenther acknowledged that with the Clinton Administration lining up with Congressional Republicans, the barriers between commercial and investment banking would probably be eliminated.
The clashing positions of Mr. Leach and Mr. D'Amato partly reflect the states they represent. Iowa has hundreds of small rural banks, while New York has dozens of securities firms eager to expand.
Some big securities firms are partly or entirely owned by big insurance companies and would benefit from Mr. D'Amato's bill and the Administration's plan. But Mr. Leach's plan would only allow the new financial giants to derive up to one-tenth of their sales from insurance, a limit that is too low to accommodate insurance companies.
Mr. Rubin plans to provide an overview of the Administration's intentions to the Greater New York Savings Bond Committee on Monday, said Administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. He will address the House Banking Committee on Wednesday.

Service Business

 BODY:
Revenue from service business in the United States rose to $1.6 trillion in 1992, up 59 percent from 1987, according to a report recently released by the Commerce Department. The service business industry includes the non-manufacturing establishments of the economy. The largest area of growth occurred in the prepackaged computer software business, a segement of business services, with revenues up 253 percent. Next was another computer-related business, information retrieval services, which include on-line services, and increased by 229 percent. In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, service business revenue was up 49 percent. Health services led the way at an average revenue increase of 71 percent for the region. The home health care boom is largely responsible for the overall explosion in health services.

Budget Amendment Slipping Among Senate Swing Votes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Prospects that the Senate would adopt a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget, a measure most recently predicted to be a vote or two short of a sure thing, seemed to take a turn for the worse today, just hours before a scheduled vote on the proposal on Tuesday.
In rapid succession, three undecided Democrats -- Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and Byron L. Dorgan and Kent Conrad, both of North Dakota -- indicated that they would oppose the amendment unless the Republicans agreed to major changes that they had so far resisted. 
 Despite Republican pleas, Mr. Nunn expressed "grave doubts" that he could support the amendment unless it barred the courts from intervening in its application. Mr. Nunn argued that without such a prohibition, the Federal courts could assume some of Congress's constitutional control of taxes and spending.
Later, after a 90-minute meeting with Republican leaders, Mr. Dorgan and Mr. Conrad said separately that they not only shared Mr. Nunn's concern but that they believed that the amendment did not properly protect the Social Security trust fund. Both men strongly indicated that they would oppose the amendment unless it was changed.
A fourth Democrat who was in the meeting, Senator Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky, also appeared to harbor deep reservations. The fifth undecided Democrat, Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, was with Mr. Nunn in Atlanta today and could not be reached for comment.
Taken together, the day's developments suggested that the 52 Republicans and 12 Democrats who were publicly aligned in support of the amendment would fall short of the 67 votes they would need to push it through the Senate and send it to the states for ratification.
But all that can change in a wink. Republicans who control the amendment debate may accede to the Democrats' conditions in order to pass some sort of amendment. Some Democrats may be holding out to win concessions, but in the end will vote for the amendment, recognizing that public sentiment is behind it.
At a rally of amendment supporters today, two of the Republicans, Senators Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Larry E. Craig of Idaho, expressed scant interest in the sort of concessions that the Democrats were asking.
"They can vote the way they want to," Mr. Hatch said of Mr. Nunn and like-minded Democrats. "But they have to realize this is the most important constitutional vote of this century."
Messrs. Nunn, Ford, Breaux and Dorgan all supported the last version of the balanced-budget amendment, which narrowly failed in the Senate last spring. And all but Mr. Ford were once viewed as likely supporters of the current version.
But the Senate's political microclimate began shifting on Thursday, when, for the first time, Mr. Nunn voiced serious concerns about the amendment. Noting that its language lacked a prohibition on judicial rulings that had been part of the 1994 version, Mr. Nunn said the current measure could enable appointed Federal judges, in effect, to write their own fiscal policy, should Congress ever fail to meet the amendment's demands and be taken to court.
Republicans tried to satisfy Mr. Nunn today by proposing companion legislation that would largely limit judicial review of the budget amendment to declaratory judgments, which have no legal authority.
Mr. Hatch allowed that this would leave the nation with no legal means of enforcing the amendment's requirement that Congress enact a balanced budget, but he said that public pressure would ensure that it is obeyed.
"That's the only way it's enforceable, at the ballot box," he said. "It would be enforceable politically."
That is a mirror image of the principal argument of the amendment's supporters: that without a dictate in the Constitution itself, Congress and the public lack the political will to control the nation's spending habits.
Indeed, Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, said today in an address to the Group Health Association of America that to balance the budget by the year 2002, two of the nation's largest entitlement programs, Medicare and Medicaid, would have to be restructured and their rate of growth reduced by about $400 billion over the next seven years.
Medicare and Medicaid account for about $300 billion a year in Federal spending, and each is growing at a rate of about 10 percent a year.
Mr. Nunn, who was in Atlanta today for a Democratic Party function, said he would look at the Republican proposal for companion legislation, but asserted that no such statute, however well crafted, could dilute the power of a clause in the Constitution.
"There's grave doubts about whether this will work," he said. "This country started on the basis of not having taxation without representation. I don't think we want a back door now because somebody's in a hurry to pass something unwinding the Boston Tea Party."
Later today, Mr. Dorgan and Mr. Conrad cited much the same reasons in expressing varying degrees of unhappiness with the amendment.
Mr. Dorgan, who had long been seen as a likely supporter of the amendment, tempered his support in a Senate speech this evening. He indicated that he could not support the measure unless its supporters agreed to limit judicial review of its provisions. But unlike Mr. Nunn, he hinted that he would consider the companion-law approach.
Mr. Dorgan also said he wanted assurances that taxpayer contributions to the Social Security trust fund would not be tapped to reduce the budget deficit. His fear, echoed by many fellow Democrats, was that Congress would simply tap the hundreds of billions of surplus dollars now building up in Federal retirement accounts and use that money to pay Federal bills, unless that was barred.
Democrats argue that dipping into Social Security funds will leave the accounts empty, except for Federal i.o.u.'s, when baby-boom workers begin to retire in the next century.
This evening, Mr. Dorgan said he preferred to change the amendment to eliminate Social Security from his calculations, but was open to separate legislation resolving his concerns if it could be approved immediately. Otherwise, he said, "I would not be comfortable supporting a constitutional amendment knowing that, riding on that vote, was three-quarters of a trillion dollars in Social Security revenues."
Mr. Conrad took a tougher stance. After meeting with Mr. Hatch, Mr. Craig and Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, a Democrat who is among the amendment's prime supporters, Mr. Conrad said in an interview that the amendment was a "nonstarter" unless it was changed to restrict the courts' power to review it.
He also said he favored changes to prevent what he called "the looting of the Social Security trust fund" and the addition of a provision that would make it easier to run a deficit during an economic emergency, when Government spending is often the only way to pump up the economic pace.
Mr. Conrad disagreed that his demands amounted to opposing the amendment. "Those who have the destiny of this amendment in their hands need to listen and see where the votes are," he said.
But he added that while Mr. Simon seemed open to changing the amendment during their meeting, Mr. Hatch's response was "completely different."

HEADLINE: POLL FINDS PUBLIC DOUBTS KEY PARTS OF G.O.P.'S AGENDA

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

 BODY:
Eight weeks after Republicans assumed control of Congress and vowed to make the Government more responsive, Americans are dubious about central elements of the party's legislative agenda on issues that include welfare, crime, military spending and the Federal budget deficit, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
Republicans are generally more supportive than Democrats and independents of what the new leadership in Congress is trying to do. But Republicans, too, express misgivings about the course taken by Speaker Newt Gingrich and his loyalists. Most Americans believe that Congress should stress jobs and crime -- issues that have not been top priorities for Republicans this year -- and health care, which has not been on the agenda of the new Congress at all. 
 While the Republican leadership has addressed the issue of crime, people took exception to major parts of the Republicans' crime policy. A substantial majority favored the ban on assault weapons that the Republicans have vowed to overturn, and most objected to a bill that has passed the House and would give towns and cities more discretion in spending money that was targeted by President Clinton specifically for more police officers.
One of the most dramatic examples of the gap between public opinion as measured by the poll and the priorities of Congressional Republicans, which are based on their reading of public sentiment, involves the proposed balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. The amendment, already approved by the House, is scheduled for what appears to be a close vote in the Senate today.
Seventy-nine percent of Americans said they favored such an amendment. But that support shrinks to only 32 percent when Americans are asked about balancing the budget if it would require cuts in Social Security, as many analysts say. The Republicans have defeated efforts to remove Social Security from the budget-balancing equation.
The poll also found that 45 percent of Americans approved of President Clinton's overall job performance, up from 38 percent in December. One reason may be that he is getting more credit for his handling of the economy; 47 percent gave him high marks on the economy, as opposed to 41 percent last month.
Even more striking was a sharp improvement in the popularity of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, amid publicity over his run for the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination. With 63 percent of Americans having an opinion of Mr. Dole, 40 percent held favorable views -- double his favorable rating last month -- and 23 percent unfavorable.
Mr. Gingrich, by contrast, was not nearly as popular. Of the 55 percent who express an opinion about the Speaker, 22 percent held a favorable opinion and 33 percent unfavorable.
The nationwide telephone poll of 1,190 adults, which was taken last Wednesday through Saturday, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
More than half of Americans said they knew nothing about the Contract With America, the House Republicans' political manifesto. But the number of people who had some familiarity with the contract has risen to 45 percent, from 27 percent in December.
Even so, Americans -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- disagreed with or were divided over many particulars in the contract.
For example, while lawmakers from both parties would require that welfare recipients be ineligible after five years or less, 66 percent of Americans said people should be allowed to receive benefits as long as they are willing to work for them. And 62 percent said unmarried mothers under the age of 18 who have no way of supporting their children should be eligible for welfare. That is at odds with a bill sponsored by Republicans in the House that would prohibit using Federal money for children born out of wedlock to women under 18.
Cindy Butler, a Republican mother of three young children from Hilton Head, S.C., who was one of the respondents in the poll, said in a follow-up interview that she feared that her party's calls for ending welfare would drive unmarried mothers to have abortions. "I'm firmly against abortion, and some of these girls are going to look to abortion to solve the problem," she said. "Children come first in my book."
Here are other areas of divergence:
*Despite the reservations about dipping into Social Security, Americans were far more comfortable with balancing the budget than cutting taxes. Given an either-or choice, 55 percent favored balancing the budget and 40 percent preferred cutting taxes. Only 32 percent said they would choose a tax cut if it amounted to $500 per child, as House Republicans have proposed. But in a shift toward optimism, 57 percent thought the budget could be balanced without any new taxes on people like them; only 43 percent held such a view two years ago.
*Despite the contract's call to increase military spending, 63 percent preferred to keep such spending at the current level.
*Sixty-nine percent of Americans said it was a poor idea for the House to approve, as it did recently, a bill that would allow the police to make searches without having a warrant. Proponents of the bill argued that it would reduce the likelihood that criminals would get off on technicalities; opponents said it was a violation of people's constitutional protection from illegal searches.
*Americans expressed displeasure with the recent House vote to change a law enacted last year that gave money to towns and cities to help pay for 100,000 more police officers on the streets. The House bill would allow jurisdictions to use the money for any crime-related expense they want. Fifty-three percent said it would be better to require that the money be used for officers on the streets; 43 percent favored giving towns and cities discretion.
One of the respondents, Gary Gasque of Marion, S.C., said in a follow-up interview that he believed the House should not have voted to change the requirement for more police officers. "That was wrong," said Mr. Gasque, a Republican. "Now the money won't hit the street like it should. This is a small town, and I just bought my kid his third bike -- they keep getting stolen. People are shooting at each other four blocks from the police station here."
There seems to be general support for recent moves by Republicans and some Democrats to reconsider giving preferences to minorities. Fifty-five percent said no preference in hiring and promotion should be given to blacks today, even when there has been job discrimination against blacks in the past. And 48 percent said no preferences should be given to women, even in cases when there has been job discrimination against them in the past.
Despite the concerns about the direction of the new Congress, the public has high expectations. Fifty-four percent said the 104th Congress would accomplish more than Congress usually does in a typical session. Public approval of how Congress is handling its job is higher than last fall, but it is still only 36 percent, with 51 percent disapproval.
While Mr. Clinton's approval rating has improved slightly, 59 percent said they had no clear idea of what the President stands for. But he still gets strong marks for compassion, with 60 percent saying he cares about the needs and problems of people like them.
At this early juncture in next year's race for the Republican Presidential nomination, Senator Dole enjoys a wide advantage: 49 percent of Republicans preferred him when asked to pick from a hypothetical grouping of eight candidates.
Most Americans do not yet have an opinion of Mr. Dole's leading rivals, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who formally entered the race last week, and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who plans to announce his candidacy today. But among those who do, sentiment is mixed.
On Mr. Gramm, 14 percent said they viewed him favorably, while 13 percent said not favorably. Twenty percent were undecided, and a majority -- 52 percent -- said they had not heard enough about him to form an opinion.
On Mr. Alexander, 4 percent expressed a favorable opinion, 3 percent an unfavorable view, 8 percent were undecided and 84 percent said they had not heard enough about him yet to form an opinion.
As for Mr. Gingrich, 51 percent of the public said he has strong qualities of leadership. But only 35 percent said he cares about the needs and problems of people like them.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted from last Wednesday through Saturday with 1,190 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, it is plus or minus five percentage points for Republicans, Democrats or independents taken as a group.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for example, can lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: THE COLLAPSE OF BARINGS: THE OVERVIEW;
Young Trader's $29 Billion Bet Brings Down a Venerable Firm

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
At the epicenter of Sunday night's spectacular collapse of a leading British investment bank stands a 28-year-old trader named Nicholas W. Leeson, a Briton who in the course of a month put $29 billion of the firm's money on the line and lost more than a billion of it.
Working in Singapore for Barings P.L.C., an investment house that had survived nearly two and a half centuries of ups and downs, Mr. Leeson eluded detection by his own firm and by outside regulators as he made an ever-mounting and ill-fated gamble on Japanese stock prices and interest rates. 
 As details of Mr. Leeson's audacious strategy became clearer today and as Barings and regulators from several countries sought to find him after his disappearance last week, the world's financial markets shuddered but ultimately calmed down.
Share prices in Tokyo fell nearly 4 percent, but stock markets in most other financial centers were not hit as hard. Shares fell a little more than 1 percent in Hong Kong. In Europe, the British pound was battered by selling, falling at one point to a record low against the German mark before recovering somewhat.
But the European stock markets were relatively calm, with London finishing down less than half a percent. In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 23.17 points, to 3,988.57, with investors using concern over Barings as an excuse to take profits, analysts said. [Page D1.]
[Tokyo stocks had recovered somewhat by midday Tuesday, posting a gain of 1.8 percent.]
In London, the British Government ordered an urgent inquiry. In an interview with The Financial Times, Peter Baring, the firm's chairman, speculated that Barings could have been brought down by a deliberate act of criminal sabotage. But he said the bank did not yet know what had happened.
"It's difficult to get a fix on the motivation of this fellow," Mr. Baring said, referring to Mr. Leeson.
Mr. Leeson does not face any criminal charges from the case so far, and it is unclear what laws, if any, he might have violated.
As bankruptcy administrators worked feverishly to salvage all or part of Barings, one question kept popping up throughout the financial world: How could a single rogue trader bring down an otherwise profitable and well-regarded institution, unnerving financial markets around the world in the process?
The loss, discovered late last week, was enough to sink Barings, despite intensive efforts by the Bank of England to arrange a rescue package over the weekend.
Mr. Leeson, who had succeeded in the arcane business of derivatives despite having failed his high-school-level math exams, disappeared from his post in Singapore last Thursday, just before the firm discovered the huge loss. He was last reported to be in Kuala Lumpur.
The governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, who cut short a ski vacation in France on Friday night to oversee the unfolding crisis, said Mr. Leeson had amassed two huge investment positions.
One -- a bet that Japanese stock prices would rise -- involved the purchase of futures contracts representing $7 billion worth of shares. The other was a bet that interest rates would rise, and it took the form of contracts representing $22 billion worth of Japanese government bonds and currency investments.
Stocks in particular went badly wrong for Mr. Leeson as Japanese shares fell sharply last week. But the rate-sensitive investment lost money, too, Mr. George said.
Perhaps most important, nobody at Barings or at the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, where most of the trades were carried out, or at the Bank of England, Barings' primary regulator, ever questioned Mr. Leeson as he built the positions during a period of almost a month.
"There was clearly a failure of control," Mr. George said at a news conference today. "How could one trader take these huge positions and how could he succeed in concealing them as he did? They just didn't know this chap had taken on this huge position."
There have been disputes within Barings in the last several days about whether the Singapore operation was adequately supervised. Some officials questioned whether the Barings banking subsidiary, which oversees the derivatives business, had enough expertise to monitor the situation properly.
Mr. George said he did not have enough information yet to point the finger at Barings or the Singapore authorities, who would have primary responsibility for policing the trades. He said that it might be impossible to assure completely that determined individuals, if they were skillful enough, could not mislead internal and external regulators in any kind of investment field.
Mr. George said it was also possible, perhaps even likely, that Mr. Leeson had help from someone else at Barings in covering his tracks, since it would be difficult for any trader to conceal investments of the scale Mr. Leeson made. But Mr. George said he had no specific evidence that anyone else was involved.
Up until last week, Mr. Leeson had no reputation within Barings as a risk taker. Coming from a lower-middle-class family north of London, he had become quite successful since joining Barings three years ago, making big but ostensibly safe investments that sought to profit on the tiny differences between what identical financial instruments sold for in Japan and Singapore. When his computer detected such a price difference, he would buy heavily in the lower-priced market and sell instantaneously in the other, generating small but steady earnings for the firm and substantial bonuses for himself.
"He was an extremely able trader," Mr. George said.
But around Jan. 26, officials said today, Mr. Leeson inexplicably, and without authorization, changed tactics. Instead of matching buy and sell orders, he in effect became purely a buyer. His purchases accelerated over the next several weeks, notably so last week. Throughout the period Japanese stock prices were falling, creating losses that Mr. Leeson apparently tried to cover by increasing the size of his bet, Bank of England officials said.
Officials said they did not know why Mr. Leeson began making the unauthorized transactions, but they speculated that he might have been trying to cover a loss in another account.
Mr. Leeson's dealings, which teams of Barings executives, bankruptcy administrators and Bank of England officials are still trying to unravel, were primarily purchases of futures contracts on the Singapore exchange. They were considerably less exotic than the complex derivatives cooked up by some banks and investment firms.
Because the purchases required only a small down payment -- typically 10 percent or less, traders said -- Mr. Leeson was able to amass a position large enough to excite comment throughout Asian financial markets about his aggressive strategy, analysts said, even as his trading was going unnoticed by regulators. Mr. George said regulators had not yet determined how much Mr. Leeson had put down as a margin payment on his position.
There are also reports that Mr. Leeson used another complex strategy called a straddle, which amounted to a bet that the Japanese stock market index would stay essentially level. Straddles are a particularly volatile investment and can cause huge losses if the market moves significantly up or down.
It is unclear what alerted Barings to the problem in Singapore. But, as his positions deteriorated, Mr. Leeson would have faced calls for increased margin payments.
On Friday, when regulators first tried to assess the extent of the damage, they calculated that of the $650 million in losses they could identify at that point, $500 million was attributable to the bet on stock prices, with the remainder from the interest-rate bet.
If, as expected, Barings defaults on the contracts as they mature in coming weeks, the Singapore exchange and its clearing corporation would be liable to pay the counterparties -- the investors who made the opposite bet and stand to gain what Barings has lost. The Singapore exchange would then become a creditor of Barings, to be repaid based on how much Barings and its various parts bring when they are sold. Officials said the counterparties are widely dispersed.
As of Sunday night, all of the contracts remained open and vulnerable to further losses from drops in Tokyo share prices or declines in interest rates. Executives from Ernst & Young, the accounting firm appointed by a British judge late Sunday to oversee Barings, declined to say whether they were trying to sell or otherwise close out any of the positions. The judge acted Sunday after Barings was placed in administration, the rough equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States.
Nigel Hamilton, who is heading the Ernst & Young team, said the loss stood at $900 million before the 3.8 percent fall in Japanese markets today, suggesting that the loss is now well in excess of $1 billion.
Mr. Hamilton said there had been considerable interest from banks and investment houses in Britain, the United States and elsewhere in acquiring all or part of Barings, which had been scheduled this week to announce record profits for 1994 of more than $160 million.
He declined to name any of the potential bidders. But among those that expressed some interest over the weekend were Morgan Stanley of the United States, which tried but failed to reach a merger deal last year with S. G. Warburg, another British investment firm; Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, and most of the big British banking companies, including HSBC Holdings, Barclays Bank and Abbey National.
"We believe there is a high-class core business there," Mr. Hamilton said. "A number of people were quick off the mark to talk to us, and they are serious people."
But it is unclear whether Ernst & Young will be able to make any significant sales until it finds a way to cap the losses on the Singapore investments. The status of Barings bondholders and some depositors was unclear today, although Mr. Hamilton said nearly all of the firm's operations continued relatively normally today and that around $46 billion of funds entrusted to Barings' asset management subsidiary would not be affected.
Ernst & Young is trying to keep crucial personnel at Barings from quitting to take other jobs, a development that would make it harder to sell the privately held firm. Mr. Hamilton said employees had been notified recently of their 1994 bonuses but had not yet received them. Some consideration would be given to paying them, he said.

HEADLINE: THE COLLAPSE OF BARINGS: THE DECISION;
Acceptable Failure Not Seen as a Threat to Financial Systems

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
In closing down Barings, Britain's oldest investment banking group, the Bank of England made a difficult judgment call, analysts and economists say, deciding in effect that its failure would not threaten the health of either the British or the international financial systems nor cause heavy losses to small depositors.
This is the exact reverse of the decision taken by the United States Treasury and the International Monetary Fund in December when they organized an international rescue package for Mexico after agreeing that the peso's collapse threatened to set off a huge withdrawal of capital from emerging market economies that could slow the world's economy. 
 But with no small depositors threatened with bankruptcy, apparently no danger that the Barings failure would bring down other banks and with the losses on its open Japanese stock positions almost incalculable, Britain's central bank allowed the House of Barings to go to the wall after more than two centuries in business, rather than risk public money shoring it up.
"Barings was not too big to fail," said Lisa S. Kaess of the New York investment advisory firm of Geoffrey Bell & Company.
"The Bank of England decided there is no risk of contagion, no systemic risk to the banking industry" said Robert Solomon, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
The Bank of England's decision contrasts sharply to some of its own earlier actions, as well as to Washington's efforts in behalf of Mexico. In 1974, the Bank of England secretly began the biggest banking rescue operation in British history when it organized a "lifeboat" to save London and County Securities and other secondary banks facing collapse as a result of ill-judged property lending.
The central bank, fearing a spreading collapse among secondary banks as panicky clients switched deposits to safer institutions, arranged for Britain's biggest banks to recycle depositors' money back into the secondary banks while they were reorganized.
The big banks had a clear interest in cooperating since a collapse of the small secondary banks would have left the big banks with large bad debts on their books.
More controversial was the Bank of England's rescue of Johnson Matthey bankers in 1984 from a crisis caused by imprudent lending, which critics saw as favoritism toward this famous bullion trading house and at least partially intended to shore up the prestige of the City, London's financial district.
On the other hand, no central bank defended the Bank of Commerce and Credit International before it was shut down four years ago. And more recently there was no rescue of the big German trading company, Metallgesellschaft, which like Barings had suffered large losses in the derivatives market.
And although B.C.C.I. was not a British bank, the Bank of England was criticized by Britain's Asian community because at the time of B.C.C.I's failure a number of small British Asian banks were also forced to close.
The governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, cut short a ski holiday to confront the crisis. Increasing the bank's reluctance to bail out Barings with public money, many analysts said, is the legacy of Britain's Conservative Government under Margaret Thatcher and its emphasis on free markets and self-reliance.
Another factor is that the Bank of England, like most other European central banks and finance ministries, did not fully share American concerns over Mexico's financial crisis and felt they had been railroaded into coming to the country's rescue.
"It would have been illogical to go for a nonmarket solution for Barings when it had favored a market solution for Mexico," a banker said.
Nevertheless, in the view of some analysts, the Barings failure will force the markets to look carefully at smaller British investment banks, notably S. G. Warburg, which is still looking for a bigger foreign partner after the breakdown of merger talks with Morgan Stanley, Kleinwort Benson and Lazard Freres.
Another consequence foreseen by some analysts is that the Barings failure, by further depressing the Japanese stock market, where the Nikkei index has already fallen 15 percent this year, may deter American investors overseas.
Last week the Securities Industry Association said American purchases of foreign securities in the third quarter of 1994 were down 89 percent from a year earlier, even before the Mexican crisis broke.

HEADLINE: 13,000 Workers On Furlough

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Telephones went unanswered in dozens of municipal offices here today, the first of what could be as many as 10 furlough days for employees of the District of Columbia.
The office closures, affecting 13,000 of the District's 41,000 employees, were part of a plan by Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. to save $70 million by Sept. 30. The plan, which is intended to deal with the capital's financial crisis, calls for days without pay, salary cuts, tax increases and other measures. Today's furloughs were predicted to save $3 million. 
 The District faces a projected budget deficit of $722 million, and Mr. Barry has proposed that the Federal Government take over responsibility for the city's courts, jails and Medicaid program. Congress is considering establishing a financial review board to assume full control of the city's finances.
A hearing has been scheduled for Thursday to explore possible solutions to the District's financial problems and to examine measures taken by other municipalities that have faced similar problems.
About one-third of the city's 41,000 employees, like those in the police, fire, and traffic departments, were exempted from the furlough because they provide critical services.

HEADLINE: Cotabato Journal;
Son Leads Marcos Family Into the Sunlight Again

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: COTABATO, the Philippines, Feb. 22

 BODY:
The campaign rally was over, and the women in the audience -- hundreds of them -- descended on the cherubic 37-year-old candidate they all still know by his boyhood nickname.
"Bong-Bong!" one teen-ager in the audience in this southern Philippine city screamed between giggles. "Bong-Bong, we love you!" 
 Another reached out to pinch his arm as he passed through the crowd. "Oh, my God!" squealed Bettina Lorez, 22 years old. "I touched Bong-Bong Marcos!"
The candidate, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., is the only son of the late Philippine dictator. Already a member of the Philippine House of Representatives, he is running a high-priced campaign for the Senate in elections this May, and early polls suggest that he should win.
It is the same path -- the House of Representatives, followed by the Senate -- that took his father to the presidency a generation ago. And Mr. Marcos does not deny that he might be interested in following in his father's footsteps all the way to Malacanang, the Presidential palace. "I'll concede that it's in the realm of possibility," he said.
Nine years after he was forced to join his family in humiliating exile in the United States, the younger Mr. Marcos is today the fastest-rising politician in the Philippines.
Supporters say that his quick rise is proof of the continuing power of the Marcos name, while enemies of the younger Mr. Marcos say that it is proof instead that millions of Filipinos have short memories, and that the power of celebrity overwhelms common sense in Philippine politics.
The newspaper attacks on his Senate campaign have been withering. "Like his late unlamented father, Marcos Jr. perceives falsehood as truth, slavery as freedom, and dictatorship as liberty," wrote Juan Mercado, a reporter who was imprisoned by President Marcos. "Like father, like son."
And mother, too? The President's widow, Imelda Marcos, is likely to join her son in the campaign. She is expected to declare her candidacy for a House seat from her home province in the central Philippines, less than four years after she was allowed to return from exile to face criminal charges over the theft of billions of dollars from the Philippines Treasury, charges that linger on. Mrs. Marcos, perhaps best known to the world for the closet full of footwear she left behind when the family fled country in 1986, is almost certain to win if she runs -- a "shoe-in," as Manila columnists, who love word-play, insist on noting.
Young Mr. Marcos says he has been delighted by the reception that he has received since returning to the Philippines in 1991.
"To be perfectly honest, after 7 or 8 years in the United States listening to all those reports, you halfway expected that they would find a tree and lynch you," said Mr. Marcos, who used his time abroad to study at both Oxford University and at the University of Pennsylvania. "But that wasn't the case. We received a tremendous reception."
He insists that he did not enter politics out of any desire to redeem the reputation of his father, who died in exile in Hawaii.
"I'm not going to vindicate my father's name because his name doesn't need vindication," Mr. Marcos said. "I am so confident that history will judge him well."
At the same time, Mr. Marcos makes clear that he is not running on the legacy of his father's 21 years in power -- a legacy that, to many Filipinos, was besmirched by an unquenchable thirst for power and wealth.
"Something obviously went terribly wrong," Mr. Marcos said of his father's presidency. But he suggests that the blame should go to his father's close aides and friends, and not to President Marcos himself.
"I think maybe he should have been more circumspect, less kind, less understanding to some of his friends," Mr. Marcos explained.
The 1986 revolution that toppled his father and brought Corazon C. Aquino to power, he says, was "a living hell -- it was horrible, and I am glad to say I survived with my sanity. There were times when you would say, 'Yeah, maybe we were nasty people; yeah, maybe we shouldn't be allowed to go back home.' "
He appears to have overcome his reputation in the Philippines as a spoiled brat, a reputation that he admits was well-earned.
"Of course I was spoiled," he readily concedes. "How could you not be, living in a palace?"
But if there was self-doubt, it has since disappeared, and Mr. Marcos is today a confident politician who knows how to work a crowd, using equal doses of charm and self-deprecating humor.
His campaign theme is one of Philippine nationalism, and he charges on the stump that President Fidel V. Ramos, one of the heroes of the 1986 uprising, is ruining the economy by selling off Government-owned businesses.
"We know that the only beneficiaries of the Ramos economic policies are not Filipinos," he says on the stump. "It is the foreigners that he has favored with all the largest contracts, with all the largest deals."
Yet economics -- specifically, the economics of campaigning -- is an issue that also dogs Mr. Marcos. The Government has charged that his family stole billions of dollars from the Philippine Treasury, and critics have suggested that some of that plundered wealth is being used in the campaign.
Mr. Marcos denies that there is any hidden wealth. "Where is it?" he asks. "For all the accusations hurled against us, what have they proven? Everything that we did have has been sequestered or sold off."
Mr. Marcos insists that he lives largely off the earnings of his wife, a lawyer from a wealthy Philippine family. And the Senate campaign, he says, is being underwritten by friends abroad.
"For campaign like this, we have to depend on friends," he insists. "I may not be poor, but I'm not rich."

HEADLINE: Priest Given 4 Years in Prison In Armored-Car Robbery Case

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Feb. 27

 BODY:
An Irish priest caught with $2 million from a $7.4 million Brink's armored-car robbery was sentenced today to four years and three months in a Federal prison.
The Rev. Patrick Moloney, a Melkite Catholic who runs a New York City shelter for troubled teen-agers and illegal immigrants, bowed his head when Judge David G. Larimer of Federal District Court referred to him as a thief. "Based on your prior life, you should have known better," the judge said. 
 Father Moloney gave a thumbs-up sign to his brother and three nieces before being taken into custody. He had faced up to five years in prison. The judge opted for the minimum sentence recommended by Federal parole authorities.
Father Moloney, 62, and Samuel I. Millar, 39, a Northern Ireland rebel who served eight years for a botched bombing, were convicted on Nov. 28 of conspiracy to possess stolen money. Mr. Millar is to be sentenced on Thursday.
The authorities said they found $2 million on Nov. 12, 1993, in a Manhattan apartment used by the two men and $168,000 in a safe in the priest's bedroom. About $107,000 had serial numbers linking it to Brink's.
The rest of the money stolen at gunpoint on Jan. 5, 1993, from a Brink's depot in Rochester is missing. Investigators have said they suspect it was funneled to the Irish Republican Army.
The defense asked that Father Moloney, who was released on bail before Christmas, be allowed to serve his sentence nearer to home at a medium-security Federal prison in Allenwood, Pa. The judge said prison officials would decide where the priest would serve his time.
In appealing for mercy, Father Moloney called himself "a victim of circumstance and circumstantial evidence." More than 100 letters of support from friends, supporters and priests were sent to the judge.
In response, Chris Buscaglia, the prosecutor, said, "I have a hard time understanding the idea that because Patrick Moloney might have done some good things in the past, that entitles him to some get-out-of-jail-free card."
Acquitted after a seven-week trial were Charles M. McCormick Jr., an unemployed teacher who subleased the apartment to the priest, and Thomas F. O'Connor, an ex-Brink's guard who was said to have smuggled Mr. Millar into the United States in 1984 and was suspected of masterminding the Brink's robbery.
Mr. O'Connor, a retired police detective, befriended Mr. Millar on a trip to Belfast in 1984. He testified that at least three gunmen showed up in the depot, took him hostage and dumped him on a roadside two hours later.
Father Moloney, who emigrated from Limerick in 1955, was arrested on weapons-smuggling charges during a visit home in 1980 but was never prosecuted. His brother, John, pleaded guilty and served three years.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
Donations Lag as Campaign Nears End

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
With one day left in its 83d campaign, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund still has a chance to match last year's total of $4.59 million. It would have to collect another $250,000, a task that is formidable but not impossible.
Contributions dated no later than March 1 and received by March 8 will be included in this year's appeal. The total today -- $4,346,550.81 -- is the lowest since 1989, when the fund raised $4,039,728.75. The number of donors this year -- 11,820 as of last Friday -- is also unusually low. Last year, 13,500 individuals and foundations sent money to the fund. In 1993, almost 14,000 did so. 
 When the campaign ends, the money will be split among seven of New York's largest private charities. As in the past, they will use it to provide an array of programs for thousands of poor, sick, elderly and disabled people. But this year, charity officials say, the fund will be more crucial than ever in providing food, clothing, furniture and housing.
This year's fund had a promising start, and by New Year's Day it was nearly $360,000 ahead of last year's pace. But donations slowed considerably after that, and by late January, the fund was receiving only several thousand dollars a day. The decrease in donations comes as government budget cuts threaten a vast range of social services in New York, from soup kitchens to medical benefits.
The fund's most successful campaign was in 1991, when it raised $5.08 million. This year's decrease reflects a precarious economy -- many who gave wrote that they did so despite salary cuts and layoffs.
But there was no lack of spirit among contributors. After reading that the fund was behind in January, many sent second and even third donations.
"My previous donation was made with the plight of elderly poor in mind," wrote Elma Williamson of Rhinebeck, N.Y., who sent a second donation of $200. "But this I would like to dedicate to the children, in hopes that they can find a more stable existence in this chaotic world."
In letters, hundreds of donors expressed anger about plans to decrease government aid to the poor. Over and over, they recognized that the need was more pronounced than ever.
As the campaign neared an end, the letters grew more impassioned.
"Since I have sent a contribution to your fund as long as I have lived in New York I should not like to bypass a year when there seems to be more need than ever," wrote Gina Epworth of Manhattan, who sent $100 a few weeks ago.
Writing that she was sad to see the fund lagging, Janet L. Schultz of Eugene, Ore., sent $100 in early February.
"Perhaps everyone is late, as I am," she wrote. "People seem to get more caught up in their own worlds every year and I wish they'd take our President's words to heart, that we all have to work together and help."

HEADLINE: Supreme Court to Decide Case On Bias Against Legal Aliens

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether a Reconstruction-era civil rights law, originally intended to protect the legal rights of former slaves, also bars discrimination against aliens.
While the issue reaches the Court in the context of the refusal by an insurance company to write homeowner's insurance for people who are not American citizens, the case could have considerably broader implications. 
 The United States Chamber of Commerce and a coalition of large employers told the Court that an interpretation of the 1866 law as barring employment discrimination against aliens would force employers to violate that law every time they complied with a 1986 law that makes it a crime to hire aliens who lack documents authorizing them to work in the United States.
The question the Court agreed to decide covers only private and not governmental discrimination against aliens, so the case is not likely to affect such governmental measures as California's Proposition 187, which bars illegal aliens from public school, welfare benefits and non-emergency health care. The California measure is being challenged principally on constitutional grounds; Supreme Court precedents have given aliens a protected status within the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection.
But the Constitution does not govern purely private behavior like employment or ordinary commercial transactions, which are covered by a number of modern and century-old civil rights laws.
In the case the Court accepted today, the law at issue is the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which is usually referred to as Section 1981, after its numerical listing in the United States Code. The law gives "all persons" the same right to "make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens."
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, ruled last year that this law could be invoked by an Australian citizen, a legal resident of the United States, who was refused a homeowner's policy on his Baltimore house by the Government Employees Insurance Company, a subsidiary of the Geico Corporation. The company told the man, Vincent P. Duane, that it did not write homeowner's insurance for noncitizens.
Mr. Duane sued in Federal District Court for an injunction and damages. Geico asked that the suit be dismissed on the ground that Section 1981 applied only to discrimination on the basis of race. Both the District Court and the appellate court ruled that the law also bars discrimination against aliens. Those courts' rulings made no distinction between aliens in the United States legally or illegally.
The case has not yet gone to trial, reaching the Supreme Court on the purely legal issue of the law's scope.
In its appeal, Geico v. Duane, No. 94-1139, the company argues that Congress has never indicated a belief that private discrimination against aliens was illegal. The debate over the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which made it illegal for employers to hire undocumented aliens while at the same time protecting some legal aliens against job-related discrimination, proceeded on the assumption that no laws existed on the subject, the company's brief said.
The notion that Section 1981 already prohibited discrimination against aliens "is an astonishing proposition," the brief said, "because Congress has legislated for more than a century without identifying or implementing any such national policy."
Mr. Duane argued in his brief that to interpret Section 1981 as not applying to discrimination against noncitizens, the Court would have to ignore the law's literal language, which guarantees to all the rights enjoyed by "white citizens."
In 1987, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, ruled that Section 1981 did not apply to aliens; the Supreme Court considered that decision but ultimately did not review it.
Also today, the Court heard arguments in a Federal criminal case that raises the question of whether the Government has jurisdiction under the racketeering law to prosecute a crime involving a single small company with operations essentially confined to one state.
Last year the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, overturned the racketeering conviction of a former Federal prosecutor who used the proceeds of narcotics dealing to finance the operation of a gold mine in Alaska.
The Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act, the Federal law usually known as RICO, makes it a crime to invest income from racketeering activity in "any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce." The Ninth Circuit ruled in this case that the Government had failed to prove that the gold mine had more than an "incidental" effect on interstate commerce.
The ruling was startling because since the New Deal, the Federal courts have placed few if any constraints on the authority of Congress to regulate and define interstate commerce. In its appeal of that 1994 ruling, U.S. v. Robertson, No. 94-251, the Government is urging the Court to rule that any "perceptible and identifiable" impact on interstate commerce is sufficient to provide jurisdiction.
In this case, the gold mine used supplies from outside Alaska and its owner, the defendant, traveled in and out of the state, Miguel A. Estrada, an Assistant Solicitor General, told the Court.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked, "Is there any business enterprise in America that wouldn't be covered" by the commerce power?
"As a practical matter, I cannot think of any business in America that wouldn't be covered," Mr. Estrada replied. He added that "in our economy in this day and age, I can't think of anything that is likely to happen in the real world" that would not have implications for interstate commerce.
The Justices appeared essentially to agree with the Government's lawyer, although one member of the Court, Justice Antonin Scalia, said in frustration at one point, "If that's what we've said, maybe we should unsay it."
Later, addressing Glenn S. Warren, the defendant's lawyer, Justice Scalia did not appear to hold out much hope that the mountain of precedent arrayed against him was about to tumble down. "You don't have a single case in which 'affecting commerce' has been interpreted by this Court as you wish us to interpret it here," Justice Scalia told Mr. Warren in a disappointed tone.
But a second interstate commerce case the Court is considering during this term may present more problems for the Government. In early November, the Court heard arguments in U.S. v. Lopez, No. 93-1260, which challenges the constitutionality of a 1990 law that made it a crime to possess a gun within 1,000 feet of a school. A Federal appeals court declared the law unconstitutional as going beyond the Government's authority to regulate interstate commerce. Today, nearly four months after the argument, that case is apparently still under active consideration, as several questions about it from the bench indicated.

HEADLINE: CUNY Professors, Fearing Worst, Rush Out Their Resumes

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Tenured professors, both young and old, already had begun frantically sending out resumes and scrambling to seek jobs at academic conventions, as anger and anxiety escalated about the effect of proposed budget cuts on the City University of New York.
But yesterday, their worst fears began to take shape when the board of trustees met and declared a financial emergency for CUNY's senior colleges -- a step that paves the way to lay off tenured faculty. 
 "With the kind of cuts now being talked about, I can't do my research and maintain my professional self-respect," said a 40-year-old Hunter College professor who is considered a superstar by many of his colleagues.
"I'm sending out my resume," said the professor, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Last night's unanimous vote by the trustees echoed their declaration of a financial emergency on Jan. 30 for CUNY's six two-year community colleges. Last night, they acknowledged that the system's 12 four-year colleges are also in jeopardy because of Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed $162 million cut in state financing for the next school year.
The trustees also unanimously approved CUNY's participation in the state retirement incentive program now being discussed in the Legislature. As many as 5,000 of its 14,000 staff and faculty -- both tenured and nontenured -- would be eligible, said Jay Hershenson, director of university relations.
At CUNY, contracts with tenured faculty require that they be given 12 months of advance notice before being dismissed. Now that an emergency has been declared, presidents of the senior colleges will begin to prepare plans to cut spending.
"The budget as it currently stands will not allow us to keep everyone on the payroll currently with us," said W. Ann Reynolds, CUNY's chancellor.
The four-year colleges have a total budget of $900 million, of which $300 million comes from tuition and $600 million from the state.
The community colleges have a total budget of $319 million, in which tuition amounts to $126 million, the state contributes $119 million and the city $74 million.
In previous fiscal crises, CUNY has called for significant faculty layoffs. But this time, spokesmen for faculty members say, the issue is as much politics as economics.
Contrasting the present situation with the financial crisis of 20 years ago, Irwin H. Polishook, president of the CUNY faculty union, said: "The cause of the trouble in 1976 was the de facto bankruptcy of New York City. The trouble in 1995 is fiscal, political and ideological."
Mr. Polishook, who was in Albany yesterday lobbying against the Governor's proposed cuts, said, "Everybody up here is talking about the death penalty. If something doesn't change, we'll have a sentence of death for the university."
As to whether some professors were likely to be more in danger losing their jobs than others, Mr. Polishook said, "Those in the highest demand area are in a stronger position."
An unusually hostile atmosphere pervaded last night's board meeting. Some faculty members, wearing their colorful purple, black and blue academic gowns, and seated in the audience made out-of-order comments throughhout the first half hour of the meeting. They grew silent only when James P. Murphy, chairman of the board, threatened to have them evicted.
William Crain, chairman of the psychology department, shouted that the trustees were yielding to political pressure.
"We respectfully request a much stronger public defense of the university," he said. "There has been no defense from trustees."
After the vote, Sheldon Weinbaum, an engineering professor, said: "If they had any sense, they'd resign en masse. I mean, a 25 percent cut for CUNY? And they're just sitting there and taking it. No chutzpah."
Barbara Bowen, director of women's studies at Queens College, agreed.
"What this represents and what the trustees just ascented to was a demotion of CUNY out of being a university toward being something less than a college. They just sat in there and agreed to let CUNY go."

HEADLINE: Rubin's Plan For Banking Spurs Fight

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin touched off a vigorous lobbying and political fight today by proposing the elimination of legal barriers that have separated the nation's commercial banks, securities firms and insurance companies for decades.
Big businesses in the three industries welcomed the Administration's call for Congress to pass legislation essentially abolishing the Glass-Steagall Act that forbids banks and securities firms to merge. They said it would help to make them more efficient and more internationally competitive. But small banks and insurance agents strongly criticized the plan as a threat to their operations and bad public policy. 
 Mr. Rubin said the Administration's plan would foster competition, forcing companies to offer better service to consumers and businesses at lower cost. The proposal would allow banks to diversify into new industries, while requiring that they not use federally insured deposits in those industries. The Administration contends that taking such steps will produce a healthier banking industry.
"It's absolutely essential that the banking system maintain safety and soundness," Mr. Rubin said in a speech to the New York Savings Bond Committee in Manhattan. "But where there are constraints that have become outmoded by changing conditions, then those constraints should be lifted."
The critics of the plan on Capitol Hill and at various trade groups quickly warned that allowing mergers of banks and securities firms could mean heavy losses to taxpayers if the combined companies gambled in stock markets with federally insured money.
As evidence of the riskiness of securities trading, critics like Representative Charles Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, pointed to the collapse on Sunday of Barings P.L.C. The British investment bank apparently lost close to $1 billion when a single trader made a wrong bet on the direction of Japanese stock markets.
"My basic concern is just as was highlighted by Barings," Mr. Schumer said. "You could end up with a crisis that makes the savings and loan crisis look tame."
Paul A. Eguale, senior vice president for government affairs at the Independent Insurance Agents of America, said that if big banks were allowed to merge with insurance companies, they would start demanding that their customers buy insurance from the affiliates as a condition for granting them loans.
"It's absolutely incredible to me that we have a Democratic Administration that does not see the dangers of allowing these large financial institutions to have cross ownerships at the expense of Main Street," Mr. Eguale said. "They're sacrificing economic interests in the name of international competition."
But Edward Yingling, chief lobbyist of the American Bankers Association, which represents banks of all sizes, said the group would now push actively for the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which has banned mergers of commercial banks and securities firms since the Great Depression.
Two different Republican bills are already working their way through Congress that would also deregulate the American financial system. One, introduced by Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the House Banking Committee, would only allow the mergers of commercial banks and investment banks, but not insurance companies.
Mr. Leach expressed dismay today that the Administration's plan was not stricter in preventing the use of federally insured deposits in areas outside commercial banking.
Mr. Leach's bill would have the Federal Reserve regulate a holding company that would own a securities firm and a commercial bank, thereby giving the Fed new powers over the nation's securities industry. The Administration's plan, by contrast, would give the Fed a central role only in regulating financial conglomerates primarily in commercial banking. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, is scheduled to present his views to the House Banking Committee on Tuesday.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative Richard H. Baker, a Louisiana Republican who heads a panel of the House Banking Committee, have introduced identical bills in the House and Senate. They would allow nonfinancial companies like AT&T to merge with commercial banks, as well as securities firms and insurance companies.
Senator D'Amato praised Mr. Rubin's plan for its similarities to his own plan. "His support for key provisions of my bill is the first indication from this Administration that it will join in a bipartisan effort to create a more innovative and competitive financial services industry," Senator D'Amato said.
Mr. Baker said in a telephone interview on Saturday that he did not feel the Federal Government was equipped to continue regulating financial industries given the pace of change in them. "In the Banking Committee's offices, you will find memory typewriters," he said, "when we're working in a world of four-pound laptops."

Day 200: Negotiators Begin New Round of Talks in Changed Atmosphere

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 27

 BODY:
Negotiators for baseball's owners and players began a new round of talks today, but remained uncertain whether the presence of Bud Selig or his peace talks with Donald Fehr last week would have any impact on their effort to end the 200-day-old strike.
Two small groups led by Selig and Fehr met for four hours, spending much of their time on the core economic issues of payroll tax, salary arbitration, free agency, revenue sharing and an industry growth fund. When they emerged, they acknowledged that they remained far apart, but emphasized that the atmosphere had changed. 
 Describing the meeting as "businesslike, not hostile," Fehr said: "We're talking and the tone is civil. Hopefully, it will lead somewhere. It would be unfair to go beyond that at this point. It's too soon to draw inferences from that about substance."
While the two sides await concrete results of their supposedly changed relationship, another scenario that could develop in the next two weeks away from the bargaining table could have a far greater impact on getting the players back to work.
The general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board is close to making a decision on the union's unfair labor practice charge against the clubs. That decision could trigger a series of events that could put the players back on the field around the middle of next month.
Fred Feinstein, the general counsel, was not in his office in Washington today to comment on the status of his deliberations, but the negotiators were back at the table, only at a new site.
Selig, the acting commissioner, and Fehr, the union chief, led their teams in the first serious bargaining since the last round of talks collapsed at President Clinton's feet in the White House the night of Feb. 7. They met at a golf club on Gainey Ranch, a high-income housing community in this Phoenix suburb. The site was selected because Selig and Fehr's parents have homes in the community.
Selig had previously spent little time in talks with the players.
"I said all along if everybody thought that my being here was productive, I'd be happy to be so," Selig said. "It's very difficult to determine what that will or won't mean. I hope it will mean something productive, but only time will tell."
Selig declined to spout false optimism. "This is not going to be a quick process," he said at a news conference.
Fehr echoed that thought. "Clearly," he said, "we still have a lot of work to do. The gulf between us is wide."
In Washington, Feinstein was very likely only days away from deciding whether to issue a complaint against the owners and if so, whether to seek an injunction that would force the clubs to restore all of the work rules that existed before they tried to implement a salary cap.
People on both sides expect Feinstein to recommend both steps to the board. If the board tells him to seek an injunction, the board and the owners could be in United States District Court in Manhattan by the end of next week. A judge could then have a decision by sometime the following week, perhaps by March 15.
"If the N.L.R.B. seeks and obtains an injunction restoring the previous terms of employment," Fehr said, "I would recommend our members go back on that basis."
The owners could counter by locking out the players, but that action would be accompanied by a major legal and economic risk. If the owners locked out the players and an administrative law judge upheld the board's unfair labor practice complaint, the clubs would be liable for back pay plus interest.
Asked about the labor board's possible role in the dispute, Selig said: "If we continue to dwell on the ancillary issues, the issues other than the issues that have separated the parties, we'll never make progress. You have to focus on making a deal."
The labor board was prepared to issue a complaint against the owners earlier this month charging that their declaration of an impasse Dec. 22 was illegal. But Feinstein placed the case in abeyance when the owners agreed to withdraw the salary cap and restore what was supposed to be the status quo.
But the owners viewed the status quo, the previous work rules, differently from the union, eliminating salary arbitration and placing the negotiation of individual contracts solely in the province of the Player Relations Committee, the clubs' labor arm. That's when the union filed its second unfair labor practice charge.
The two sides recently have become embroiled in a dispute over the status of minor league players. The union has asked minor leaguers not to play in major league exhibition games, saying they would be considered replacement players if they did. The clubs have accused the union of using those players, whom they do not represent, for their own means.
A three-man union contingent met with about 340 minor leaguers in Tampa, Fla., tonight to explain the union's position. Other meetings are scheduled for West Palm Beach, Fla., Tuesday night and Phoenix Wednesday night.
Joining Fehr in the negotiating session today were Lauren Rich, a union lawyer, and three players, Jay Bell, Paul Molitor and Terry Steinbach. Working with Selig were John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox, Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies, Dave Montgomery of the Philadelphia Phillies and two lawyers, Chuck O'Connor and Rob Manfred.
Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox, a member of the owners' negotiating committee, was at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, which is also on the Gainey Ranch grounds, but he said he was not participating in the talks.
A person on the management side said he heard that Reinsdorf was claiming to have nine owners pledged to block a settlement they didn't like. Ratification of an agreement requires 21 votes from the 28 clubs.

HEADLINE: The Nuclear Wedge Issue

 BODY:
Citizens should not be deceived about the real motivation behind the gathering crusade against affirmative action. The rhetoric about reverse discrimination is the 90's equivalent of blue smoke and mirrors. Everyone in American politics knows what is going on, and if three decades of racial progress are to be abandoned, let us at least be candid about it. Republican strategists and the party's Presidential candidates have spotted a nuclear-strength wedge issue for the 1996 election.
By concocting a fantasy that white males are a new victim class in the world's richest nation, they see a highway to a pre-emptive lock on the electoral vote. The tipoff came from the 1994 Congressional election, when 62 percent of white males voted for G.O.P. candidates. By sustaining those numbers the Republicans can seal off President Clinton, or any other Democratic nominee, from victory in the nation's Southern tier, including the mega-states of Texas and California. Absent a vote drain from a third-party candidate, a Democratic victory becomes virtually impossible. 
 The G.O.P.'s reigning ideologue, William Kristol, sketched the plan for building this miraculous backlash machine, and Senators Bob Dole and Phil Gramm have cranked it up. Democrats are rushing to get out of the way. Perhaps President Clinton's promised review of existing Federal affirmative action regulations will have a calming effect in his party's ranks. If not, they will break and run.
The attack on affirmative action depends on exaggerating every inconvenience suffered by a white worker or student into a massive insult against egalitarian principle. It is true that in absolute terms, males have lost a tiny portion of the economic advantage represented by all-male construction unions, firehouses and medical school classes. It is also true the contracting guidelines pioneered by President Nixon put new businesses owned by blacks, Latinos and women into a bid pool that was once a safe haven for white-owned firms.
A growing economy once cushioned the impact of such competition. But as high-salaried industrial and government jobs disappear, a sinister national tendency toward scapegoating has resurfaced. The noble bipartisan tradition of reasonable remedies for past discrimination has withered. In its place, the nation has a new class of politicians willing to argue that it is intolerable for a white male anywhere in America to taste one drop of the discrimination that over the decades has been gulped in gallons by blacks and women.
Critics of affirmative action would have a strong case if their handful of reverse-discrimination examples represented a vast national problem. But the reality is far different, and it is an apotheosis of illogic to have the United States junk 30 years of progress because a Colorado contractor lost a $300,000 guard-rail contract to a minority bidder.
Among doctors, lawyers, scientists and university teachers, fewer than one in 20 are black. The ratio is only slightly higher in the construction trades. The plain truth is that the number of blacks at the professional or skilled labor levels is simply too slight to produce much competition, let alone discrimination against white men.
The remedies that have helped a small number of blacks have helped a larger number of women. Almost a quarter of the nation's doctors and lawyers are women. But that simply means that professional schools that once sliced the admissions pie in favor of white males have been forced to hand out more equal slices.
Does anyone doubt that this happened because of Federal law and enforcement pressure? The city of Richmond, Va., shows what happens when that pressure disappears. Under its minority contracting rules, more than 30 percent of city construction contracts went to minority companies. With revocation of those rules, minority participation fell to 5 percent of the contracts in 1993 in a city that is 55 percent black. A new outreach program is now driving the numbers back up, though nowhere near the original accomplishments.
Richmond points the way toward a new national reality if the war on affirmative action succeeds. Today, young activists from privileged backgrounds and elite universities argue that America's poor, its minorities and women deserve no advantage to correct past discrimination at work and school. Theirs is the callow wisdom of the political-science class, not the ennobling, real-world wisdom produced from our nation's long struggle against racial and gender inequity.
Mr. Kristol likes to say that affirmative action has been poisonous for race relations in America. There is poison in the air these days, but not the one he imagines.

The Road Not Taken

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
See them smile and toast each other before their little Chinese Communist and American flags. The negotiators from Beijing and Washington are celebrating their happy day of commercial accord.
And why not? They have done their job well. The Americans said that unless the Communists stopped stealing United States intellectual property like movies, compact disks and computer software, Washington would retaliate with sanctions on more than $1 billion of Chinese exports to the U.S. 
 Being no fools, the Communists, after making all kinds of horrible faces, gave in at the last moment -- as predictable from the first moment. That is, the first moment that the Clinton Administration showed that this time it really meant its warnings, really.
So maybe the rest of us should be toasting each other too, because Beijing and Washington have shown we were right -- that on important disputes between the two countries the Chinese Communists would give ground in the face of economic pressure from the United States.
But we do not toast. We see the road not taken. We know where it might have led had Mr. Clinton had the courage, if not of his conviction then at least of his promises.
We asked the President to use tariff pressure against Communist China to persuade Beijing to lessen the use of its three key instruments of rule: torture, imprisonment and slave labor. No revolution was demanded, no abdication by the Communists, just that they display restraint in practicing their theology of force as government.
Mr. Clinton agreed but broke his word. There are two reasons to bring all this up -- and again tomorrow and tomorrow.
One is simply that Chinese are still tied to torture boards in political cells and made to work in factories based on slave labor, and Tibetans are still beaten, arrested, deported from their own land. Of all Americans who should continue to fight for China, none have a greater obligation than those who voted for Bill Clinton. The second reason we will deal with in a moment.
Soon after taking office, he signed an executive order: If the Communists did not lessen oppression in China and occupied Tibet by spring 1994, the U.S. would raise some tariffs on Beijing's exports to the U.S.
It was sensible to believe it would work. It was simple decency to try. Economic pressure had been carried out, effectively, against the Soviet Union and South Africa.
And for Communist China, the U.S. was and is an essential customer. Beijing sells us four times as much as it buys, runs a $30 billion trade profit with the U.S. and counts on our technology to strengthen and smarten its huge war machine.
Last year, up to almost the last moment, top members of the Administration said Mr. Clinton would never go back on his executive order.
But as they spoke, the China lobby -- American businesses operating in China -- had already gotten to Mr. Clinton. The President, knowing his executive order was not fulfilled, just tore it up. What's more, he said he did not want to hear about human rights anymore as a China-trade issue. When he turned, he whirled all the way round. State Department officials who had said he would never do such a thing, what could you be thinking of, meekly changed their public minds, as did a sad collection of Democratic senators.
Now, the State Department report on human rights shows that oppression is as pervasive and cruel as when Mr. Clinton made his promise, and when he broke it.
That second reason to remember: Political appeasement and economic strengthening of dictatorships are related and contagious diseases.
Politically and morally there is a connecting line between forgetting the tortured in the Chinese cells, sales of high-tech military equipment to the Chinese by America, Europe and Israel, European pressure to lift the embargoes against Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro, and Russian contracts with Iran for nuclear plans.
The democracies cannot destroy all tyrannies. But they should not empower them. Yet they do, they do.
Maybe, after the President betrayed himself and human rights pledges last year, the political bosses of the gulag in Beijing's Politburo offices raised happy little toasts of their own. I think so.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Budget Could Lift Bond Rating, Agency Says

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed budget received unusual support today from a leading state credit agency, which suggested that it would raise New York's bond rating if the Governor's budget is passed on time and if it is in balance for half a year.
Standard & Poor's, which rates New York's general obligation bonds at A-, the lowest of any state, said in a report that passage of Mr. Pataki's budget by April 1, the start of the fiscal year, "could provide the impetus for a rating upgrade." But with a month to go before the deadline -- and a 10-year record of failing to pass a budget on time -- negotiations between Mr. Pataki and the Legislature are in only a nascent stage. 
 The Standard & Poor's report noted that Mr. Pataki had proposed to reduce state spending for the first time in recent history while also cutting income taxes.
"This budget must be based on realistic economic assumptions and passed in a timely manner," the report states. "If that is achieved, S. & P. will consider it another step toward the state's fiscal recovery that could lead to an increase in the state's G.O. bond rating to 'A' in the near future."
An increase in the bond rating would allow New York to borrow at lower interest rates, thereby saving money for future budgets. It also would provide a psychological boost for the state's business climate and a political victory for Mr. Pataki.
Richard J. Marino, a director of Standard & Poor's, said it was uncommon for the agency to hint publicly about a rating increase before it was ready to grant one. He said the firm would not act until at least October, when it would be able to judge if the state budget remained in balance after six months.
The state's other primary credit rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, issued a report last week that was less encouraging. It made no suggestions about the possibility of a rating increase.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Gain On Failure of British Bank

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Government securities gained in thin trading yesterday, after the collapse of a venerable British investment bank helped to attract funds to the market as some investors sold stocks to buy short-term securities.
Early in the day the failure of Barings P.L.C., the 228-year-old British investment house, sent ripples through the world's financial markets amid fears that the crisis would spread. While trading steadied in Europe, the United States bond market still benefited from a flight to quality as investors sought a safe haven. 
 But traders cautioned that yesterday's gains, the second consecutive advance, should not be seen as the start of a longer rally, especially because the short end of the market had been vulnerable to reports about the health of the economy.
William A. Hornbarger, associate vice president, fixed-income research, at A. G. Edwards & Company in Cleveland, said the market's move was made in thin trading, "and thin trading will exacerbate any move the market makes."
The price of the 30-year bond rose 21/32 , to 10029/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 7.47 percent, from 7.52 percent on Friday, and is still at a five-month low. The rates of shorter-maturity bills were also down.
At the Treasury's regular weekly auction of new three- and six-month bills yesterday, the rates declined for the third consecutive week. The rate for three-month bills dropped a basis point, to 5.73 percent, while the rate for a six-month bill fell 11 basis points, to 5.90 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The market is likely to be tested in two weeks, when the Government releases the latest employment data. But ahead of that is the Purchasing Management report, to be released tomorrow. The market will focus on the prices paid and prices received components, and look for inflationary pressures as signs of whether the Federal Reserve's policy of increasing short-term interest rates has kept inflation from accelerating.
Mr. Hornbarger said the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, was scheduled to speak to the National Association of Business Economists in Washington tonight. As a result, trading activity may be limited today, as the market waits to see if Mr. Greenspan will say anything beyond his remarks in Congressional testimony last week.
"We think the bond market right now is carving out a new trading range," Mr. Hornbarger said, "and the current yield may be the low end of that trading range."
The Treasury market was also supported by a steady dollar, which recovered from declines caused by a surging German mark. A stronger dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities very attractive to foreign investors, especially when there is turmoil in other markets.
Elsewhere, municipal bond prices rose, as a decline in new sales, down 50 percent from last year, helped increase the demand for outstanding issues. This week the dealers are expecting to sell $1.42 billion of new paper, but that will be down $680 million from last week.
The largest sale of the week, a $500 million bond offering by New York State tomorrow, is expected to do well. Lehman Brothers will manage the offering, in which a New York 10-year bond could yield 5.50 percent, according to traders.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of three- and six-month bills yesterday:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.552	97.017	Discounted Rate	5.73%	5.90%	Coupon Yield	5.91%	6.18%	High Price	98.557	97.032	Discounted Rate	5.71%	5.87%	Coupon Yield	5.89%	6.15%	Low Price	98.549	97.017	Discounted Rate	5.74%	5.90%	Coupon Yield	5.92%	6.18%	Accepted at low price	50%	33%	Total applied for	$46,391,971	$45,285,590	Accepted	$13,038,993	$13,050,245	Noncompetitive	$1,326,102	$1,327,200

Shell and Exxon in North Sea Oil Venture

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Two of the world's largest oil companies, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group and the Exxon Corporation, announced yesterday that they had received approval from the British Government for an $800 million project to squeeze more oil and gas out of developed fields in the North Sea.
A series of such projects has helped keep the flow of oil in the North Sea at much higher-than-expected levels over the last several years -- a trend that has made it more difficult for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to force world oil prices higher. 
 Last November, OPEC decided to extend its production quota of 24.5 million barrels a day through the end of this year, in the hope of keeping supplies tight and pushing up prices as world demand rose.
The strategy has worked to some degree; prices have recovered from the mid-December level of $16.50 a barrel. Yesterday, the price of the benchmark West Texas intermediate crude was $18.66 a barrel.
Adam Sieminski, an energy analyst for NatWest Securities, said the increase in North Sea production had moderated the rise in prices. Although many big fields in the North Sea are reaching maturity, he said, projects like the one announced yesterday have enabled oil companies to tap into smaller surrounding fields and keep production from falling.
"They just keep squeezing out more oil and gas," he said.
Production in the North Sea rose from 4.48 million barrels a day in 1993 to 5.3 million barrels a day in 1994. It is expected to climb to about 5.8 million by end of this year.
The two companies will develop three fields in the central North Sea, known as Teal, Teal South and Guillemot A, more than 100 miles east of Aberdeen, Scotland. A medium-sized tanker will be used for loading and storage.
Production is scheduled to begin in about two years. The venture will be able to process 55,000 barrels of oil a day and transport 30 million cubic feet of gas a day through the nearby Fulmar Gas Line to St. Fergus, Scotland.
While the oil reserves of the three fields, at 90 million barrels, are not huge, the venture will be among several modest projects that have helped production in the North Sea. Horizontal drilling has enabled oil companies to tap fields from existing platforms, and three-dimensional seismic surveys have enabled them to pinpoint deposits, greatly reducing the chance of dry wells.
The three fields in the venture will be developed using underwater wells, linked by flow lines to the tanker.
Heinz Rothermund, the managing director of Shell U.K. Exploration and Production, which will operate the venture, said the use of such a platform system "will provide higher profitability than any alternative options and offers the potential for the economic development of other North Sea fields in the future."

Conseco Wants to Buy All of 2 Insurers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
Conseco Inc., which tried unsuccessfully last year to acquire the much larger Kemper Corporation, said yesterday that it wanted to spend almost $728 million to buy shares of two life insurance companies it controls but does not own entirely.
Because the shares of the two affiliate companies -- Bankers Life Holding and CCP Insurance -- have been depressed along with many other insurance stocks, analysts saw the move as way for Conseco to buy cheaply shares that could help improve its faltering earnings and perhaps be sold at a profit some day. Conseco, a insurance holding company, knows the operations of the two companies inside out, as it reorganized them in the early 1990's and continues to provide much of their management. 
 Michael A. Lewis, an insurance analyst at Dean Witter, estimated that the purchases would "significantly" increase Conseco's per-share earnings, even if it had to issue new securities to raise the $727.6 million it proposed to pay for the shares. He added that owning 100 percent of the two companies could give Conseco more flexibility in managing them than the current arrangement in which Conseco owns about 60 percent of Bankers Life and a little less than half of CCP.
Conseco's business strategy of buying life insurance companies, fixing them to improve profits and then selling shares to the public was very successful in the 1980's and early 1990's. The company, based in Carmel, Ind., is continuing that approach, though higher interest rates have hurt profits of most life insurers and Conseco's fourth-quarter profits were 35 percent less than in the comparable period a year earlier.
The morning announcement of Conseco's plans caused a quick rise in the company's stock, which closed yesterday at $35.25, up 75 cents. But even with that gain, and recent purchases by Conseco of its own shares, its stock remains below the $45 of two weeks before it announced fourth-quarter earnings that were weaker than expected. The company's share price is well below its all-time high of $75.75, reached in October 1993.
Because of the close ties among Bankers Life, CCP and Conseco, the offers of $22 a share for Bankers Life and $22.50 a share for CCP are expected to be approved. Shares of Bankers Life rose $2.50 yesterday, to $21 a share, a price that is only slightly below the $22 price set in 1993, when a Conseco-led investor group publicly offered the shares, and well above the low of $16.50 last December. CCP rose $1.25, to $20.625, well above the $15 set at its public offering in 1992 and the $13.625 low set last December.
Steven Hilbert, chairman of Conseco, is also chairman of Bankers Life and CCP. The Conseco offer will be considered by independent directors of those two companies.
Bankers Life, based in Chicago, specializes in the sale of supplemental medical insurance, long-term- care insurance and annuities, using its own network of sales agents. CCP, based in Carmel, specializes in the sales of annuities to educators using a sales force of independent agents.

Another Cut In Production By Chrysler

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 27

 BODY:
In another signal that demand for new vehicles may be weakening, the Chrysler Corporation plans to idle the Canadian assembly plant that produces its midsize and full-size sedans for a second week, beginning Monday.
The plant, in Bramalea, near Toronto, had operated two shifts continuously since Chrysler introduced its LH sedans in 1992. But last Wednesday, Chrysler said it would shut the plant this week, because too many unsold vehicles had accumulated on dealers' lots. 
 Then, after examining sales estimates on Friday, Chrysler executives decided they would forgo another week's production in hope of thinning dealers' inventories.
"Inventories just aren't where we want them to be, and we've said before we won't overproduce," Michael Aberlich, a Chrysler spokesman, said today in confirming the production cut.
The Bramalea plant produces the Chrysler Concorde, New Yorker and LHS; the Dodge Intrepid, and the Eagle Vision.
The cutbacks reflect an industrywide trend. Since December, dealer inventories have been rising relative to the levels a year earlier, when demand was unseasonably robust.
Climbing interest rates have held back demand, the auto makers say, although they still predict sales will increase this year and next. While sales remain strong for pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles, other segments of the market, like mini-vans, appear to be weakening.
Chrysler has reined in its optimism about the market. Last spring, it projected record industry sales in 1995 of 16.6 million cars and light trucks. But as interest rates rose, Chrysler's economists reduced that number to 15.6 million, which would be about a 3.3 percent increase over 1994 sales of nearly 15.1 million.
Auto industry analysts have been expecting Chrysler and other auto makers to cut back their aggressive production schedules. On Friday, Jack Kirnan of Salomon Brothers trimmed his earnings estimates for Chrysler, mostly because of production cuts and rising incentive costs. Last week, Chrysler doubled rebates on some mini-vans.
Saying that most of the problems are temporary, Mr. Kirnan continues to rate Chrysler's stock a buy. Still, he has reduced his forecast of 1995 per-share earnings by 50 cents, to $9.50, and his 1996 forecast by $1, to $11. Chrysler shares closed today on the New York Stock Exchange at $44.25, down 12.5 cents.
Mr. Kirnan predicted that Chrysler would also have to cut a week of production of its Neon subcompact car. And he said the Ford Motor Company, which has already made some production cuts, would make further reductions.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rebounds as Fears Over Barings Crisis Fade

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most leading currencies yesterday, rebounding from early losses as concern faded that the collapse of the British investment firm Barings P.L.C. would lead to an international financial crisis.
Early in the day, in Asian and European trading, currency dealers flocked to buy German marks, fearing that the Barings crisis could spill over to other institutions and depress financial markets around the world. In recent years, the mark has become a haven for many investors in financial crises because the mark has maintained its value better than the dollar. Investors also have great faith that the Bundesbank, more than any other central bank, will keep inflation under control, thus preserving the value of mark-denominated deposits and assets. 
 "We're basically seeing a flight to quality into the mark with the shocking news from London on Barings," Karl Halligan, a trader at the CIC Bank New York, said yesterday morning.
But fears that the Barings crisis would spread eased later in New York trading. The dollar was also bolstered by early gains in American stocks and bonds, although stocks fell later in the day.
Because the Barings crisis is "an isolated incident for a single U.K. institution, it didn't have a lasting impact on the dollar," said Vicki Schmelzer Alicea, who handles currency sales for Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale in New York.
After falling to a 28-month low of 1.4530 marks early in the day, the dollar recovered to 1.4660 marks late in New York trading yesterday, up from 1.4612 marks on Friday. The dollar also recovered from an early low of 96.58 yen, bouncing back to 97.07 yen, up from 96.50 yen on Friday. The dollar touched a record low of 96.12 yen on Nov. 2.
The mark has been steadily strengthening in recent months, benefiting by political uncertainty in Italy, Spain, France and Britain. The surge of buying in marks yesterday further battered many of these weakened currencies. The mark rose to a record highs against the Italian lira and the British pound yesterday.
The pound also fell against the dollar, ending at $1.5812, from $1.5885 on Friday. In other trading, the dollar fell to 1.2430 Swiss francs, from 1.2450 francs on Friday.

HEADLINE: Car Bomb Kills At Least 54 In Kurdish Iraq

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Feb. 27

 BODY:
A car bomb exploded in a crowded market street in the Iraqi city of Zakho today, killing at least 54 people and wounding up to 80, Western and Turkish officials said.
The city is in the area of northern Iraq controlled by Kurds, who are under the protection of an allied Western force that operates from the air base at Incirlik, Turkey. It was not clear who was behind the explosion. Past bombings have been blamed by local Kurdish groups on the Iraqi Government, which claims sovereignty over the area. 
 American military officials at Incirlik said the early-morning explosion occurred in the financial district of Zakho. They said that at least 54 people were dead but the death toll could rise. Up to 80 people were injured, 15 seriously, a spokesman said. Western aid workers said they feared the death toll could go higher.
Northern Iraq has had fighting since mid-December between two factions, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
A statement from the Patriotic Union said initial reports from Zakho indicated that as many as 80 people were killed and dozens wounded.
 Relief workers reported from the region that the explosion was in a crowded commercial street lined with traders, many from neighboring Turkey. A Turkish Foreign Ministry official confirmed the explosion and said he was concerned that Turkish truck drivers who regularly pass through Zakho could be among the casualties.
Zakho, 12 miles from the Turkish border, and the towns of Dohuk and Salahuddin are controlled by the Democratic Party. The Patriotic Union holds Erbil and Sulaimaniya further south.
Turkey and the United States have recently warned both leaders that their fighting could endanger the flow of relief aid to the region.
Turkey supports the truck trade into Iraq to boost its regional economy, which has been affected by the 1990 United Nations embargo punishing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Turkish trucks bring food and medicine, allowed under the trade sanctions, and return with diesel fuel to sell on the local market.
Lucrative tolls collected by the Democratic from the Turkish trucks lie at the heart of the present conflict with the rival group. The Democratic Party refuses to share the revenue. The two factions formally share power in the local parliament and administration, based in Erbil.

HEADLINE: U.S. Stocks Get Caught in the Barings Downdraft

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The collapse of the British investment bank Barings P.L.C. weighed heavily on stock markets around the world yesterday, and investors' nervousness cut short some early gains on Wall Street, pulling the Dow Jones industrial average back below the 4,000-point mark.
"In the morning, the stock market wanted to show that the world's market problems were not our problem," said Bernard Spilko, senior vice president of Bank Julius Baer. "But around 2 P.M., computer selling programs kicked in and the U.S. market got caught in the downdraft that hit everywhere." 
 The Dow lost 23.17 points to close at 3,988.57, after trading up nearly 10 points early in the day. The retreat ended for now a rally that had lifted the Dow to more than 4,000 points for the first time on Thursday and to another high on Friday.
Broader market indicators also fell, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index losing 4.30 points to close at 483.96, and the Nasdaq composite index dropping 6.58 points, to 784.50.
The collapse of Barings came on Sunday after it said a trader in its Singapore office had lost hundreds of millions of dollars because of an unauthorized gamble on the direction of Japanese stock prices and interest rates. Yesterday, the losses were estimated at about $1 billion.
"This is the type of out-of-the-blue news that will create a hurdle for the market," said Alfred Goldman, an analyst for A. G. Edwards.
The Barings disclosure sent prices plunging in Tokyo yesterday, where the Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 664.24 points, or 3.8 percent. Other Asian markets also declined. But Tokyo stocks made a partial recovery today, closing up 244.73 points, or 1.5 percent, at 17,053.43. In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index fell more than 50 points when trading opened yesterday, but it later cut its losses, closing down 12.40 points at 3,025.30.
Stocks also fell sharply in Mexico, but investors there were more concerned with internal economic problems, as they awaited a tough new austerity plan promised by the Mexican Government. The leading Mexican stock index tumbled 106 points, or 6.85 percent. [Page D2.]
Still, Baring's collapse bolstered bond prices, as some investors moved money into Treasury issues as a haven in a financial crisis. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, declined to 7.47, percent from 7.52 percent on Friday.
Despite the shakiness in world markets, trading on the New York Stock Exchange was moderate, with 285.8 million shares changing hands, compared with the three-month average of 319 million. Declining issues on the Big Board outnumbered gainers, 1,608 to 632, for the first time in four sessions.
American depository receipts for shares of Japanese companies were particularly hard hit because the Barings losses stemmed largely from trading in Japanese futures contracts on the Nikkei stock index. A.D.R.'s for the Sony Corporation dropped 1 7/8, to 42 5/8; those for the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company fell 2 3/8, to 139, and those for the Kyocera Corporation slumped 2, to 129.
Transportation issues fell significantly, as the Dow Jones transportation index slipped 17 points, to 1,577.99. Among the railroads, Conrail shares were off 1 7/8, to 54; Burlington Northern down 1, to 55 3/8, and shares of the Union Pacific Corporation dropped 1/2, to 52 1/2.
Among the airlines, the UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, was off 3/4 a share, to 95; the AMR Corporation, parent of American Airlines, fell 1 1/4 a share, to 60 1/2, and Delta Air Lines was off 1/8 a share, to 57 1/4.
Many bank stocks also wound up on the down side after a recent upsurge, amid concern that the Barings failure could create similar instability here. Bankers Trust of New York closed at 62 3/4, down 3/4 a share, and J. P. Morgan closed at 63 5/8, down 1/2.
One of the biggest declines in the Dow industrials was in shares of the General Electric Company, which fell 1 1/8, to 53 5/8. The Supreme Court yesterday let a group of Philadelphia residents proceed with a lawsuit to recover environmental contamination damages against seven companies, including G.E.
The ITT Corporation dropped 3 1/4 a share, to 96 3/8, with some analysts indicating doubts about the company's heavy debt load. And Salomon fell 7/8, to 35 7/8, after it said more charges from accounting errors had been uncovered, increasing its 1994 loss to $399 million.
Some companies managed to buck the trend yesterday. Shares of the Promus Companies rose 1/2, to 35 3/8, after a bill was introduced in the Pennsylvania Legislature to legalize riverboat gambling. Those of the Boston Scientific Corporation increased 7/8, to 21 3/8, after the approval on Friday by the Federal Trade Commission of its merger with two other companies. And the Scott Paper Company advanced 1/2, to 79 3/8 a share, following its announcement of a letter of intent to sell a plant for $170 million.

HEADLINE: House Considers Bill to Impose Extensive Review Process on New Rules for Health and Safety

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
The House moved toward passing the most far-reaching piece of anti-regulatory legislation on the Republican agenda today, opening debate on a bill to make it difficult for Federal agencies to impose new rules on health, safety and the environment.
The risk-assessment bill would require a proposed regulation to survive an elaborate series of scientific studies, reviews and appeals in which its backers would have to demonstrate that it would be the most effective way to reduce risks to the public. The legislation would substitute economic calculations for health considerations as the determining factors in setting standards for toxic wastes and clean air and water. 
 Its sponsors say the procedures are needed to prevent unnecessary regulations.
"We will usher in a new era of rationality in the imposition of regulations," said Representative Robert S. Walker, Republican of Pennsylvania. "This bill will require the use of sound science and sound economic principles to determine if there is a rational basis for imposing new and costly regulations."
Opponents say that rather than streamlining the current system, the measure would entangle regulators in red tape.
"This is a fraud," said Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California. "What they in fact do in this bill is create so many hurdles to regulatory actions that Federal agencies will simply be unable to protect the public health and the environment anymore."
Endorsed by a coalition of business groups, the bill has alarmed environmentalists, labor groups, Congressional liberals and the Clinton Administration because it would override existing laws, invite litigation and let representatives of regulated industries sit on panels to review and challenge the science used in writing proposed rules.
All those objections will be raised in amendments to be offered by opponents during debate, which is scheduled to continue on Tuesday.
In an early test of Republican strength, the House rejected a Democratic effort to replace the entire bill with a less comprehensive substitute. The vote was 174 to 246.
Though the House is almost certain to approve some form of risk-assessment bill, it must first decide whether economic calculations should supersede the health-based standards set by environmental laws passed in the last 25 years. The vote on that provision, expected to occur on Tuesday, will be the clearest signal yet on how far the House is prepared to roll back a generation of environmental law.
Later in the year, Congress will vote on extending and altering statutes like the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act and the Superfund law on cleaning up toxic-waste dumps. Last week the House voted overwhelmingly to freeze most new Federal regulations, giving it time to rewrite the way rules are drafted.
As members returned for another week of voting on anti-regulatory provisions of the Republicans' Contract With America, it was not yet clear how many moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats would have second thoughts this week over how far to take the crusade, and how fast.
Twenty lawmakers last week signed a letter saying that unless the risk-assessment bill was modified, it would "fundamentally threaten more than 25 years of progress in protecting the health and welfare of the American people."
"We support taking a hard look at, and revising where warranted, existing environmental, health and safety standards," said the signers, who included both Democrats and Republicans. "But the way to do that is through a thorough statute-by-statute examination, not through an overbroad shotgun approach."
Under several existing laws, environmental standards must be set at levels adequate to protect public health, regardless of the costs to industry.
For example, when setting air-quality standards for lead, the Environmental Protection Agency determines how clean the air must be to protect people from lead poisoning, without trying to calculate whether reaching that standard is worth the cost of controlling lead emissions.
It is this kind of health-based standard that the Republicans would replace with a new test: that the benefits in reducing health risks be justified by the economic costs of complying with each rule.

HEADLINE: In Chicago, a Gang Tries to Show Political Muscle

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Alderwoman Dorothy Tillman, who rose to fame in Chicago by denouncing the strong-arm tactics of the old Democratic machine, now faces opposition from an organization of another sort: a street gang.
A group called 21st Century Vote, which has ties to Chicago's largest gang, the Black Gangster Disciples, is trying to oust Ms. Tillman, who represents the South Side neighborhoods of the Third Ward, and elect Wallace (Gator) Bradley, who has served prison time for armed robbery. 
 Mr. Bradley, 42, who contends that Ms. Tillman has "sold out" to Mayor Richard M. Daley, is not the only convicted felon in the contest, which will be decided in voting Tuesday. Tyrone Kenner, a former Alderman who went to prison for taking bribes, is also on the ballot. In all, five former convicted felons are running for aldermanic posts in Chicago.
Ms. Tillman, famous for her jaunty hats and her shake-the-rafters oratory, is favored to win re-election. But some political experts here say the race could be close.
Campaign signs for "Gator" have been plastered on walls, windows and shuttered storefronts throughout the ward, the poorest in the city. And crowds of young men huddle on street corners to pass out Mr. Bradley's campaign literature.
"Gator's got a lot of kids looking up to him," said an admirer, Troy Porter, an unemployed 33-year-old man standing on a corner. "We've given everybody else a chance. Why not Gator?"
The attacks on Ms. Tillman, who came to Chicago from her native South as a teen-ager in the 1960's to work for civil rights and was appointed to the City Council in 1985 by Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor, have confounded many political experts here.
"Gator Bradley went to jail because he was convicted of a crime; Dorothy Tillman went to jail for fighting for the civil rights of black people," said Conrad Worrill, the chairman of the Center for Inner-City Studies at Northeastern University. "We need to make a distinction between the two."
Ms. Tillman has branded Mr. Bradley a "monster created by the media" and predicted that she will easily win. In her campaign, she has sought to emphasize her ties to Mr. Washington, who died in 1987, and her background in the civil rights movement.
The election is being watched as a test of the political power of street gangs. The 21st Century group mounted a demonstration at City Hall two years ago with thousands of young men, many of them wearing the familiar colors of the Gangster Disciples.
In the City Council, Ms. Tillman has been a vocal critic of Mayor Daley, but her style has become slightly quieter in recent years. Mr. Bradley says that shows she has betrayed her constituents.
"Our community knows that when you go silent, it's because you've been bought out," he said.
Despite Mr. Bradley's contention that Ms. Tillman has joined sides with Mayor Daley, the Alderwoman has been campaigning for the challenger in the mayoral race, Joseph Gardner, who is black.
Mr. Bradley says he fostered a "peace treaty" between members of Chicago street gangs two years ago. "Gangs are not the problem; criminal behavior is the problem," he said in an interview today.
"Violence is violence. The attacks on gangs are just a way to isolate the African-American community, to put fear into people. Look at fraternities. They have hazings. They're a gang. The Police Department is a gang."
The 21st Century Vote, which has storefront offices above a beauty parlor on the South Side, has backed a candidate before. Last year the group supported Jerry Washington in his unsuccessful quest for a post in the State Legislature. Mr. Washington lost by a wide margin.
In recent years, the Black Gangster Disciples group claims to have changed its focus -- and its name, to Better Growth and Development.
But the Chicago Crime Commission is skeptical of the gang and its political arm. In a 1994 report, the commission said the board of the 21st Century Vote included "convicted drug dealers and murderers."

HEADLINE: Congressional Roundup: School Lunches;
Democrats Dig In On Grants to States

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Democrats vowed today to preserve the national school lunch program as a Federal program, and they said that Republicans would pay a political price for trying to dismantle it.
Gov. Howard Dean, Democrat of Vermont, the chairman of the National Governors' Association, and Democratic members of Congress denounced the Republican proposal to replace the lunch program with a lump-sum payment of Federal money to the states. Child nutrition, they said, is a national responsibility. 
 In their attack on this element of the Republicans' welfare legislation, the Democrats were emboldened by the recent success of efforts to preserve food stamps as a Federal program.
The House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities approved legislation last week to replace the school lunch program with a lump-sum payment, or block grant, that the states could use to run lunch programs that they would devise.
Democrats noted today that the committee chairman, Representative Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania, opposed a similar proposal by the Reagan Administration in 1982. Indeed, Mr. Goodling was the sponsor of a House resolution that said, "The Federal Government should retain primary responsibility for the child nutrition programs, and such programs should not be included in any block grant."
Representative Randy (Duke) Cunningham, Republican of California, defended the block grant proposal, saying schools could serve more meals at lower cost if they had greater control over the lunch program.
Speaking to members of the American School Food Service Association, who run school lunch programs, Mr. Cunningham also said that House Republicans were obliged to support the block grant because it was part of the Contract With America, their political manifesto in last year's elections.
"Nothing is politically right if it's morally wrong," Mr. Cunningham said. "But I'm under certain constraints on what I can and cannot do."
The Republican bill, which will probably go to the House floor next month, says that illegal aliens may not receive school meals subsidized by the Federal Government.
Woodrow Wiedenhoeft, assistant superintendent of schools in La Crosse, Wis., asked Mr. Cunningham: "How do we find out if a 5-year-old or a 7-year-old is an illegal alien? How do you tell him he won't eat today?"
Mr. Cunningham replied that he did not expect educators to "root out" illegal immigrants.
The American Public Welfare Association, representing state and local government welfare officials, criticized other elements of the Republican welfare bill, like the denial of cash assistance to legal immigrants.
These officials also objected to provisions specifying how a state may or may not use its share of a new Federal block grant to assist poor people.
For example, they said, states should be free to decide whether to pay benefits to unmarried mothers under the age of 18. The House Republican bill would prohibit the use of Federal money to provide cash assistance to children born out of wedlock to women under 18, and it would also deny benefits to their mothers.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Gain, Our Loss

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Still the Right Deal for Mexico" (editorial, Feb. 24) says it all. The bailout package is a good deal for Mexico and absurd for the people of the United States. Can anyone seriously believe that Mexico will surrender its oil revenues in case of a loan default? 
 When our government is slashing spending, even considering letting poor children go hungry in the schools, the bailout agreements seem almost obscene. The North American Free Trade Agreement is costing the United States thousands of jobs and should be rescinded.
The bailout is likely to result in $20 billion lost. How many school lunches would $20 billion buy?
Mexico is not a ward of the United States. It should take responsibility for its own people and actions.

HEADLINE: THE COLLAPSE OF BARINGS;
Men Who Shook the Foundations

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
Barings P.L.C. is not the first institution to be shaken by a single, aggressive trader. In recent years, banks, securities firms and even county governments have suffered billions of dollars in losses all attributed to bad judgment -- or misfeasance - by one employee.
 
Nicholas W. Leeson -- A 28-year-old trader from the Singapore office of Barings, has been accused of making trades that have led to at least $950 million in losses, causing the collapse of the venerable British investment bank.
Mr. Leeson used futures contracts to bet heavily that the Japanese stock market would stay level. When the earthquake in Kobe caused the market to tumble instead, Mr. Leeson tried doubling up his bets, only to sustain further losses. Mr. Leeson disappeared last week, and is now being sought by authorities.
 
Victor Gomez -- Another trader felled by the overseas markets. In January, when Chemical Bank announced that it had suffered $70 million in losses in trading Mexican pesos, the bank blamed a trader, which people close to the bank identified as Mr. Gomez, a vice president in its foreign exchange group. The bank said the trader had loaded up on more pesos than he was authorized to purchase. Those holdings suffered staggering losses after the sudden devaluation of the peso on Dec. 20 and its subsequent further fall.
 
Robert L. Citron -- As the treasurer of Orange County, Mr. Citron won plenty of fans for his aggressive and daring financial style that produced hefty profits for the county investment pool. But the fund was borrowing heavily to speculate on interest rates staying low or declining. As the rates rose last year, Mr. Citron's trading strategy collapsed in disaster. Losses reached into the billions, and Orange County filed for bankruptcy.
Now, Mr. Citron is out of a job. But the fault for the catastrophe does not lie with him, he has said. After 24 years of trading billions of dollars in the county fund, Mr. Citron said he was an unsophisticated investor. The fault, he said, lay with his brokers at Merrill Lynch & Company.
 
Joseph Jett -- The former chief Government bond trader at Kidder Peabody & Company was celebrated by the firm for his profit-making ability. Then, in April 1994, Kidder made a stunning announcement: Mr. Jett's profits were all a fraud. The firm said that, by using an accounting loophole, Mr. Jett manufactured phony bond trading profits totaling $350 million. In truth, Mr. Jett's real trading had lost $100 million, the firm said. The phantom profits not only improved the performance of Mr. Jett's Government trading desk, but brought him a $9 million bonus in 1993. Mr. Jett has denied any wrongdoing.
Earlier this year, Mr. Jett was notified that the enforcement staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission had recommended civil charges against him. Kidder, Peabody, which at the time was a subsidiary of the General Electric Company, has since been sold to the Paine Webber Group.
 
Paul W. Mozer -- The former head of the Government trading desk at Salomon Brothers, Mr. Mozer had the reputation of being the most aggressive trader in the business. In 1991, when the Government imposed rules limiting the amount of securities that a single dealer could purchase in a Treasury auction, Mr. Mozer elected to side step the rules. Using the names of Salomon customers who had not authorized any purchases, he submitted false bids in a number of Treasury auctions. Using the other names allowed Mr. Mozer to purchase far more of the Treasury securities than he was allowed.
The scheme was disclosed by the firm in August 1991, and Mr. Mozer was dismissed. Salomon's senior management, including John H. Gutfreund, then the chairman, was forced to resign. The firm ultimately paid a $290 million fine. Mr. Mozer was sentenced to four months in prison and was banned from the industry for life.
 
Howard A. Rubin -- The former head of mortgage securities trading at Merrill Lynch , Mr. Rubin was accused by the firm of causing a $377 million loss in 1987. The firm said that Mr. Rubin failed to disclose that he had taken a $500 million position in a risky form of mortgage-backed securities called "principal only," while selling the corresponding "interest only" to Merrill clients. The firm said that they had instructed Mr. Rubin not to take such positions, and only learned of it when the losses were mounting.
In 1990, the S.E.C. suspended Mr. Rubin from the industry for nine months. Merrill Lynch responded to the crisis by establishing a risk management group that reports directly to the firm's senior management, rather than through the trading managers. KURT EICHENWALD

HEADLINE: Mexican Market Dives Nearly 7%

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 27

 BODY:
Mexico's stock market suffered its worst percentage loss of the year today, and the peso again drifted lower, as investors continued to await a tough new austerity plan promised by the Mexican Government.
There was also dark news from Banamex, the blue-chip Mexican bank, which announced that it was letting go up to 35 percent of its 33,000 employees. Investors fear it could signal the beginning of a wave of layoffs by other banks and many businesses crippled by the country's economic crisis. 
 The Mexican stock exchange tumbled 106 points, or 6.85 percent, today, the steepest percentage decline among many in this troubled year. It crashed through the psychologically important 1,500 barrier to close at 1,447.52, its lowest level since October 1992.
"We're trying to remain reasonably calm and rational, but this was the kind of day that is really hard to explain on a rational basis," said Geoffrey E. J. Dennis, director of emerging markets equity for Bear, Stearns & Company in New York.
Since Mexico signed an agreement in Washington last Tuesday in which the United States agreed to provide $ 20 billion in loans and loan guarantees to help Mexico with its most pressing problem of paying off maturing Government debt, investors have continued to flee the Mexican stock market.
The harsh terms of the assistance package -- soaring interest rates and harsher Government austerity -- are expected to hit Mexican businesses hard.
On Jan. 3, President Ernesto Zedillo announced an agreement with business and labor groups to contain prices and wages in an effort to moderate the inflationary effect of last December's peso devaluation.
Government officials have conceded that their original recovery plan has not worked as was intended, and they are preparing a new, tougher plan to raise taxes and cut Government spending. Some investors had expected an announcement on Sunday or today, but all that came from the Government today was a statement from the Ministry of Labor that negotiations were continuing.
"There's complete pessimism all around," said Gene Frieda, an analyst at NatWest Analysis in Washington. "People are looking for a new agreement, and no one is willing to sign on to anything until it happens."
One Government official said today that the financial markets' continuing slide made it clear that the new agreement would have to be announced within the next few days. "The trouble we saw in the markets today is the best sign that something has to be done, and soon," the official said.
Along with the growing uncertainty surrounding a new economic plan, the collapse on Sunday of the British investment bank Barings P.L.C., a major player in Latin America's emerging markets, also rocked the Mexican market.
Another negative factor was an allegation over the weekend by Mexican officials that a second gunman took part in last year's assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate from the Institutional Revolutionary Party. The suspect has been linked to the ruling party itself.
Analysts said all those factors combined to foment deep uncertainty among the investors remaining in the Mexican stock market.
Such doubts also took their toll today on the peso, which at one point broke through the exchange rate of six pesos to the dollar before settling back to close at 5.945. On Friday, the peso was trading at 5.875 to the dollar.
At today's rate of 5.945 to the dollar, the peso has dropped almost 42 percent since being devalued in December, and it is now worth less than 17 cents.
Many investors and analysts found Banamex's layoffs worrisome. While all of Mexico's private banks are struggling, it was believed that the largest banks had sufficient resources to survive.
During the day, there was also speculation -- denied by the Finance Ministry -- that Mexico's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, would leave office.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 3, 1995, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about a plunge on Mexico's stock market on Monday misstated the size of job cutbacks planned by Banamex, a Mexican banking company. It plans to cut payroll costs, not its work force, by as much as 35 percent. The company expects to reduce its staff of 32,500 employees by about 10 percent by the end of the year through attrition and severance payments.
