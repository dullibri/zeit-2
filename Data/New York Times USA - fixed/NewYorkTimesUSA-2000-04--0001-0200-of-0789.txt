HEADLINE: Africa Trade Bill

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman's March 28 column mentions studies showing that an Africa trade bill stalled in Congress would "create jobs in Africa and scarcely affect employment here." But analysis exposes the two leading studies as fatally flawed. 
 An International Trade Commission report asserts that granting the 48 sub-Saharan African countries free access to the United States market would displace fewer than 1,000 American jobs. The commission assumed that the trade bill would generate no new capital investment in Africa. But without new factories, few new African exports can be created. The American job loss would be minimal -- as would African job gain.
The Congressional Budget Office has observed that whatever the new bill's provisions, most African apparel and textile shipments will by law have to be deemed "import sensitive," and therefore subjected to standard tariffs. So the bill is really a Catch-22.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Surges As Growth in Incomes Slows

BYLINE: NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com 

 BODY:
Consumer spending surged in February, even though income growth slowed, government data showed yesterday.
Two other reports showed strength in factory production. Together, the data indicated that the five interest rate increases over the last 10 months had done little to slow the economy. 
 The Commerce Department said personal spending rose 1 percent in February, after rising a revised 0.6 percent in January. The gain was more than twice the 0.4 percent rate of income growth in February, a slowing from January's 0.7 percent rate of income growth. The savings rate, the amount of income left after spending, fell to 0.8 percent in February -- its lowest level since the government started keeping records on savings rates in 1959.
Alternative forms of income, like stock gains and increases in home prices, are not factored into the savings rate, but economists say a low savings rate is a worrisome sign that consumers are still willing to spend more than their income allows.
The pace of manufacturing, meanwhile, is also picking up. A survey of March manufacturing activity in the industry-heavy Chicago area showed that factories were busy, with higher production rates, even as rising costs for energy and raw materials continued to accelerate. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago index rose to 57.4 in March, compared with 56.7 in February. (Numbers above 50 denote economic growth.)
Another report on factory orders, from the Federal Reserve, showed a decline of 0.8 percent in February -- the second consecutive monthly decline. But the bulk of the decline came in the volatile transportation sector, which reflected a drop in airplane orders. Excluding transportation, factory orders rose 0.5 percent in February, reversing a drop in January.
Joe Lavorgna, senior United States economist with Deutsche Bank, said the first-quarter data indicated an annual growth rate of 5.8 percent. "There is little doubt that domestic demand this quarter is as strong as it was last quarter," he said.
But he also noted that there would be drags on first-quarter growth because growth in business inventories eased and the United States trade deficit continued to widen.

HEADLINE: Security Council Votes to Let Iraq Buy Oil Gear

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 31

 BODY:
The Security Council voted unanimously today to allow Iraq to import $1.2 billion in spare parts and other equipment this year for its ramshackle oil industry, so that more oil can be pumped efficiently and safely to pay for civilian goods and public service projects.
At the same time, the council's Iraqi sanctions committee completed work on four lists -- of food, pharmaceuticals, educational material and agricultural equipment -- that Iraq will be permitted to purchase without a committee review, although United Nations officials will oversee and approve the purchases. 
 Since December, Iraq has been allowed to sell unlimited quantities of oil, although earnings are monitored and expenditures controlled through a United Nations escrow account. A third of the profits -- $20 billion since 1996 -- goes to pay claims arising from Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which led to international sanctions against President Saddam Hussein.
The resolution today, introduced last week by the United States, increases, to $600 million from $300 million, what Iraq can spend on oil equipment in the six-month period that ends in June. The vote also covers retroactively the six-month period that ended in December. The council all but promised to keep the higher level in future six-month reviews.
Secretary General Kofi Annan has been pressing for a higher ceiling on buying equipment since last year. In a report on March 10, he said Iraqi oil fields, which still use 1980's machinery, could not sustain the rate of pumping reached last fall, when production hit three million barrels a day.
The United Nations is moving to increase oil production as the United States presses other oil-producing nations to raise output, to try to reduce the prices of gasoline and heating oil. But Western diplomats said there was no direct connection, because upgrading Iraq's oil industry has been an issue for many months.
Iraq had been pushing up its capacity before oil prices began to rise late last year.
The four lists of civilian goods no longer subject to scrutiny by the sanctions committee include not only food, but also soap, packaging and storage materials. In the education category, the list of 137 items include classroom furniture, printing equipment, paper for textbooks, photocopying and duplicating machinery, sports equipment and clothing, musical instruments, and audio-visual aids.
The medical list runs to about 50 pages of specific pharmaceuticals, plus a variety of supplies for baby and child care and equipment for hospitals like sheets, radiology film, surgical goods and anesthesiology equipment.
As Iraq has begun raising larger sums for goods to relieve citizens' hardships, relief organizations have asked Mr. Annan to look at longer-term development projects in Iraq. United Nations officials and diplomats are divided on the issue, with some saying planning wider social programs to be paid for by oil money should be Iraq's job, not theirs.
Mr. Annan told the council this month that the "oil for food" program was never meant to be a full development program for Iraq, but only a supplement to the government's own resources and expenditures.
Western diplomats most critical of Mr. Hussein say the Iraqi government has billions of dollars, much of it earned through smuggling and black-market activities, that it chooses not to spend on public projects that would alleviate hardship and improve health and sanitation. Relief officials say that is not an excuse for denying Iraqis many basic needs or for isolating them indefinitely.
Under current Security Council resolutions, sanctions on Iraq cannot be lifted until it can be certified free of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles to deliver them. A new arms inspection system is now being created for Iraq. Its chief inspector, Hans Blix of Sweden, is to present his management plan for the new system in the middle of April.
At that point, he will have to go to Baghdad to begin compiling a list of unanswered questions and uninspected sites, which the Iraqis will have to deal with if they want to be declared disarmed. Mr. Hussein's government has given no indication they will allow him to visit.

HEADLINE: Cutting Crime, Keeping Our Rights

 BODY:
The police shootings of Amadou Diallo and Patrick Dorismond exposed a seemingly intractable problem. How can police aggressively keep guns and drugs off the street, while respecting the civil rights of citizens? The Op-Ed Page asked a few experts.
H. Richard Uviller is a law professor at Columbia University. 
 I'm for gun control of all kinds. But even the most comprehensive program will make little difference in our high rate of gun violence. Guns used in crime are rarely licensed.
The only way to reduce gun crime is to go after the unlawful guns secretly carried by dangerous people. And the only way to do that is for police to approach suspicious people, to expand traffic stops to include a search for guns and yes, even to stop cars and people, lawfully, as a pretext for a gun frisk. The Supreme Court has said such stops are constitutional. True, the court recently (and unfortunately) held that the unverified tip from an anonymous informer does not justify a stop and frisk, even where the information is that a described person is carrying a gun. But all that means to a resourceful cop is that the tip will be verified by some other suspicious circumstance.
Aggressive street patrol is the most effective strategy for illegal handgun interdiction. But "aggressive" does not mean brutal or abusive, much less murderous. Officers assigned to these gun runs must be carefully selected and rigorously trained. It's not the only way to reduce violence, but it is a critical component of any sane policy.
Geoffrey Canada is president of the Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families.
I would start with more training and better screening of undercover police officers. And then I would insist that all undercover officers wear a wireless microphone that records all verbal exchanges with suspected criminals. The recordings should be made not only of the officer doing the buy or bust, but of the back-up officers as well. This tape should be a permanent part of the arrest record and should be reviewed by superior officers routinely.
These tapes would give answers to potentially important questions. How were suspects approached? What verbal exchanges occurred? What did back-up officers say (or not say) to suspects? The tapes could point police superiors to undercover officers who were inappropriate, overzealous or racist. They would also provide many training opportunities for officers and important, albeit incomplete, information to the public about why officers used deadly force.
Frank Serpico is the former New York City police detective who testified about police corruption in the 1970's.
We can have a safe society where the civil rights of individual citizens are not capriciously violated. What can be done?
* The mayor must reverse his vetoes of an independent audit board on police misconduct.
* There must be better psychological screening of recruits to ensure that they are the type of people that we want maintaining order and protecting our streets.
* There must be better training of recruits and instructors in the academies, which includes training in psychology, ethics and specialized combat.
* The rule that allows police officers involved in shootings to take 48 hours before they tell their story must be abolished.
* Minority representation in the police department must be increased.
* The office of the special prosecutor that was created as a result of the Knapp Commission hearings was disbanded in the 80's as no longer necessary. We need to reappoint a special prosecutor now to look into matters of police misconduct.
* There must be an end to selective enforcement of drug and weapons violations.
* We must have a mayor and police commissioner who have a greater respect for the racial, economic and cultural diversity of the citizens of New York.
Mathea Falco, president of Drug Strategies, a nonprofit research institute, was assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters in the Carter administration.
The fatal police shooting of Patrick Dorismond shows once again that we cannot arrest our way out of our drug problems. Using undercover officers to approach apparently law-abiding citizens and to try to entrap them in a crime completely distorts law enforcement's legitimate goal of making communities safer.
Although politicians like "street sweeps" for their public relations value, these sweeps do not have any lasting impact and too often violate individual rights and increase distrust of the police. But as numerous studies have shown, sustained community policing -- in which officers work closely with neighborhood residents -- can drive out street dealers.
Patrick J. Lynch is president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
Keeping one's balance between effective policing and showing the proper respect for your fellow New Yorkers takes a skilled acrobatic performance. But that tightrope stretches precariously when cops are feeling cheated by their contract, criticized by the community, used by the politicians and pressured by their bosses.
The notion that our cops are trigger-happy or out of control is unsupported by facts or statistics. But you can't counter this misconception unless you communicate with the community.
The pressure to produce numbers is a flawed approach to law enforcement. Quality of arrests is more important than quantity. Officers are not unwilling to go after the low-level criminal, but these arrests shouldn't simply satisfy a production schedule or risk lives. So to restore lost faith, we must tone down the politics, turn up the dialogue, do away with quotas and pay cops a living wage.
Richard E. Green is head of the Crown Heights Youth Collective in Brooklyn.
Yes, the police need to change tactics. But the community must also be ready to de-escalate the "scold" war it has conducted against the police and the Giuliani administration, and show the same level of moral indignation when young people lose their lives at the hands of one another. Since the shooting of Amadou Diallo, I have known four young people who have lost their lives due to violence.
The clergy, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, police officers and community leaders must come together to develop solutions. Our community leaders should consider patrolling their own schools (which is done in Philadelphia) and setting voluntary curfews for our youth. To make our communities safe, we must stop maligning all officers and start working with them.
George L. Kelling is the co-author of "Fixing Broken Windows: Restoring Order and Reducing Crime in Our Communities."
Aside from the underlying political fight, two important policing issues are raised by the recent shootings.
Special units, such as the street crimes unit and anti-drug operations like Operation Condor, can be effective tools, but they can also be troublesome and potentially dangerous. While special units have been important ingredients in the Police Department's crime-reduction efforts, they tend to be remote from neighborhoods and communities.
The second issue is police planning. Police increasingly rely on analysis of crime data, mapping and other methods to develop tactics for addressing specific problems. When they discover that guns are the primary instruments of murder in black neighborhoods, is it racial profiling or smart policing to target anti-gun efforts there?
Resolutions to these issues are possible, but not easy. They involve balancing individual rights with community interests, effectiveness with costs, and the tradeoffs among important values. Getting out of the current political mess, however, is the first step. Police and neighborhood leaders will have to seek each other out aggressively and honestly. Then, they can get back to the business of improving policing.

HEADLINE: Farmers Are Scaling Back Genetically Altered Crops

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 31

 BODY:
For the first time since 1996, American farmers expect to plant fewer acres with genetically engineered crops, largely because of concerns about selling those crops in international markets, the government said today.
According to a study released by the United States Department of Agriculture, farmers said they would plant more acres of corn and soybeans, the nation's two biggest crops, in the coming planting season but that a smaller part of their acreage would be devoted to genetically engineered varieties. The survey showed, for instance, that biotech corn plantings could be down 24 percent from a year ago and soybeans could be down 9 percent. 
 The nation's largest seed companies disputed the figures, saying that the use of genetically altered seeds in the United States was expected to be flat or up just slightly this year.
"What we know is what our invoices are telling us and that is, on a percent basis we're very similar to last year," said Doyle Karr, a spokesman at Pioneer Hi-Bred, the nation's largest seed company, and a division of DuPont.
Whether or not American farmers are planting genetically altered seeds, of course, is of major importance to the nation's largest biotechnology and food companies, many of which have invested billions of dollars in the technology, and watched the use of the biotech seeds grow tremendously over the past four years, to 62 million acres a year ago from 3 million acres in 1996.
Officials at the Department of Agriculture say the decline they expect in biotechnology acreage, the first since widespread planting of such crops began 1996, was probably due to the growing debate, particularly in Europe and Asia, over the use of the seeds to fight pests or protect crops against weeds.
Environmental groups say the crops were improperly tested and are potentially dangerous to the environment and humans. And major food companies like Frito-Lay, a division of Pepsico say that because of consumer uncertainty they have decided to avoid such crops.
The Agriculture Department study, a survey of thousands of American farmers conducted in early March, showed that farmers expect to plant 25 percent of their corn fields with genetically engineered seeds this year, down from 33 percent a year ago. They also expect to plant biotech seeds on 52 percent of their soybean fields, down from 57 percent a year ago.
Keith Collins, the department's chief economist, said biotech acres "look like they're down a little bit, but they haven't fallen off the table."
"Farmers have asked if they plant biotech will they have a market," Mr. Collins said. "Questions have been raised about the international market. But it doesn't look like farmers are fleeing biotech either."
Mr. Collins said some of the survey's numbers ought to be tempered, however, because while the study showed a drop in the percentage of cotton planted with biotech seeds, it failed to take into account that cotton acreage had risen sharply from a year ago. The survey may have also overstated the decline in biotech acreage devoted to soybeans because of possible miscounting a year ago, he said.
Indeed, the major seed companies say sales are expected to be up slightly this year. Officials at Monsanto said they recently found indications of a small increase after contacting companies that license their technology.
"We don't see a decline," said Carl Casale, a spokesman for Monsanto in St. Louis. "We see a market that is at least what it was last year if not better."
Several seed company executives, including Anthony Minnichsoffer, a spokesman at Novartis Seeds, say they expect less so-called Bt corn, a seed that releases its own insecticide to fight off the European corn borer, because there have been fewer problems with the pest, but otherwise sales of biotechnology products are stable.
"It doesn't look like it's changed significantly, maybe one or two percentage points up or down," Mr. Minnichsoffer said.
But farming organizations back up the Agriculture Department's predictions. The American Corn Growers Association said a survey it conducted in February showed that biotechnology plantings were expected to be down as much as 16 percent. And an informal survey conducted this month by the National Corn Growers Association found that 175 farmers from 23 states showed a 20 percent decline in plans to plant biotech corn this year.
Rod Weinzierl, executive director of the Illinois Corn Growers Association, said that in parts of the state, biotech corn plantings were expected to drop as much as 50 percent, largely because farmers fear that exports to Asia could dwindle.
Some farmers are also complaining about a shortage of nonbiotechnology seeds for the planting season, which is just getting under way.
They say that some of the big seed companies have not been able to deliver the traditional seeds they are asking for and in several cases have offered discounts on biotech seeds, suggesting that there is either an oversupply of biotech seeds or a shortage of traditional seeds.
"There's probably more of a shortage this year because there were probably more people who wanted to use" varieties that are not genetically modified, said Stanley Blunier, a corn and soybean farmer in Forest, Ill. "If it's not a shortage, it's tight."
Mr. Blunier, 48, is planting about 50 percent of his soybean fields with biotech seeds and about 70 percent of his corn fields with biotech seeds, a slight increase in biotech acreage from a year ago, largely because he has assurances that he can sell his biotech crops, he said.

HEADLINE: Albright Drops Objection to Loan Deal for Russia Oil Company

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today that she had dropped her objections to $500 million in loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank to a Russian oil company that had been accused of fraud.
The company, Tyumen, wants to spend $292 million to hire a Houston company, Haliburton, to rehabilitate an oil field in western Siberia, and $198 million for ABB Lummus Global, of Bloomfield, N.J., to modernize a refinery near Moscow. 
 The chairman of the United States Export-Import Bank, James A. Harmon, said in a statement today that the bank's board would "take up this matter at the earliest possible opportunity."
The bank had been close to approving the guarantees when Dr. Albright intervened on Dec. 22. At that point, the company had been accused of fraud in its dealings with BP Amoco, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and George Soros, the investor, over the bankruptcy of another oil company, Chernogorneft. All were investors or creditors in Chernogorneft.
A senior State Department official said tonight that negotiations between BP Amoco and Tyumen were sufficiently advanced that the loan guarantees should be issued.
"Our view is, it is back on a mode where people are talking to each other in a normal commercial way," the official said. "Waiting longer risks having us drawn into the details of these commercial disputes in a way that really isn't appropriate."
James B. Foley, a State Department spokesman, said today that since December, the Clinton administration "has been engaged in an extensive review of the concerns and allegations that were raised in this case."
Tyumen has been privatized, he pointed out, and "we have also opened a dialogue with the Russian government to impress upon them the need to address weaknesses in Russia's legal framework that led to the abuses in this case."
Dr. Albright blocked the loan guarantees during a time of heavy fighting in Chechnya, but State Department officials have said her action was not related to Russia's use of force in crushing the rebellion there.
Tyumen's president and chief executive, Simon Kukes, said in a statement: "These loan guarantees will create thousands of jobs in the United States and Russia and enable significant cooperation with Western partners on technical and managerial levels."
An American spokesman for the Tyumen, Rory Davenport, said the State Department's reversal was a confirmation of the business practices of Tyumen's leaders, "and saying that they have a good business plan and a good potential for growth."
"It's kind of like a seal of endorsement," he said. "It will allow them to attract more Western partners, more Western financing. That's very, very important."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Nasdaq Posts Its First Gain Of the Week

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Technology stocks remained the market victors in the first quarter, but old standbys like Intel seemed to be eclipsing Internet darlings by the end.
In an appropriately discordant finish to a wild and crazy quarter, major market indexes moved in opposite directions once again yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average was up solidly for most of the session, but reversed course late in the day to close at 10,921.92, down 58.33 points, or 0.5 percent. Computer programs related to end-of-quarter portfolio shuffling were cited by market participants. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index posted solid gains. The S.& P. rose 10.66 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,498.58. And the technology-laden Nasdaq rallied for the first time this week, gaining 114.94 points, or 2.6 percent, to 4,572.83.
The session closed the books on a volatile quarter in which technology stocks were widely expected to return to earth. In fact, the Nasdaq composite index experienced four declines of 10 percent or more in the first quarter, but rebounded each time.
Value stocks, generally old-economy companies whose shares look relatively cheap, were expected to reassert themselves. That, too, happened, but only briefly. And some of those stocks were pounded as investors proved unmerciful toward companies with bad news.
"Because of the inconsistencies in the market, it was one of the most difficult quarters in my memory," said Laszlo Birinyi, who has a stock market research firm in Greenwich, Conn. "And I think this will continue. There is too much information and too many uninformed investors."
Among industry groups, electronics-related stocks -- from instruments to semiconductors -- did extremely well. As the week ended, Internet concerns that provide services to both consumers and businesses showed weakness, while investors flocked to technology companies with proven earnings, companies like Intel and Cisco. Natural gas stocks posted big gains in the quarter, and so did oil and gas drillers.
But it was a very bad period for hotel and motel operators, engineering and construction stocks and life insurance companies.
Led by energy, technology and health care (otherwise known as biotechnology), small stocks fared well. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-cap issues finished the quarter at 539.09, up 6.8 percent.
The quarter started badly for all sectors of the market, but particularly for the 30 stocks that make up the Dow: at one point the index was down more than 13 percent.
The blue-chip index rallied as long-term interest rates began to ease even as short-term rates climbed. The Dow did particularly well last month, rising 7.8 percent. Still, it is down 5 percent for the year.
The S.& P. 500, which was down for much of the quarter, is now up 2 percent for the year, thanks to a 9.7 percent gain in March. In fact, the month just ended was the best for the index since December 1991.
And the Nasdaq composite, which fell 7.9 percent last week and was down 2.6 percent for March, nevertheless closed out the quarter 12.4 percent above its year-end mark.
At the quarter's end, even the most optimistic market analysts acknowledged that technology stocks remain overpriced after their recent dips.
"There is no question that technology got ahead of itself on valuation," said Jeffrey Applegate, chief market strategist at Lehman Brothers. "And if we got overvalued in technology, chances are we will have to get undervalued as well. That is particularly true for the Internet stocks."
Business-to-business stocks suffered yesterday amid concerns about companies banding together to create their own buying groups on the Internet.
For the first quarter, technology stocks were the walkaway winners. The list starts with Intel, the world's biggest chip maker and a component of the Dow, the S.& P. and the Nasdaq composite. The stock was the best performer on the Dow, gaining more than 61 percent.
Strong as it was, that performance badly lagged that of the biggest gainers in the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq. The top New York Stock Exchange gainer was Avista, which rose 164 percent, while Safety-Kleen was the top loser, down 89 percent.
Scientific Atlanta, an S.& P. component and the No. 5 gainer on the Big Board, rose 126 percent. LSI Logic was up 116 percent. Neturgy Networks, the top Nasdaq gainer, rose 478.1 percent, while Superior National Insurance, the Nasdaq's biggest loser, slid 79 percent.
There were several notable flame-outs, particularly among well-established names. The foremost was Procter & Gamble, which makes everything from Pampers to Crest to Tide. Investors battered the shares last month after the company gave a surprisingly downbeat projection on earnings for the balance of its fiscal year. The day of the announcement P.& G. lost one-third of its market capitalization. For the quarter, the stock was down 48.4 percent.
Other big names in the Dow that fared poorly were Johnson & Johnson, the maker of Band-Aid bandages, baby care products and Tylenol pain reliever, which fell 24.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange; and International Paper, which fell 23.8 percent.
Despite the big fluctuations and concerns about technology stocks, analysts said overall stock fundamentals remained solid.
"The equity outlook is good," said Byron Wien, United States equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "Technology and telecommunications stocks are too frothy, but at the same time the companies are doing fabulously. The question is to watch out for the stocks that get ahead of themselves."
Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, predicted that the second quarter would be much like the first, as investors seek out the likely winners among technology stocks.

Good Period for Treasuries
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices rounded out the best first quarter in more than a decade as a 7.9 percent decline in the Nasdaq composite index this week made fixed-income securities more attractive to some investors.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 20/32 yesterday, to 105 29/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.83 percent from 5.87 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Hey, Rudy G.: Bring Back The Sopranos

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
FOR a devotee of the "Godfather" movies, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani made a shocking gaffe during this year's State of the City address. It came right after he described his crusades against organized crime at the Fulton Fish Market and the carting industry.
"We've reduced the influence of the Mafia so much," Mr. Giuliani boasted, "now when they do mob shows, they don't even set them in New York any more. They put them in New Jersey. They do 'The Sopranos' in New Jersey." 
 This is something to celebrate? Ordinarily city officials try desperately to keep industries from crossing the river, especially the ones deemed integral to New York's image. Television networks and film companies get tax exemptions and other favors because they generate publicity that lures tourists here.
But now millions of television viewers are gazing at the wonders of New Jersey. Soon busloads of tourists will be admiring the swamps below the Pulaski Skyway, and only veteran New Yorkers will remember the mob hits at Umberto's Clam House and Sparks Steakhouse. The executions in the next "Godfather" movie could take place at the Applebee's in Livingston Mall.
How can New York regain its status as the capital of organized crime? The obvious answer is to make Tony Soprano a relocation offer he can't refuse. The official term is an Inducement Resolution, which is a package of benefits from the city's Industrial Development Agency for companies demanding a bribe to come in from the suburbs.
"A deal with the Sopranos would require some creativity," said one lawyer who has negotiated many such deals with the city (and who insisted on anonymity to avoid offending either the mayor or the mob). "Typically the city offers a company exemptions from sales tax, but that won't be very helpful because the Sopranos usually don't pay sales tax anyway."
Fortunately, the city has a history of creative corporate welfare, so there are precedents to draw on for a Soprano aid package. By borrowing the language from past deals for media companies, banks and insurance firms, it's simple enough to fill out the paperwork for the Industrial Development Agency:
Applicant: Soprano Family Enterprises ("Sopranos").
Employment: 3,782 jobs.
Type of business: Waste management, trucking, adult entertainment, commercial construction, corporate security, home-appliance sales, used-automobile exporting, commercial lending, miscellaneous personal financial services.
Net revenues for last fiscal year: "Substantial" (F.B.I.).
I.D.A. Benefits: $250 million in low-interest bonds for purchase in Staten Island of residences, including home offices, for relocated Sopranos executives. One three-acre industrial site in Brooklyn, to be sold for $1 and granted adult-entertainment zoning waiver allowing operation of Bada Bing dancing establishment. Seven city-owned lots, currently unoccupied, adjacent to Belt Parkway and Gowanus Canal, to be leased for 99 years at no cost, for miscellaneous storage purposes.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION. Sopranos, a privately held company, is willing to consolidate and expand its operations by relocating to New York City. In return for benefits, the chief executive, Anthony Soprano, guarantees to keep 100 jobs in the city for a period of either 15 years or "as long as I'm boss."
F.B.I. analysts project that Sopranos' relocation would add 900 jobs to the city's garment, carting and construction industries. Adverse environmental impacts -- e.g., increased traffic congestion at rush hour -- are expected to be negligible due to unique nature of these "no-show" jobs.
Economic analysts calculate that the "multiplier effect" of these activities will be an additional 2,782 jobs. Some will be in related service industries like ammunition sales, emergency medical care, mortuary services, floral sales.
The remainder will be created by the indirect economic stimulus of Sopranos' activities, like the increased demand for new automobiles due to export operations. Assuming a rate of .6 gangland slayings per year, tourist visits to murder sites are projected to create 47 jobs.
Recommendation: New York City has an unusual opportunity to revive an industry weakened by an exodus of leaders to out-of-state correctional institutions. At a small cost per job, the city can stimulate its economy and assure its prominence in future installments of "The Godfather." I.D.A. staff urges prompt approval by sundown today.

Group Led by AT&T Invests In Web Phone Call Provider
AT&T, British Telecommunications and Liberty Media Group are making a $1.4 billion cash investment in Net2Phone, an Internet telephone services provider. The deal is the latest in a series of moves by AT&T to strengthen its Internet presence.
Net2Phone, which handles about 40 percent of calls routed over the Internet, said separately that it had sold a minority stake to the Internet search engine Yahoo through a stock swap valued at $150 million. Page C2. 

Web Auctioneers to Set Safeguards
The Consumer Product Safety Commission said that two of the biggest Internet auction sites had agreed to new safeguards to protect people from buying dangerous second-hand products on the Web. The agency said the auction sites, eBay and Amazon.com Auctions, had agreed to links with the commission's site to warn buyers and sellers about products that had been deemed hazardous, or in some instances even outlawed. A7.
 
Engineered Crop Planting to Decline
An Agriculture Department survey says American farmers expect to plant a smaller percentage of their acreage with genetically engineered crops this year for the first time since 1996. But the farmers say they plan to increase total acreage and seed companies say total sales of genetically engineered seeds has not declined this year. A6.
 
Consumer Spending Rose 1 Percent
Consumer spending rose 1 percent in February, while income growth slowed to 0.4 percent, and the savings rate fell to its lowest level since the government began keeping records in 1959. Factory orders fell 0.8 percent in February, the second consecutive decrease. C2.
 
Japanese Unemployment at Record
The number of Japanese workers looking for jobs climbed to 4.9 percent in February, a record high, as bankruptcies rose and companies trimmed jobs in the aftermath of an economic downturn last fall and winter. C2.
 
Environmental Coffee Rules Studied
Sales of coffee that meet the tastes of gourmets and a variety of environmental standards have exploded recently. The members of the North American Free Trade Agreement have assembled a team of 100 representatives of coffee roasters and importers to begin standardizing the criteria under which coffee can be certified as having been grown in conditions that are good for health, the environment and workers. Above are freshly picked coffee beans ripe for roasting. C2.
 
Bank of New York Cuts Chief's Pay
The Bank of New York said that it had paid its chairman and chief executive, Thomas Renyi, less last year than in 1998 because of the bank's role in a Russian money-laundering scandal. His total compensation fell to about $6.75 million from $7.55 million. C16.
 
Cable Rights Negotiations Extended
ABC and Time Warner Cable have agreed to another extension of negotiations in their dispute over rights for Time Warner to carry ABC's stations over its cable systems. The two companies have been at odds over how Time Warner will compensate ABC for continuing to retransmit ABC's stations. C16.
 
Shares of Drkoop.com Plummet
Shares of the Internet health company Drkoop.com plunged more than 40 percent after its accountant said Drkoop has lost money since it started and might not survive. C3.
 
Financier Gets 10-Year Sentence
Financier Mario Conde, who symbolized Spain's get-rich-quick boom in the 1980's, was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison for his role in the $2 billion failure of the country's biggest bank. C2.

THE REPUBLICANS
 
KEYES ON THE TRAIL -- Still pursuing his Republican presidential bid, Alan Keyes told Wisconsin voters this week that Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic nominee, has a "pretty good chance" of winning the election. Mr. Keyes said Mr. Gore would benefit from "economic prosperity and peace" in a race against the presumed Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Mr. Keyes, who spoke to voters at the Monroe County Fairgrounds, said Republicans needed to promote moral values and oppose abortion, which he called worse than slavery. Dirk Johnson 

THE REFORM PARTY
 
CALL FOR 'HARDBALL' ON OIL -- Patrick J. Buchanan said yesterday that the United States should stabilize oil prices in part by lifting sanctions on Iran and Iraq, selling them oil-drilling equipment and threatening to withhold military aid from Persian Gulf allies unless crude prices fall to $20 a barrel. "This is the dark side of globalization," Mr. Buchanan said in an advance copy of a speech at Boston University. "We should play hardball with those who play hardball with us."
 
THE VOTERS
 
THE RACE IN PENNSYLVANIA -- With the major presidential candidacies effectively settled, interest among political professionals is shifting to an array of theoretical vice-presidential nominees to see how they fare in the polls. The latest measure, from Pennsylvania, finds that a local Republican, Gov. Tom Ridge, adds five points to Gov. George W. Bush's current four-point lead over Vice President Al Gore. A Bush-Ridge ticket was polled at 46 percent, to 37 percent for Mr. Gore, who was measured without running mates. The poll, conducted for the Commonwealth Foundation/Lincoln Institute, measured a Bush ticket with the evergreen theoretical nominee, Colin L. Powell, at 47 percent to 37 percent over Mr. Gore. The survey had a margin of error of four percentage points. Francis X. Clines
 
THE SOUTH
 
AN UNUSUAL SWITCH -- For years, Democrats in South Carolina have stood before cameras to announce their conversion to the Republican Party, but this week, there was a far more startling switch: Two moderate Republican state representatives said they were becoming Democrats, the first Republicans to do so in the state since the end of Reconstruction. Mickey Whatley and Dr. Margaret J. Gamble said they were tired of being pressured to vote along party lines, though they can now also escape difficult primary challenges. The move reduces the Republican majority in the state's House of Representatives to five votes. David Firestone
 
FREE ADS COMING -- Starting today and continuing through the month, a North Carolina broadcasting company will provide a total of 180 minutes of free broadcasting time on each of its four television stations so candidates for governor can explain their positions on main issues. Both parties hold primaries on May 2. Capitol Broadcasting, based in Raleigh, plans to allow each of five candidates -- three Republicans and two Democrats -- to tape three two-minute spots; personal attacks on opponents will be prohibited. Each spot will run six times on WRAL-TV, a CBS affiliate in Raleigh; WJZY-TV, the UPN affiliate in Charlotte; WRAZ-TV, the Fox affiliate in Durham, and WILM-TV, the CBS affiliate in Wilmington. Jim Goodmon, Capitol's chief executive, sat on a 1998 White House commission recommending that television stations give candidates broadcast time in the month before an election. Kevin Sack

HEADLINE: SEEKING ANSWERS, CENSUS IS STIRRING PRIVACY QUESTIONS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
Saturday is Census Day, the day the government takes a demographic snapshot of every man, woman and child in America to find out how many of them there are and where they live and how old they are and what race they consider themselves, and to make it possible to tabulate, among dozens of other factors, their education, marital status, income and housing conditions.
To some people, this is an invasion of their privacy. 
 Most people interviewed at random in several cities around the country were happy, even eager, to answer the census questions. But it was not hard to find ones who were upset.
"Some of it was too personal," said Tom Donahue, a retiree who lives in the Charlestown section of Boston. "I didn't fill in those parts. I just left them blank."
Adriana Farrell, a software developer in suburban Minneapolis, asked, "Am I Hispanic because my mom is from Ecuador?"
At a bar on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Ken Rickert, an elevator mechanic, said he would not return his census form because "this is a government institution, and I don't want any part of it."
Carolyn Berghoff, a member of the Chicago Lyric Opera's choir, said she and her husband, Robert, a lawyer, had answered all the questions except the ones dealing with income, which they left blank. "The older you get the more reluctant you are to give out that kind of financial information," Ms. Berghoff said.
The Census Bureau wants to know where people were living on April 1, and it mailed census forms earlier this month to 120 million home addresses, asking who would be living there on April 1.
In an interview today, Kenneth Prewitt, the census director, said, "There's not a single question on the census that was not put there to fulfill some very serious piece of legislation or government program.
"If you think Head Start is invasive, if you think mass-transit routes are invasive, if you think the location of veterans hospitals is invasive, then maybe so, but they depend on the census," Mr. Prewitt continued. "Cost-of-living increases for Social Security and veterans could not be calculated without the census."
There are two census forms. Most households get the short form, which asks seven basic questions about the number of people living at each address and their age, sex and race. Hardly anyone objects to answering these questions.
But 1 household in 6 gets the more elaborate long form, which has 53 questions, and this is where the objections arise.
The complaints have been frequent enough that some politicians, almost all of them Republicans, have weighed in. Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has made public-service commercials urging people in his state to return their census forms.
Senator Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, said that many constituents had complained that their rights were being infringed and that the senator had encouraged them to skip the questions they objected to and to send in the rest of the form.
Another Republican senator, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, has prepared legislation that would remove the criminal penalty for failing to answer questions. Mr. Hagel's spokeswoman, Deb Fiddelke, said his office had received about 200 complaints about items being intrusive.
Even Gov. George W. Bush of Texas entered the fray, saying at a campaign stop in Milwaukee this week that he was not sure he would answer all the questions himself. Mr. Bush advised people, "If they're worried about the government intruding into their personal lives, they ought to think about it."
Democrats accused the Republicans of playing politics with an essential element of the American government.
"They don't want people counted," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, "because they think it serves their political purpose."
In his radio address on Saturday, the White House said, President Clinton will encourage Americans to return their census forms.
Bill Beach, a senior fellow in economics at the Heritage Foundation, said the government simply did not need to have so much information about so many people. "The scope is awesome as to what the government is asking you by law to reveal," he declared.
But Stephen Fienberg, a professor of statistics and social science at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said, "Every question is there because there is a law that cannot be implemented without the data, and the only way we can get the data is through the census."
Questions about race, Mr. Fienberg said, are essential to enforcing voting-rights laws. Questions about language are necessary for various education programs. Questions about plumbing and kitchen equipment are needed for housing programs.
Complaints about privacy arise every 10 years, said Margo Anderson, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, who has written a history of the census. But Professor Anderson said she could not recall a time when so many politicians complained at the very time the count was being made.
Across the country this week, census takers went to homeless shelters and soup kitchens in the hope of enumerating people. Over the next month, nursing homes, college dormitories and prisons will be visited. Beginning on April 18, census workers will knock on the doors of households that have not returned their forms.
Half a million temporary workers will be hired for these duties.
To encourage participation, the Census Bureau has run an extensive advertising campaign, much of it on television. The advertising budget, approved by Congress, is $167 million.
As of today, the bureau reported, 50 percent of households had responded. The response rate ranged from 37 percent in Mississippi to 56 percent in Nebraska. Mr. Prewitt, the census director, said the goal was a national response of 61 percent, before census takers began the count of those who failed to return the forms sent to their homes.
State-by-state population tallies will be completed by the end of this year, and they will be used to determine how many Congressional seats are allotted to each state.
If preliminary estimates pan out, New York and Pennsylvania will lose two seats, and Arizona and Texas will gain two. Connecticut, Illinois, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma and Wisconsin will lose one seat each. California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Montana and Nevada will gain one each.
By April 1, 2001, each state will receive block-by-block counts. These will be used for redistricting within the states and for such decisions as where to build schools, roads and fire stations. More detailed data will then be reported periodically.
The statistics are not used just by governments and social scientists. Businesses rely on them to determine where to advertise, where to invest and where to locate.
When this year's count is complete, the experts say, the population of the United States will be about 275 million. That is 200 million higher than the count at the turn of the last century.
In 1920, the census found that the United States had crossed the divide that separates a rural nation from an urban one. The 1980 census showed that the population of the South and West exceeded that of the North and Midwest. The 1990 census was the first, in asking who lived at an address, to use the term "unmarried partner."
The Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, held last year that the actual head count had to be used for reapportionment of Congressional seats. But this year, for the first time, the Census Bureau is also using a sampling technique to enumerate people who were missed by the head count.
The justices did not rule on what this more accurate count could be used for -- on whether, for example, it can be the basis for drawing the redistricting maps within states.
The result, no doubt, will be a flurry of lawsuits, filed by political parties, civil rights groups, conservative legal foundations, cities and suburban counties, each of them trying to compel or prohibit the government from using the population counts derived from sampling.

HEADLINE: PUTIN VOWS RUSSIA WILL REINVIGORATE ITS NUCLEAR FORCE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: SNEZHINSK, Russia, March 31

 BODY:
In his first official trip since being elected president, Vladimir V. Putin visited one of Russia's leading nuclear weapons design centers and vowed to preserve the nation's nuclear might.
"We must increase the efficiency of our nuclear potential," Mr. Putin said at a meeting at the Chelyabinsk-70 complex near here, where thousands of nuclear scientists live and work behind a barricade of barbed wire. 
 None of this was portrayed by Russia's president-elect as the start of a new arms race. In fact, Mr. Putin emphasized today that he supported ratification of the Start II arms reduction treaty and negotiations to make further cuts in strategic nuclear weapons. And he pointedly said that his goal of a more efficient nuclear program includes consolidating production, not increasing it.
He insisted that his talk of building a stronger Russian state should be taken by the West as a sign that he was committed to protecting property rights and developing a fairer legal system. It is not, he said, an indication that he is looking for a confrontation with the West or planning to crack down on human rights.
When asked today for reaction to Mr. Putin's trip and his proposals, the State Department said it had no comment.
During his visit, Mr. Putin did point out that his decision to attend a meeting here on nuclear energy and weapons issues had been made long ago and that politics were not the point. Still, politics seemed to be very much on the mind of Mr. Putin, who failed to win a convincing mandate in the recent election and is now seeking broader support as he forms his new government.
In fact, the symbolism of today's event, as well as its content, appeared to provide a clue to his agenda. Russia's sizable nuclear arsenal is the Kremlin's last pretension to superpower status. Flanked by his defense and atomic energy ministers today, Mr. Putin signaled that he was prepared to support both the weapons arsenal and the scientists who have developed it.
Set in the town of Snezhinsk, Chelyabinsk-70 is one of 10 closed nuclear cities, where some 700,000 Russians live and which have fallen on hard times.
The fate of the cities has been a growing concern not only for the Russians but also for American policy makers, who fear that economic hardship may prompt Russia's nuclear elite to sell its bomb-making expertise to aspiring nuclear powers.
Chelyabinsk-70, certainly, has seen better days. The nuclear complex was established in 1955 as a backup and competitor to Arzamas-16, the Soviet Union's first nuclear weapons design center.
Its scientists were among the nation's elite. But with the collapse of the Soviet Union, they lost their favored place in the system. Wages were delayed. Many young people left to find opportunities elsewhere.
The work force at Chelyabinsk-70 shrank to its present 9,500 employees from about 15,000 a decade ago. The complex's crisis seemed to be symbolized by the suicide of Vladimir Z. Nechai, the director of Chelyabinsk-70, who shot himself in 1996.
During the recent election campaign, Mr. Putin repeatedly pledged to strengthen Russia's military-industrial complex. For example, he outlined a 10-point plan for improving military production, and he has increased spending for weapons procurement by 50 percent, a development that appears to reflect the strains put on the military by the war in Chechnya.
Scientists here say high-level attention from the Kremlin is already beginning to make a difference at their nuclear center. The average pay of a nuclear scientist at Chelyabinsk-70 is only 3,000 rubles a month (about $106). But at least wages are being paid regularly now.
"We are receiving increased attention," said Yevgeny N. Avrorin, the scientific director of Chelyabinsk-70, who has worked here since the complex was established. "It started when Yevgeny M. Primakov was prime minister and has continued. To compare our situation with the West, we are poor. But things are better than they were a year and a half ago."
At Chelyabinsk-70, for example, there has been talk of redirecting the talents of its scientists and workers to civilian projects. But Mr. Avrorin said only 10 percent of its scientists and workers had shifted entirely to commercial work.
And a much-advertised United States Energy Department program to drum up civilian work for residents of Russia's nuclear cities has been pared back by the United States Congress and provides only a modicum of assistance.
After arriving today, Mr. Putin strode across the main square, which is still dominated by a hulking monument of Lenin, and plunged into the crowd like a veteran politician.
He later held a news conference, at which he said he would move forward with pro-market economic policies and promised to welcome politicians from a variety of parties into his government on the condition that they work as members of his team.
Later he left for the nearby city of Chelyabinsk to preside over a judo tournament and hand out kimonos to the winners -- a convenient photo opportunity for a leader who touts his own prowess at the sport.
For all that, the region is not a hotbed of Putin supporters. Many of the workers at Chelyabinsk-70, for example, are highly educated, and they appear somewhat less impressed than many of their countrymen by the tough image that Mr. Putin has forged by ordering a military campaign in Chechnya.
Mr. Putin, in fact, received 47.5 percent of the vote here, somewhat less than the 52.6 percent he received nationwide. Grigory V. Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko party and a critic of Mr. Putin's Chechnya policy, received about 12 percent here, about double his national average. And while the crowds were friendly, they were surprisingly modest considering the rarity of the event.
A 25-year-old woman who was selling tea, candy and household items in the outdoor market said she had voted for Mr. Putin. Trained as a teacher, she opened a small stall in the marketplace after she got tired of waiting for wages that never seemed to be paid on time.
"Maybe Putin came to see what conditions are like in a closed city," said the woman, who gave her name only as Olga.
Vyacheslav Stepanov, 54, a ballistics expert and director of a military laboratory here, acknowledged that there were many problems at Chelyabinsk-70, including the fact that few young scientists were clamoring to work there. For a while, he said, he was the youngest person in his office.
Still, he did not seem convinced that Mr. Putin would make that much of a difference. Mr. Stepanov said he had voted for Ella Pamfilova, the only female candidate in the election contest, who received a fraction of the vote.
"I thought I should show my support for a female candidate," he said.

HEADLINE: Stand Over Cuban Highlights A Virtual Secession of Miami

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 31

 BODY:
The last time Floridians spoke fiercely about rebellion and secession, they left the Union. Now rebellion is happening again, as political leaders in Miami-Dade County say they plan to defy federal authority in the international custody case of Elian Gonzalez.
But secession, say all manner of people here, has been going on for a long time. The battle over Elian merely shows how far it has come. 
 "This country is going to see now what we're all about," shouted Jose Ramos, an elderly Cuban-American who considers himself Cuban, period, outside the house where Elian lives in Little Havana. One of the many exiles in South Florida whose hatred for President Fidel Castro of Cuba defines his past, present and future, Mr. Ramos said he was ready to give his life to stop the federal government from taking Elian away.
Such passion is expected at the house, ground zero in the four-month confrontation between an overwhelming majority of Cuban exiles here and United States government officials who want to return Elian to his father and to Cuba. But on Wednesday, when 20 elected officials in Miami-Dade County said they would not allow their police to aid federal authorities, it proved that the politicians here would choose their own independent foreign policy over the rule of law, say some legal, political and immigration experts who have followed the Elian case.
To many people here, some who cheered and some who shuddered, it was a declaration of independence for a part of the country that is, increasingly, a nation apart. People have even begun to greet each other with, "Welcome to the independent republic of Miami."
"This is a city that is separate," said Lisandro Perez, the director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University. "We now have our own local foreign policy."
Cuban-Americans make up some 800,000 of the county's 2.1 million people. Latin Americans make up the overwhelming majority, and English has faded from homes, offices and stores. But it is the Cuban exiles who drive the county's economy, politics and culture, and it is Cuba's flag, not the United States', in the windows of shops, on car antennas and on the mural behind the Chevrolet dealership on Le Jeune Road.
Many Cuban-Americans believe they have been strong-armed by the government, and that its leaders have no compassion for Elian or for their view, said Luis Aguilar Leon, Cuba scholar and historian at the University of Miami. "They are thinking of justice," Mr. Leon said. "But justice is not only the law."
"It's hard for them not to get passionate," he said. "Everyone has a brother, sister or family member who has suffered, because of a totalitarian regime."
And that, said political experts, is what drove Alex Penelas, mayor of Miami-Dade County, to say that he would not use the county's resources to assist federal officials if they come for the boy, and to say that he would hold Attorney General Janet Reno responsible if blood was shed.
His language, said experts on exiles and people on the street, reminded them of the way Southern governors talked during the civil rights movement decades ago.
"On Oct. 15, 1996, Penelas executed his solemn oath as Dade County's mayor to 'support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,' " said William P. Harris Jr., a lawyer in Miami.
But what Mr. Penelas and others did in front of the federal courthouse on Wednesday afternoon reminded him of George Wallace on the steps of the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery in 1963, when, "in the face of a federalized force, he violated his oath and disgraced himself," Mr. Harris said.
"I'm still angry," he said. "Everyone refers to Miami as that 'banana republic.' First all the corruption we've had over the years and now this? My God."
Mr. Penelas said he never meant that the police would stand by if violence broke out. "It's unfortunate that my statements were interpreted that way," he said.
What he meant, he said, was that the police would play no role in taking the boy from the home. "If they think our SWAT team is going to go in there and take him out, yelling and screaming," he said, federal officials are mistaken.
But local police often help federal officers in such tense situations, and in choosing not to let his officers assist in this case, Mr. Penelas, and those mayors who backed him, are siding against an unpopular but legal process, say some experts on police actions and crowd control.
Mr. Penelas described the government's actions as "provocations" and "unjustified threats." In Little Havana, exiles applauded Mr. Penelas' words, and took them to mean that he is behind them in their fight to keep Elian in the freedom of the United States, at all costs.
"This country is the land of laws," said Miguel Saavedra, president of Vigilia Mambisa, an exile group here. "But not today. Not with us."
Max Castro, a senior research associate at the North-South Center at the University of Miami, which focuses on immigration and Cuban issues, also said the unrest echoes "state and federal confrontations in the civil rights era. They had the same elements."
But like the people on both sides of that issue, "Cubans are polarized," he said.
Critics of his stand said the mayor's comments, and the comments of others, seemed to excuse disobedience if not invite it. What it shows, said David Abraham, professor of immigration law at the University of Miami, is that "the local political elite said they feel the laws of the United States do not apply to them, when they feel otherwise. People who believe in the rule of law are mystified by this."
"This isn't like some of the other things South Florida has done," he said, referring to years of massive political corruption, police scandal, and legendary drug trafficking -- local politicians once named a street after a drug dealer, a mistake they corrected.
But this, said Mr. Abraham, "is the the most defiant position a public official has taken since the days of Orville Faubus." Mr. Faubus was the Arkansas governor who defied federal orders to integrate schools in 1957, leading to violent confrontations in the streets, and to public dismay.
"Just as President Eisenhower found that only an overwhelming display of force could make clear that the law of land also applied in Arkansas," Mr. Abraham said, "it may regrettably take an overwhelming display to prove South Florida is part of the United States."
The truth is, said many Cuban-Americans here, they do not mind if they are seen as a separate country. Not only do they not want to be part of middle America, they do not care very much what middle America thinks of them.
"I don't understand this country," said Marta Santana, who came to the United States 40 years ago. She was a teacher in Cuba, then worked at a day care center here. "Castro is the devil, and now so is Clinton."
But Miami's national image does matter, to the lenders and corporate decision-makers who would invest in a region where bond ratings seem to sink with every corruption scandal or sensational headline.
"People are going to look down at them around the country after this one," said Mr. Perez of the Florida International University, who is Cuban himself. "It will have a negative implication to those sitting in middle America."
For 40 years, he said, the exiles have been viewed not so much as immigrants as fighters of communism.
"They've been spoiled by the U.S. government in the past. Look at the record. They've gotten television stations, radio stations," to broadcast their message to Cuba.
"This time the government is saying no."
Not all Cuban-Americans want the boy to stay, and even some of those who do say they do not approve of the tactics. But they are shouted down.
Most support the hard-line against the federal government, even if quietly. "If we were African American, no one would be questioning us," said Mazaro Menendez, a salesman who came from Cuba 27 years ago.
Even as exiles vowed to use any means possible to stop the boy from being taken, Joe Carollo, the mayor of Miami, said the Cuban community will not -- even as his own constituents talk of violence -- become violent.
"The Cuban-American community has never been involved in riots," he said. "We have no history of violence."
If the exiles somehow win, and keep Elian here in defiance of the law, it would dismay many people here -- the anglos, blacks and non-Cuban Hispanics, said some political experts.
"They would find someplace else to live," said Mr. Abraham.

MARIAN ANDERSON
 A Singer's Journey.
 By Allan Keiler.
 Illustrated. 447 pp. New York:
 A Lisa Drew Book/Scribner. $30. 
 THE greatest intersection of art and politics in this nation's history was Marian Anderson's concert at the Lincoln Memorial in 1939. She was the most distinguished singer of her day, blessed with a voice that Arturo Toscanini famously called a once-in-a-century phenomenon. She had spent the 1930's dazzling European audiences with her mastery of art songs -- beating them, as it were, at their own game. Yet all these laurels could not persuade the racist Daughters of the American Revolution to allow her the use of their Constitution Hall. This mistreatment of a national treasure outraged the country, and drew 75,000 citizens to the Lincoln Memorial, asserting with their presence that the Civil War had been about completing the American Revolution, so-called Daughters be damned. Anderson herself was a lonely figure on that podium. As Allan Keiler writes in his smart and disturbing biography, it was an accident, never welcomed by Anderson, that her artistic journey so often coincided with high public drama.
Anderson's persona was imperially remote -- she identified herself as "we." This may have been a function of her appearance: she was tall and slim, with features that recalled her African and Native American ancestors. But the posture might have been a response to the naysayers who had dogged her since childhood, the poor daughter of a cleaning lady, already caught in the skein of class and intraracial prejudice. She once wrote her husband, Orpheus Fisher (a man so light-skinned that she was suspected of marrying outside the race), that a "middle way" was "best perhaps, all the while keeping ears, eyes and mouth open." This deeply religious woman believed one must always watch as well as pray.
Her talent alone should have opened all doors. Keiler, a professor of music at Brandeis University, credits Anderson with three octaves; her longtime accompanist, Franz Rupp, said she had four. Classical music has seldom known an instrument like Anderson's, one that could soar to ethereal highs -- she could mimic angels, ghosts, ecstatic maidens and terrified children -- then descend to unearthly, androgynous lows. With baritonal power she could impersonate a brokenhearted suitor, an exhausted slave or the voices of God and Death.
The subtle deployment of vocal dynamics was her joy. Her low notes, sung half-voice, seemed even more cavernous, and the emotions they articulated all the more complex. She had derived this strategy from the great black tenor Roland Hayes, despite the objections of an early coach who wished to cultivate a lusty voice out of Italian opera, not a "pianissimo contralto." She stuck to the sound, a legacy of the black church, as was her magical use of blues notes. Because Keiler is far more interested in her performances of lieder than of spirituals, he glosses over her church background, though it was intrinsic to her art.
The granddaughter of a freed slave, Marian Anderson was born in Philadelphia on Feb. 27, 1897. She was first sponsored by her father's church, Union Baptist, a citadel of the Talented Tenth, where spirituals were sung in a cultivated style. (The word itself was pronounced with a rolled "r.") But John Anderson died when Marian was 12, and the great influence on her life was her mother, Anna Delilah, a former schoolteacher and devout member of Tindley Temple Methodist, a congregation that favored brooding hymns and moans. But the church's founder, C. A. Tindley, would become the first important gospel songwriter, one of whose compositions is now known as "We Shall Overcome." In addition, Marian's grandfather Thomas Anderson was a member of the Church of God and Saints of Christ, a storefront sect that combined a black Jewish identity with Pentecostal rituals, foot washing, dancing in the spirit and speaking in tongues. Long before she began her studies of classical song, Marian Anderson was exposed to the immense range of black sacred music, a fountain that never ran dry.
Keiler traces her artistic journey: her youth spent touring a circuit limited to "the self-nurturing world of the black community"; her 20's and 30's in Europe, where her mastery of the lieder tradition was considered miraculous, particularly in Scandinavia and the Soviet Union; her triumphant return to the United States in her late 30's; the impresario Sol Hurok's subsequent direction of her career, which brought great fame and some fortune but so overtaxed her voice that by 1940 Hurok could promise Franz Rupp, her new accompanist, that she had only a few seasons left in her. Throughout, her repertory kept expanding, hundreds of songs in different languages.
Anderson's favorite genres were lieder and spirituals. Rupp was already a star in the first and her willing acolyte in the second. A refugee from Hitler, married to a Jewish woman, the singer Steffanie Schwarz (herself a mistress of lieder and one of Anderson's many coaches), Rupp was a nonpareil accompanist, commanding a rhythmic and harmonic authority that played to all of Anderson's strengths. Together they recorded several masterpieces. In Schubert's "ErlkRated PG-13nig," while Rupp duplicates the galloping horses, Anderson mimics four characters -- the narrator, the anguished father, the frightened child and the fairy king, whose hypnotic, lilting tones culminate in a fierce cackle. Mortality registers another voice in "Death and the Maiden" -- low, resigned and terminally seductive. The marriage of Eros and Thanatos became a Rupp-Anderson specialty.
Her American songs were no less powerful. Since there was a tradition of formalized spirituals, one that long predated the blues and anticipated the harmonic complication of folklore found in jazz, Anderson's folk tunes did not shock concert listeners. Even so, she hoped to avoid "the character of art songs" in her spirituals, "which is not their nature at all." She graced both forms with a similar range of vocal colors, thereby treating anonymous black lyricists as the peers of Goethe and Schiller. For example, on April 11, 1945, she recorded Schumann's "Silent Tears," basking in its sumptuous harmonies. The next day she recorded the spiritual "Hold On," saturating the lyrics with a blues tonality that would do any gospel singer proud.
Anderson's exclusive interest was her art; she did not marry until she was 46, and even then remained closest to her mother and sisters, Ethel and Alyse. Yet she was frequently viewed in political terms, as a representative of her race -- a deadening role for any artist. During the 1930's, she was condemned in Nazi Germany for performing Aryan music and in the Soviet Union for singing about Jesus. (Keiler contends that a nation enslaved by Stalin identified particularly with her songs of liberation.) The book's most powerful pages recount Anderson's legendary performance at the Lincoln Memorial. Keiler shows that the D.A.R was "not at all compelled by local custom" when the organization turned down Howard University's request to present Anderson in concert. Black artists had performed in Constitution Hall up to 1932; indeed, the practice of segregation in Washington was fitful and erratic, as might be expected with so many Northeastern politicians dependent on the black vote. The D.A.R.'s leaders were political reactionaries who detested feminism and integration as twin evils. Since Anderson was not on record as a political activist, they reserved their greatest hatred for her champion Eleanor Roosevelt -- her savior, her defender in a swirl of ugly events that she did not want to think about or even entirely acknowledge."
But the presiding genius of the Lincoln Memorial concert, one of the landmarks in the civil rights struggle, was Walter White, the executive secretary of the N.A.A.C.P. It was White and not Hurok who solicited the endorsement of artists like Toscanini and other luminaries of classical music in an effort to bring the D.A.R. to its senses, and it was White who chose the Lincoln Memorial as the concert site and dreamed up the most resonant details: the concert programs were distributed by Boy Scouts, black and white, and "America" was selected rather than "The Star-Spangled Banner" because of its spirit of communal engagement. As White intended, the concert was immediately regarded as a world event. Like Joe Louis's victory over Max Schmeling the year before, it was seen as the triumph of American democracy, the actual condition of black people notwithstanding.
The year 1939 ensured Anderson's fame and her place in history. It also exposed her to the liabilities of symbolic status. During the 1940's she toured the South, demanding that audiences at her concerts be integrated, though herself subject to all the indignities of segregation. For insisting on her "middle way," she was criticized by white Southerners as overly confrontational and by civil rights leaders as insufficiently engaged. Called upon to discuss politics -- a huge request of someone with a high school degree in home economics -- she chose to speak in a slow, deliberate, grandly impersonal manner (missionary cadences later echoed by Coretta Scott King, Barbara Jordan and Jessye Norman) that could sound windily officious. In 1957, the United States Information Agency sent her to Asia as a musical ambassador, expecting her simply to sing and be charming. But her first concert occurred the day President Dwight D. Eisenhower dispatched troops to protect the pioneering nine black students at Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., and Anderson found herself obliged to explain Arkansas's Gov. Orval Faubus and American race relations to Asian audiences. Only at home would she express her outrage over the "things . . . required of me as a Negro that would not be required of someone else."
ANDERSON was too big a star not to make a ripe target once age and overwork did their inevitable mischief. After 1950, as her vocal lapses -- an unruly vibrato and wavering pitch, the product of age and overwork -- became more pronounced, many critics, most cruelly in Jet and Ebony, called on her to quit. But she could not, largely because she was the sole support of her mother and sisters. Wonderfully, she kept bouncing back, recovering her voice, though usually on the nights the critics stayed home. Her debut in 1955 at the Metropolitan Opera came too late -- she was nearly 58 years old -- but the chance to work as part of an ensemble thrilled her. In 1964, with a young black accompanist, John Mosley, she recorded a new album of spirituals. Her blues tonalities and rhythmic freedom had never been so unbridled; her moans sounded like a recording of field hands. During her last years, until her death at 96, only Mosley's down-home chords could induce her to sing again.
What kind of career would she have today? Those who lament her late arrival in opera forget that the starring roles usually go to voices significantly higher than hers. She appeared too inbred and solitary a figure for the stage, though she always regretted not accepting Stanislavsky's offer to coach her in the role of Carmen. Her repertories are all out of favor: lieder is the province of connoisseurs; both formalized spirituals and folkloric gospel are now period gestures.
Keiler's impressively researched book supplements and supersedes Anderson's 1956 autobiography, a typically guarded affair. He covers the life chronologically, avoiding psychological analyses. The massively discreet Anderson remains opaque. In public, Anderson did not exude much humor; neither does her biographer. There are no startling revelations. But by putting his emphasis on her career, Keiler gives Marian Anderson the homage she deserves. It is a quietly amazing story.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 4-2-00: The Ethicist;
Census and Sensibility

BYLINE: By Randy Cohen 

 BODY:
When I fill out my census form, I am considering declaring myself poor and African-American. This would be a lie because I am middle class and white, but it strikes me as responsive to a higher ethic. Adding one more tally to a group known to be undercounted would help right the inaccurate figures. Should I suppress my socially conscious concerns? -- J. Sommer, New York
You should express your concerns, but not in the way you propose. While the census is seriously -- and, many say, deliberately -- flawed, it is not so utterly discredited as to justify the small civil disobedience you describe. Instead, write to your representatives and demand the use of sampling techniques that would yield a more accurate count, and urge your local officials to make every effort to see that all are tallied. But when the census form arrives, fill it out honestly. 
 Aside from the legal objection to falsifying the form, it is in everyone's interest to make the count as accurate as possible. If your policy were universally adopted, the census would be discredited as little more than fiction, particularly the part about the 35 Guamanians living in my apartment.
My school's parking lot has only 47 spots for 100 driving students. I asked a school administrator where I could park off campus legally. I parked where he told me, but my car was ticketed and towed because the fire chief thought that the many cars on that street caused a fire hazard. Who should pay for the impound and ticket? Who is at fault? -- Joshua Fink, Englewood, N.J.
Bad advice offered in good faith is not bad ethics. If that administrator says it will be sunny tomorrow, you can't sue him if it rains. He is offering an opinion outside the authority of his office. The responsibility to wear a hat is yours.
If you parked in a legal spot, fight the ticket and ask the school official to help. If the spot was not legal, his opinion doesn't change that, so you're stuck. Tell him what happened so he'll know he is misinformed and stop giving bad advice. And who knows: he may offer to pay part of the ticket to compensate for his bad advice.
At a gourmet market where I shop, more than a few customers help themselves to handfuls of nuts and dried fruits without paying. This is clearly unsanitary. I've mentioned it to the cashiers, who say that no one in charge cares enough to stop it. May I say something to these freeloaders or should I ignore the situation and fume inwardly? -- N. Levy, New York
If you catch people actually napping in the pickle barrel, you may jostle them awake and give them a stern talking to. In the cases you describe, however, I think the health risk is minimal. Perhaps what makes you fume is less a matter of hygiene than moral outrage. However, while the behavior you describe sounds like stealing to me, if the owners of the shop know about it and do nothing to stop it, your ethical imperative is lifted. The store may be willing to tolerate this sampling for the good will it engenders, or at least to avoid the hassle. Their store, their choice. My anti-fuming advice is to tell the owners that you intend to shop elsewhere, and why, and then do so.
About a year ago, a friend borrowed $10,000 from another friend of mine. Not only has the borrower not returned the money, he also shows no inclination of ever doing so. By remaining friends with the welsher without so much as a comment, am I condoning his reprehensible behavior? Am I wrong to remain his friend? -- Lawrence Toffler, Los Angeles
If every time two friends quarreled and all their mutual friends had to choose sides, none of us would have many friends left. Fortunately, you are not obliged to cut off all ties to the deadbeat, but you should not ignore his bad behavior.
Use your continued association to remind the defaulting friend of his obligation -- gently, but persistently -- and make it clear that you do not condone his lapse.
Your situation will become more difficult if the injured party demands that you break off with the deadbeat. Then you may have to take a side. But while there are indeed transgressions grave enough to sink a friendship, for now at least this isn't one of them. Still, I wouldn't lend him any money. Or a cup of sugar. Or a cup.

HEADLINE: For More Artists, A Fine Old Age

BYLINE: By TERRY TEACHOUT; Terry Teachout, the music critic of Commentary, is a contributor to Time magazine.

 BODY:
SPEND a night at the movies, or channel-surfing at home, and you're likely to come away suspecting that Western culture has been hijacked by a horde of hard-bodied twentysomething clones with very good hair and very moderate I.Q.'s. But there are other entertainment options available to New Yorkers jaded by jejuneness, and those who prefer "The Sopranos" to "Jack and Jill" may have noticed that this has been an exceptionally fine season for older artists. Among other things:
*Paul Taylor, 69, made two strikingly personal new dances, "Arabesque" and "Cascade." 
 *Rosemary Harris, 69, and Lauren Bacall, 75, are starring on Broadway in "Waiting in the Wings," a comedy about old age written by Noel Coward when he was 60.
*Bob Brookmeyer, 70, released "New Works: Celebration," a CD of new compositions for jazz orchestra, and celebrated his birthday in December by blowing the roof off the Village Vanguard.
*The New York Festival of Song released a recording of "Evidence of Things Not Seen," a full-evening song cycle for four solo voices and piano by Ned Rorem, 76.
*Merce Cunningham, 80, choreographed "Biped," a dance that makes bold use of computer-generated digital images.
*The Metropolitan Museum of Art mounted a splendid show of paintings by Hans Hofmann, the most vibrant and passionate of which were done when he was 85.
In recent years, I have had occasion to spend much time looking at and listening to the works of older artists, an experience that has caused me to question the tendency of critics and scholars to partition creative lives into three "periods." This practice was inspired by the way the music of Ludwig van Beethoven changed over the course of his life; brusque and dynamic, even aggressive, during his middle age, it turned inward and became profoundly mysterious in the decade before his death. It is now widely thought that most great artists undergo a similar stylistic evolution in the "third periods" of their creative lives. But Beethoven died at 56, and it may be that the concept of the third period is based on assumptions that no longer hold true now that it is commonplace for artists to outlive the Biblical allotment of three score and ten -- long enough to have a fourth period.
While there have always been artists who remained active into their 70's and beyond, they once seemed slightly freakish, if only because there were never all that many Titians or Michelangelos at any given time. But times are changing, and so are actuarial tables. The average American born in 1920 died at 54. Now he will live to 73 or she to 80. This well-known fact is as applicable to artists -- at least those who take reasonable care of themselves -- as anyone else, but its implications have gone unnoticed by the news media. As any journalist can tell you, today's youth-conscious editors want to run stories about the next new thing, not the last old one. Nor are our trend-mad scholars so very different; "The Artist Grows Old," a thoughtful and provocative lecture by Kenneth Clark published in 1972, is the only monograph of its kind that I know.
Mere survival, of course, is no guarantee that an artist will continue to do good work. Advancing age is especially hard on singers and dancers. The tenor Peter Pears made his Metropolitan Opera debut at 63 in Benjamin Britten's "Death in Venice," while the cabaret singer Mabel Mercer, born in 1900, recorded her last album, the grandly expansive "Echoes of My Life," in 1976. But Pears and Mercer never had any youthful bloom to speak of: the beauty of their voices always contained a larger-than-usual proportion of strangeness. And while opera singers willing to renounce the lead roles of their youth can always switch to character parts (many a superannuated diva is grateful to Tchaikovsky for having done so well by the crotchety countess of "The Queen of Spades"), no such opportunities exist in the plotless works of the modern choreographers. In the world of George Balanchine, everyone is 25.
Conversely, much third-period art has been the work of artists who, like Beethoven, would no longer be generally regarded as old. Many of the novels thought to embody the hard-won wisdom of old age were actually written by men and women in their 50's. Remember Lambert Strether's anguished outburst in Henry James's "Ambassadors"? "Live all you can; it's a mistake not to. It doesn't so much matter what you do in particular, so long as you have your life. If you haven't had that what have you had?" It's an unforgettable utterance, the wrenching cry of an onlooker whom life has passed by, and it was written by a man who was 57 -- old by the standards of 1901, but not today.
WHAT we see in "The Ambassadors," or hear in a piece of third-period music like Beethoven's B Flat String Quartet, Op. 130, is the awesome spectacle of a genius learning to live in the shadow of mortality. Memento mori is the motto of the third period, and it is not necessary to be old to remember that you must die. Indeed, I believe that at least some of the qualities Kenneth Clark singled out as typical of what he calls the old-age style -- "a sense of isolation, a feeling of holy rage, developing into . . . transcendental pessimism; a mistrust of reason, a belief in instinct" -- are in fact an artist's initial responses to the fearful prospect of his own death, and thus more characteristic of what we now think of as middle age.
It is worth noting that a like development can also be seen in young artists who know their time is short. Flannery O'Connor's short stories "Judgment Day" and "Parker's Back," finished days before she died of lupus at the age of 39, are no less wise for having been written by a far younger person than James. I watched my friend, the cabaret singer Nancy LaMott, record her last album, "Listen to My Heart," not long after she learned she had the cancer that would shortly kill her; though she was only 43, she sang of love and loss as if she knew all there was to know about them both. Perhaps she did.
When we speak of the "wisdom" of a work of art, we are talking about a quality accessible only to artists who strive to understand and accept things as they are. One of these things is old age itself. We squirm at the spectacle of an octogenarian father, or a senescent rock star; for much the same reason, it is sobering to reflect on what will happen to the famously self-indulgent baby boomers (of whom I am one) as they grow older. I don't like to think about Bill Clinton at 70, or Mick Jagger at 80. I also wonder whether rock will prove musically and lyrically rich enough to hold the attention of my increasingly anxious generation, though I was pleased to see that "Two Against Nature," the new Steely Dan album, contains a fine song, "What a Shame About Me," in which Walter Becker, 50, and Donald Fagen, 52, cast a cold eye on a once-promising boomer whose life has gone sour: "I'm still working on that novel/ But I'm just about to quit/ 'Cause I'm worrying about the future now/ Or maybe this is it."
Listening to "What a Shame About Me" put me in mind of the dismayingly large number of long-lived artists whose careers go off the rails well before their actual demise. Their work often fractures along existing fault lines of temperament: one thinks of the deliquescence of Renoir's late nudes, the ugly obsessions of Alfred Hitchcock's "Frenzy," the morbid fear of death that poisons Philip Larkin's "Aubade" ("Unresting death, a whole day nearer now,/ Making all thought impossible but how/ And where and when I shall myself die"). They may suffer an enervating loss of energy, as Patrick O'Brian did in the last few of his Aubrey-Maturin novels; they may become foolishly garrulous, like George Bernard Shaw, or dry up, like Aaron Copland. Most often, like Martha Graham, they simply start to repeat themselves, replacing substance with too-familiar style.
Yet once in a while the miracle happens; an artist not only survives middle age, but also remains creatively vital. "Father Time is not always a hard parent," Charles Dickens wrote in "Barnaby Rudge," "and, though he tarries for none of his children, often lays his hand lightly on those who have used him well." To see such folk in the flesh is to be delighted and puzzled in equal measure. I heard the alto saxophonist Benny Carter at Iridium four years ago; he was then 89, but he played like a man of 60, and I could scarcely believe my ears.
Such apparent freedom from the devastation of old age seems to come less easily to those artists who work with words. "To write tolerably over the age of 65 is exceptional," Kenneth Clark rightly notes. That is when painters and orchestral conductors are just getting their second wind. As the 76-year-old Anthony Powell embarked on his 19th novel, "The Fisher King," he ruminated in his journal on the special problems facing the older novelist: "The sluggish imagination of old age makes giving of reality to characters difficult. The story must be seen from the point of view of a writer's own age group, later life being on the whole thin in action of the kind to give point to novels."
This makes sense, and it helps explain why most of the masterpieces of old age have been nonverbal. The best fourth-period art floats free of action and character. Instead, it is about essences, which are notoriously difficult to convey in words, though the Japanese painter Hokusai came close. "All that I have produced before the age of 70," he wrote at 75, "is not worth taking into account. At 73, I learned a little about the real structure of nature, of animals, plants, trees, birds, fishes and insects. In consequence, when I am 80, I shall have made still more progress. At 90, I shall penetrate the mystery of things; at 100, I shall certainly have reached a marvelous stage; and when I am 110, everything I do, be it a dot or a line, will be alive."
What fourth-period art is not about, at least not usually, is death. "Is this, perhaps, death?" sings the soprano in Richard Strauss's "Four Last Songs," to which the orchestra obligingly replies with a quotation from the 84-year-old composer's own "Death and Transfiguration." But such rhetorical gestures are relatively uncommon among artists who have come to terms with their own mortality -- a process that takes both time and unflinching courage. Their interests lie elsewhere, and their art changes accordingly. This is what drives the fourth periods of the greatest older artists: having accepted the inevitable, they are no longer weighed down by it. Hence the surging, staggering vitality of such fourth-period masterpieces as Paul Taylor's "Piazzolla Caldera" or Hans Hofmann's "Lust and Delight," which burn with a passion that is not merely recalled, but actively felt.
Not infrequently, a fourth-period work may epitomize the whole of a long creative life, though there is always something new on display as well. One of my favorite jazz albums is the pianist Marian McPartland's "Silent Pool," which she recorded at 78. It consists of 12 of her own compositions, accompanied by a string orchestra; some are familiar, but Alan Broadbent's arrangements shed unexpected light on their harmonic refinements, and Ms. McPartland responds with spring-fresh playing in which past and present are deftly juxtaposed. The 68-year-old Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, after the Guggenheim Museum the most celebrated of his buildings, has the same Janus-faced quality. No other architect could have designed it: all his stylistic quirks are on gloriously idiosyncratic display. But the total impression they leave is not valedictory. Instead, like "Silent Pool" or "Piazzolla Caldera," Fallingwater looks straight ahead into the future.
As I settle uneasily into my own middle age, three fourth-period works speak to me with particularly invigorating force. The first, Igor Stravinsky's ballet score "Agon," is a work I hear often (George Balanchine choreographed it in 1957, and the New York City Ballet dances it frequently), invariably marveling at how the 75-year-old composer sought and found stylistic renewal by bending the bristly complexities of Arnold Schoenberg's serial method to his own iron purpose. I have no use for most 12-tone music, but there is something superbly cheeky about Stravinsky's having placed a serial pas de deux at the epicenter of a piece that ends in good old-fashioned C major.
The second, Giuseppe Verdi's "Falstaff," is the most miraculous fruit of extreme old age that any Western artist has yet harvested. I have never seen it without crying, not because it is sad -- I can't think of a more joyous opera -- but because I find it inexpressibly moving that the 79-year-old Verdi should have found within himself the energy and grace to simultaneously portray the vanity of human wishes and what Alexander Herzen so beautifully called "the summer lightning of happy love."
"Falstaff" is a marvel of economy: one wouldn't wish it a bar shorter. But just as marvelously spare is the fourth-period masterpiece I love best, "The Snail." The 83-year-old Henri Matisse made it in 1953, at a time when illness had left him capable only of cutting out and pasting together pieces of colored paper, like a child in kindergarten. That the finest painter of the 20th century should have been reduced to such an extremity is the most terrible of ironies, but Matisse did not waste precious time pitying himself. Instead, he arranged his pieces of paper into a festive exercise in visual shorthand so concentrated and clear that it all but scorches the viewer's eye.
Hokusai, who called himself "the old man mad about drawing," would have understood "The Snail" perfectly. Like all fourth-period art, it penetrates the mystery of things, and in so doing celebrates the ultimate mystery of human life itself. Old men mad about art can give us no greater gift.

When Medicine's Loss Is the Law's Gain

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
OTHER fathers taught their sons how to throw curveballs. Leonard Rivkin's taught him to read X-rays. And Mr. Rivkin knew what an articular fracture was before he could roller skate.
Mr. Rivkin's father, Hyman Rivkin, was a physician in Far Rockaway. He believed medicine was more than just a noble profession. It was the only profession. "I ended up becoming a lawyer through pre-med," Mr. Rivkin, 75, said recently. "Fathers who are doctors want their sons to be doctors. I was in pre-med until I decided I didn't like it. I couldn't stand chemistry." 
 Mr. Rivkin didn't particularly have a burning passion for legal matters, either. But he did like the way the law-school building looked at his alma mater, the University of Virginia. And he needed a profession. So he enrolled in law school.
The rest, as they say, is history. Fifty years ago, Mr. Rivkin, the founder of Rivkin, Radler & Kremer, Long Island's largest law firm, opened a solo practice in the back room of an insurance agency in Freeport. Clients visiting the agency had to walk through his office to get to the restroom. It seemed like the perfect marketing strategy.
But during his first three months, Mr. Rivkin earned more as a notary than he did as a lawyer, charging 25 cents a document, enough to cover lunch. He did his own typing. Occasionally, he spent afternoons at the local movie theater.
At first, whatever cases came his way -- wills, closings, accident cases -- were from neighbors, friends and relatives.
But in 1950, there were not many high-profile trial lawyers on Long Island. Few, if any, wanted to take on accident cases for injured plaintiffs. Most law offices belonged to solo practitioners or small firms. And many local lawyers brought in trial lawyers from Manhattan or Brooklyn if they had a case to be tried.
Mr. Rivkin approached the South Nassau Lawyers' Association, a social group of young lawyers (now the Nassau Lawyers' Association of Long Island) and let it be known he was available for "of counsel" work, cases that lawyers give to other lawyers to handle. His strategy worked.
Before long, Mr. Rivkin was so busy he had to hire a typist. He took on one partner, then two. In the 1980's, the practice grew to 250 lawyers. Though the number of lawyers has dropped to 140, the Uniondale firm is believed to be the largest suburban law practice in the nation. It has additional offices in California, Newark and Chicago, but not in Florida, where Mr. Rivkin, an avid fishing and boating enthusiast, retired 10 years ago. He remains an honorary counsel to the firm and spends summers in Dix Hills with his son, John Rivkin, 46, a senior partner.
It was by defending corporations accused of environmental damage and pollution that Mr. Rivkin made his practice a legal powerhouse. He was the lead counsel for the Dow Chemical Company in the Agent Orange case brought by Vietnam veterans. He defended asbestos companies and their insurers against health claims and represented numerous corporations sued for toxic-waste damage.
Mr. Rivkin's experiences growing up as a lawyer on Long Island are chronicled in a book, "May it Please the Court! From Auto Accident to Agent Orange: Building a Storefront Law Practice into America's Largest Suburban Law Firm."
It was Jeffrey Silberfeld, 52, of Point Lookout, a former partner at Rivkin, Radler & Kremer and a visiting professor at Hofstra law school, who told Mr. Rivkin over lunch at the Hofstra University Club four years ago that he should tell his story. Mr. Rivkin agreed. Then he asked Mr. Silberfeld to write it. The book is to be published this week.
A John Grisham novel? No. More like "A Civil Action," Mr. Silberfeld said. But Mr. Rivkin hopes his success story will be used as a how-to manual and resource guide by law schools around the country, the saga of a rainmaker who used his suburban shop to his advantage in the courtroom.
"In litigation, one of the benefits in coming from a provincial Long Island neighborhood is in when you try the big-name case, they don't expect much of you," Mr. Rivkin said. "You can get away with a lot more and you can surprise a lot of people. I used it to my benefit."
The high point of Mr. Rivkin's career, he said, was Agent Orange.
The strategy was classic Rivkin. "Our premise in litigation was take the initiative," he said. "Even though we were a defendant in most cases, we always found a way to make the other side march to our tune, not march to theirs, even if they were suing us. To deflect the anti-Dow sentiment, the firm labeled identifed the federal government as the bad guy and started a third-party action. I always have felt it was so much more fun being a counterpuncher."
By the 1980's, the firm had moved from Freeport to Garden City and, in 1986, occupied three floors in the EAB Plaza. With national stature, it had garnered the cachet of a Park Avenue firm without the commute.
"Our firm wasn't built up from young lawyers out of law school," Mr. Rivkin said. "We picked up a number of lawyers who lived on Long Island who wanted to work on Long Island."
These days, Jerry Kremer, a senior partner and former assemblyman, does a reverse commute from Manhattan. Other partners include John Dunne, a former New York State senator and assistant United States attorney general for civil rights; William Savino, the mayor of Old Brookville; Erica Garay, president of the Long Island Women's Agenda; and Barry Shapiro, president of Channel 21. The firm is now full service.
In the past 50 years, Mr. Rivkin said, the practice of law has changed. But as a sole practitioner and as a senior partner, he always had fun. "Each case has a challenge unto itself, from the smallest to the biggest," Mr. Rivkin said.
 
50 Top Women
"Women are different," Faith Popcorn, the futurist, was telling the crowd of 600 that gathered in the ballroom at the Garden City Hotel on Tuesday night. "They can do two things at the same time. They can do five things at the same time."
The women being honored at the inaugural Long Island's 50 Top Women awards dinner probably can do more than that.
Like Yvonne Pena, who founded the Latina Women's Society for Social Change a year and a half ago. The group, the first Latina professional organization in Suffolk County, she said, is dedicated to eradicating myths about Hispanic women. , Ms. Pena is Suffolk County Human Rights Commissioner. She also produces the only Spanish-language public access program in Suffolk County, "Un Mensaje a La Comunidad."
And Dorothy Tripp, 77, mother of seven, grandmother of seven and great-grandmother of one. As the director of tourism for the town of Hempstead, she helps bring meetings and conventions to town, promoting 31 museums, 19 hotels, the Nassau Coliseum, the most famous beaches on Long Island and the Belmont Stakes Festival. "I'm very active in a lot of organizations," said Ms. Tripp, listing just a few. She is a co-founder of the Women Economic Developers of Long Island, just finished a term with the Long Island Convention and Visitor's Bureau and serves on the boards of the Long Island Center for Business and Professional Women and the Long Island Regional Economic Development Committee.
Picking the 50 women making the greatest impact on the Long Island economy was not an easy task, said John Kominicki, editor and publisher of the weekly Long Island Business News, which asked its readers and those of more than 100 community newspapers to send in nominations. A panel of business and government leaders selected the winners.
As it turned out, most of the women already knew each other. "We all do business with each other; some of us have been friends for years," said Marie Zere, president of the only female-owned commercial and industrial real estate company on Long Island, Zere Associates of Ronkonkoma. "If someone came to me and asked me, I would have picked out 25 women in this room, 25 absolutes who have been known to contribute to the community."
Looking around the room, Sharon Lobel was impressed. "It's nice for people to see there is a driving force of female business owners on Long Island," she said. Ms. Lobel is president of Seal-It, a manufacturer of tamper-evident packaging. "But I've always thought of myself as a business owner who happens to be a woman, not a woman business owner."
Roslyn Goldmacher, another honoree and executive director of the Long Island Development Corporation, said the approximately 35,000 female-owned businesses on Long Island, including some of the largest grossing companies, play a very significant role in the local economy.
"The presence of influential women is increasing all the time," said Christine Conniff Sheehan, honoree and founder of Networking, a magazine geared toward business women. "This is a market of very important people who must be paid attention to. Times are changing. Women know it. Men aren't quite sure."

HEADLINE: Theater;
Despair and Catharsis In O'Neill's Final PLay

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
IF you ain't the damnedest daughter in Connecticut, who is?"
"And if you ain't the damnedest father in Connecticut, who is?" 
 Although the battle of insults between a commonly besotted pig farmer and his daughter, a self-described "ugly overgrown lump of a woman" gets worse, it's a mere prelude to a ruse. Phil and Josie Hogan are bent on snaring James Tyrone Jr., their deeply besotted landlord, to spend the night with Josie under a "beautiful moon to fill him with poetry and loneliness."
Few theatergoers need to be told that James was Eugene O'Neill's older brother, or that "A Moon for the Misbegotten," is the playwright's act of expiation, written 20 years after James died. "May you rest forever in forgiveness and peace" is the play's merciful last line, spoken by Josie to James after he has gone off in defensiveness and despair.
And no one needs to identify with O'Neill's lusty, scheming, drug or drink-ridden characters who survive on pipe dreams. After O'Neill's reach for tragedy, power and glory, and an audience's sense of what catharsis and exaltation must have meant in ancient Greek drama, it's no wonder that most other plays seem small. If his stage creations -- the biographical, disguised; the mythical updated, or the fictitious and the wish fulfilling made real -- are larger than life, that is because his vision of theater was, to borrow one of his own titles, beyond the horizon. Leave it to Tennessee Williams, peerless heir to O'Neill's touch of poetry and journey into experimentation, to sum up an eternal force: "O'Neill gave birth to the American theater and died for it," Williams said.
That O'Neill was born in New York in 1888 is a mere statistic; Connecticut has a rightful claim to the last century's mightiest American playwright. He worked as a newspaper reporter in New London at 24 and went on writing plays until his death 41 years later. "Moon" was his last.
The family cottage in New London is a destination for tourists and the O'Neill Center in Waterford is a historic summer nurturing place for new plays, new musicals and cabaret performers. In Connecticut's major theaters, "Moon," a once forgotten, then misjudged work, was last produced in 1989 (Hartford Stage) and in 1991 (Yale Repertory).
The current Broadway success of "Moon" and the lingering high of last season's "Iceman Cometh," is a most reaffirming paradox. "Public Says No, No O'Neill Again," read the headline of a 1988 article in Variety after the abrupt closing of two Broadway imports from the Yale Repertory, "Ah, Wilderness" and "Long Day's Journey into Night," the first lighthearted play about the family of his fantasies; the second, about his real tormented one.
"The evidence is thus conclusive that the work of the playwright usually ranked as America's greatest is unable to prosper or even survive in the harsh Broadway economic climate," Variety's report went on.
In a harsher Broadway climate more than a decade later, O'Neill thrives. A Broadway production of "Desire Under the Elms" is scheduled for October at the Roundabout Theater, which successfully revived "Anna Christie" in 1992. "Ah, Wilderness" was welcomed in a 1998 Lincoln Center production.
More than the exports for which the state's theaters are known, the O'Neill renaissance is Connecticut's ultimate lifeline to Broadway.
As for the customary feeding of New York theater by Connecticut, it has not been as nourishing of late as the transfer of "Wit" from the Long Wharf in New Haven to Off -Broadway, where it is to close next Sunday. "The Clearing" and "Sueno," both from Hartford Stage, and "Red" from Long Wharf, moved to Off Broadway to no avail. But three of Connecticut's important resident playwrights -- A. R. Gurney, Donald Margulies and Arthur Miller -- have effectively kept theater on and off Broadway alive this season. Indeed, Mr. Margulies' "Dinner with Friends," a perceptive and unsettling view of marriage and friendship, perhaps even ostensibly sedate suburban life, may emerge as the season's finest Off Broadway play; it had a tryout run at Rich Forum of the Stamford Center for the Arts in October and has been a hit at Variety Arts Theater in Manhattan.
Mr. Gurney's "Ancestral Voices," a sort of "Love Letters" reading/hybrid play, expanded to five characters, spanning three generations, has been seen two nights a week at Lincoln Center, with stellar casts in intermittent runs.
As for Mr. Miller, "The Price," moved from Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts to Broadway in a fiercely excellent production, by consensus, its best yet.
It was not a Broadway survivor this season, but "The Ride Down Mt. Morgan" is to open, finally, on Broadway next Sunday. When Mr. Miller was out of fashion, that play had to travel for a 1991 world premiere in London, which is always true to Miller in his own fashion. Williamstown produced it in 1996, and the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1998. Both are nonprofit counterparts to regional theater.
Is Miller in or out of the loop? As with O'Neill, it's the fickle commercial theater that decides. Connecticut's regional theaters are conceived to serve and perpetuate the cause of art for real theater lovers, not to indulge and second-guess the faddish tastes of consumers.
A move of another sort, "The Wild Party," at Manhattan Theater Club, one of two versions this season of the same 1928 narrative poem, had its genesis in 1997, at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford.

HEADLINE: 100 Years of the Submarine;
With Most of That Time in Groton, the Ships Have Become an Integral Part of the State

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
THE centennial of the Navy submarine force will be marked with observances around the country this month, but few places will be celebrating it more than southeastern Connecticut. In Groton, a large blue plywood cutout of a submarine welcomes visitors to the "Submarine Capital of the World," and few places can dispute that title.
The submarine force got its foothold in Groton in December 1915, when five submarines steamed up the Thames River to their new home at a Navy base in Groton. Through two world wars and one Cold War that saw their importance to national security grow steadily, until today when the base has sprawled over 500 acres, submarines have been an integral part of the region, adding an estimated $1 billion a year to the regional economy, employing thousands of people. 
 Groton's town manager, Ronald P. LeBlanc, said the civilian community appreciated the presence of the submarine force and took pride in it, as well as the workers who build submarines at Electric Boat.
"It's more than the economic impact of the base," Mr. LeBlanc said. "The town's image is wrapped around submarines -- submarine construction and submarine operations. Without submarines, we would lose a big part of the town's identity. They're as much a part of us as we are a home port to the submarine service."
Representative Sam Gejdenson, whose congressional district includes Groton, said it would be impossible to quantify a century of Navy influence on the region, "but certainly it has to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars, particularly when you consider all the indirect impacts."
The influence is always spreading, Mr. Gejdenson said. Recently, he met someone who is marketing fishing poles made of material developed for the Trident submarine. Sonalysts Inc. in Waterford, which started doing work on sonar, now makes movies and music in its recording studio that grew out of its work in acoustics. The Kildare Corporation in New London used what it learned about sound propagation underwater to develop a system to detect dangerous turbulence around airports, a system that is being tested by the Federal Aviation Administration.
"There's an endless part of our economy that really germinated as a result of the dollars that came in from the Defense Department," Mr. Gejdenson said. "Our dominance in marine science and oceanography and a lot of other areas came as a direct result of the technology that the Pentagon invested in to build the best submarines in the world.
"When the woolen mills died in the middle part of the last century, it left behind people who were tied to the technology of the last century," he said. "Submarine technology has provided the seeds for this region's future."
Mr. Gejdenson said that without submarines, southeastern Connecticut would be much more heavily dependent on fishing or farming.
"I think we still have some tremendous assets. We have a great place to live. But there are other places along the water that are in desperate straits, economically," Mr. Gejdenson said.
"Submarines provided an infusion of training and technology that we never could have gotten any other way."
Throughout most of this century, almost everyone in and around Groton had some connection to the Navy, either through the base or the Electric Boat shipyard down the Thames River, where submarines are built.
"If you grew up in the area and you weren't going to college, you either went into the Navy or you went to work at Electric Boat," said Melvin E. Olsson, president of the Marine Draftsmen Association, one of the two large unions at the shipyard. His grandfather was on the crew that tested new construction submarines after World War II, and he recalls waiting on the dock with his grandmother for the boats to return. His father was a rigger, and Mr. Olsson started there in 1960 as an apprentice pipe fitter.
"It was always the best paying job you could get, and the opportunity to get a good, skilled trade, especially for someone who wasn't planning on college," Mr. Olsson said. "Most of your neighbors worked there, your parents probably worked there, it was the center of the community. Electric Boat reached into every neighborhood. Almost everyone in the area has, one way or another, been touched by Electric Boat."
Mr. Olsson said the nature of business has always been cyclical, and it has gotten a bit of a black eye in the last five years or so because as the Navy has ordered fewer submarines after the end of the Cold War, employment has plummeted almost two-thirds, from more than 25,000 to about 9,000.
"But many, many people around Connecticut, and even into Rhode Island and Massachusetts, have made a good living over the years from Electric Boat," Mr. Olsson said.
Electric Boat, which celebrated its own centennial last year, still has one of the largest payrolls in the state, $360 million last year. And the company has a reputation for innovation, a trait that has seen it through some downturns in the past. In the 1930's, when it was reporting $1 million a year in losses, the shipyard agreed to experiment with a welded-hull submarine, versus the riveted boats used in World War I. That work kept it in business until World War II, when it was churning out a new submarine every two weeks for a time.
After the war came another slump, which ended when the yard agreed to build the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, the U.S.S. Nautilus, and a few years later the first submarine that could fire missiles while submerged.
Today, the shipyard is working on the next-generation Virginia-class of submarine, which company officials said will help create a revolution in undersea warfare. In addition, it is involved with two teams chartered by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to look at completely new roles and capabilities for submarines, such as national missile defense.'
"Where will we be in another 100 years? It depends on whether the U.S. Navy continues to need submarines," said John K. Welch, president of the Marine Group of General Dynamics, the parent company of Electric Boat. "I would guess that with two-thirds of the world covered by water, submarines will continue to play a very vital role throughout the next century."
But the Navy's impact also goes beyond building and operating submarines, even beyond economic issues, local leaders said. Janet D. Pearce, executive director of the United Way of Southeastern Connecticut, said enlisted people and officers are some of the core volunteers for Little League, Boy and Girl Scouts, churches and social service organizations, whether hammering nails for a women's shelter or serving on the board of directors of a local agency.
In fact, Construction Battalion Unit 414 built the conference room at the United Way.
"They've done a lot of work on projects over the years that really put their skills to good use, things that could not have been done without the Navy," Mrs. Pearce said.
Cynthia H. Clegg, president of the Southeastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce, said the business community is working to establish stronger ties with the military through such efforts as its "Service Person of the Month" and "Service Person of the Year" awards ceremonies, and a "Military Appreciation Month," when members of the military are offered discounts.
"Locally, businesses are very aware of the benefits of having the military here -- they shop in our stores, buy their cars at local dealers -- and they are working hard to nurture that business relationship with the military, and the client relationship with people in the service," Ms. Clegg said. "That awareness is always increasing."
Despite that the attack submarine fleet has been cut by almost half nationwide, from 104 to 57, the Naval Submarine Base in Groton is still the home port of more than 20 submarines, only a few less than its Cold War peak, making it the most active submarine port in the United States. Because those submarines are more sophisticated than in the past, the work force has been fairly steady, with about 10,000 civilian and military employees. And with dozens of construction projects under way, from new piers to a new community center, it is likely to remain that way.
"I'd say, compared to the turmoil we saw during the base closure process in the 1990's, the future looks pretty good for submarines staying in southeastern Connecticut," said John C. Markowicz, executive director of the Southeastern Connecticut Enterprise Region, a business development group, and co-chairman of a group that helped save the base from three rounds of closures.
"In any round of base closing, the chief criterion is military value -- it all comes down to, what can you do for the fleet today?" Mr. Markowicz said. "The construction of the controlled industrial facility to handle nuclear waste, and the new barracks, and other new buildings around the base, just means they can do that much more for the fleet, which increases its vibrancy."
There is considerable debate about what date represents the true "birthday" of the submarine force. Some say it was April 11, 1900, when the Navy purchased the Holland VI from Electric Boat and its inventor, John P. Holland. Others contend it should be Oct. 12, 1900, when the Navy put the submarine into commission as the Holland, or SS-1.
Today every Navy submariner has to come to Groton at some point, because of the presence of the Naval Submarine School on the base. Enlisted people and officers all come for basic submarine school before they join the fleet, and for advanced training as they rise in rank.
The region is also the home of the Historic Ship Nautilus, which has been opened to tours since 1986 and hosts some 300,000 visitors a year. The Submarine Force Library and Museum is putting the finishing touches on a $4 million expansion that will almost double its space, with a grand opening slated for April 28.
To celebrate the submarine's centennial, the U.S. Submarine Veterans will host a Memorial Service next Sunday at the National Submarine Memorial East off Bridge Street in Groton. The combined officer and enlisted person Submarine Birthday Ball will be April 28 at Foxwoods Resort Casino, just north of the base. That same day, the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton will formally unveil an expansion that will for the first time focus on the Cold War missions of submarines. The Postal Service last Monday also issued a series of five postage stamps during day-of-issue ceremonies at the Dealey Center auditorium at the base, with more than two dozen clerks busily canceling stamps and covers for collectors.
Rear Adm. John B. Padgett III, who is the commander of the Navy's Northeast Region and whose headquarters are in Groton, grew up in the area, graduating from Norwich Free Academy before heading off to the Naval Academy. He returned to Groton two years ago as commander of the Navy's Northeast Region.
"My father was a submariner, and I watched the first ballistic missile submarines make their patrols out of Groton," Admiral Padgett said. "Now, to be back here at a time when we're honoring the first 100 years really is a source of great personal pride."

HEADLINE: Skilled Masons Are in Short Supply

BYLINE: By THOMAS STAUDTER 

 BODY:
ON a bright, breezy March morning, Michael Gualtiere, proprietor of Mike's Masonry, was laying concrete floors with his four-member crew at the New Chalet on the Lake, a condominium development in Mohegan Lake. Less than a mile away, in Shrub Oak, three Ecuadorean brothers and a cousin were fitting together a stone wall along East Main Street.
Warmer weather has awakened the sizable corps of masons in Westchester County from hibernation, and the craftsmen are again hard at work, turning stone, brick and concrete into walls, foundations, walkways and more. The age-old profession is changing, however, as each new season finds fewer and fewer true master masons plying their trade. 
 Booms in the construction and home improvement fields have put a premium on masonry work, even though many builders lament that many of those who call themselves masons are not as skilled as their predecessors, who were mostly Italian and Irish immigrants or their descendants.
"It's much harder these days to find a mason, especially a good one," said Robert G. Chamberlain, a landscape architect who has done extensive work in Westchester. "They're in high demand right now with the warm weather returning."
Young Americans, it seems, are not inclined to enter the field because of its grueling nature, and even with an influx of skilled masons from Central and South America, the demand exceeds the supply.
"I've always had a lot of work and a good clientele, but the last three years it's been super busy," Mr. Gualtiere, a 37-year-old Yorktown resident, said.
While munching on a hard-boiled egg, Mr. Gualtiere directed a concrete-mixing truck toward the foundation he was working on. After the mixer poured out its contents, Mr. Gualtiere, along with another mason, Michael Ryan, and three laborers waded into the half-foot deep expanse of fresh concrete and raked it out.
Then, using a screed, which is like a long, hollow two-by-four, Mr. Gualtiere and Mr. Ryan leveled and smoothed out the concrete, deftly working around dozens of pipes for the plumbing and electrical and heating systems of the building.
Mr. Gualtiere, who said he has been in the masonry business for 18 years, started out as a carpenter but realized "I liked working outside every day better," he said.
He and Mr. Ryan started out as laborers, completed apprenticeship programs and became members of Local 5 of the Bricklayers and Allied Craft Workers' Union. They left to work as independents in the late-80's when the economy slumped. "If you didn't have enough seniority, you didn't get the phone calls," Mr. Gualtiere said. "The union wasn't going to leave the old-timers at home -- and why should they have? We were just kids supporting our cars and drinking habits."
After smoothing out the floor, Mr. Gualtiere used a magnesium bull float, a rectangular metal mat attached to a long handle, to force out the bubbles in the hardening concrete.
"This is hard work," Mr. Gualtiere said, as he pushed and pulled the bull float across the floor. "There's no new generation of American kids who want to do this. They just want to wear baggy pants and play on computers. The Spanish guys really work hard and come to the job ready to go. They're your next generation of masons."
The construction boom has led to an increase in the number of masons in the Hudson Valley, said Rod Fortran, a labor market analyst with the State Department of Labor in Albany. His office projects that the number of masons in the region will rise to 2,400, from 1,800, between 1997 and 2007. But he said those numbers do not distinguish between union members, "master" masons and unskilled workers who simply build stone walls.
The reluctance of young Americans to enter the masonry field is readily apparent in the apprenticeship and training programs here in the county, where the class sizes have been shrinking for 15 years, said Erik Cantamessa, a third-generation mason who teaches at the Northern Westchester and Putnam Board of Cooperative Educational Services in Yorktown. "Right now I have the union and dozens of contractors knocking on my door looking for masons, but I don't have enough people to fill all the slots for the amount of jobs coming through."
The agency's masonry apprenticeship program attracts from 10 to 15 new high school students each year, although many students do not complete the two-year course.
"Moms and dads are giving their kids everything they want these days, and as a result the kids are not so eager to go to work," said Mr. Cantamessa, 37, of Mahopac, who is also a former instructor for the Bricklayers and Allied Craft Workers' Union.
He said the students who join the union "are making more money in two or three years on the job than I am now." The base salary, he said, begins at $10 an hour and climbs rapidly to $25 an hour, with benefits on union jobs totaling an additional $17 an hour.
The work is, indeed, arduous. Masons may profess to enjoy working outdoors, but that does not ease the burden of lugging 100-pound bags of concrete to a job site or unloading a truckful of concrete blocks on a hot, muggy day.
Whether the work is physically too hard or the pay too modest compared with office jobs, the fact is that fewer sons are following their fathers into masonry.
(No one interviewed for this article knew or had ever heard of any women working as masons. All the young women who started the apprenticeship program at the cooperative-education board eventually dropped out, Mr. Cantamessa said.)
"Working with my father gave me a certain level of pride," said David Anderson, the 33-year-old owner of Robert D. Anderson Company of New Rochelle, a business specializing in masonry restoration, which he bought from his father 10 years ago. "I started out at 13 mixing cement and loading bricks for him."
In his experience, Mr. Anderson said, "The younger workers in the field are more obsessed with the pay, and also they see jobs as temporary stopping points before they move on, as opposed to a career they'll stick with for decades."
Nearly all the brick work in the county today is done by union workers on publicly financed projects like government buildings and schools. In many buildings, brick work is being replaced by prefabricated materials that look like brick but come in sheets, and the brick-laying aspect of masonry is fast becoming a dying art.
Frank Capocci, a 55-year-old Port Chester resident and foreman at Robert D. Anderson Company, is representative of the vanishing breed of bricklaying masons. Born in Frosinone, Italy, Mr. Capocci came to the United States at age 17 and started attending the apprenticeship program run by Local 5 of the Bricklayers and Allied Craft Workers' Union.
"I went two nights a week to the union's apprentice school in White Plains," Mr. Capocci recalled, "and I had a terrific teacher, Mr. Palmer, who taught me how to lay bricks, lay steps out, make fireplaces and chimneys and also how to read a blueprint."
Mr. Capocci, a union member for 32 years, said that he does not mind teaching the trade to younger workers, but he added that many of the old-timers in the masonry field do not like to share their knowledge to perceived competitors or to those outside their immediate families.
"It's the same as when I was young, coming up the hard way," Mr. Capocci said. "But with less of the younger generation coming into the field, a lot of the older fellows will be taking what they know into retirement."
At Home Mason Supply Corporation, a family-run business in Peekskill, Keith Bobolia, one of its owners, said: "I've been here 22 years, and during that time the customers have certainly changed. When I came on board there were still a lot of Italians, first- and second-generation Italian-Americans, Irish-Americans from the trade unions and German contractors.
"Today, I'd say 90 percent of our customers are Spanish-speaking Latin and South Americans. I watched a lot of them work their way up after starting as laborers for other masons."
The emphasis at Home Mason Supply, as a result, has shifted toward stone work, Mr. Bobolia said. "The Spanish guys are, for the most part, excellent at building stone walls, patios, any kind of dry work involving stacked stones. You couldn't ask them to build a chimney, though; they wouldn't know how to lay it out."
Over time, he said, his customer base has shifted toward landscapers and away from builders, a trend that is evident in how material is stored in the supply yard: fieldstones and interlocking blocks are up front while bricks are way in the back.
Over in Shrub Oak, a 29-year-old mason from Ecuador who has been in this country illegally since 1991, said, "I knew when I came here that I would have to find a job in construction because I only finished grammar school in my country."
Starting out as a laborer, he eventually learned enough to work as a mason for a general contractor, making around $400 cash weekly.
"I think many American people don't want to get into this business because it's too hard," he said while shaping fieldstone with a mallet. "When I drive around with my boss and see the places where I've worked, I feel proud."

Converting for Dollars: A Co-op Becomes a Condo

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
THE 17-story Stratford House on Overlook Avenue in Hackensack seems no different than it did just 13 months ago, but the 133-unit building has since undergone a transformation from a co-op to a condominium, enhancing its value.
"We wanted to create interest so we could market the units and raise their values as well as increase the level of owner occupancy in the building," said Steven Muhlstock, president of the Stratford House Condominium Association and a 20-year resident. 
 A sales campaign will begin tomorrow at the building, where 119 resident owners converted their units since it became a condo three weeks ago. The conversion allows the remaining 14 owners to make the switch over the next two years.
The Stratford House is one of a small group of co-ops in New Jersey and the nation that have become condominiums in recent years. It is distinct, however, because it was a relatively financially healthy co-op -- unlike most co-ops that have tried the switch -- and as such its progress will be watched closely, industry professionals said. Residential Ownership Alternatives Hutton, a real estate consulting firm based in Iselin, organized the conversion plan.
The 31-year-old building, which contains one- to three-bedroom units plus penthouses, was converted to a co-op in 1980 and most of the units were sold before the real estate market fizzled in 1987. But since then, many owners have been unable to sell their units at the prices they paid. So they rented them instead, leaving the building with a 40 percent owner-occupancy rate.
As recently as eight months ago, units at the Stratford House sold in the mid-$30,000 to the mid-$70,000 range, said Marc Greenberg, executive vice president of the Pellogreen Group of Fort Lee, which manages the building.
Co-op purchasers buy stock in the co-op corporation, which entitles them to a proprietary lease to occupy their apartments. Through the board of directors they elect and the bylaws they adopt, owners control how their building is run, . including accepting or rejecting buyers.
Condo buyers purchase their apartments and an interest in the building's common areas, and can sell or rent their units without the approval of a co-op board. Because of these features, residential brokers said, condos sell for 20 percent more on average than similar co-ops.
At the Stratford House, "the conversion gives unit owners who paid high prices the opportunity to minimize their losses or recoup their investment, and those who paid low prices the chance to maximize their equity," said Jack H. Boyajian, a partner with David L. Muelken in R.O.A. Hutton. He said his company had converted a two-building co-op in Edgewater, was under contract to convert two others and was exploring six more conversions in the state.
In converting the Stratford House, which 80 percent of the unit owners approved, Mr. Boyajian said the building's single tax lot was divided into 133 tax lots, and its $2.7 million underlying mortgage, held by the Republic National Bank, had to be repaid. Owners also had to convert the individual share loans on their co-op units to conventional mortgages, he said, noting that both were accomplished as "a cash-free transaction."
The Columbia Federal Savings Bank, he said, provided owners with mortgages based on the appraised value of their units as condos, which was 30 to 40 percent higher than as co-ops. The Federal National Mortgage Association has agreed to buy the loans from Columbia Federal, he said.
Since the mortgages on individual apartments were larger than the share loans they replaced, the 119 owners who converted immediately were able to pay off their share of the underlying co-op mortgage, their individual end loans, closing costs and R.O.A.'s fee. In doing so, those owners paid down $2.3 million of the underlying mortgage.
Mr. Boyajian said a new $400,000 mortgage was also put in place that allows the remaining 14 unit owners to pay down their share of the underlying mortgage when they convert over the next two years.
Most unit owners will pay the same or slightly less in total monthly carrying costs on their condos as they did on their co-ops. For example, Mr. Boyajian said, a two-bedroom co-op that was bought in 1985 for $87,900 -- a similar one recently sold for $60,000 -- had a total monthly carrying cost of $1,094, made up of real-estate taxes, maintenance, its $25,000 share of the buildingwide mortgage and its payment on its $25,280 share loan. The monthly cost of that unit as a condo, which was appraised at $134,000 and received a new loan of $55,860, is $1,080, with the condo owner taking on about $5,000 in added debt.
Housing analysts cited several reasons why co-op boards in New Jersey have explored converting their buildings to condos. They said financial woes -- from foreclosures by banks to defaults on loans by sponsors -- that arose when the mid-80's boom deflated had negatively affected co-ops, as has the perception that they are more restrictive than condos.

THE co-op form of ownership, though widely used in New York, has also never caught on west of the Hudson River except in Fort Lee, just over the George Washington Bridge from Manhattan, which has attracted many New Yorkers familiar with the concept. There are 3,447 condominium buildings with 260,000 units in New Jersey, compared with 185 co-op buildings with 27,000 units, according to state figures.
Benjamin Lambert, a Woodbridge lawyer who specializes in co-op matters, said buyers "still don't get the concept because they are so used to buying an apartment, not shares in a corporation, and of getting a deed, not a proprietary lease." There is also the perception that condos are easier to finance and sell for higher prices than co-ops, he said.
The co-op market, hit hard by a real estate recession that sent values falling up to 50 percent, has rebounded as a result of the healthy housing market. But generally, co-op prices have not reached the same level as their peak in 1986 or come back as much as condos, brokers said.
In Fort Lee, where co-ops outnumber condos by a 2-to-1 ratio, "prices are close to where they were in '86," said Charles Oppler of Oppler-Ketive Realtors, which specializes in co-ops. Last year, 302 co-ops were sold at an average price of $105,738, compared with 215 units sold at an average price of $76,266 in 1997, he said, noting that in some buildings, "we're seeing prices we haven't seen in 10 years."
That is not the case in Hackensack, said Mr. Muhlstock, the board president of the Stratford House. He said that condo prices in this market were 20 percent higher than for similar co-ops and that over the last three years condo sales were five to seven times higher than co-op sales.
Meanwhile, the building's underlying mortgage was due to expire in 2003, he said, and added, "We knew that with a 40 percent owner-occupancy level, banks would not look at the building as a safe investment and would recast the loan at a higher interest rate." It was, he said, the right time to do the conversion.
Mr. Lambert said he encouraged his clients to examine "the pitfalls and promises of a conversion," which is difficult and time-consuming. A major hurdle, he said, is getting shareholders to agree. Other concerns, he said, are whether the underlying mortgage has a large prepayment penalty and whether more than nine units are still owned by the sponsor, which requires that a new public offering statement be filed with the state. At the Stratford House, the sponsor owned fewer than nine units.
There are also tax issues. With the higher appraised value of condos over co-ops, a conversion will result in higher property taxes. There could also be income tax consequences for the corporation and the shareholders in the form of income tax on any recognized gain resulting from the conversion of units not used as primary residences, he said.
Mr. Boyajian said his company worked with Hackensack's tax assessor to phase in the real estate taxes over four years. As for the federal income tax, he said the co-op corporation could use losses incurred over the years to offset any gains.
The sales campaign to reintroduce the Stratford House as a condominium will be controlled, Mr. Boyajian said. Twelve apartments, he added, will be put up for sale at one time, so not to flood the market, and at prices that are not lower than 90 percent or higher than 110 percent of their appraisals as condominiums, to maximize values.
To date, Mr. Muhlstock, who has no intention of selling his penthouse unit, said he "cannot see a downside to the conversion." The proof, he added, will be in the sales.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Downtown Brooklyn;
Open Only Two Years, a Hotel Is Ready to Expand

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
FROM the time the first discussions began until it opened its doors in July 1998, Renaissance Plaza in downtown Brooklyn was a 15-year undertaking, with much of the uncertainty that delayed the project centered on the 376-room hotel that is part of the 1.4-million-square-foot building, which also contains offices and stores.
But less than two years later, the hotel has been such a success that the center's developer, Joshua L. Muss of Muss Development, is negotiating with the city's Economic Development Corporation to put up a building on an adjacent site that would add 280 rooms to the hotel. 
 "We had thought about doing an addition, but we figured that it would be in the very distant future," Mr. Muss said. "It typically takes 50 years for something to become an icon in Brooklyn, but we seem to have done it in two years."
The hotel, which occupies the lower seven floors of the 30-story tower between Adams and Jay Streets, currently has an occupancy rate of 93 percent, said Ken Schwartz, general manager of the hotel, called the New York Marriott Brooklyn. This is an almost unheard of level of use for a hotel and well exceeds last year's 82.4 percent rate for Manhattan, itself high by historic standards.
"The weekends have been particularly surprising," Mr. Schwartz said. "Usually downtown hotels do not do well on weekends, but we have done well." With business conferences bringing guests into the hotel during the week, he said, social events like weddings and parties have kept it busy on the weekends.
Sean Hennessey, the director of the New York hospitality practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, agreed that the hotel had been unexpectedly successful. He said part of the reason was the high level of finish of the building and what he called "generous rooms."
But he said the affiliation with Marriott was important as well, both for the name and the operating experience the organization has brought to the management of the hotel.
Room rates have increased as a result of the unusually intense demand. When it opened in July 1998, the typical rate was $179 a night for the slow summer season, with an increase to $225 for the busier fall season.
The current rates, Mr. Schwartz said, are $199 to $259 a night on weekdays, and $149 to $190 a night on weekends.
Mr. Muss said that when the hotel part of Renaissance Plaza was originally designed, public spaces like meeting rooms and ballrooms were deliberately overemphasized, given the number of guest rooms. The building has 28,000 square feet of public space, including an 18,000-square-foot ballroom, the fourth-largest in the city.
He noted that the Manhattan hotels with larger public spaces, like the Marriott Marquis and the Sheraton New York have well over 1,000 guest rooms. "We just didn't have the guts or the financing to build on that scale," he said.
Mr. Schwartz said its relatively small number of rooms has hampered the hotel's ability to attract conventions and meetings with large numbers of attendees from out of town.
"We'll do over 90 percent in guest-room occupancy this year, but the banquet halls will be only about 50 percent," he said. "That's where we have room to grow, and that's why we need additional guest rooms."
One reason for the success of the Renaissance Plaza project, Mr. Muss said, is that it has something that is scarce in all urban locations: parking. In fact, indoor parking, 1,100 spaces in all. He said that most hotel guests who arrive by car are in taxis but that the parking is important for business meetings and social events like weddings.
And the parking is important to the tenants who have filled all but 10,000 square feet of the 825,000 square feet of the office space of the complex. Since the offices are mostly occupied during business hours, parking becomes available for events held during evenings and weekends.
The addition to the hotel would be a freestanding 23- or 24-story tower built immediately to the east of Renaissance Plaza on Adams Street. The city-owned site is currently occupied by low-rise masonry building that once housed an electrical substation.
Although the design for the structure is far from complete -- that is why it is not certain whether it will be 23 or 24 stories -- some concepts are already in place.
One is that there will be no separate entrance to the addition, which will be connected to the main building by a glass-enclosed, two-level bridge over a pedestrian walkway. The concept is to enhance security by directing all guests and visitors through the main lobby.
The reason for a two-level bridge is that one level would be for guests and the other for service operations. The guest-level bridge would connect at the second-story lobby level of the main building, right next to the front desk.
The bridge would take out two guest rooms in the main building, which is why the addition, which will have 282 rooms, will result in a net addition of 280.
The new building will provide guests an experience the existing hotel cannot: views of something other than downtown Brooklyn. The building across Adams Street that now houses the State Supreme Court is about 12 stories tall, so guests in the upper half of the building should have excellent views of midtown Manhattan or in the rooms facing the other way, of Coney Island and Sandy Hook.
BECAUSE the land is owned by the city, the project will have to go through a formal approval process before it is decided whether the site will be sold or leased on a long-term basis, a process Mr. Muss estimates will take from 12 to 18 months.
Michael Carey, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said he supports the project in general, noting that it will bring additional jobs and economic activity to downtown Brooklyn, which has lagged behind the revival of most of Manhattan.
"They didn't open a hotel in Brooklyn in half a century, and a little over a year later these people want to expand," Mr. Carey said. "That's good for Brooklyn."
He added the next step would be for the city to designate Mr. Muss as the developer of the project so he can proceed with his negotiations with Marriott and other sources of financing.
Mr. Muss said that once he has his financing and all the needed permits, the hotel could be built in about a year, which would mean it could open by the summer of 2002. The building, he said, would be "a straightforward accumulation of rooms," with none of the architectural and engineering problems posed by having large public spaces on low floors.
"It would be like an apartment building," he said. "They go up fast."
Mr. Muss, who is active as a developer in the boroughs outside Manhattan, said the performance of the hotel demonstrates that a Brooklyn location is not the drawback some people thought it to be.
He grins broadly as Mr. Schwartz tells about one result of the hotel's high occupancy rate.
"Sometimes we have to tell people trying to book a room here that we are filled up," he said. "We tell them that they will have to go into Manhattan."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
Strengthening Retail on Garden City's Franklin Ave.

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY

 BODY:
WHEN Gary Kahres, an owner of the Medical Shop at 949 Franklin Avenue, took over his Garden City store 20 years ago, he recalled recently, business was booming along the avenue, a thoroughfare that stretches southward from Old Country Road.
In late March, as a cold wind whipped down the sidewalk, there were few pedestrians, but still there were signs that the avenue, which began declining in the 1980's and which had major vacancies as recently as two years ago, might be headed for the retail revival that Mr. Kahres and other long-established retailers have been yearning for. 
 Shopkeepers are placing their hopes on several major redevelopment projects that are already luring new retailers, and on a $4 million street beautification project extending from Fifth to 11th Streets that was undertaken by the village last year and that is now receiving its final touches. Street improvements extending north of 11th Street to Old Country Road are scheduled to start this spring.
The Medical Shop, once a general bookstore and now specializing in books and other items for medical professionals, is a diehard on the street that once called itself the Fifth Avenue of Long Island but that began losing its luster because of competition from the nearby Roosevelt Field Shopping Center and other large retail centers.
The departure by Bloomingdale's to the Roosevelt Field mall in 1995 was a major blow to the street's upscale shopping image. Sears took over the vacant Bloomingdale's space. Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue and Talbot's still anchor the north end of the shopping district, but last year Saks announced that it was planning to relocate to Roosevelt Field. The plan was unsuccessful only because because Simon Properties, the mall's owner, failed to receive the special-use permit it needed from the Town of North Hempstead for additional construction to accommodate Saks.
Mr. Kahres, busy with a stream of customers, said people who shopped at his specialized store would find it inconvenient to go to a mall, so that he never considered moving there. "Still," he said, "I would like to see the street loaded with people the way it once was." Many view the renovation by Renaissance Development of 833-55 Franklin Avenue, with a total of 75,000 square feet, as the catalyst of a retail revival. The building was once occupied by the Abraham & Straus department store, which moved out in 1995.
Renaissance, which is a joint venture of the Albanese Development Corporation of Garden City and the Castagna Realty Company of Manhasset, bought the handsome brick building in 1998. Its $9 million gut rehabilitation has created 40,000 square feet of office space on the upper two floors and 20,000 square feet of retail space on the ground level.
The building, which also has a 16,000-square-foot basement, has a new lobby and new elevators. The exterior has been restored and large new windows were installed on the ground level for new stores. Bentel & Bentel of Locust Valley and Angelo Francis Corva of Manhasset were the architects for the renovation.
The office space on the upper floors has been leased: Salomon Smith Barney took 35,000 square feet in September and the Silverberg & Hunter law firm will soon move into the remaining 5,000 square feet.
The building also has its first retail tenant, New York Sports Clubs, a health club, which has leased 21,000 square feet including the entire basement and is scheduled to open for business in May.
If discussions with two potential tenants -- one a casual clothing store, the other a home furnishings store -- are successful, the remaining 14,000 square feet of retail space will also be leased, said Russell G. Matthews, executive vice president at Albanese Development.
Across the street at 888 Franklin Avenue, Renaissance has taken what were formerly four storefronts, three of which were vacant, and is combining them as 11,500 square feet that have been leased to Kings Super Markets. The chain, which is based in Parsippany, N.J., specializes in gourmet foods and other specialty grocery products.
The block occupied by the two Renaissance properties, between Stewart Avenue to Ninth Street, was considered the most distressed on Franklin Avenue because of its almost 90,000 square feet of vacant space.
"Franklin Avenue is the face of the village and as people drove by and saw these empty stores the perception was that all of Garden City was undergoing some sort of economic decline," Mr. Matthews said. "That was not the case because each building had its own story and reason for being vacant."

LARGE vacancies still exist. Of the 1.5 million square feet of retail space along Franklin Avenue, which includes the three big department stores, 90,000 square feet in the smaller locations is still vacant, according to the Garden City Chamber of Commerce.
However, other players in addition to Renaissance are buying properties with plans to renovate. A partnership of Vincent Polimeni of Garden City and Edward Kalikow of Westbury has bought the 47,000-square-foot three-story-and-basement office building at 1000 Franklin Avenue and is planning to convert the street level to retail space once a lease held by the Astoria Federal Savings Bank expires next year.
"We bought our building six months ago perceiving an opportunity," Mr. Polimeni said. "We intend to complement what Renaissance has done and to revive Franklin with quality retail."
Some of Franklin Avenue's older office buildings will also be refurbished. Renaissance is in contract to buy a 50,000-square-foot building at 1122 Franklin Avenue that had been the headquarters of the Roosevelt Savings Bank. It plans to renovate the building to multiple offices and has already started marketing the space.
A 33,000-square-foot building at 901 Franklin Avenue vacated by Salomon Smith Barney for its move to the Renaissance building has been acquired by TDK Electronics of Port Washington for its new headquarters.
Another pending office renovation is at 501 Franklin Avenue, a 150,000-square-foot building modeled on Hampton Court in England, built by Doubleday, Page & Company, the publishing house, in 1910 and now boarded up. Doubleday & Company was bought by Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate, in 1987 and was renamed Doubleday Direct.
The Bertelsmann subsidiary, whose editorial offices are in Manhattan, occupies 100,000 square feet at 401 Franklin Avenue next door to the 501 Franklin Avenue building, which it owns. Doubleday Direct is now known as Bookspan, reflecting its joint-venture partnership with Book-of-the-Month Club Holdings, which is owned by Time Inc., a unit of Time Warner. The 501 Franklin Avenue building will be renovated, but plans are still indefinite, said Malka Margolies, a spokeswoman for Bookspan.
Even though 501 Franklin Avenue is south of the shopping area, the looming presence of a major empty building did not help the business district, so its future renovation is an important component of any turnaround, said Bertram Donley, president of the Chamber of Commerce.
In a 1997 report issued by the Garden City Planning Coalition, a group organized by the village to come up with strategies to revitalize the business district, recommendations included beautification of Franklin Avenue, adding public parking spaces to the village's current 5,200, forming a business improvement district, and recruiting retailers that would complement the existing stores. A street beautification project completed by the village in 1986 on Seventh Street turned it into a bustling shopping street with no vacancies. Village officials now hope that the Seventh Street success story will spill over to Franklin Avenue.
"We have done our part in improving the public properties and making them pedestrian-friendly and I am very encouraged by the activities we are seeing," said Robert L. Schoelle Jr., the village administrator.
Many visualize Garden City as becoming the role model for other downtowns that have seen an economic decline. "I believe the concept of the mall is wearing off a little bit and people would just like to have the experience of strolling through a quaint village with upscale stores," Mr. Kalikow said.
William B. Kuhl in Manhattan was the landscape architect, designer and planner for Franklin Avenue's street revitalization project, as well as for Seventh Street's.
"The major element that makes malls attractive is a lot of stores in one spot, but pleasant they are not," Mr. Kuhl said. "The downtown experience becomes more of a social event in enjoyable surroundings."
For Franklin Avenue, Mr. Kuhl designed a series of elements. At the intersection of Stewart Avenue, he placed a gazebo at one corner, a fountain at another and a rose garden at a third. Alleyways leading to public parking were given hanging vines.
With a 25-foot wide sidewalk to work with, Mr. Kuhl indented some areas to provide parallel parking. The on-street parking has two purposes, he said: encouraging passing motorists to pull up and shop and helping to slow traffic as cars pull out into the traffic lanes. Decorative lampposts, lighting, benches, street trees, and extensive landscaping are other highlights of the beautification project.
"We like to think that with our design we have set the table and now it's up to the Chamber of Commerce to bring the guests to dinner and get the businesses into town," Mr. Kuhl said. "Designing a beautiful streetscape won't have everyone banging on your door, but with some new businesses already moving in, results can already be seen."

HEADLINE: In All 5 Boroughs, High Goes Higher

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
NO getting away from it: everywhere in New York City home prices just keep climbing -- from the rarefied heights of Manhattan where 11 apartments have sold for $10 million or more so far this year, compared with just six in all of 1999, to every single ZIP code area in the city's other boroughs.
A studio in Manhattan costs 31 percent more than it did only a year ago, one survey says; a one-bedroom, 29 percent more. A family's income now needs to exceed $100,000 to cover the costs of a well-kept brownstone in Harlem, according to the president of the neighborhood's real estate board. 
 The cost of a one-bedroom condominium in Astoria, Queens, which was $95,000 in 1998, climbed to $120,000 in '99. And a detached colonial in Forest Hills that sold for $267,000 in 1996 went for -- "Are you ready?" the broker said -- $417,000 last year. Even in struggling East New York, Brooklyn, the average price for a single-family house rose 8.4 percent in 1999, from $140,789 to $152,585.
One family tried to get away, however briefly, from this frantic house-buying scene, said Susan Goldy, the president of the Bronx brokerage company that bears her name, and it cost them their dream house.
Nestled into a hillside in Riverdale, the Mediterranean-style three-bedroom with a terrace and sunken living room had been snatched up -- verbally -- for $515,000. "Then the couple went on vacation," Ms. Goldy said.
"They came back a week later, and there were three offers beyond theirs," she said, "and now the house is selling at $565,000" -- a $50,000 leap in only two weeks.
"The last people, the ones accepted at $565,000, told the seller that they were going on vacation," Ms. Goldy said. "He, in turn, told them they had to sign the contract, have everything done, before they left or no deal."
And it's a good thing, Ms. Goldy said, "because there are now other interested parties."
Oh, so many interested parties -- particularly in buyer-maddening Manhattan -- are bidding with abandon. "The bidding is where the rubber meets the road, a hint of where we're going," said Barbara Corcoran, the chairwoman of the Corcoran Group. "We have dozens of buyers for every good apartment and a half dozen for every one that's not so good."
"Six months ago," Ms. Corcoran said, "our average overbid was 8 percent, meaning the offer over asking price. Since January, that has jumped to 14 percent. To me, overbids tell more of the story than the sales prices."
Kirk Henckels doesn't quite know what tale is being told by the prices in his stratospheric market niche. Mr. Henckels is the director of Stribling Private Brokerage, specializing in homes selling for at least $3 million, "but given the increases of the last three years," he said, "we're probably going to have to double that."
Especially puzzling is a sudden burst of ionospheric activity. "All of last year, there were six prewar co-ops in Manhattan that closed at $10 million or above," Mr. Henckels said. "Now, in the first three months of 2000 there have been 11," the highest about $35 million for the 17,000-square-foot apartment at 740 Park Avenue once owned by John D. Rockefeller.
"Who knows?" Mr. Henckels said when asked why there is suddenly so much rare-air movement. "This very high end of the market is usually conservative, even though the expenditure is a relative pittance to them. When this group buys, they seem to do it en masse, as if they'd gotten on the phone the night before and said, 'Let's go shopping tomorrow.' I've watched this for 20 years."
But even for regular folks, housing costs keep climbing. For the second straight year, according to the repeat-sales survey conducted by Case Shiller Weiss, a real estate statistics company, prices appreciated last year in every one of the 130 ZIP code areas in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island (the survey does not include Manhattan). In 1997, by comparison, 14 areas saw prices drop, and in 1996 that number was 30.
New York City's house-price picture is not all that different from that of the nation and the rest of the region, except for one significant aspect. In 1999, for the fourth straight year, the national median price for an existing single-family home set a record, rising to $133,300 from $128,400 in 1998. In the region, the median price hit $208,000 last year, up from $187,400 in 1998.
The difference, said Rae Rosen, the senior regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is that, even more than its suburbs, the city is "pretty much landlocked, so we're bidding up a fixed supply."
At the same time, with the economy in its 109th month of expansion (the longest in history), with the stock market pumping out bonuses and dividends and with consumer confidence strong, buyers are out in force.
To be sure, more and more of them are out there because more people are working. "The job picture in New York City has been exceptionally strong in recent years," said John Weiting, the regional commissioner of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, "and in 1999 employment in the city's private sector gained more momentum."
The city added 81,000 private-sector jobs during 1999, raising the total to 3.1 million. "The 1999 increase topped the 76,000 gain in 1998," Commissioner Weiting said, "with the number of jobs added the largest for any year in nearly half a century." Between 1989 and 1992, during a deep downturn, the city lost 321,000 private-sector jobs. But by last December, the unemployment rate was 6 percent, down from 7.6 percent the year before and down from 11.3 percent in 1992.
Rising mortgage rates might be expected to take some of the house-buying steam out of that expanding work force, and financing costs have certainly risen recently. "We are at about four-year highs for the standard 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, hovering near 8.3 percent," said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage statistics company in Butler, N.J. "But as you might expect, a steady rise in fixed rates has given resurgence to adjustable-rate mortgages," which offer a lower-cost alternative to traditional fixed-rate financing, at least for a time -- usually 3, 5, 7 or 10 years -- before they are adjusted downward, with any luck, but quite possibly up.
"Some 30 percent of mortgages being originated right now have some form of adjustable rate, up sharply from 10 percent in January '99," Mr. Gumbinger said. "And part of the reason home sales have done so well is because there are these alternatives to rising fixed rates."
Another part of the reason, in Ms. Corcoran's view, is that the rising rates "have only added fuel to the fire and increased the urgency to buy."
"People are asking, 'If not now, when will I buy?' " she said.
All of which leaves Ms. Rosen of the Federal Reserve duly optimistic about the city's housing prospects. "You know what's exciting?" she said. "Twenty years ago, it used to be that 96th Street in Manhattan was sort of a cut-off, and now you can keep going, and the health of the area is clear for almost another 30 blocks. Storefronts are no longer closed up. There are new window frames all over."
"If you go right outside Forest Hills in Queens, it looks like a mini-United Nations," Ms. Rosen continued. "It's astounding how various groups have migrated to the United States and invigorated communities. There's a similar robust Russian community that has created million-dollar homes in parts of Brooklyn."
Prof. Michael Schill, the director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law, is a little less sanguine. Given recently released data from the city's 1999 Housing and Vacancy Survey, he said, "one might be surprised by the rapid increase in prices over the past few years."
The survey shows that between 1996 and 1999 the rate of increase for the city's housing supply outpaced population growth. Over those three years, housing units rose by 1.5 percent while the city's population went up 0.8 percent.
"Yet, despite the fact that housing supply was increasing faster than population, vacancy rates actually declined," Professor Schill pointed out, from 4.01 percent in 1996 to 3.19 percent in 1999. Five percent is the statutory benchmark for declaring a housing emergency, allowing rent regulations to be continued.
There has been considerable increase in residential construction. In 1999, building permits for 12,421 housing units were issued, according to the Department of City Planning, a 19.6 percent increase over the 10,387 units authorized in 1998.
Professor Schill offers several reasons why the housing crunch has continued, even though construction outpaced population growth. Pointing out that between 1996 and 1999, the city's median household income rose by 11.5 percent, from $29,600 to $33,000, he said: "First, families were able to pay more for housing and, therefore, bid up sales prices and rents. Second, households that were doubled up with friends and relatives are now be able to move into their own homes."
At the same time, the Census Bureau may be underestimating population growth. "This seems likely," Professor Schill said, "given that we are experiencing extremely high levels of immigration, a substantial portion of which is probably illegal."
Other causes for the crunch: most of the new construction is luxury rental apartments, not co-ops or condominiums, and conversions of existing buildings to co-ops and condominiums are, at best, rare.
All of which pushes up prices.
DIVINING real estate trends by the numbers is, at best, a murky exercise. To begin with, co-op sales are not officially recorded because, technically, they are securities transactions involving the selling of shares, and not transfers of title. Condominium sales, however, are officially recorded. As a result, studies of co-op data compiled by brokerage houses and appraisal concerns do not claim to include all transactions in the market. At the same time, some market surveys report average prices, while others use a median -- meaning half the prices are above that figure and half below. Still, the numbers, along with anecdotal impressions, can serve as barometers of market patterns.
In Manhattan, the median price for all residential sales -- combining co-op and condominium transfers -- from the Battery north to West 116th Street and East 96th Street was $320,000 in 1999, up 14.3 percent from $280,000 in 1998, according to Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, the appraisal company that prepares perhaps the most comprehensive sales survey, the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report. The number of sales for the same area of Manhattan was 8,154, up 8.1 percent from the 7,542 transactions in 1998.
For studios, the Elliman report said, the median price was $136,000, up 12.4 percent from $121,000 in 1998. For one-bedrooms, it was $260,000, up 10.6 percent from $235,000. The median for two-bedrooms was $595,000, up 9.2 percent from $545,000; for three-bedrooms, $1,595,000, up 25.1 percent from $1,275,000. And for four or more bedrooms, it was $3.4 million, up 13.1 percent from $3,006,145.
The Real Estate Board of New York offers a localized assessment.
The median price for prewar apartments on the East Side, between 42nd and 96th Streets was $632,500, up 7 percent from $592,500 in 1998. For postwar apartments on the East Side, the median was $350,000, up 40 percent from $250,000. On the West Side, from 42nd Street up to 110th Street, prewar apartments sold for a median of $432,500, up 31 percent from 1998, when it was $329,000; and for postwar apartments it was $316,000, up 36 percent from $232,000.
Gregory Heym, the chief economist for the real estate board, explained that according to the board's guidelines, a studio usually contains 1 to 2 1/2 rooms with, perhaps, a separate kitchen and an alcove. One-bedrooms run from 2 1/2 to 4 rooms with a living room, a kitchen and, perhaps, a dining area. Two-bedrooms run from 4 to 7 rooms; three-bedrooms, from 5 1/2 to 10 rooms including, perhaps, a maid's room and a library, and four-bedroom apartments contain 11 or more rooms.
For everything south of 42nd Street, pre- and postwar combined, Mr. Heym said, the median price was $264,500 up 30 percent from the 1998 figure of $202,800.
It is certainly a seller's market. "There's one thing holding people back when you talk to them," Mr. Heym said. "They say, 'I'd love to sell, but then where am I going to go?' "
Mr. Miller pointed out that the overall numbers -- that 14.3 percent rise for all co-ops and condos -- may be misleading. "Because the economy is so good, due to Wall Street, Silicon Alley and the entertainment sectors, there's a lot of entry-level younger buyers moving into the market," he said. Those buyers tend toward studios and one-bedroom apartments.
"Because so many more smaller apartments are transferring," Mr. Miller said, "they pull the overall prices down so that a reader of the statistics may not fully appreciate how much prices have actually increased."
Ms. Corcoran appreciates it. "We had, last week, a large two-bedroom on Fifth Avenue that every broker agreed was grossly overpriced," she said. "It was overbid by three buyers, 33 percent over asking, from $1.8 million up to $2.4 million."
"Everybody was stunned," Ms. Corcoran said, "including the hard-to-shock seller."
Clark Halstead, the founder of the Halstead Property Company, tried to put it in perspective. "Take a Park Avenue building in the high 80's, a distinguished prewar where there are numerous six-room apartments," he said. "Classic Sixes" are considered the prototypical family apartments in Manhattan: living room, dining room, kitchen, two bedrooms and a maid's room.
"Our records show that four sales of this six-room type in 1990 averaged $606,000," Mr. Halstead said, "and in 1999, four more sold -- not the same ones -- for an average of $1,320,000. That's a 120 percent increase."
"The hue and cry of the cocktail party circuit is that apartment prices have gone berserk," Mr. Halstead said. "But compare that 120 percent to financial assets, like the Standard & Poor's 500, which went up 400 percent over the decade."
Andrew Heiberger is the president of Citi Habitats, which focuses on the expanding downtown market. "My average number of calls for people willing to spend $1 million or more has doubled, to two a day," he said.
The tight rental market is driving up sales prices, Mr. Heiberger said, as is "the fact that many proposed conversions from commercial to residential were canceled because the commercial market went so crazy."
According to Citi Habitat sales, the median price for a studio below 14th Street was $165,000 last year, compared with $135,000 in 1998, a 22.2 percent increase. For 1-bedrooms, it was $260,000, up 20.9 percent from $215,000. Two-bedrooms climbed to $462,000, up 21.9 percent from $380,000. And 3-bedrooms were $720,000, up 9.1 percent from $660,000.
The upper uptown market is getting pricey.
"Just this winter," said R. Kenyatta Punter, the president of the Greater Harlem Board of Realtors, "a one-family, three-story brownstone at 416 Convent sold for $660,000." In 1998, it would have sold for $600,000, he said.
Other than in dilapidated buildings requiring renovation or government-subsidized new construction, "it's becoming increasingly difficult for persons making $50,000 to $70,000 to find home-ownership opportunities in the Harlem community," Mr. Punter said. "Your income really has to exceed $100,000 in order to make the kind of purchase I cited."
There is no central source for price data, by the dollar, for Brooklyn. But by another measure of the market, the Case Shiller Weiss repeat-sales index, the direction is clear: every one of the borough's 36 ZIP code areas saw prices rise last year.
THE survey is based on a table showing the average price for all single-family homes sold by ZIP code area, year by year. To determine price fluctuations in 1999, the survey took the purchase price of each home sold in each ZIP code area during the year, compared it to the price the house brought the last time it sold, and then, using the annual index, adjusted the earlier price to what it likely would have been had it sold in 1998. The 1999 prices for homes within each ZIP code area were then compared with the estimated 1998 prices to compute the change.
Of the 36 Brooklyn areas, 1 increased by up to 4 percent, 34 by 4 to 8 percent and one -- Bay Ridge -- by 8 to 12 percent.
"While the rise was universal over all the areas that we deal with," said Christopher Thomas, the William B. May Company's senior vice president for Brooklyn, "there are certain areas with houses at the lower end of our price spectrum that rose higher than those in more established communities." Mr. Thomas's company specializes in the more affluent areas of the borough, like Brooklyn Heights, with neighborhoods like Fort Greene at that lower end of the company's spectrum.
"Where in late '98 a four-story town house in Fort Greene was selling for $635,000," Mr. Thomas said, "there's one currently in contract for $850,000."
In Brooklyn Heights, a year ago, he said, at least half a dozen brownstones were listed for under $2 million, while now all but two are listed between $2 million and $3 million. "Last year, you could still buy one-bedroom apartments in the $150,000 to $200,000 range; now they go for closer to $300,000," Mr. Thomas said.
Brooklyn's less affluent communities are also appreciating. Jacob Shayovitz, a certified appraiser and the president of the Brooklyn Board of Realtors, cited one section of East New York where the average price last year was $140,789, up 8.4 percent from $152,586. "It shows that people are taking more pride in home ownership, maintaining them better," Mr. Shayovitz said. In one area of middle-income Midwood, he said, "homes sold for an average of $299,231 in 1998; in 1999, for $301,729."
In Queens, according to the Long Island Board of Realtors, which covers the borough, the median price in December was $190,000, up 2.7 percent from $185,000 in 1998. And according to the Case Shiller survey, 13 of the borough's 57 ZIP code areas experienced increases up to 4 percent, 24 by 4 to 8 percent, 18 by 8 to 12 percent and two -- Fresh Meadows and Howard Beach -- by 12 percent or more.
Barbara Frechter, the president of Glenjay Realty in Forest Hills, said she sold a three-bedroom detached colonial between Austin Street and Queens Boulevard for $267,000 at the end of 1996, "and in '99 it sold for -- are you ready? -- $417,500."
"The same person we sold that house for bought in Cord Meyer, the north side of Queens Boulevard where there are large, beautiful homes," Ms. Frechter said. "That house had five bedrooms, a kind of custom-built split, and it sold for $550,000."
A two-bedroom co-op on Queens Boulevard that sold for $85,000 in 1998, she said, "would now be $95,000 to $100,000, absolutely."
In Astoria, "because it's so close to the city," Ms. Frechter said, a one-bedroom condominium that sold for $85,000 to $95,000 a year ago "is now selling for $120,000."
And a three-family, semidetached house in Astoria that sold for $270,000 in 1998 "went for $370,000 in '99," Ms. Frechter said, a whopping 37 percent jump.
The statistics kept by the Bronx Board of Realtors are incomplete. But the Case Shiller report indicated that all 25 of the borough's ZIP code areas saw prices increase: 1 by up to 4 percent, 23 by 4 to 8 percent and 1 -- Throgs Neck -- by 8 to 12 percent.
One broker, Haniff Baksh, the vice president of ERA Besmatch, conducted his own survey, based on deed transfers recorded by the Department of Buildings. For Throgs Neck, Pelham Parkway and Mosholu in the northeast Bronx, 1999 prices averaged $180,000 for a one-family home and $230,000 for a two-family. "In '98, those numbers were slightly less, about $170,000 for a one-family and $220,000 for a two-family," Mr. Baksh said. In the once-desolate South Bronx, single-family homes now average $150,000, compared with about $135,000 a year ago, Mr. Baksh said, while two-family homes average $200,000, up 10 percent from $180,000 a year ago.
"There's a lot of investor activity helping to revitalize these areas," he said. "There's some subsidized housing, of course, but that's not the bulk of it; this is private activity."
Ms. Goldy, the broker in Riverdale, cited rapid-fire price rises in her neighborhood. "We closed on a combination apartment -- two one-bedrooms -- in July at $250,000," she said. "And the very same apartment, for unusual reasons, came back on the market in January and sold for $275,000."
A one-bedroom co-op on Kappock Street sold for $50,000 in December 1998, she said, "and we closed on another one-bedroom in the same building in January 2000 for $74,000."
On Staten Island, said Sandy Krueger, the executive vice president of the borough's Board of Realtors, the median price for single-family homes was $177,000 in 1999, a 7.3 percent increase over 1998's $165,000. For two-family homes, it was $250,000, up 14.7 percent from $218,000. And for condominiums and co-ops, the median was $107,000, an 18.9 percent jump from $90,000. According to Case Shiller, all 12 ZIP code areas on Staten Island saw prices increase by 4 to 8 percent last year.
Getting site-specific, Mr. Krueger said that "in West Brighton, on the north shore, the median for single-family homes was $151,500," a 25.2 percent increase over $121,000. For two-families, it was $159,900, 10.3 percent over 1998's $145,000.
For Heartland Village, in mid-island, the single-family median was $202,000, 12.2 percent over $180,000; and for two-families, it was $279,900, a 14.2 percent increase over $245,000 in 1998. And in Huguenot, on the south shore, the median for single-family homes hit $355,000, up 8.7 percent over $326,500 in 1998.
Mr. Thomas of William B. May in Brooklyn proffered perhaps the only sure-fire solution for price-battered buyers.
"We had a couple selling a co-op in Brooklyn Heights who signed a contract to purchase a town house in Prospect-Lefferts for $325,000," Mr. Thomas said. "The house closing took longer than expected because they had to sell their co-op."
"If they didn't go through with the deal they would forfeit their 10 percent deposit," he said. "Then, coincidentally, during that delay, they inherited a house in Westchester."
Even though they were not going to live in the Prospect-Lefferts house, the couple decided to go through with the deal, and then put it on the market. "We sold it immediately for $375,000 -- a $50,000 profit," Mr. Thomas said. "It just indicates the degree to which the market rose over just that four-month period."
A postscript: The couple had purchased their Brooklyn Heights co-op in 1996 for $120,000. They sold it for $320,000. "They made out pretty well," Mr. Thomas said.

Urban Renewal, on Canvas: Camden Sits for a Portrait

BYLINE: By FRED B. ADELSON 

DATELINE: HADDON TOWNSHIP

 BODY:
SINCE the 17th century, artists have been interested in painting city views that are topographically and architecturally accurate. Images of Rome, Venice, Paris, or New York may easily come to mind. But Camden?
For more than 25 years, William M. Hoffman Jr. has been painting portraits of Camden. What he has created is an engaging series of approximately 60 images in oil or casein paint as well as watercolor that depict a variety of buildings and street scenes from all sections of the city. Twenty-two of these urban subjects, dating from 1979 to 1999, are on view here at the Hopkins House Gallery. 
 Artistic activity in Camden has long been documentary and illustrative. A year after the city's incorporation in 1828, John James Audubon was the first professional artist to work in the newly established city. He settled there to observe the springtime migration of warblers and other birds that were traveling north. A period of rapid growth soon took place, changing the city from what was a rural 19th-century ferry stop on the Delaware River to a major industrial center of the early 20th century.
Even before the construction of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge in the 1920's, everything from soup to paper boxes to battleships was manufactured in Camden. "On Camden's supplies the world relies" was the slogan of the city's Board of Trade. Many of the architectural subjects painted by Mr. Hoffman date back to this period of booming economic prosperity.
It was not until 1974 that the artist started to make charcoal drawings of sites near the Camden campus of Rutgers University, where as a professor of art he has been teaching painting since 1967. Mr. Hoffman lives in the suburb of Woodlynne and occasionally rides his bicycle to class. Familiar with the back roads of the neighboring city, he has roamed all over Camden to find subjects that interest him. None of his images are based on photographs. Mr. Hoffman is dedicated to painting en plein air, which means working outdoors.
"It is much more interesting and immediate to work directly on the site," he said. "I see the place more clearly. I feel more a part of the community and its people. Things are always changing; the weather and light conditions; the blowing canvas." His small strokes of loose brushwork enhance the naturalism and immediacy that he effectively captures.
Mr. Hoffman flatters Camden. The sun always seems to be shining. Like John Constable, he is fascinated by cloud-patterned blue skies that add a nonthreatening sense of drama to what are essentially idyllic images of the cityscape. He sees a place where there are no abandoned houses, graffiti or litter. In addition, he eliminates most of the telephone poles, traffic lights and fireplugs.
Two of Mr. Hoffman's very successful and most panoramic images are "View of Camden with City Hall" and "View of Philadelphia from Camden." The former was painted in 1983 from the roof of Victor Hall, a seven-story RCA building that was given to Rutgers but has subsequently been torn down. The elevated point of view allows the artist to present the city's eclectic mix of architecture, while he also creates a composition of geometric forms and patches of contrasting pink and green colors. The other image is a view looking from the eastern shoreline toward Philadelphia; the Benjamin Franklin Bridge looms up from the right side. Working on a pathway that is used by residents of Camden to pick wild berries and to fish in the Delaware, Mr. Hoffman includes the foreground vegetation and the boating activity on the river.
This scenic vista is a bittersweet one. The loss of manufacturing jobs and the closing of factories has been devastating to the city. On the other hand, new construction, like the towers of Liberty Place, is an obvious sign of the healthy economy of nearby Philadelphia.
Mr. Hoffman steadfastly refuses to depict Walt Whitman's house, one of the city's most historic properties. Because the celebrated residence is on the south side of Mickle Street, it doesn't receive direct sunlight preventing the artist from representing an aesthetically pleasing image. In addition, he feels that the widening of the street into a major thoroughfare has destroyed the original 19th-century village ambiance of the neighborhood.
"I want to emphasize the vitality of a community," Mr. Hoffman said. The painter, who is essentially a realist artist, has depicted several street scenes populated with groups of people enjoying their surroundings. "Helene Apartments," the largest canvas in the show, is a slice-of-life view at the intersection of Third and Cooper Streets. The foreground tree trunk is a classic framing device and contrasts with the vertical stacks of the Campbell Soup factory in the distance. The artist's brushwork nicely suggests the gray stonework of the castellated building with corner towers. This was one of the first apartment houses in the city. Although it may seem hard to believe, the painter maintains that the boy on a pony (cropped at the far right) did ride by while he was working on the canvas in 1983.
Mr. Hoffman will have an additional selection of works from his Camden series on display at the Markeim Art Center in Haddonfield from Wednesday through May 17. An opening reception will take place there on April 8 from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Like a preservationist, Mr. Hoffman documents an ever-changing urban landscape. In an illustrated booklet to accompany the two exhibits of the Camden series, Roberta K. Tarbell acknowledged that Mr. Hoffman "offers us his interpretation of Camden, New Jersey, a city often maligned . . . He challenges us to recognize the rich tapestry of architectural history that exists and urges us to build what time and indifference have destroyed in the once radiant city."

Reasonable and Customary, But in Whose Eyes?

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Jennifer Steinhauer covers health care for The Times. Her column on the economics of health care will appear the first Sunday of each month. E-mail may be sent to
jestei@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
OPENING an "explanation of benefits" letter from a health insurance company is a little like playing blackjack in a casino: Chances are you're going to lose; the question is how much.
While the majority of Americans insured through their employers are now enrolled in H.M.O.'s, and thus make minimal co-payments on doctor's visits, a lot of us -- me included -- still get medical care the old-fashioned way, paying the doctor up front, filing a claim and waiting for reimbursement. The same system applies to patients in preferred provider plans who choose to see doctors outside the network. 
 What makes this seem like a losing gamble is that reimbursement checks rarely come close to covering the doctor bill. Rather, the insurance company pays some portion of what its explanation-of-benefits form calls a "reasonable and customary" fee.
Meaning what, exactly? I doubt that "reasonable and customary" is the $95 that my pediatrician (who is outside my preferred provider network) charges for a hepatitis B vaccine; my informal survey indicates that this is high, even by Manhattan standards. I also suspect that it isn't the $17 my insurance plan deemed "reasonable and customary" for the polio vaccine he billed at a fairly typical $40.
Conspiracy theorists might conjure images of nurses sitting in a wood-paneled study, eyeballing claims in a sinister way -- and paying 40 percent of whatever a doctor charges.
In fact, the process is a lot more complex, even if the results are equally unsatisfying.
 MOST insurers rely on data produced for years by the Health Insurance Association of America. (It recently sold the operation to a company called Ingenix.) Doctors are surveyed by region to see what they will accept as payment for procedures. That data is organized into percentile groups; "H.I.A.A. 80," for instance, is the fee that 80 percent of doctors in a region will accept for a service. Many also factor in Medicare reimbursement rates.
But you can't assume that anything close to H.I.A.A. 80 is what your insurance means by "reasonable and customary." Instead, insurance companies present the data to employers, who choose the level upon which they wish to base reimbursements.
In other words, "reasonable and customary" is very much in the eye of the beholder.
To you and me, the costs of those calculations can add up quickly. Say your eye doctor charges $500 for a comprehensive exam. Now assume that your employer has opted for H.I.A.A. 80 as its "reasonable and customary" rate, and that the surveys peg that fee for the exam at $200. If your benefits cover 80 percent of "reasonable and customary," you get a check for $160. You were holding 12; you've just drawn a queen.
Now, you probably want someone to blame. Obviously, your boss or union is a good place to start. "Most people don't understand that it is their employer who sets their reimbursement rate," said Edward Kaplan, a vice president at the Segal Company, a benefits consulting firm. "I have seen some set it at 50 percent of H.I.A.A."
Then there is your doctor, who may be inflating rates to help keep the H.I.A.A. averages high. The doctor will argue that costs are rising by the minute, but you end up having to bridge the gap.
Whoever is at fault, there still are times, experts say, when explanation-of-benefits forms are just crazily out of whack. Reimbursements like the $13.60 I received for that polio vaccine -- 80 percent of $17 -- are probably worth challenging.
"Never underestimate incompetence," said Helen Darling, a senior consultant at Watson Wyatt, another benefits consultant.
Or you could just give up and join an H.M.O. The reason I haven't is that I like having an attentive pediatrician five minutes from my apartment who doesn't make me wait. To help contain the costs of such luxuries, I may establish a flexible medical spending account -- a plan that lets pretax dollars be set aside for paying medical bills. Check to see if your employer offers one.
The accounts are ideal for people who can roughly predict their medical costs. The tax advantage lets your money go further; you can even use the account for over-the-counter goods like contact lens cleaner. The catch is that if you don't spend every cent you set aside, you lose it at the end of the year.
"It is a great thing that most working people do not take advantage of," Ms. Darling said.

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
THREE more years, if everything falls into place, and this city can have a new casino. The Borgata, looking as much as it can like a Tuscan village, will open its doors on an expanse that used to be a city landfill, putting 3,000 more people to work and paying more than $10 million a year in property taxes.
Yet Atlantic City is disappointed. There were supposed to be at least two more casinos, a plan deferred and downsized when the company that had promised to build one of them announced last month that it was buying the company that had promised to build the other. There were supposed to be 20,000 more jobs. 
 But more important, there was supposed to be a transformation of Atlantic City from a giant bus terminal to a vacationland -- a "destination resort," in tourism parlance -- for millions of fun-seeking, free-spending, hotel-staying visitors.
This was, after all, the path of Las Vegas. And when Las Vegas's flashiest operator, Steve Wynn, said five years ago that he would bring his Mirage Resorts here, Atlantic City thought it could follow. The goal, in addition to acres of sheer fun by the sea, was to make good on the State Legislature's original mandate to make gambling "a unique tool of urban redevelopment."
Atlantic City still needs redevelopment desperately. It is reeling from the devastation of its small-business sector, visible on the Boardwalk in a line of pizza stands, T-shirt shops and for-rent signs. Its schools, despite a surge of casino dollars, are among the worst in the state. Its old housing is increasingly crowded with immigrants struggling in low-wage casino jobs, and its new housing is virtually all subsidized.
Steven P. Perskie, an Atlantic City lawyer who as an assemblyman wrote the legislation that allowed gambling 25 years ago, spoke recently with a tone of wonder about the $7 billion that the industry has sunk into the city: The money, he said, has exceeded the wildest expectations.
Yet, he added during an interview in his office here, "We had this notion of a spillover effect that didn't happen."
The revenue, $55 billion since 1978, has been by any measure a torrent of money. Why, some wonder is it not more visible?
"It's over $1 billion for every man, woman and child in the city," said Robert Goodman, director of the United States Gambling Research Institute in Northampton, Mass. "No city in history has had that kind of money poured into it. Now look at what exists, what it accomplished. There are parts of the city that look like Bosnia. To me that's the measure of it."
Nonetheless, everyone still dreams of a spillover effect. The catch is that for now, the only visible means of floating all boats is more dollars from more casinos -- casinos to expand entertainment offerings, to build hotel rooms, to draw ancillary businesses.
In short, the second wave -- a term now embedded in the vocabulary here -- is ever poised and never breaking.
No new casinos have been built since 1990. Last year, the Las Vegas strip surpassed Atlantic City in revenue. And since the day in June 1995 when Mr. Wynn said he would build a resort "the likes of which Atlantic City has never seen," employment in the industry has barely budged.
LAST month, Mr. Wynn exited Atlantic City. Mirage is being acquired by MGM Grand, which had its own plan for a Boardwalk casino. And while MGM is expected to proceed eventually with Mirage's plan for a $1 billion casino-hotel in the marina district, where it would share an enormous tract with the Boyd Gaming Company's Borgata, the Boardwalk project looks distant at best.
That is a splash of cold ocean water for this city of 38,000, which depends on its 12 casinos more than ever. And they account for 80 percent of the property tax base, up from 67 percent only 10 years ago.
Casino money, fed into Atlantic City's redevelopment in accordance with the state's grand design, has financed, among other things, the convention center and baseball stadium, a marine museum and thousands housing units. And it is not as if the money is running out. Through the 1990's, revenue rose an average of 4 percent a year, and many of the casinos expanded.
Tired of the tale-of-two-cities theme, Mayor James Whelan insists all of this spending really does show. "We've had tremendous economic development over the last five years," he said.
"Take Atlantic Avenue," he said, ticking off the bank and stores, the supermarket, the new bus terminal. "There isn't a single block on Atlantic Avenue that hasn't seen significant investment. But because there isn't a Bergdorf-Goodman, there's no ta-daaaa, it doesn't get focused on."
"For us," he continued, "economic diversity is not for us to go out and become a manufacturing center or a mini-Silicon Valley. For us, diversity is still in the realm of tourism and entertainment. That's an economic reality."
But Mr. Goodman, among others, points to the addictive nature of gambling revenue. "If the Legislature or the voters were to decide, let's shift away from gambling and toward some other enterprise, you'd see it's very difficult to change. You can't just turn the spigot on and off."
Indeed, Atlantic City is struggling to open the spigot wider. It must shore up its market position in gambling, not only against Las Vegas but against more local poaching: the giant Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun casinos in Connecticut, slot machines at Delaware race tracks and the threat of a new casino in Monticello, N.Y.
Moreover, only the casino companies are likely to build what everyone here wants: more hotel rooms. There are now 11,600 rooms in the casino-hotels, plus 2,500 in non-casino hotels, and the generally agreed-upon number needed to attract big conventions and major airline service is 20,000.
And if a turn away from gambling revenue is difficult in new casino cities like Detroit or Biloxi, Miss., it is all but impossible here.
By law, the city is a preserve governed largely by interlocking agencies charged by Trenton with regulating the casinos and feeding tax coffers from the income.
Chief among them is the Casino Control Commission, which tracks the industry's every dime and collects the state's 8 percent tax. The city's face is primarily the work of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, created in 1984 to invest funds from casino revenue. The Atlantic County Improvement Authority also finances housing and public projects.
The first decade of gambling overwhelmed a city government famous for corruption and ineptitude, and business opportunities, along with the middle class, leached to the suburbs. The state authorities on the scene were groping.
Michael Pollock, the publisher of Michael Pollock's Gaming Industry Observer, recalled that "the view from Trenton was, we legalized casinos, we wrote the law, and now our job is to sit back and spend the revenues."
In the 1990's, "the public sector really got its act together," Mr. Pollock said. The lesson, he said, was that "if you want to redevelop Atlantic City to give it a middle-class housing base, it takes very deep subsidies and years and years of commitment."
The deepest subsidies have gone to housing. The casino reinvestment authority, determined to create middle-class neighborhoods where tenements were razed, is underwriting blocks of neotraditional houses with porches and gingerbread. Hundreds of townhouses fill the once-depleted Inlet section.
Jim Kennedy, the authority's executive director, said that when land costs are included, the subsidies average $250,000 per unit. "The thought was that Atlantic City needed a lot of help in the early years," Mr. Kennedy said. "It needed a lot more help than anyone thought."
While no one is complaining about new housing, many doubt that the much bigger infusion of money has benefited the people left here. The city's black political leaders, in particular, have been pessimistic and so far mostly accurate about the development schemes offered through the years.
Councilman Lorenzo Langford said that "we were sold a bill of goods" on Mr. Wynn's plan to touch off a burst of development near the marina, where Trump Marina and Harrah's had staked out a small casino district next to an old landfill.
For lack of bidders, the 150-acre city property, known as the H-tract, was given to Mirage in exchange for a development plan; Mr. Wynn proposed a resort to be called Le Jardin-Palais and carved out a piece for a partnership with Boyd Gaming, to become the Borgata complex. Then the State Legislature enacted a bill sponsored by Bill Gormley, the area's Republican state senator, to reimburse developers up to three-quarters of the cost of cleaning up old landfills. Mirage was the only apparent beneficiary.
The state also undertook a $330 million road and tunnel, paying two-thirds of the cost, to direct traffic from the Atlantic City Expressway to the marina district. A block of homes in a middle-class black neighborhood was razed for the project, which is now well under way.
Now that Mr. Wynn has withdrawn, "I get no pleasure in standing on a soapbox and saying I told you so," Mr. Langford said. "I think it's a tragedy that we as residents got snookered."
Fights on the council, where Mr. Langford and other minority members often clash with Mayor Whelan, have confounded some smaller development proposals. But most proceed through the Republican-dominated state agencies that direct casino tax dollars.
The casino reinvestment authority has provided millions for the huge new convention center, the Sandcastle baseball stadium, an ice rink and a marine museum, called the Ocean Life Center.
The agency is also helping to finance a shopping and entertainment complex in the gaping blocks between the convention center and the Boardwalk, where visitors are now greeted by a McDonalds and a Gulf station.
The project's developer, the Cordish Company of Baltimore, plans a 500,000-square-foot retail and entertainment complex. The company president, David Cordish, noted that with 425,000 square feet of retail space, Atlantic City is, to put it mildly, underserved; Las Vegas and Orlando each have 20 million square feet.
"With 37 million visitors," Mr. Cordish said, "shame on me if we can't give them something to do."
Mr. Cordish, who specializes in old urban sites resuscitated for tourism, said: "Baltimore's Inner Harbor took 25 years. For 20 years every dealing here was subsidized by the public sector. In the last five years private developers have moved in to do it themselves."
For businesses here, 25 years has imparted the lesson that Mr. Wynn himself once delivered to small-business owners in Bridgeport, Conn., where he had proposed a casino. "There is no reason on earth," he told them, "for any of you to expect for more than one second that just because there are people here, they're going to run into your store, or restaurant, or bar."
Todd Lovitz, who runs a T-shirt shop on the Boardwalk, knows that. Mr. Lovitz traces the decline to the mid-1980's, and when the new convention center opened in 1997, he said, his Pier 21 shop lost 40 percent to 50 percent of its convention business.
There were good years, and Mr. Lovitz's family opened successful shops in casinos. But on the Boardwalk they took hits: the $17,000-a-year rent on their women's clothing store doubled with the coming of the casinos, and they closed it.
The old Boardwalk Convention Hall is under renovation, but Mr. Lovitz wonders why the city let the retail climate deteriorate. "The Boardwalk should have been a priority," he said. "This is what people know, what people see.
"It's not that the people aren't here with money," he went on. "It's that people don't come out of the casinos. There's nothing for them to buy. If these were upscale stores, like in South Beach in Miami, it would work."
Ira Zelden, the owner of a pricey women's clothing store called Jules of Margate, ran shops at the Showboat and the Tropicana, then retreated to his suburban niche.
"You can't get them in a cocktail dress when they come in a nylon jogging suit," Mr. Zelden sighed. "Theres no marketing of this town. They want a working-class market, which is ridiculous. That is not who's spending the dollars, spending $7 or $8 a drink in bars."
From the beginning, the small-business owners were casualties. The Atlantic County Division of Economic Development charted one awful period, from December 1979 to September 1981, when the number of apparel shops in Atlantic City fell to 62 from from 116 and restaurants and bars to 191 from 240.
Mr. Persie said the casinos provided plenty of openings for those who adapted and got creative. But those who tried to market themselves to gamblers, he said, "got slaughtered."
Doris Grabel, who runs a supper club with here husband, Harry, and son, Mark, said, "I don't know if there's an answer to this," considering what gambling had done to and for her city. Grabels has survived and even expanded in its quiet residential corner of the city while the casinos raked in customers with free meals.
"When the first casinos came in, this place was dynamite," said Mrs. Grabel. "We were jammed with the executives and everything."
While the casinos still closed at 4 a.m., the workers poured in, but that business withered when they became 24-hour operations.
At the same time, the cost of doing business went up. With rising land values came rising taxes -- "they went up, way, way, up, and everybody still wants to know what they did with the money," Harry Grabel said. And there was a new 3 percent luxury tax on liquor.
The Grabels recovered, in part by starting a banquet business, and Mrs. Grabel does not regret the whole gambling experiment. "It brought a lot of people here," she said. "But I'm not talking about Atlantic City itself. Atlantic City is not booming."
While the bar filled with the Saturday-evening crowd of locals, Mrs. Grabel commiserated with Lois Saltzberg, whose children own a pharmacy nearby.
"It's a heartache," Mrs. Saltzberg said.
"It's a heartache," Mrs. Grabel echoed. "You have no nucleus; everybody moved out."
Christine Brown's view is different. Atlantic City is "absolutely" better than it was 10 years ago, said Ms. Brown, who runs a broadcast and video production business with her husband, Benjamen.
IT is so much better, she said, that two years ago they moved from Egg Harbor Township into the Ocean One mall, on a pier across from Caesars. The cost of space was half what it was in their old quarters, but their business quadrupled.
"You're just more visible being here, working here," said Ms. Brown, who is always darting into the casinos on business.
Like everyone else, though, she is antsy for the broader-based tourism that she says is incubating. "Starting with the convention center, things started to move on," she said. "If the city brings in non-casino hotels and family entertainment, I see a big boom here."
The Convention and Visitors Authority reports that about 20 percent of tourists stay overnight, a figure the authority desperately wants to increase. A survey it commissioned showed that about half of the total visitors came mostly to gamble, one-third to vacation and less than 10 percent to attend conventions.
The convention-goers are by far the most demographically desirable, with an average income of $71,300, compared with the gamblers' $46,800. And they are far more likely to pay full rates when they do stay in hotels.
But "there is a room issue," said Sarah Lindkrantz, the authority's vice president for marketing. "We need more rooms to expand the market."
The chairman of the Casino Control Commission, James R. Hurley, pays close attention to the hotel question, since, he said, the redevelopment of Atlantic City "is one of the reasons were here."
"Until they build more rooms here, the economists and analysts who look at it say it's not going to change much," Mr. Hurley said. "Las Vegas has more hotel rooms than New York and San Francisco put together."
He said he expected the marina district to eventually yield two new hotels. But, nodding over his shoulder, he added: "We used to have pictures all along the wall -- all the plans people talked about and never built."
James Crawford, the director of the South Jersey Transportation Authority, which is responsible for the tunnel project, said that the state's projections for development in the marina district were entirely on track.
He also defended the pace of building. "We will have gone from a raw concept to an open highway in six years," Mr. Crawford said. "That will be the fastest project undertaken in New Jersey in at least 30 years."
Mr. Perskie said the public sector's reconstruction of the city should pay off handsomely in the next decade, after "the languor of the 1980's came back to bite us in the backside in the 1990's."
But the industry that is supposed to return the favor is largely unimpressed.
"There are a lot of places competing for your capital," said Al Luciani, president of the Sands Casino Hotel. Mr. Luciani, who recently returned to Atlantic City after a decade, said it was still a "very difficult" place to do business.
And he, too, is waiting for something to tip. "It needs to be broadened," he said. "It needs to clean itself up, it needs broader attractions than just a dozen casinos."

Zero Down, And Maybe Something To Gain

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO 

 BODY:
WHILE house-hunting in Fayetteville, N.C., a few months ago, Suzanne and Curtis Walker found themselves in an enviable quandary: they had discovered the expansive ranch house they were dreaming of, yet were reluctant to sell their investments to buy it because the stock market was performing so well.
They managed to hang on to both the house and their portfolio -- by qualifying for a 30-year loan without having to put a penny down, aside from closing costs. 
 "We wanted to keep our money invested in a vehicle that we knew could appreciate at a better rate," said Mrs. Walker, 39. The couple's mutual fund portfolio has tripled in value in the last decade, to around $200,000.
With the economy strong and housing prices rising, more lenders have started offering mortgages that do not require down payments, though with rates a half to a full percentage point above those of conventional loans. The lenders also demand somewhat higher incomes and credit ratings, and some limit the loans to $600,000.
The lenders, facing more competition and a dwindling refinancing market because of higher interest rates, see zero-down loans as a way to attract a broader array of customers. Many of the borrowers are starting out in careers or, like the Walkers, have most of their assets tied up in investments.
Just a couple of years ago, zero-down loans were virtually impossible to find, aside from those offered through the Department of Veterans Affairs or a few brokerage firms willing to take securities as collateral. Although they remain chiefly a niche product, they are expected to be more prevalent during the spring and summer, said Keith Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage research firm in Butler, N.J. Already, they have been well-received in the secondary market, where mortgages are grouped and sold as securities by companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, experts say.
Mr. Gumbinger said that 62 percent of the 250 lenders that HSH surveyed in March had such loans, usually with a fixed rate for 15 or 30 years. The average rate on a 30-year zero-down loan was 9.05 percent, versus 8.42 percent on a conventional loan, according to the survey. Most banks also demand that borrowers putting less than 20 percent down buy private mortgage insurance.
Among major lenders now offering the zero-down loans are Countrywide Home Loans, GMAC Mortgage, Bank of America and Norwest, according to HSH, which provides a list on its Web site, www.hsh.com.
Dorcas Helfant, who runs Coldwell Banker-Helfant Realty in Virginia Beach, Va., estimates that about 3 percent of the buyers who deal with her office choose zero-down loans. "It's not a huge market program, but it's picking up steam," she said.
Down payments are typically the biggest barriers to home ownership, said Robert Brown, an executive vice president at Countrywide, which began offering zero-down mortgages in January, and where the Walkers obtained their mortgage. "The borrower may have the ability to make a mortgage payment," Mr. Brown said, "but coming up with the cash up front may be a problem."
Countrywide, based in Calabasas, Calif., markets three zero-down mortgages: a standard 30-year fixed-rate loan; a 103 percent loan, which finances the full purchase price plus 3 percent for closing costs; and an 80/20 loan, in which 80 percent is financed with a first mortgage and the remaining 20 percent from a second mortgage (or home equity line of credit), eliminating the need for private mortgage insurance.
THE Walkers, who got a 100 percent loan for $150,000 from Countrywide, at 8.5 percent, are among a growing number of borrowers with higher incomes who prefer to keep their wealth in stocks, bonds or options. Their household income is close to six figures; Mr. Walker is a command sergeant major in the Army, and Mrs. Walker is a mental health therapist.
"Someone may be worth hundreds of millions of dollars on paper but have no savings," Mr. Gumbinger said. "There's a lot of people who fit into that category in the Silicon Valley; the Internet made them rich."
Although not rich, Brian and Tanya Daniels had some money available to put down on an 1880 two-story farmhouse they bought recently in Bristolville, Ohio. But they chose instead to obtain a zero-down loan and use their savings for renovations. "It needed to be completely redone -- new electricity, new plumbing. We're tearing out walls," said Mr. Daniels, 27, a machine repair apprentice for Delphi Packard Electric Systems. He and his wife, a schoolteacher, received a 30-year, 103 percent loan for around $50,000, at 8.25 percent.
For Linda Bumpas, 32, a hospital office manager in Virginia Beach, the zero-down mortgage she received last spring enabled her and her two daughters to move out of a two-bedroom apartment and into a roomier, $69,900 town house. "The money that I saved allowed me to make home improvements and to buy furniture," she said.
Starting out with no home equity does not bother the Daniels couple or Ms. Bumpas. They expect to derive what mortgage experts call "instant equity" from their neighborhoods' rapid appreciation.
But what happens if housing values or the economy head south -- particularly if a homeowner has a huge mortgage and no appreciable equity? Experts like Peter G. Miller, author of "The Common Sense Mortgage" (Contemporary Books), warn that buyers who suddenly need to sell will face brokerage fees and related costs that they will have to pay out of pocket. "Where do you get the cash?" he asked.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, recently warned banks against risky loans, reminding them of losses that savings and loans and banks suffered in commercial real estate in the late 1980's.
Lenders say they impose tighter credit standards on borrowers who put nothing down. "We're not in the business to own property," said Mr. Brown at Countrywide, which looks for customers with slightly higher overall credit ratings and solid employment histories for zero-down loans.
James Grant, publisher of Grant's Interest Rate observer, has noted that lenders have become less risk-averse, a reflection of the healthy economy. But he said he was not concerned about zero-down loans posing a systemic risk to the banking industry, because they were still just a small market.
Besides, he said, 'people will do almost anything before losing their homes. That's not to say that this is a prudent method of proceeding for a bank, but a house is a pretty good collateral in all except the most severe downturn."

HEADLINE: The Face of Teenage Sex Grows Younger

BYLINE: BY ANNE JARRELL 

 BODY:
ON the Upper West Side, Dr. Marsha Levy-Warren, a psychologist, said she is seeing more and more preteenagers who are going on junior versions of dates in fifth grade, at 10 or 11 years old. By seventh grade, they have graduated to sex.
"I can't tell you how many girls come in who are bereft about having had sex too soon," she said. "They went to a party, met a cute guy, he seemed to like them, they hooked up and did what they assumed everyone was doing. Then, they feel awful." 
 On the Upper East Side, Dr. Cynthia Pegler, a specialist in adolescent medicine, sees girls brought in by their mothers when they outgrow the pediatrician. These sophisticated young women may not be having intercourse at 13, but they are having oral sex. "They tell me oral sex is no big deal," Dr. Pegler said. "They don't see it as sex, but as safe and fun and a prelude to intercourse, where before, it used to be the other way around."
And in the suburbs, on Long Island, Dr. Wayne Warren, a psychologist, said groups of seventh and eighth graders rent limousines to take them to clubs in Manhattan, where they get drunk, grind on the dance floor and have oral sex in dim corners.
In a society that is always pushing the envelope, the age at which sexual experimentation begins is speeding up, too, say psychotherapists, health professionals and school officials, who are concerned about the health and emotional ramifications for young teenagers.
"There are significant numbers of youngsters who are engaging in sexual activity at earlier ages," said Dr. Robert W. Blum, a physician and the director of the division of general pediatrics and adolescent health at the University of Minnesota, which analyzes data on teenage sexual activity for the federal government. "Besides intercourse, they are engaging in oral sex, mutual masturbation, nudity and exposure as precursors to intercourse."
In data published by Dr. Blum and his team in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1997, 17 percent of a national sample of thousands of seventh and eighth graders had had intercourse. Other, smaller studies put the percentage even higher.
"I see no reason not to believe that soon a substantial number of youths will be having intercourse in the middle-school years," said Dr. Richard Gallagher, director of the Parenting Institute at New York University's Child Study Center. "It's already happening."
Experts of all political and philosophical bents give many reasons for this phenomenon, including the rising divorce rate, inattentive parents, the availability of condoms and the earlier onset of puberty. But the most frequent explanation is that today's culture sends a very mixed message to its young.
On the one hand, bombarded by warnings about AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases, adolescents are taught abstinence, the sole contraception method taught at one-third of all public schools across the country, according to a recent poll by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a private research organization.
On the other hand, teenagers are confronted daily with a culture that has become a very sexy place indeed in which to live. "Sex is everywhere, and it's absolutely explicit," said Dr. Allen Waltzman, a psychiatrist with practices on the Upper East Side and in Brooklyn, who sees many adolescents. "There's hardly a film that doesn't show a man and a woman having sex. There's MTV, lurid rap lyrics, and now we've got technosex on the Internet."
None of this is lost on young adolescents, Dr. Waltzman said. "Kids always push to the limit of what's permitted in a society."
One 13-year-old boy at a junior high school in Manhattan said he first had oral sex at 12 and has had it about eight times at parties and in the hours between 4 p.m. and 7, before parents come home from work. The sex was never with a steady girlfriend, because he has never had one. "It's something to do with someone," he said. "I think it's curiosity. I don't think that's bad."
An eighth-grade private-school boy said that he and his friends know that oral sex "is not perfect," but that they believe there is less likelihood of picking up a sexually transmitted disease than with intercourse. "The schools tell us to refrain, they tell us you get S.T.D.'s from both, but no one believes it," he said.
Dr. Warren, who practices in Manhattan as well as in Suffolk County, said: "Before, the dialogue was, 'I love you and care for you, so let's experiment.' Now, the dialogue is, 'This is safe and fun and O.K., and you have nothing to worry about.'
"I see girls, seventh and eighth graders, even sixth graders, who tell me they're virgins, and they're going to wait to have intercourse until they meet the man they'll marry. But then they've had oral sex 50 or 60 times. It's like a goodnight kiss to them, how they say goodbye after a date."
There are no in-depth studies showing national trends in sexual activity in middle school, ages 10 to 13. No one will finance such studies, Dr. Blum said, because of fear of the outcry from politicians who embrace an abstinence-only message and from parents wanting to protect their children's privacy.
The studies of national trends that do exist look only at high school students. These show a striking drop decade by decade in the age at which teenagers first engage in intercourse. A December 1999 study by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University noted that in the early 1970's, less than 5 percent of 15-year-old girls and 20 percent of 15-year-old boys had engaged in sexual intercourse. By 1997, the figures were 38 percent for girls, 45 percent for boys.
In the wake of AIDS and of abstinence advocacy, statistics from the 1990's analyzed by the Guttmacher Institute show that the age by which a majority of teenagers had engaged in intercourse has not continued to fall. The teenage birthrate has been falling since 1991, in part, experts say, because of decreased sexual activity. (It is still the highest for the developed world.) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta reports that among high school students of all ages, those who have had sex declined from 53 percent in 1995 to 48.4 percent in 1997, the latest year for which figures are available.
But Dr. Gallagher said that the apparent diminishing of high school sexual activity masks a more insidious development: some older teenagers may be extending their years of virginity, but some younger teenagers are having sex earlier.
"You can get 16- to 18-year-olds who will be very conservative sexually," Dr. Gallagher said. "And then you can get right below them a group of 14- to 16-year-olds who say those older students are too conservative, let's party."
Despite the paucity of data about young teenagers, educators say that the anecdotal evidence points to increased sexual activity, often of a detached, unemotional kind.
"The kids are overwhelmed with sexual messages, and we're seeing a younger and younger display of not only precocious sexual behavior but also aggressive sexual molestation, like holding down a student and forcibly pulling down his or her pants," said Dr. Frederick Kaeser, the director of health services for District 2 of the New York public school system, covering much of Manhattan.
"We do a terrible job of teaching sex education," he added.
One boy, 13, who attends a private school in Manhattan, said his interest in sex began in the third grade, watching "Beverly Hills 90210," the television show that portrayed teenagers from well-off families in the boom economy behaving like adults. "I was interested," he said. "The people were cool. I wanted to try what they were doing on the show."
He, along with half a dozen of his friends, described a timetable for sexual initiation. By third grade, they knew the slang for activities from masturbation to oral sex. By fourth grade, they had girlfriends and were playing kissing games. By fifth, they were going on dates. In sixth, they were French kissing and petting. In seventh and eighth grades, they tried oral sex, and some had intercourse.
By ninth grade, one boy said, "it's just one big spree of going all the way."
The head of their school said she thought they were accurate in their timetable.
Asked if they felt things were going too fast, the boys shrugged. "It has to happen sooner or later," the 13-year-old said. "Sex is pleasurable. Why not now? Sometimes people get hurt. Sure. I've been hurt. But that's going to happen at any age."
Psychiatrists and psychologists, however, say that most young teenagers cannot handle the profound feelings that go with early sex. "Developmentally, they just aren't ready," Dr. Levy-Warren said. "They're trying to figure out who they are, and unlike adults who obsess first and then act, kids do the opposite -- they act and then obsess. They jump into this, and are left with intense feelings they're unable to sort out."
What's most troubling to Dr. Levy-Warren and others is a new casual, brazen attitude about sex. "I call it body-part sex," she said. "The kids don't even look at each other. It's mechanical, dehumanizing. The fallout is that later in life they have trouble forming relationships. They're jaded. "
While New York middle-school educators and counselors say they are increasingly concerned about earlier sexual activity, particularly oral sex, no one is clear on what to do about it. After Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez was fired in 1993, in part for introducing a condom-distribution program, the New York public schools have settled into a sex education curriculum that's a mixed bag of preaching, basic anatomy and, in high school, condom distribution, though parents can choose to keep their children from participating.
Even at New York's private schools, not concerned with federal guidelines, which since 1996 have allocated millions of dollars to sex education programs that teach only abstinence, ambivalence reigns. At Friends Seminary in downtown Manhattan, parents were called to a meeting two years ago after students in a fifth grade class began pairing off and breaking up, and "the misery factor was high," said Pamela Wood, the head of the middle school. There was no consensus among the adults. Half were appalled at the prospect of 10-year-olds dating. The other half thought it was cute.
"In elementary school, everyone pretty much has the same agenda," Ms. Wood said. "By middle school, no one agrees on what is appropriate. As for parents, their egos can get entangled. They want their kids to be liked, and if dating is what it requires, then they're for it."
The sex education curriculum at Friends includes practice exercises in how to put on a condom for eighth graders and free condom distribution in high school, but there is disagreement about distributing condoms with fruit flavoring, for use during oral sex.
At the Dalton School on the Upper East Side, concern about the precocious sexual climate led this year to starting a sex education program for the fifth grade, where none had existed so early before.
Dr. Glenn Stein, the middle-school psychologist, said that the program is mostly anatomy. "A little inoculation, I would call it," he said. "It's not enough, but it's a start."
What the fast-sex scene means to girls, as opposed to boys, is of particular concern to school psychologists, who mentioned holding discussions and seminars on gender issues. Deborah Tolman, a director at the Wellesley College Center for Research on Women, points out that anecdotal evidence indicates that when it comes to oral sex, "the boys are getting it, the girls no."
"It's the heterosexual script that entitles boys and disables girls," she said.
Most psychologists say that what is needed is not just to supply youngsters with facts and information about anatomy, but also to provide them with forums to explore their feelings and to digest the proliferation of sexual messages they receive. As Francesca Schwartz, a school psychologist at the Brearley School, a private school for girls on the Upper East Side, put it: "Do I really like this person? Or am I just doing this to be popular? These are the questions the kids need to learn to think about and ask."
Such discussions should come sooner rather than later, educators say. "Preteens in our culture are 8 and 9," said Dr. Ava L. Siegler, a psychologist and the author of "The Essential Guide to the New Adolescence." "We shouldn't wait to talk to them about AIDS, sex and violence until they are 12."
Dr. Waltzman added: "To kids, their crushes and loves are the most important thing. Adults may see it as silly or irrelevant, but the kids don't. It does no good to leave them to figure it out on their own."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Jackson W. Robinson;
Green Century Balanced Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
WHEN he's not at work, or sailing in Maine's Penobscot Bay in a Wianno Senior -- a 25-foot-long wooden-hulled sloop -- Jackson W. Robinson tends to the organic vegetables in his garden.
That is no surprise, given that he is the child of "green" parents, Ed and Carolyn Robinson. During World War II, they wrote "The Have-More Plan," a back-to-nature tome that is still in print. (Storey Books, $9.95) 
 Mr. Robinson, 57, is manager of the $50.1 million Green Century Balanced fund, which invests only in companies that he deems to be environmentally friendly. But that is not all. Profits from the fund are passed on to a consortium of advocacy groups -- mostly public interest research groups -- that own the fund's adviser, Green Century Capital Management, through a partnership. The money is used for litigation, research and educational programs.
Investors, meanwhile, are rolling in green. The fund returned 42.2 percent a year, on average, for the three years through March 24. That compares with 36.8 percent for one of its peer groups, small growth funds, and 13.6 percent for balanced funds, according to Morningstar Inc.
Mr. Robinson divides the universe of 10,000 publicly traded United States stocks into three categories -- what he calls "the greens, the cleans and the dirties."
"A green company is part of the environmental solution," said Mr. Robinson. "Clean companies, like those in financial and health care, don't contribute either to the solution or the problem. Dirty companies have high levels of waste streams, Superfund sites or environmental litigation."
He avoids companies associated with fossil fuels, tobacco, weaponry and nuclear power.
To pick the fund's three dozen or so stocks, he looks for small- to mid-cap growth companies with returns on equity of more than 15 percent and annual earnings growth of at least 20 percent. These companies tend to be market leaders, he said, and tend to have successful new products, services or technology.
Mr. Robinson likes to examine a company's ratio of sales to capital expenditures. The multiple varies by industry, he said, but big ratios flag companies that tend to use capital efficiently.
He also seeks earnings catalysts like new management or products, heavy spending on research and development or a shift to higher-growth businesses. He is de-emphasizing quantitative measurements like price-to-earnings ratios, he said, "because we have such major deviations in the market."
The fund's prospectus states that the portfolio will generally keep at least 25 percent of its assets in bonds or cash. It now holds 16 fixed-income issues, mostly junk bonds. He favors short-term issues, because interest rates are rising; the average duration of the fund's bonds is just under five years, and they yield 9.5 percent, on average.
Mr. Robinson sees value in what he calls the emerging energy group, companies that make and service solar and wind power projects and fuel cells. The group's revenue and profits are growing at 20 to 40 percent a year, he said. He is also bullish on the natural and organic food industry, which is seeing sales and earnings growth of 15 to 20 percent a year, versus 3 to 4 percent for traditional grocery stores.
ONE favorite is United Natural Foods of Dayville, Conn., a rapidly growing distributor of natural and organic foods. Mr. Robinson bought shares at $10 to $11 in December; the price had tumbled from nearly $30 in February 1999 because of what he called an ill-managed acquisition.
In early 1999, he said, the manager in charge of the company's successful Western division, Michael S. Funk, became chief executive. Mr. Funk, he said, had already fixed many problems arising from the merger, so Mr. Robinson has confidence in him.
Mr. Robinson expects shares to trade in the $25-to-$30 range over the next 12 to 18 months; he predicts earnings growth of 16 to 17 percent a year, on average, over three years. The stock now trades at $15, or 13 times his earnings estimate of $1.15 a share for 2001.
Another favorite is Astropower of Newark, Del., an independent manufacturer of solar modules and panels and photovoltaic cells. The company has cut production costs, Mr. Robinson said, by building modules on an assembly line; it uses silicon discarded by semiconductor makers.
About 80 percent of the company's sales are overseas. "Europe is far ahead of the U.S. in terms of alternative energy and wind," he said, adding that the company is working on new applications like solar-powered cellular phones and hand-held computers.
He bought shares at $6 at the initial offering in March 1998. The stock now trades at $32.3125, or 42 times his 2001 earnings estimate of 75 cents a share. He predicts earnings growth of 50 percent, annualized, over three years; his 12- to 18-month price target for the stock is $50.
Mr. Robinson bought shares of Uniroyal Technology of Sarasota, Fla., at $36 in January. The company, spun off from Uniroyal Tire, sold a business that produces high-quality plastics in February and plans to divest its remaining small plastics operations. It makes bright, long-lasting light-emitting diodes, or L.E.D.'s, that are replacing incandescent bulbs used in traffic lights because they use less power, Mr. Robinson said. "Ultimately," he added, "we will see L.E.D. used in buildings, significantly decreasing the demand for electricity." The devices can also be used in flat-panel computers and home electronics, he said.
He expects the company to break even in 2001 and sees earnings of $2 to $3 a share in 2003. The stock trades at $47; his 12- to 18-month price target is $100.

HEADLINE: THE BUSINESS WORLD;
Where the Armorers No Longer Thrive

BYLINE: By PETER S. GREEN 

DATELINE: VODOCHODY, Czech Republic

 BODY:
THE roar of a jet engine rumbles across the stubbly wheat fields near Boeing's Aero Vodochody factory here on the outskirts of Prague, as a Czech test pilot puts an L-159 fighter-trainer through its paces.
The Czech Republic is a new NATO member, and the L-159, a product of Czech engineering and labor, is equipped to NATO standards, carrying the latest electronics and weapons. By all accounts, it is a good, inexpensive plane. 
 But despite a multiyear, multimillion-dollar sales drive, Aero has orders for just 72 planes, all from the Czech Air Force. The spacious production hall that once assembled 30 fighters a month now turns out just 4.
The Czechs have a long tradition of military manufacturing. After conquering Czechoslovakia, Hitler used Czech tanks made at the Skoda works in Plzen to invade France. In the Communist era, some of the Warsaw Pact's best weapons were made in Central Europe. When the Warsaw Pact collapsed in 1990, though, so did the markets for Eastern arms makers, as the world was flooded with surplus East bloc weapons and the East lowered its defenses.
Even the entry last year into NATO of the Czechs, Poles and Hungarians has failed to revive the fortunes of the local manufacturers.
"There was a misapprehension at the end of the cold war that these industries would become engines of growth," said Michael Brzoska, research director at the Bonn International Center for Conversion, which studies the effects of Europe's military cutbacks. Instead, he said, shrinking economies and smaller armies gave the manufacturers no chance to retool.
"I don't see any good prospects for any of those countries," said Clifford Beal, editor of Jane's Defense Weekly, noting that exports to Soviet-era allies have also dried up.
Nor can the manufacturers find markets at home. NATO wants new members to concentrate on matters like computers and teaching NATO tactics to soldiers. Fancy weapons can come later. And with reason: the Czechs have only three combat-ready battalions, the Hungarians two and Poland about five.
Changing sides after the cold war also hurt. Tesla Pardubice, a Czech electronics company, developed a passive radar to detect American stealth bombers. But with the United States no longer a threat here, the only potential buyers were countries like Iran, Iraq, Libya and Yugoslavia, and now Tesla is in bankruptcy.
"Whenever we wanted to sell it, our American friends were against it," said Jiri Pisklak, managing director of the Czech Association of Defense Producers.
MOREOVER, while military industries in the West have diversified into civilian production, there have been few spinoffs here. Despite a wealth of engineering talent, Mr. Beal said, the Easterners lack home-grown business skills. "In the era of leveraging brain power into business power," he said, "they can't make the jump."
The Bonn Center estimates that arms employment in Poland fell from 260,000 in 1985 to 70,000 in 1998, and in the Czech Republic from 30,000 in 1993 to 18,000 in 1998.
"The question for these countries is: Do they pick up as a supplier, a link in the chain, or do they go bust? They cannot stand alone," said Digby Waller, defense economist at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
At Aero, Boeing has chosen the supplier route. Over 70 percent of the L-159 comes from outside the Czech Republic, mainly from the United States, and today the plant assembles airframes out of components made elsewhere.
"Realistically, companies of our size need to be involved in joint development and production," said Aero's president, Scott L. White. "Our niche is airframe structure -- from design through the delivery of parts."
But even with American management and marketing skill behind it, the L-159 is a tough sell. Britain, Italy, Russia, China and Brazil all build similar planes. In recent months Aero has lost contracts to Britain's BAE Systems and to the Chinese.
Those deals, however, were lost for precisely the same reasons that Boeing bought Aero.
To secure sales, manufacturers routinely promise vast investments in local industry or local production to help client states offset the cost of the weapons. In South Africa, BAE not only offered its Hawk trainers, but also promised to build a deep-water port and to construct water filtration plants in black townships.
Mr. White says there is a worldwide market for 100 planes a year like the L-159. But the Czech government, short of cash, is unable to help underwrite deals like BAE's sale to South Africa. And as a Boeing subsidiary bound by American laws on business deals, Aero shies away from offsets that may appear unrelated to building airplanes.
"Our key frustration and our key problem is that we can't promise things we can't fulfill," Mr. White said.
With Western companies close to selling jet fighters to the Czechs, Poles and Hungarians to replace their aging MiG's -- a multibillion-dollar prospect -- those local manufacturers that can fit into the supply chain may see some new orders; those that cannot will see sales slide further.
The fighter sale is largely why Boeing bought 35 percent of Aero for about $30 million last year, in a deal that also won Boeing a contract to supply more 737's to Czech Airlines.
"Boeing did not come to the Czech Republic to make a return on investment," Mr. White said. "It was looking instead toward opportunities for other commercial and military sales."
The Czechs alone want up to 36 supersonic fighters, worth a potential $2 billion. Poland could buy up to 72 planes and Hungary about 30.
Lockheed Martin wants to sell the F-16, the workhorse of the United States Air Force; Boeing wants to sell the F/A-18, used primarily by the Navy and Kuwait; and BAE and Saab want to sell their Gripen fighter, so far used only by Sweden.
That has left NATO authorities slightly dismayed. "We are not telling them to buy aircraft," an officer from a NATO country said. "We say first fix things like personnel."
But like Boeing, the other Western fighter builders are sweetening their offers to Eastern European defense ministries with promises to bail out local arms makers. All are looking at ways to make parts locally, and BAE is offering to fully offset the cost of a fleet of Gripens by investing an equivalent amount in the purchasing country.
Does that mean the jets are free, as many East Europeans seem to think? No, said BAE's regional director, Julian Scopes; the offsetting investments must make sense on their own, and though they will benefit the host country's economy, they generally will not put anything close to the cost of the jets back into government coffers in the short term.
Mr. White, meanwhile, faces another challenge: competing with bargain-basement equipment available on the secondary market, including his own company's unsold inventory.
Russia, he said, is selling used jet trainers similar to Aero's L-39, the L-159's predecessor, for less than $100,000. By contrast, L-159's cost $12 million to $15 million apiece. Behind the Aero factory, Mr. White shows a visitor an L-39 painted in desert camouflage. Twenty-nine L-39 jets were built for Nigeria, which never took delivery of them. Twelve were eventually sold to Yemen, but 17 more sit in hangars, awaiting a new buyer.
"I'll sell it to you for a half a million dollars," Mr. White offers, only half-jokingly.

HEADLINE: REPORT ON EXECUTIVE PAY;
J.C. Penney Bosses in Stock Bind

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
MANAGEMENT experts and institutional investors constantly lobby American executives to own more stock in the companies they run. Unlike options -- which, at worst, are worth nothing -- ownership of actual shares brings a downside. When investors lose money, so do the people running the company.
In a year when many old-economy stocks declined, that danger became real for top executives. Few lost as much as the bosses at J.C. Penney, the giant retailer, whose stock lost more than half its value during 1999. 
 Most companies require chief executive to own stock worth three to five times their annual salary, said James A. Hatch, an executive vice president at the Compensation Resource Group, a pay consulting firm in New York. Penney is more aggressive. Its chief executive, James E. Oesterreicher, must own seven times his annual salary, according to the company's most recent proxy. The ratio declines for lower-level executives, down to one and a half times salary for store managers.
In 1998, the most recent year's proxy available for Penney, Mr. Oesterreicher made $612,000. He did not own quite seven times that in early 1999, but he did hold about 80,000 shares, worth about $3 million at the time. (The shares had been worth about $4 million only a few months before.)
Today, however, with J.C. Penney's stock trading at $14.875, 80,000 shares would be worth just $1.19 million. If Mr. Oesterreicher received no raise last year and still holds 80,000 shares today, he would have to buy an additional 200,000 to comply with the company's policy. Through a spokeswoman, he declined to comment.
Many other chief executives find themselves in similar predicaments. Coca-Cola, Eastman Kodak, Sara Lee and Sears, Roebuck all have stock ownership policies, and all saw their price drop in 1999. To follow their own rules, executives there would have to do some serious value investing -- or persuade their boards to hand over thousands of free shares. DAVID LEONHARDT

HEADLINE: PERSONAL BUSINESS;
Filling Seats With Online Discounts

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
TICKET discounts for online customers, already favored by the airlines for filling empty seats, are rapidly spreading to sports -- and entertainment might be next. But the same technology that allows discounts is also likely to allow higher prices for some of the sports and entertainment seats that everyone wants.
The New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association offer discounts to anyone who signs up for "Nets News" online bulletins. Last week, the team offered $50 seats to today's Detroit Pistons game for $20, and $25 seats for $17. 
 Since last season, Texas Rangers followers who signed up on the Web for the baseball team's fan club, Inside Pitch, have received e-mail offers of steep discounts. Hockey fans get similar breaks from the Dallas Stars.
"It's incredibly successful," said Jeff Cogan, executive vice president of the Southwest Sports Group, a company led by the Dallas investor Thomas O. Hicks that owns the Stars and Rangers. Aided by data from online sales, Mr. Cogan is also considering higher ticket prices for games on weekends or against popular rivals for the Stars this fall and for the Rangers next year.
The rapid growth of online ticket sales makes it much easier for sports teams or entertainment companies to gather data and set prices according to demand. The newest technology will let online buyers print their own tickets rather than having to wait for them to arrive by mail or pick them up at box offices.
Later this month, fans attending sports events at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, the First Union Center in Philadelphia and 22 other sites will be among the first in the nation to use tickets they printed on their own computers. Within a year, that capability is likely to spread to wired patrons of most major theater chains, stadiums, arenas and performing arts centers. The resulting convenience is expected to help raise online ticket sales from $300 million last year to $4 billion by 2004, according to Forrester Research.
Sports and entertainment executives are already debating whether they are entering a new era of pricing seats according to demand. W. Thomas Gimble, chief executive of Tickets.com, based in Costa Mesa, Calif., which has formed partnerships with the Stars and the Rangers, has no doubts. "When you can print your own tickets, it busts apart the old rules of selling," he said.
But sports teams, promoters and entertainers, fearful of alienating their fans, are proceeding cautiously, especially in raising prices. In November, Tickets.com began auctioning some prime seats for Elton John and Backstreet Boys concerts at an average of 45 percent over face value, but the extra proceeds go to charity.
Operators of movie theaters and some concert halls are openly skeptical. Mark Pascucci, a senior vice president of Loews Cineplex Entertainment, which has 2,900 screens, says that discounted movie tickets for some shows would only steal audiences from others. "There's no practical reason for this," he said.
Loews is joining Regal, Edwards and other theater chains to begin an online ticketing service this summer. Movietickets.com, based in Boca Raton, Fla., and owned by the National Amusements theater chain, AMC Theaters and CBS, plans to begin selling movie tickets online over Memorial Day weekend. Both groups intend to let filmgoers print their tickets at home, beginning in December. To attract customers, they will forgo service charges for at least six months.
Tickets printed at home on standard paper and printers will include bar codes that can be scanned by readers at theaters and stadiums. The printouts might also include driving directions, seating charts, parking coupons or restaurant advertisements.
THE Rangers and the Stars, however, intend to go a step further, using software from Talus Solutions of Atlanta that helps airlines and hotels gauge demand and set their rates. Marriott International uses Talus software to set as many as 10 different rates for identical hotel rooms.
Stadium and team owners are especially eager to fill empty seats, because so much of their revenue comes from food, drink and souvenirs. "To those owners, it's a big deal, regardless of what patrons pay for the tickets," said Tom R. Madison, president of Talus Solutions.
The Rangers, wanting to fill some of the 15,000 seats that, on average, remain empty in their stadium, are also offering breaks like free extra tickets or coupons for discounted food and beverages to frequent ticket buyers. "Baseball is the perfect opportunity to introduce dynamic pricing because so many seats go unsold," said Mr. Gimble of Tickets.com.
Mr. Gimble's company also expects to allow ticket buyers to print their own tickets beginning this summer for some of its 4,100 other sites, which include the theaters at Lincoln Center. But sports teams are more likely to adopt variable pricing than the entertainment industry, Mr. Gimble said.

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY;
Bewitched and Bothered by an Oil Cartel

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AT first I thought it was just a silly infatuation -- you know, the thrill of forbidden love in an age when hardly any love is really forbidden. But I couldn't get it out of my head, and I grew tired of hiding it. Now I want the whole world to know that, for a brief shining moment, I was in love, madly in love, with OPEC.
I know it seems crazy, a middle-aged American with a gaping gas tank hankering after a profit-hungry oil cartel. Keeping a long-distance relationship vital and fresh is no picnic, and heaven knows OPEC has never been much for sweet talk. 
 In the end, of course, my friends were right. The whole thing ended in tears when my beloved oil ministers caved in at their meeting last week and agreed to increase production, leaving shards of my broken heart on the conference table.
Oh, OPEC, how did I love thee? Let me count the ways.
Your most endearing quality was your power. You're the only force on earth strong enough to make Americans ease up on a fossil-fuel habit so severe that it threatens the planet with ruinous global warming. (This, though, you dismiss so charmingly on your vain little Web site, www.opec.org.)
If you had just kept the lid on, higher gas prices might finally have made some of us park our bloated sport utility vehicles and rethink our plans to live in 5,000-square-foot houses. At the very least, you might have inspired enough energy conservation to make a dent in the air pollution that kills 50,000 Americans a year. And by making us drive less, your tough love might have saved some of the 41,000 who die on the roads.
That is to say nothing of what your tough love might have done for Americans' fitness. I don't mean that we would have worked out and slimmed down just to please you; we're much too lazy to do that for anyone. But if you had made gasoline expensive enough, some of us might at least have started walking more (remember walking?), even if only to McDonald's.
I dreamed of a long-term commitment. I wanted to be able to trust you to reduce output permanently and thereby help stop all the terrible sprawl we're always complaining about. The whole pattern of land use in this country is based on cheap energy, and whatever we may say about it, we really have no plans to stop randomly replacing bucolic vistas with strip malls. You could have been our knight in shining armor, the one who saved us from the suburbs that ate civilization.
Your pattern of secretiveness, always thrilling in an affair like ours, was another plus. Love means never having to tell the American people that, adjusted for inflation, gas is actually cheaper today than it was in 1960. Americans need something to get worked up about; faced with seven long months of Bush vs. Gore, pump prices make a wonderful diversion.
Ah, but dearest OPEC, you have already betrayed my hopes, so I might as well confess. Before I fell for you, my heart used to go pitter-patter for a certain Federal Reserve chairman who seemed to have the whole economy in his hands.
Sorry, Mr. Greenspan, but you're nothing next to these exotic oil men. All you can do is fiddle with short-term interest rates. By raising oil prices, my favorite cartel can fire a laser-guided smart bomb precisely at the most tax-worthy part of the economy this side of cigarettes. Because we lack the discipline to impose sharply higher taxes on gasoline, the most socially destructive fossil fuel, we were lucky to have OPEC to do the job for us.
Of course, the cartel kept the money -- it was entitled to something for playing the bad guy, no? But at least we got the economic benefits, which ought to have included the slower economy that you, Mr. Greenspan, have been pining for. If only OPEC had stayed the course. (Sigh.)
Now it looks like prices will flatten out and that the gas tax will stay as it is. But I haven't given up all hope. Sometimes, when I remember the land yachts of my youth arrayed in block-long gas lines, I think wistfully of what might have been. I dream again that my wild and crazy energy hegemonists will take up the lance anew, twisting down the wellhead valves and rescuing us from our own worst enemies -- ourselves.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Asian Values, Trumped By the New Economy

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
WHATEVER happened to "Asian values?"
With the unexpectedly rapid revival of most of the economies in East Asia, you would think that there would be a lot more talk again in the region about the hardy superiority of Asia's often more authoritarian and centralized approach to fostering economic growth and running governments. 
 But the avatars of Asian values -- Lee Kuan Yew, the patriarch and former prime minister of Singapore, and Mohathir Mohamad, the prime minister of Malaysia -- who were once so outspoken about the dangers of individualism and the cultural failings of the West, have barely been heard from lately. And few in Asia are listening these days to sermons on "Asian" virtues of thrift, strong extended families, personal connections and deference to elders. Instead, the continent has fallen in love with the Internet.
On a recent trip to Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Jakarta, I was struck repeatedly by the widespread enthusiasm for doing business on the Web. The mania for the few dot-com stocks aimed at the Asian market is just the most visible sign. More profound is how quickly Asia's leaders are realizing that they can't flourish in the new economy by doing business as usual.
"We have no choice but to adapt an Asian version of the American model of openness and entrepreneurialism," said Victor Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. "Fortunately, that's where Hong Kong already has an advantage."
Yet even in China, where the freewheeling Internet threatens the monolithic power of the Communist Party, the government solidly backs building the infrastructure of a wired economy.
"China needs the Internet more than any other country in the world," said Peter Yip, chief executive of China.com, a Hong-Kong company of which the Beijing government is part-owner. "It's the only way to catch up with the rest of the global economy."
Indeed, the emergence of the Internet is empowering a new generation of Chinese entrepreneurs and luring home some of China's best and brightest who have been studying and working abroad. One evening in Shanghai, at an upscale Western-style restaurant called M on the Bund, I had dinner with three young Chinese entrepreneurs involved in various online ventures. From our table on the seventh floor of a neoclassical stone office building built by foreigners before World War II, we were able to look across the Huangpu River to dozens of modern glass skyscrapers in the sprawling Pudong industrial and commercial area.
The conversation, ranging from media gossip to contemporary art to business strategies, could as easily have taken place in Manhattan, London or Tokyo. Yes, these Web pioneers represent only a thin slice of a tiny elite, but they are likely to be a wedge that helps open China to the wider world.
"In the United States, I'm just another smart tech guy," said Bo Y. Shao, founder and chairman of Eachnet.com, which is trying to introduce a new form of person-to-person e-commerce to China. "Here in Shanghai, my skills are unique."
Mr. Shao, 26, a Shanghai-born math whiz, went to Harvard to study, but returned to China last year to build Eachnet fromscratch. While he adapts his business model to the vagaries of what is still a primitive economic environment, he is raising money abroad and planning a public offering.
EVEN more than in America, the online explosion in China is a challenge to the Asian business establishment, which has been on the defensive since the Asian financial crisis broke in 1997. In the mainstream economy and to some extent online, many leading businesses -- and some spectacular failures -- are little more than the long shadows of powerful families. Ownership and responsibility is closely held at the top, mostly by fathers, sons and brothers. "Guanxi," or connections that sometimes spill over into corruption, are an essential element of the complex dance between business and government elites.
"Family businesses, crony businesses -- they all have to share power and be restructured to be competitive," said Jimmy Lai, chairman of Next Media, a publishing company that is becoming a multimedia content provider and e-commerce vehicle. "The Internet has democratized business. It will inevitably democratize Asian economies."
There is a lot of hype associated with Internet ventures in Asia, of course, just as there is in the United States. And there are plenty of places in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand where basic development remains frozen and the Web is a distant dream.
Still, as the region resumes its economic race, the idea that Asia is fundamentally different has lost its resonance. The information technology revolution is liberalizing an already liberal West; the more traditional East seems destined for the same.

HEADLINE: REPORT ON EXECUTIVE PAY;
In the Options Age, Rising Pay (and Risk)

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
BY any reasonable measure, the final year of the 1900's was a fantastically lucrative time to be the chief executive of a major American corporation.
After a decade of seemingly limitless pay increases, the average compensation for chief executives shot up an additional 23 percent, to $11.9 million, last year. Valuing stock options in the most widely used way, a chief executive now makes more in a single day than the typical American worker does in a year. Thanks to stock and options from previous years, the average corporate leader has squirreled away holdings worth an additional $75 million, at recent market prices. 
 It is said virtually every spring, as public companies publish the documents detailing their senior executives' pay, but it bears repeating: These numbers are enormous, far higher than anything any society has ever paid a group of employees.
And yet there is one comparison that makes the average chief executive look practically bourgeois.
That, of course, is the pay of the people at the helm of the smaller, younger and generally far less familiar technology companies at the heart of the so-called new economy. On average, they made $27 million last year, including salary and the estimated current value of the stock options they received. They have accumulated $720 million more in equity, on average -- almost 10 times the holdings of the bosses of old-line companies, according to an analysis conducted for Money & Business by Executive Compensation Advisory Services, an Alexandria, Va., publisher of pay data.
The study examined the pay of the chief executives of 100 of America's largest nontechnology companies and 60 of the leading new-economy concerns, from America Online to PurchasePro.com, an operator of business-to-business Web marketplaces. Unlike most studies of executive pay, the survey also compared the most common method of estimating the value of stock options with the one that arguably influences executive behavior the most: the options' value based on the current stock price.
The results, along with interviews with pay consultants, executives and recruiters, point to the single largest force shaping compensation at the top of the economy today: the dichotomy between old-economy and new-economy stocks.
Technology shares are notoriously volatile, and they have cratered in the last few days. But their gains over the last year remain stunning, with the Nasdaq composite index up 83 percent. Much of the rest of the market, over that period, has stalled. As a result, hundreds of executives at some of America's best-known companies, like J.C. Penney, Xerox and Mattel, find the bulk of their recent stock option grants worthless -- "under water," in the parlance of executive pay -- at least for now.
And that, as the headlines announce daily, has created an executive class more receptive than ever to the lure of the digital economy. "The giant sucking sound you hear is all of the talent in America rushing to the Internet," said Alan M. Johnson, the president of Johnson Associates, a New York pay consulting firm.
THE exodus has left many companies desperate to retain top managers. It has also given executives -- whether in the new economy or the old, at companies with soaring or plummeting stock prices -- more leverage to demand unheard-of sums.
Traditional companies are increasing how much pay they package in the form of salary, bonus and restricted stock -- or anything else that, unlike stock options, still has value when a share price declines. "When the market is up, executives all want equity," said James A. Hatch, an executive vice president at Compensation Resource Group, a pay adviser. "When the market is down, they all say, 'The market has nothing to do with the performance of this company.' "
New-economy companies, meanwhile, have found that piles of options are no longer enough, as sought-after executives have become savvier about the high failure rates in the dot-com world and the unpredictability of Internet stock prices. At public Internet companies, the salary and bonus of chief executives who are hired hands, not founders, rose about 15 percent last year, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers -- a gain that put their cash pay at about $450,000.
Occasionally, top executives who bolt to dot-coms can even get guarantees protecting them against reversals of fortune. Joseph Galli, who left Black & Decker in June to become president of Amazon.com, received almost two million stock options -- and a promise that Amazon would make up the difference if they were not worth at least $20 million by 2003.
All in all for top executives, 1999 became an updated version of the old saw about the coin flip: Heads, I'm really wealthy; tails, I'm fabulously wealthy.
To be sure, much of that wealth remains on paper, particularly for the Internet bosses. If the Web market is truly a bubble, and if that bubble is near the point of bursting, many could find themselves deep under water without a lifeline. But the lure remains for old-economy executives. Just last week, Patricia Fili-Krushel left as president of the ABC television network to join Healtheon/WebMD, an Internet health care company. In August, Daniel H. Schulman jumped from AT&T to Priceline.com as president; in February, he was joined by Heidi G. Miller, who defected from Citigroup to become chief financial officer. Andersen Consulting, Federal Express and Nike have lost high-profile managers, as well.
The departures have left old-economy companies looking for pay strategies to help them stem the tide and motivate the people left behind. "There's a lot of panic out there," said Ira T. Kay, who oversees the executive compensation group of Watson Wyatt Worldwide. "Morale at these companies is just in the toilet."
Even with the revival of interest in many old economy stocks in recent weeks, some 54 percent of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 closed on Friday at prices lower than a year earlier. The market in old-economy stocks has been so bearish, in fact, that the median estimated value of the options granted last year to the 100 old-line chiefs in the Money & Business survey, based on their companies' recent stock prices, was zero.
"The primary retention device -- option vesting -- is not working," said George B. Paulin, president of Frederic W. Cook & Company, a pay consulting firm.
Few have seen their holdings plummet more than Geoffrey Bible, the Philip Morris chief executive. When 1999 began, Mr. Bible had accumulated a pile of options worth $94 million. During the year, he received an additional one million options and cashed in $7 million worth of his original stash. Yet by the time the world rang in 2000, Philip Morris's stock had fallen by 56 percent -- and all of Mr. Bible's remaining options were worth less than $1 million.
What's an old-line company to do? Some are reaching back to resuscitate pay strategies last in vogue during the bear market of the 1970's. They are basing raises, bonuses and incentive payments for chief executives and other top talent susceptible to dot-com fever on company earnings, rather than on stock performance, for example. For the 100 old-economy executives in the Money & Business study, bonuses rose almost 30 percent last year, largely because of the companies' strong profits.
More companies are also giving raises to their most productive managers, even if it means creating disparities among workers with the same title. "We're making sure a larger percentage of our pay goes to the very best performers," said Rick Martino, I.B.M.'s vice president for talent.
In the highest corporate ranks, companies are increasingly granting restricted stock to executives . These are real shares -- not options -- that hold value even if the stock is falling, though the executive must hang onto them for a designated period. Thirty-nine percent of large companies gave their chief executives such awards last year, up from 33 percent in 1998, according to a sampling of proxies by Pearl Meyer & Partners, compensation consultants in New York. The average grant size shot up 25 percent, to $1.2 million. Not one of the 60 new-economy chief executives in the Money & Business study received a single share of restricted stock.
Owens Corning, the building materials maker, was typical of old-economy companies that turned more toward cash and restricted stock. Its shares lost more than 40 percent of their value in 1999. But its chief executive, Glen H. Hiner, saw his salary and bonus jump 38 percent, to $4 million. And he received a $2.3 million grant of restricted stock, 10 times what he got in 1998.
"We were intentionally more aggressive in awarding equity in 1999," said Dennis Vereb, the company's vice president for compensation, both to reward executives for record earnings and to motivate them to lift the company's share price.
A growing number of companies seem no longer to care about the effects of a 1993 law -- the one pay initiative that grew out of the Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign -- that limits the maximum amount of base pay they can deduct from taxes for their top five executives to $1 million each. (The law exempts any amount above $1 million that is tied to performance, or that is deferred.)
Archer Daniels Midland, for example, paid its chief executive, G. Allen Andreas, a base salary of $2.4 million last year, costing the company as much as $490,000 in deductions. In its proxy, the company says that limiting pay to $1 million would be "inadvisable."
Another approach to retention is to give employees access to investments that companies hope will mimic the rise in Internet shares. Dozens of companies, including The New York Times, have said they will issue tracking stocks or set up separate divisions for their dot-com operations. Andersen Consulting, meanwhile, announced a $200 million venture-capital fund last month, the proceeds of which will go to selected employees.
Health care and pharmaceutical companies are studying similar plans, said Pearl Meyer, who runs the pay advisory firm bearing her name.
"They're playing defense," Ms. Meyer said.
OF course, companies continue to hand out enormous option grants as well, but the erratic stock market, combined with a new accounting rule, has altered the specifics.
In past years, companies responded to stock weakness by repricing old options -- canceling a $30 option if shares were trading at $20, for instance, and replacing it with one that had an exercise price of $20.
The practice angered shareholder groups, which said it undercut the entire premise of rewarding managers for good performance and punishing them for mediocre results. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, deciding that repricing violated the spirit of its guidelines, ruled last month that companies engaging in the practice would have to take a charge against their earnings.
So now some companies are changing the other variable in the options equation -- time -- by awarding options with longer terms.
At Reebok, for example, the chief executive, Paul B. Fireman, held some 500,000 options that were on the verge of expiring worthless, until Reebok's board extended their term by 10 years, according to the company's recent proxy. Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble, both suffering from swooning stocks, are issuing options with 15-year exercise terms, instead of 10 years.
Some observers worry that the extensions might let executives off the hook for poor performance.
"Ten years seems like an appropriate long-term horizon," said Ann Yerger, director of research at the Council of Institutional Investors. Extending that period, she added, "is sort of a way of repricing and increasing the value of awards."
"I don't think that's the kind of behavior that is going to be applauded by institutional investors," she said.
Companies say they have little choice but to sweeten the deals they offer top management: executives are exploiting to the hilt the power that a tight labor market gives them.
THEIR increasing leverage has rewritten the rules for salary negotiations that were once often a good-natured give-and-take between a board and an executive who had probably spent most of his career at the company, pay experts say. The dynamic began to change in the early 1990's, when corporate governance advocates lobbied directors to show more independence and as a recession prompted companies to dismiss even senior employees. Now that the economy favors the executives, it is their turn to play rough.
"All across American industry, we have a much harder, tougher relationship," said Mr. Johnson, the New York pay consultant, adding that some executive salary negotiations now resemble talks with organized labor. "It has a very different feel to it than five years ago."
Today, executives are getting everything from Mr. Galli's multimillion-dollar guarantees to multiple country club memberships to security details.
"Perks really started to go out of fashion 10 to 15 years ago," said Carol Bowie, the director of research at Executive Compensation Advisory Services. "They're coming back."
Honeywell, for example, pays for Michael R. Bonsignore's wife to travel with him -- and then picks up the taxes they would otherwise have to pay on that income. The company also gave Mr. Bonsignore the lifetime use of security guards and clerical support, and it picked up the fees of the lawyer who negotiated his contract.
"It's a feeding frenzy," Mr. Hatch said. "Everybody's looking at each other's proxies and saying, 'They get more; I want more.' "
One thing that the Money & Business study makes clear is the through-the-looking-glass nature of executive pay. Who's on top depends very much on how the numbers are added and on the assumptions behind them.
By one measure, for example, the old-line executives appear to outgun their upstart rivals even in the value of their stock options, still the largest component of executive pay. Using the simplest formula for valuing options, which assigns each option a value of roughly one-third of its exercise price, the 60 upstarts received options worth an average of $3.4 million, while the 100 old-economy chiefs got an average of $4.6 million.
Elevating the old-economy average were a handful of windfalls: American Express granted Harvey Golub options valued at almost $45 million. At Alcoa, Paul H. O'Neill got more than $32 million in options and at General Electric, John F. Welch Jr. got almost $25 million worth. (Bank of America granted Hugh L. McColl Jr. options valued at nearly $35 million, but for now those options are under water.)
Almost none of the new-economy executives could boast of such packages. But that is largely because the most common methods of valuing options often badly understate their value, Ms. Bowie said.
How? Many technology executives receive options before, or just as, their companies go public, and so the options' exercise price -- generally the market price at the time the options are granted -- is a faint shadow of the price assigned the shares by rabid investors in initial public offerings.
Consider Charles E. Johnson Jr., chief executive of PurchasePro.com, which went public last September. At one-third of their exercise price, his 1999 options were worth less than $400,000. However, at the options' estimated current value in the study -- an average of the stock's price at the end of December, January and February -- Mr. Johnson's options are worth $54 million. If he is keeping an eye on the stock's price, that is what the market is telling him his pay package is worth.
The current valuation method yields an average of $27 million each for the total pay packages of new-economy executives, vaulting them well past their old-economy counterparts. Of course, as the last few days' trading underscores, technology stocks also fall, making the Wunderkinds' options less valuable, or even worthless. But others will soar further -- and make the executives' 1999 pay look even better in retrospect.
AT recent values, the billionaires club is expanding beyond well-known figures like Bill Gates of Microsoft and Jeff Bezos of Amazon.
Joining them this year are Henry T. Nicholas III of Broadcom, a maker of communications chips, who owns $4.8 billion in stock and options; JoMei Chang of Vitria Technology, a maker of e-commerce software ($2.3 billion); and Scott Kriens of Juniper Networks, which makes Internet routers ($1.1 billion).
"People are ending up with levels of wealth far beyond what could have been created even five years ago," said Carl Schmitt, a vice president of WestWard Pay Strategies in San Francisco.
The great majority of that wealth, like the wealth of so many investors and new-economy workers, depends on the Internet remaining in the good graces of Wall Street. Old-economy executives, on the other hand, get to take home much of their earnings immediately.
Even Mr. Bible at Philip Morris didn't have such a bad 1999, by that standard. He received $6.3 million in hard cash, thanks to a $4.4 million bonus largely for meeting the company's earnings goals. And the one million options he received were double the number in his 1998 grant.
If Philip Morris's stock rebounds, he -- like many executives at large companies -- will have the best of both worlds: a big paycheck to make up for the volatile 1999 stock market and the gains from all of the options still being handed out.
Oh -- and the average full-time worker's income? It increased about 3 percent in 1999, to roughly $33,000.

Greenspan Feels the Earth Shake

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ALAN GREENSPAN is among the most powerful men in the world. As chairman of the Federal Reserve, he can alter the course of the economy by moving interest rates up and down. His pronouncements can send shudders through markets around the globe.
Wrong. 
 Or so it seems as Mr. Greenspan tries, with little success so far, to cool off an economy that is threatening to overheat and impose a degree of temperance on Wall Street's long-running party.
It is not just Mr. Greenspan whose clout is in question. Given that companies, consumers and investors have proven largely impervious to a series of rate hikes by the Fed, economists are wondering whether monetary policy still works, or at least whether it works the same way it used to.
The Fed has pushed interest rates up five times since June. In the meantime, the economy has continued thundering along at a pace well above what most economists think is sustainable over the long run without generating inflation. The government reported last week that the economy grew at a 7.3 percent annual rate in the last quarter of 1999, its fastest pace in 16 years, and all the signs are that growth has moderated only slightly so far in 2000.
Although stock prices have taken to gyrating wildly, and the high-flying technology stocks in the Nasdaq index have been hit hard, the trend on Wall Street has remained upward. And long-term interest rates have not risen nearly as much as would be expected when the Fed is driving up the official short-term rates it controls.
Higher interest rates take time to filter through the economy, and their full effect may not be felt until later this year. But the economy and the markets are clearly absorbing the Fed's rate hikes with a somewhat perplexing equanimity.
"Monetary policy usually works with a lag of six to nine months, so you shouldn't really expect the rate increases that occurred starting in mid-1999 to have a noticeable impact on the economy before the second quarter of this year," said L. Douglas Lee of Economics from Washington, a consulting firm. "Having said that, the economy is not as sensitive to interest rate increases as it used to be. This makes it tougher for the Fed to slow things down by raising interest rates."
In textbooks, monetary policy sounds pretty simple. Fed officials make a judgment about how fast the economy can grow without igniting inflation, based on the growth of the working population and improvements in productivity. (Over the last few years those estimates have risen to nearly 4 percent, from just over 2 percent.)
When growth exceeds that rate over a sustained period, the Fed drives up the short-term interest rates it controls. Banks then charge more for loans. The bond market pushes up corporate borrowing rates. Stock prices come under pressure.
With mortgages and auto loans more expensive, and people feeling less wealthy, consumers buy fewer houses and cars. With their costs rising and sales slowing, companies might choose to close a plant, or not to open a new one. Jobs become less plentiful. The economy slows and inflation fades.
In the real world it is more complicated.
For one thing, although growth rates are well above what almost anyone thinks is sustainable over the long run, there is almost no inflation. Moreover, the economy and the markets are changing in ways that tend to dampen the effect of rising rates.
TAKE mortgages. Rates on traditional fixed-rate mortgages have shot up over the last year. But homebuyers have learned to maintain their purchasing power by shifting into adjustable rate mortgages, which initially carry lower monthly payments. Mr. Lee said that at the beginning of 1999, while rates were quite low, only about 10 percent of homebuyers were choosing adjustable mortgages. By the end of last year 30 percent of homebuyers were choosing adjustables. As a result, home sales, a key driver of economic growth, have kept running at a brisk pace.
Moreover, much of the economic growth in recent years has come from advances in technology, and technology companies carry relatively little debt compared with their "old economy" cousins in capital-intensive fields like manufacturing. Companies with little debt are less sensitive to rising rates than those with big debt loads, and are therefore less likely to cut back as the Fed tightens policy.
The difference between old and new economy companies is just one reason the financial markets have not reacted much to the Fed's tighter monetary policy. Another is psychological: investors have become so conditioned to Mr. Greenspan keeping the economy on an even keel that they are concentrating not on the pain he is seeking to inflict on them through rate increases but on the presumed outcome of his efforts -- an economy that continues growing steadily with little inflation. Mr. Greenspan is in some ways a victim of his own success.
Much the same phenomenon is at work in the bond market. Because the government is running huge budget surpluses, the Treasury is paying off the national debt. In doing so, the government is creating a shortage of Treasury bonds, driving up the price of those bonds and driving down the interest rate they carry. In effect, the Treasury and the Fed are working at cross purposes.
One result has been a call for the Fed to reexamine the tools it uses. If the key to bringing the economy's growth down to a sustainable level is reining in the stock market, as Mr. Greenspan says, then perhaps he should consider aiming his fire directly at Wall Street.
In Congress, pressure is mounting on Mr. Greenspan to tighten the rules on buying stocks with borrowed money. But Mr. Greenspan has repeatedly replied that such a move could not be counted on to have any effect on stock prices.
So the Fed will no doubt continue using its imperfect though not impotent interest rate tool. And Mr. Greenspan may find that he has to raise rates further, and in bigger increments, than he would prefer.

HEADLINE: REPORT ON EXECUTIVE PAY;
What the Numbers Mean, and How They Were Calculated

 BODY:
IN examining executive compensation, Money & Business sought this year to capture the differences between the pay practices of companies in the old economy of industrial, service and financial concerns and those in the new economy of Internet and related businesses.
After all, one of the biggest worries today of managers at established companies is the flight of workers to Internet jobs that promise unprecedented wealth. And one of the great concerns of economists and market watchers is that the new economy's pay practices -- especially its generosity with stock options -- may be contributing to a casino mentality, blind to business fundamentals.
To gauge the divide, Executive Compensation Advisory Services, an Alexandria, Va., division of Harcourt Inc. that collects, analyzes and sells information on executive pay, collected data on pay at 160 companies among the early filers of proxies for 1999, the documents in which compensation details are reported. 
 Representing the old economy in the survey were 100 of the largest nontechnology companies (as measured by sales) that had filed their proxies by March 23.
The 60 new-economy companies had the same proxy deadline and appeared on one of 10 widely watched indexes of technology stocks: the Dow Jones Internet composite index; the Fortune e-50; the Interactive Week Internet index; the USA Today Internet 100; internet.com's Internet Stock List and ISDEX Internet Stock index; the Wall Street Research Net e-tailers index; and TheStreet.com's Internet Sector, e-commerce and e-finance indexes.
(A company in one of these indexes that would also have qualified, by size, for inclusion in the old-economy list -- Microsoft, for example, or I.B.M. -- was considered part of the new economy in the study.)
All 160 chief executives had to hold the job for their company's entire 1999 fiscal year. (That period varied widely, with the fiscal year for a few companies ending as early as March 1999.) Several of those listed -- like Bill Gates of Microsoft and Dale F. Morrison of Campbell Soup -- are no longer chief executive today.
Pay can be added up any number of ways. Pay critics -- and corporate recruiters -- tend to cite the biggest possible numbers, while executives and company directors may have an interest in minimizing the size of pay packages. In any event, the biggest differences stem from the way stock options are valued.
Any value assigned to an option is a guess; the real worth of a chance to buy a stock four years from now at, say, $10 a share depends on the trading price of that stock in four years. The data in the tables on these two pages represents an attempt to recognize this uncertainty, and to take into account how people think about options in real life.
Options granted in 1999 are valued two different ways. One method, using a widely accepted guideline of 33 percent of the price at which the options were granted, takes into account the volatility of stock prices. The other method estimates the value of options based on recent prices for each company's stock -- the value that an executive would have in mind if he was keeping one eye on the stock ticker.
Neither of these numbers appears in corporate proxy statements, which use one of two other methods for valuing options. Simply using the companies' values would make it impossible to compare various executives' options grants.
Given the complications, the tables do not try to total cash and options pay into a single number. Income from exercising options granted in past years is also reported separately, as it can be viewed as compensation for previous years' work.
Here are definitions for the columns in the tables.
 
Direct Compensation
 
SALARY -- Base annual pay that does not directly depend on company results.
 
BONUS -- A cash payment that can very widely depending on the company's performance.
 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AND OTHER -- A combination of two categories. The first covers incentive payments that most companies set approximately three years in advance and pay out depending on the company's performance. The second includes miscellaneous items like moving expenses, insurance payments or fees covering personal use of a corporate jet.
 
TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION -- The sum of the three previous categories.
 
At-Risk Compensation
 
RESTRICTED STOCK -- The value, as reported by the company, of shares conditionally granted to an executive. Typically, executives get to keep these shares only if they remain with the company for a predetermined period.
Values are shown only for executives who received restricted stock. None of the new-economy executives in the study received restricted stock, so the column does not appear on the new-economy table.
 
1999 OPTIONS, GRANT-DATE VALUE --An estimate of the value of the stock options granted to an executive in 1999, based on the price of the company's stock when the options were granted. (The exercise price of all options in the study is the same as the market price on the grant date.)
One of the most common methods for valuing options is the Black-Scholes formula, which takes into account the exercise price of the option, the time before it can be exercised, the time before it expires and the volatility of the company's stock. A widely used approximation of the formula simply takes one-third of the exercise price. This is the method that Money & Business used.
For example, if an executive received 100,000 options on a stock that was trading at $30, the study estimated the grant to be worth 100,000 multiplied by $10, or $1 million.
 
1999 OPTIONS, ESTIMATED CURRENT VALUE -- An estimate of the value of the stock options an executive received in 1999, based on recent prices of the stock.
The study found the average of the company's closing stock prices at the end of December, January and February. The exercise price of the option was then subtracted from that average to arrive at a current value for the option.
Consider again the executive who received 100,000 options on a stock that was trading, on the grant date, at $30. If the average recent stock price was $50, each option would be valued at $20, and the 100,000 options would be worth $2 million. If the stock was trading at $29, the options would have no current value.
 
Accumulated Wealth
 
OPTIONS PROFITS REALIZED IN F.Y. 1999 -- The gain that executives saw in the 1999 fiscal year by exercising options from previous years. For each option, this number is the difference between the price of the stock when the executive exercised the option and the price at which the option was granted. In some cases, executives immediately sell the underlying shares, and in other cases they hold onto the stock. Values are shown only for executives who realized profits during the fiscal year.
 
VALUE OF STOCK BENEFICIALLY HELD -- The value of shares held outright by an executive, based on the closing stock price at the end of the company's fiscal year. In some cases -- because, for instance, shares are held in trust for a child -- executives may disclaim beneficial ownership of a portion of the shares they are reported as owning.
 
VALUE OF OPTIONS, F.Y. END -- Value, at the end of acompany's fiscal year, of both exercisable and nonexercisable options held by the executive.
 
TOTAL VALUE OF EQUITY -- The sum of the previous two numbers.
 
OWNERSHIP STAKE -- Beneficial stock holdings, plus exercisable options and options exercisable within 60 days, as a percentage of the company's total shares outstanding, as reported in the company's proxy.

Performance
 
STOCK PERFORMANCE VS. S.& P. 500 -- The amount, in percentage points, by which the company's performance trailed or exceeded the stock index during the period through the end of the company's 1999 fiscal year.
Performance comparisons are for a one-year period for new-economy companies and a three-year period for old-economy companies.
For those new-economy companies that went public during the 1999 fiscal year, performance is measured against the index for the portion of the year that they were publicly traded.
Some new-economy companies went public after the end of the fiscal year; they are shown as N.A.
 
Averages and Medians
For each column, these figures take into account only executives for whom values were reported. For example, the averages for restricted stock grants to old-economy executives include only the 34 executives who received restricted stock. "Average" is the arithmetic mean; "median" is the figure in the middle of the series of numbers.
The performance statistics were calculated by Money & Business, based on data provided by Factset Research Systems, a research firm in Greenwich, Conn., and Bloomberg Financial Markets. All other data was calculated by Executive Compensation Advisory Services.

HEADLINE: REPORT ON EXECUTIVE PAY;
Will Today's Huge Rewards Devour Tomorrow's Earnings?

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
OVER the last 15 years, as executive pay has soared and each new plateau has met with something of a public outcry, America's business leaders and their supporters have had a ready answer for the critics: Look at the stock market.
In 1988, when the average pay of chief executives at large companies first topped $2 million, the Dow Jones industrial average ended the year at 2,168. By 1995, when average pay hit $5.8 million, the Dow had reached 5,117. On Dec. 31, 1999, the end of a year in which the average pay package reached $11.9 million, the index closed at 11,497. 
 The two numbers have enjoyed a symbiotic relationship, the executives argue, as the promise of wealth, in the form of stock options, has inspired them to create efficient companies that are driving the longest economic expansion in American history.
To a large extent, the debate is over, and the executives have won.
Companies in Europe and Asia are starting to mimic the American system by raising salaries and awarding more stock. Dot-com billionaires have made the fortunes of some old-line executives look moderate. And eight years after Bill Clinton made exorbitant executive pay an issue in his first presidential campaign, the topic has disappeared from the political scene.
Yet at this moment of triumph -- when nine-digit packages are a reality and eight-digit annual pay is the norm -- there is a rising undercurrent of concern over the very thing that executives credit with helping motivate the country's stunning growth: the tremendous boom in stock options.
Over the last five years, America's companies have handed over a large portion of themselves to the executives who run them. That has aligned management's interests with investors, delighting those who advocate tying executive pay to performance.
But a growing number of analysts warn that it has also created the potential for a host of long-term problems that could undercut economic growth.
As top executives (and other employees) continue to exercise their rising pile of options over the next decade, other stockholders will see their stakes watered down. It seems unavoidable. Already, companies have spent billions of dollars in recent years -- and taken on rising levels of debt -- buying back shares to minimize the dilution. For the repurchasing to continue at its current pace, a recent Federal Reserve study warned, companies would have to devote virtually all of their future earnings to buybacks.
In essence, the skeptics worry, corporate America is using stock options like a credit card without a spending limit. While every penny in salary is recorded as a cost on company books, hundreds of billions of dollars in stock options aren't counted at all. To the fire of a blazing stock market, companies add the fuel of overly rosy earnings reports, unencumbered by off-the-books promises of future pay.
IN a speech last summer, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said stock options helped "impede judgments about prospective earnings" and, over the last five years, had caused companies to overstate profit growth by one to two percentage points each year.
The level of exaggeration is on the rise, doubling between 1997 and 1998, according to a study by Bear Stearns. At some companies -- including Cisco Systems, a new-economy stalwart that briefly last week boasted the highest market capitalization in the world -- earnings would be more than 20 percent lower if stock options were accounted for.
"The dilution is a serious financial problem, and it ought to be getting a lot of attention," said John C. Bogle, the founder and former chairman of the Vanguard Group, the big mutual fund company.
Not everyone agrees, to be sure. By attracting and motivating the best workers and managers, stock options spur long-term growth at a faster rate than they dilute a company's shares, many executives argue, giving stockholders better net returns than they would have received otherwise. "I'm a great believer in stock options," said Dennis Powell, the controller of Cisco, one of the stock market's best performers over the last decade.
In addition, companies publish their level of "overhang" -- the percentage of the company that options would represent if all were exercised -- allowing investors to factor it into their decisions. And widely published statistics on diluted earnings per share take into account any options that currently have value.
But a growing number of investors remain skittish. Fund managers at T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F., a $288 billion pension and mutual fund company, are more often using their proxies to vote against executive pay plans. Over all, the proportion of such plans that meet tough resistance is up. And a New York Stock Exchange task force has recommended tightening guidelines to force companies to seek shareholder approval of almost all options plans.
"For the first time, you're starting to see mainstream institutional investors become concerned that the decade-long stock-option binge has left companies with serious, structural earnings problems," said Patrick S. McGurn, the director of corporate programs at Institutional Shareholder Services, a Rockville, Md., group that advises large investors.
Even some of the consultants paid to design executives' contracts -- who have been some of the loudest defenders of the pay explosion -- have grown concerned.
"We're giving away more and more of the future value of the company," said Richard H. Wagner, president of Strategic Compensation Research Associates.
Corporate debt, rising in large part to pay for options plans, "is the dirty little secret of corporate America," added Ira T. Kay, the head of the pay practice at Watson Wyatt Worldwide.
Just a few years ago, boards of directors were hesitant to set aside more than 1 percent of a company's equity for stock options in any given year; they generally kept the overall level of outstanding options below 10 percent.
But just as technology companies have transformed attitudes about stock price valuations and the track record that a company should have before going public, so have they blown through the old guidelines on options.
"The dot-com and new economy companies have rewritten all the rules," said Gary Locke, head of Towers Perrin's executive compensation practice.
The rising use of stock options predates the Internet, but the remarkable success of technology firms over the last five years has helped to rapidly accelerate the trend. The number of millionaires, and mega-millionaires, that technology companies have created has put the rest of corporate America on the defensive. One response has been to ply executives with even more options.
Last year, the nation's 200 largest public companies handed out options that represented the equivalent of 2.1 percent of their outstanding shares, up from 1.2 percent in 1994, according to Pearl Meyer & Partners, a pay consulting firm in New York. As a result, the average overhang reached 13.7 percent in 1999, well above the old 10 percent ceiling.
Since 1996, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has required companies to include a footnote in their annual reports disclosing what options would cost, using one or another widely accepted formula, if they were charged as an employment expense.
Why is there a cost? In granting options, companies are allowing employees to buy stock in the future at today's (presumably lower) price. To make up for the discount, the companies either forgo issuing shares for which they could have received full price, or they buy back existing shares and forfeit the difference.
"You're buying high and selling low," Mr. McGurn said.
Of course, if a company's stock price has fallen below the exercise price when its executives become eligible to cash them in, the executives will not exercise them, and other investors' shares will not be diluted. But that is hardly a trade-off most companies would welcome. When options are under water -- as is the case at so many old-economy companies today -- many executives either flee or demand other payments to make up for money they had expected to get.
To date, few companies appear to have suffered from the options boom. Strong profits have given many of them enough cash to pay for their growth and to repurchase millions of shares. Among other things, the buybacks have generally prevented options granted in the early 1990's and exercised over the last few years from diluting earnings per share -- though, of course, the money used to buy the shares could have been deployed to other ends.
From 1994 to 1998, the amount that companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 spent each year on stock repurchases more than tripled, to almost $150 billion, according to a Fed analysis of Compustat data. Together, buybacks over that period accounted for about 2 percent of all outstanding shares.
BUT the pace of option grants has accelerated rapidly in the last few years, and the number of exercisable options will be far greater in five years than it is now. As a result, the Fed study found, companies would have no money for investments or dividends if they tried to keep up their pace of buybacks. On the other hand, the study's authors warned, slowing the pace of buybacks "could have a negative effect on equity valuations."
Of course, companies could borrow to buy back stock -- a strategy for which they have already shown a fondness. Corporate debt has risen by 45 percent over the last five years, and much of the increase is a result of share repurchases, said John Lonski, the chief economist at Moody's Investor Services.
Defenders of the current level of option grants point out that the growth of the stock market has kept debt-to-equity ratios at levels that are of little concern. Skeptics note that the ratios have risen in recent years despite the long bull market, leaving companies vulnerable to a correction.
The central question, though, may be whether investors have taken into account the rising level of overhang when valuing today's market.
On one hand, the footnotes in companies' annual reports tell investors the degree to which options could dilute their shares and offer an estimate of the options' cost. "There is full disclosure," said Rick Escherich, a managing director at J. P. Morgan, "and I assume it is something that gets factored into every company."
On the other hand, the information is buried inside a document issued once a year, in an era when the smallest bit of news about a company can instantly alter its stock price. "We all know companies' stock price moves on quarterly earnings numbers, not annual reports," said Pat McConnell, a senior managing director at Bear Stearns and one of the authors of the study that found options' true effect on earnings to be rising (though still smaller than in some earlier estimates).
Some analysts are not even sure that individual investors find the annual footnotes. "You've got to be pretty sophisticated to sort it all out," said Paula Todd, who manages the executive compensation research division at Towers Perrin. "My grandmother isn't going to figure out the overhang."
A further question is what companies are getting for their largess. Numerous studies in recent years have shown that companies with high levels of executive stock ownership have outperformed companies with low levels. Few of the studies, however, asked what the ideal level of ownership was: Do companies get an extra bang from making their chief executives centimillionaires, for instance, rather than mere decimillionaires?
Noting the void, three Columbia Business School professors undertook a study of 600 companies, examining their performance over the last 20 years. Their results, published late last year in the Journal of Financial Economics, showed that increasing an executive's stakes in a company did not cause stronger earnings or a higher stock price. Instead, it appears to be other factors, like research spending, that cause a company to perform well.
"A lot of the evidence people have cited for the link between ownership and performance is flawed," said Charles P. Himmelberg, one of the authors.
Another, R. Glenn Hubbard, added, "There's not much extra kick from higher managerial ownership." The ideal level of ownership appears to vary by company, they said.
A recent Salomon Smith Barney study, meanwhile, found that most of the heaviest users of options in the S. & P. 500 actually underperformed the index.
Such findings can only fuel the skepticism that already has companies working harder to win shareholder approval of proposals for new option plans. Fourteen such proposals, including one at Ben & Jerry's, the ice cream maker, failed last year. More significant, one out of every seven proposals received at least 30 percent negative votes last year, according to Strategic Compensation Research Associates, which advises companies on getting such plans approved. Three years ago, only one of every 12 plans met that level of opposition.
BECAUSE many of the yes votes represent bulk votes by brokers, on behalf of individuals who do not return their ballots, anything but a landslide often means that executives had to lobby large investors or revise parts of their proposals.
"It used to be that you just put your plan in your proxy," Ms. Todd said. "Now that period when the proxy is out on the street is hell for a lot of companies."
Even Microsoft, with years of stellar returns, saw 27 percent of its shares vote against a small option plan for board members in November.
It would be an exaggeration, however, to suggest that investors no longer believe in options, analysts say. "There's a general consensus that stock options have been very beneficial to the performance of U.S. companies," said Mr. Escherich of J. P. Morgan. "The question is: What is the right level?"

Fear? Not in Three Asian Markets

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
TAIWAN just elected a president who has historically advocated independence for his island nation. China has repeatedly warned that any move in that direction will ignite a war. So how did investors in greater China react?
By kicking off a brisk market rally, of course. 
 Before they got caught in last week's technology sell-off, stocks in Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China's two markets, Shanghai and Shenzhen, were jumping in the aftermath of the vote. In Taipei and Hong Kong, where the post-election relief was most palpable, shares were up 9 percent and 3 percent, respectively, from March 22 through Wednesday.
The immediate cause of the euphoria was the tranquillity on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Despite its noisy declamations beforehand, Beijing has been quiet since Taiwanese voters elected the veteran opposition leader, Chen Shui-bian. And although Mr. Chen's Democratic Progressive Party formally endorses independence, Mr. Chen is laboring to sound like a moderate.
Concluding that the threat of war has eased, most investors are getting back to business, which in Asia means mimicking -- with a few twists -- the Internet-fueled boom in the United States.
In keeping with that, technology shares in Hong Kong and Taiwan followed the swooning Nasdaq late last week. Hong Kong's losses were steeper than those of Taiwan, where investors are still drawing comfort from the calm political waters.
"China has neither the military capability nor the political motive to attack Taiwan," said Marc Faber, a money manager in Hong Kong, summarizing the majority view. "The politicians will continue to bark, but the business interests in establishing more ties will prevail." Nevertheless, he concedes, "if China takes military action against Taiwan, the whole of Asia is going to collapse like a house of cards."
That, in a nutshell, is the problem facing investors in East Asia "The market is choosing to believe that China will not react strongly to Chen's election," said Dong Tao, a regional analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong. "But there are signs that China has real concerns. This could be the calm before the storm."
So Mr. Tao is of two minds about Asia. He is nervous about political developments but sanguine about its economic prospects.
Mr. Tao said the economies of Taiwan, Hong Kong and China were all rebounding faster than could have been expected after the traumatic downturn of 1997 and 1998. He estimated that Taiwan's gross domestic product would rise 6.8 percent in 2000, that Hong Kong's would grow 5.5 percent and China's, 7 percent.
As in the United States, technology is regarded as the region's main economic engine. In Taiwan, semiconductor manufacturing has long been a foundation of growth. But in Hong Kong, technology is a relatively new phenomenon. And it is being embraced with all the fervor shown by recent converts.
In the last three months, the Hang Seng has been electrified by the shares of new-economy companies like Pacific Century CyberWorks and Tom.com. Pacific Century is an Internet access company, which despite having no real business recently acquired Hong Kong's dominant phone company, Cable and Wireless HKT, in a stock-and-cash deal worth more than $38 billion.
Tom.com is an Internet portal that was started from scratch in January by two companies with ties to Hong Kong's powerful tycoon, Li Ka-shing. Though it has even less substance than Pacific Century -- which at least has a portfolio of investments -- Tom.com is worth $3.95 billion.
Hong Kong's old-economy companies are rushing to put on new-economy clothes -- and doing so with some success. Mr. Li's two flagships, Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong Holdings, have both benefited from their association with Tom.com, as well as their own cyberventures. Another big property developer, Sun Hung Kai, on March 17 spun off an online venture, Sunevision, which is up 25.2 percent since then.
Though analysts are positive about Hong Kong, the sharp sell-off on Thursday and Friday underscores its risks. Neil Saker, the head of economic research at SG Securities in Singapore, said his year-end target for the Hang Seng was 18,000 -- not far above its current level of 17,406.54.
Despite its modest loss on Friday, Taiwan is just starting its climb, Mr. Saker said. He predicted that the Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted index would reach 12,500 by the end of the year, up from 9,854.95 on Friday. "I'm particularly optimistic about Taiwan, because of its dominance of the electronics business," Mr. Saker said.
Taiwan's leading technology companies, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and United Microelectronics, are also trading near record highs. But unlike the Hong Kong market leaders, these companies have operations, producing silicon chips for which there is a measurable and -- at the moment -- nearly unquenchable demand. David Lui, a manager at Strong Investments, which holds Taiwan Semiconductor, thinks earnings will grow 30 to 40 percent, annualized, over the next three years.
CHINA'S impending entry into the World Trade Organization, meanwhile, has fed hopes that Chinese companies will be forced to become more streamlined and competitive.
And China is likely to benefit from a higher profile in Morgan Stanley Capital International's benchmark index of emerging-markets stocks. Morgan Stanley plans to revise the index, which is followed scrupulously by stock fund managers, to give China-related shares a heavier weighting. It will do so by adding widely held stocks like China Telecom, Citic Pacific and Legend Computer to its China index, even though they trade in Hong Kong rather than the illiquid mainland market.
"Investors who track this index will probably sell down Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan to invest in mainland China," Mr. Saker said.

HEADLINE: Dimmed Promise in Prague

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expected a warm reception when she visited her native Prague last month. But even she was surprised to learn shortly before her arrival that President Vaclav Havel intended to propose her as a possible successor. Beyond his admiration for Dr. Albright, Mr. Havel was trying to register a larger point. In the decade since the Velvet Revolution against Communist rule, Prague's political leaders have compiled a record of disillusioning failure, including the fracturing of Czechoslovakia into separate Czech and Slovak states in 1993. No one of Mr. Havel's stature has yet emerged to replace him when his term expires in 2003.
Czechoslovakia's expectations were understandably high when it restored parliamentary democracy and market economics in 1990. Between the two world wars, it was one of Eastern Europe's most vigorous and longest surviving constitutional democracies. Under Alexander Dubcek in the 1960's, it tested the limits of liberal Communism. Then, after the Soviet invasion of 1968, its dissident intellectuals, foremost among them Mr. Havel, developed a vision of a broadly based civil society. By the bleak standards of the Soviet bloc, Czechoslovakia's economy performed relatively well. 
 The most glaring failures of the past decade have been in economic management. Under Vaclav Klaus, who served first as finance minister and then as prime minister until 1997, state-owned industries were privatized without adequate legal oversight or accountability. Initially, the results were promising. But more recently growth has sputtered and a series of corruption scandals has tainted the reputation of business and political leaders. The Czech Republic still has one of Eastern Europe's richer economies and is a candidate for early admission to the European Union. But a more thoughtful round of reforms backed by more legal safeguards will be needed to attract foreign investment and revive growth.
Political life has also been disappointing. Mr. Klaus, a brash conservative, saw his early popularity erode as the economy weakened. Three years ago he fell from office amid a corruption scandal. A weak Social Democratic government now rules in coalition with Mr. Klaus's conservatives. As president, Mr. Havel remains popular and respected, but his health is poor and his political influence is limited.
Dr. Albright was right to disclaim any interest in the Czech presidency. It would create an intolerable conflict of interest for a secretary of state to be looking ahead to directing the affairs of another country. But if Mr. Havel's proposal can jolt Czech politicians into thinking more creatively about their future leadership, it will have served a good purpose.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TREND;
A Clock to See You Through The Next 10,000 Years

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
WITH a clickety-click and a Zen Buddhist gong punctuating the ceremony, some of the people most associated with the dizzying acceleration of the culture ushered in slowness as the new frontier. They activated the prototype of The Clock of the Long Now, the tool designed to measure the next 10,000 years and beyond.
"Hours are an arbitrary artifact of our culture," said Danny Hillis, the clock's inventor and the scientist who pioneered the concept of parallel computers that is now the basis of most supercomputers. "The chance of people using hours 10,000 years from now is probably pretty low." 
 Its spiraling pendulum now slowly twisting, the prototype, an exquisite 9-foot-tall object that first began keeping time welcoming that millennial New Year's Eve, has been called the world's slowest-moving computer. Constructed of brass and monel, a nickel and copper alloy, the clock slightly resembles a futuristic jukebox that computes using mechanics instead of electronic circuitry to calculate extremely slow increments of time. The prototype -- which will travel to the London Science Museum this summer -- tracks the moon's position and phase, local rising and setting times of sun and moon, equinoxes, solstices and the Gregorian calendar up to 10,000 years from now.
Andrew Nahum, project director of "The Making of the Modern World," the exhibit on the history of technology in London, called the clock "an example of sublime technology," not only because of its ingenious mechanics but also because of its "moral reflection."
After three years in a Sausalito machine shop, the prototype made its public debut recently at the TED Conference, the annual powwow for the New Economy's power elite in Monterey. Part latter-day "magic box," as John Harrison's 18th-century longitude-tracking chronometer was called, part conceptual art, the clock has become the cause celebre of a heady cadre of Bay Area thinkers and futurists, among them Esther Dyson, the author; Douglas G. Carlston, the co-founder of Broderbund software; Kevin Kelly, founding editor of Wired, and Stewart Brand, creator of The Whole Earth catalog and the early online community the Well. Ever the phrase-coiner, Mr. Brand calls the clock "a patience machine" and "a steam engine for the information age."
Along with his cohorts, Mr. Brand started The Long Now Foundation ("long now" is a reference to deep time coined by the British musician Brian Eno) to raise money for the project, which is to include a separate digital linguistic archive with the Book of Genesis in a thousand languages. The long-term plan is to build an 80- to 90-foot version of the clock and ensconce it among the bristle-cone-pine forested limestone cliffs of White Pine County, Nev., literally the middle of nowhere. The foundation has already bought 186 acres adjoining Great Basin National Park. The idea is to do for thinking about time what photographs of Earth from space did for thinking about the environment, to "reframe human endeavor," Mr. Brand said, "not with a thesis but a thing."
It's quite a thing. Its fastest dial moves once a day; the slowest, once every 10,000 years and beyond.
As an artifact projected to be accurate to within one day every 20,000 years, the clock may be seen as a grandiose atonement for the sins of Internet time, or perhaps the ultimate boy-toy. The prototype, now sitting at the foundation's headquarters in The Presidio, an old general store building with creaking stairs and lumpy plaster, breaks new technical ground.
Its most riveting feature may be the "Equation of Time" cam, which looks like a sculptured torso but is actually a mathematical calculation rendered in three-dimensional form. It measures the 26,000-year precession of the equinoxes, accounting precisely, Mr. Hillis said, for elliptical eccentricities in the Earth's orbit.
The most heavenly looking element is the face, a rotating black sphere that charts the paths of the stars, one of the oldest forms of telling time. A measuring device called a rete traces the stars' positions over millennia. (For instance, 13,000 years from now, Vega will be where Polaris is -- in the center of the clock's star field.)
In designing his antidote to civilization's "pathologically short attention span," as the Long Now literature puts it, Mr. Hillis (who once made a computer out of Tinkertoys) has tried to learn from the mistakes of previous long-range messages like the Phaistos disk unearthed in Crete in 1908, which features 241 symbols in an ancient form of Greek that predates Homer. Instead, he looked to Big Ben, the work of an inspired amateur named C.B. Denison, and places like New College, Oxford, where a 19th-century reconstruction of the main hall used 14th-century oak trees planted in anticipation of a day hundreds of years in the future when the beams might need replacing.
THE most controversial philosophical conceit of the clock may be that it was deliberately designed to require human winding, an idea meant to foster the idea of responsibility. How it would be wound and by whom has yet to be determined. Maybe a ritual, like Stairmasters, offered Mr. Brand.
To Dr. Gregory Benford, a professor of physics at the University of California at Irvine and author of "Deep Time: How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia" (Avon, 1999), the clock is noble but flawed. "It's too pretty," he said. "The first biker gang to come along is going to trash this thing. If they made it rugged and ugly, it might last."
At the foundation's offices in the Presidio, a 22-pound tungsten pendulum bob lay on a table -- the ultimate geek paperweight. Donors of $50,000 or more can get one of their very own with an unusual set of instructions: Care and maintenance of your pendulum bob mostly involves preventing people from dropping it on their toes. With proper care, it should outlast your civilization.
In a profound sense, the clock, a jewel-like gesture toward the infinite, reflects deep anxiety about time in an increasingly whirlwindish culture. "It's about the coming of age of the kids who were going to save the world," Dr. Benford observed. "And like all deep-time monoliths, it's a mirror."

HEADLINE: Saving the Snake River Salmon

 BODY:
The Clinton administration has been willing to challenge 70 years of accepted public policy that hydroelectric dams are by definition a good thing. Led by Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, it has pressed the contrarian notion that dams that are doing more harm than good -- to fish stocks, to watersheds and to the environment generally -- ought to come down. Several dams have in fact been destroyed in the last few years. But these dams have been relatively small, and the administration now faces a huge test of its resolve -- whether to order the breaching of four large hydroelectric dams on the lower Snake River in eastern Washington State. The purpose would be to restore 140 miles of the river to its natural free-flowing state and greatly increase the chances for survival of the river's depleted salmon populations.
These dams provide many benefits -- power, irrigation and shipping -- and most regional politicians seem flabbergasted that anyone would even think of breaching them. But if the administration follows the path that most scientists have drawn for it, and does an unprejudiced calculation of costs and benefits, it will ask Congress to breach these dams. In doing so, it will have partly atoned for a colossal ecological mistake and added greatly to President Clinton's environmental legacy. 
 The fate of the dams lies with two federal agencies that are expected to issue reports in the next two months -- the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Army Corps of Engineers. Both are under orders from a federal judge, Malcolm Marsh, to devise recovery plans for the salmon under the Endangered Species Act.
Dam-breaching is on the table because other efforts to save the salmon have failed. The four Snake River dams came on line between 1962 and 1975. In the last 25 years, in a futile effort to assist fish migration, the federal government has spent more than $3 billion on programs that include fish ladders, hatcheries and even a complicated truck-and-barging system to get the young fish downstream. Even so, salmon stocks, which averaged more than 100,000 adults in the 1960's, have fallen to little more than 3,000.
Although some federal biologists argue that the barging programs should be given more time, most scientists believe that breaching the dams would be the most effective step toward restoring the wild salmon runs. One team of federal, state and university scientists gave the spring-summer chinook runs an 80 percent chance of recovery if the dams were removed. No scientist can or will guarantee complete success. But what seems clear is that the salmon cannot be saved without breaching.
With the science tilting against them, opponents have relied on economic arguments. For example, Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, warns that breaching would be "an unmitigated disaster and an economic nightmare for the region." But it will not. The $1 billion or so needed to decommission the dams could be rapidly amortized by saving the $200 million a year now spent running the dams and barging the salmon around them. Indeed, that annual outlay could rise dramatically if the dams are not breached, since the corps would have to take other measures, all of them costly, to satisfy Judge Marsh.
Losing the salmon could exact other costs as well. Near the end of the 19th century, the United States signed treaties with various Northwestern Indian tribes guaranteeing fishing privileges for all time in "usual and accustomed places." The Indians have been wonderfully patient in not enforcing these rights over the years. But if they did, and there were no salmon to be found, the legal obligation, according to federal experts, could run into the billions of dollars.
Some people would suffer real if momentary pain. The dams supply about 4 percent of the region's power, and monthly utility bills could rise between $1 and $4 a month if breaching occurs. Even so, northwestern consumers would still pay among the lowest utility rates in the country. Barge transportation, used mainly to move wheat downstream, would be eliminated above the dam sites. But with modest public investments, the railway that served the farmers successfully until the dams were completed 25 years ago could be revived.
The heaviest price would probably be paid by 13 farms covering 37,000 acres in western Washington, which would lose irrigation water now pumped from a reservoir behind one of the four dams. Here again, modest investments in new wells or pipes to pump water from a lowered Snake River would soften the blow and keep all but the most marginal farmers on their feet. The costs that Senator Gorton regards as unbearable are in fact manageable if the government is willing to step in with targeted grants and loans, much as it did 10 years ago when the decision to save the spotted owl sharply reduced timber harvests.
Is such a program worth it in this case? Oregon's governor, John Kitzhaber, one of the few regional politicians to support breaching, said it well: "If our salmon runs are not healthy, then our watersheds are not healthy. A highly degraded ecosystem -- which is where we are headed today -- represents a decision to mortgage the legacy with which we have been blessed for our own short-term benefit. I believe we are better than that."

HEADLINE: Donald Townsend, Who Founded Tad's Home of the Low-Priced T-Bone, Dies at 91

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Donald Townsend, who founded the Tad's Steakhouse chain in 1957 on the theory that a T-bone, baked potato, garlic bread and a tossed salad could be profitably sold for $1.09, died March 25 in a Reno hospital. He was 91.
Little matter that the meat might be cardboard thin, with clumps of fat and sinew. For a tenth the price of a fancy steak dinner, a working man could watch his hunk of steer searing under leaping, hissing flames in Tad's front window -- "a steak show" in Mr. Townsend's memorable phrase. He could then savor it beneath red velvet wallpaper and fake Tiffany lamps, dousing it with as much steak sauce as seemed prudent. At Tad's peak, the chain had 28 restaurants, eight in New York. 
 The concept had legs. Adjusted for inflation, the $1.09 price in 1957 would be $6.50 now, just 49 cents below today's price. The Riese Organization, which bought Tad's in 1988, will open a new Tad's in the new Times Square, its fifth in New York. If all goes well, Riese hopes to expand nationally once again.
The appeal of Mr. Townsend's idea was evident at lunchtime the other day at the Tad's on 42nd Street between Broadway and the Avenue of the Americas. One man said he rode the subway at least once a week from his home in the Bronx to eat in the restaurant. A family from St. Louis said they had dropped in because they like the Tad's in their hometown, one of the few still open outside of New York. Kathryn Calise, who works in a nearby office, said: "The food is good. The price is good. It's comfortable."
Mr. Townsend's office was once directly over this restaurant. He had two secretaries, one to handle business and the other to schedule polo and the other elements of his brisk social life.
Mr. Townsend was born in North Dakota in 1908. His father, a rancher, died when he was 7. As the oldest of five children, he went to work training trick ponies and helping haul coal. In his teens, he went to Washington State, where he worked as a logger until an injury to his little finger ended his logging career.
He scrambled from job to job, selling diet pills in Australia and opening some of Northern California's first drive-in restaurants, among other things. For a brief time in his 20's he worked for Borden's. One day, his boss, irritated at his off-the-job business activities, demanded, "Are you working for Borden's, or are you working for Don Townsend?"
"I guess I'm working for Don Townsend," came the reply. He never worked for anybody else again.
In 1957, Mr. Townsend joined with his brother Neal and a friend, Alan Tadeus Kay, to open the first Tad's, its name taken from Mr. Kay's middle name. Mr. Kay died soon afterward.
Mr. Townsend told the writer Sandra Hochman, who was his companion for many years, that Tad's was based on several foundations besides the "steak show." One was marinating the meat in papaya juice to tenderize inferior cuts of meat. Another was inventing tiles that looked like charcoal over which to cook the meat; it was cleaner than charcoal and allowed more even levels of heat.
Tad's hired no advertising or public relations consultants, relying instead on word-of-mouth recommendations. There were no waiters, further cutting costs. Customers carried their own trays.
Fortune magazine called Mr. Townsend "the grandfather of the fast foods business," and Ray Kroc, who built McDonald's into a powerhouse, conferred with Mr. Townsend. One piece of advice Mr. Kroc got: "You make more money selling to the Indians and not to the chiefs."
Mr. Townsend and his brother later became involved in more business ventures, including selling blue-green algae as a nutritional supplement and marketing geothermal energy. In the late 1940's, he developed an entire town, Cameo Acres, near San Francisco. He liked to say that the centerpiece of his business strategy was, "Get the money up front."
Mr. Townsend lived in New York for 35 years; he moved to Reno to be nearer his family after selling Tad's. With his immaculate dress, shock of white hair and twinkling blue eyes, he was active in fund-raising for the arts and politics. His own dining preferences tended more toward Le Cirque than Tad's.
His sense of humor could be wicked. He once had a denim jacket made with a heart on the back, his phone number smack in the middle. Ms. Hochman, who lived with the millionaire at the time, remembered being less than charmed.
Mr. Townsend's first wife, Lois, died many years ago; their sons, Lance, of Hawaii, and Gordon, of Northern California, and their daughter, Donna Searby of Reno, survive him. His second wife, Leila Townsend, from whom he was divorced, returned to be with him in his final years, although they did not remarry.
At the 42nd Street Tad's, the man who regularly visits from the Bronx expressed pleasure that Tad's had survived the automats and other New York City institutions like Orange Juliuses, which once seemed to stand on every other corner. He saw no reason to give his name, but said he was 59 and worked as a supervisor for the Transit Authority.
"This reminds me of when I was a youngster," he said. "Tad's Steakhouse is a monument."

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Belichick Shows His Relaxed Side

BYLINE: By MIKE FREEMAN 

 BODY:
Bill Belichick is having a glass of orange juice in a ballroom at a luxury Florida hotel, his sips being interrupted by glances at the sandy beach 30 feet away. The green and blue water seems to be having a calming effect on one of the most intense head coaches in professional football.
These days Belichick is smiling a lot, and is friendly, even talkative, at times. These are not images usually associated with one of the best defensive minds in the game. The usual is seeing Belichick looking disheveled and sounding grumpy. 
 That is certainly the way he looked during what was the most chaotic time of his professional life. Remember? Bill Parcells named Belichick the head coach of the Jets then, fearing a new owner might not be supportive, Belichick abruptly resigned, eventually joining the New England Patriots. It was an awkward, embarrassing time for both Belichick and the Jets.
The Jets were chastised by the news media and fans for not knowing what was going on inside Belichick's head. And Belichick was portrayed as a confused goofball who showed a lack of respect to Parcells. There were National Football League and team officials who, after watching Belichick's bizarre news conference in which he resigned from the Jets job, were questioning if Belichick had some sort of breakdown.
Now, all is well again with the world. Belichick is trying to rebuild the Patriots, and the Jets have Al Groh as their head coach. Groh, in fact, said hello to Belichick at the owners' meetings last week in Palm Beach. And believe it or not, Parcells and the New England Patriots owner, Robert K. Kraft, once bitter enemies, even recently had a brief but friendly chat.
That does not mean all the wounds are healed from Belichick's excellent adventure, in which he went from defensive coordinator to head coach to unemployed to head coach again within a span of days. In Palm Beach, when Belichick was asked about things that did not involve the Jets, he was talkative. But whenever the subject of the Jets came up Belichick clammed up. Trying to get his thoughts on the subject was harder than beating one of his vaunted defensive schemes.
Did he have any doubts during that chaotic period that his decision to step down was the right one?
"No," he said.
Does he ever think about the Jets?
"I've moved on," he said.
One of the few times Belichick smiled while discussing his former team was after being asked about the trade talks involving wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. Belichick said that while he was with the Jets, he was aware that the organization felt Johnson's contract situation would be a problem.
Then Belichick quipped, "I don't think we'll be dealing for him."
Belichick has a tough job ahead of him. The Patriots are a team in need of a personality. There are times New England plays on a championship level, and there are times when it struggles. The team lacks consistency.
The Patriots are happy to have Belichick on their side because for many years, when Belichick was in New York, he devised plans that completely frustrated New England, especially quarterback Drew Bledsoe. As Belichick has met with Patriots players, all of them have expressed their glee about having Belichick's brainpower supporting them instead of trying to shut them down.
"The organization showed a lot of trust in me in bringing me to the Patriots," Belichick said. "For that I am grateful."
 
Giants Seek Explosiveness
Several team executives said the Giants have been approached by a number of teams about their 11th pick in the April draft. Ernie Accorsi, New York's general manager, denied that. In fact only one team has contacted the Giants, the Baltimore Ravens, who were considering swapping their fifth pick with the Giants in exchange for the Giants' 11th selection plus additional picks. The Ravens later changed their mind.
Meanwhile, are the Giants slowly changing the way they evaluate college draft prospects? Often the Giants have drafted players with size and power, and not necessarily athleticism. The recent leaguewide trend has been to draft smaller, faster players who are also great athletes.
One Giants team official said Coach Jim Fassel had been preaching more and more to draft speedy, athletic players, forgoing size if necessary. Fassel, the official said, has urged the team to change the way the Giants look at players, and go for speed. "We need explosion," Fassel said.
It should be noted that Fassel and Accorsi are working well together, unlike management's relationship with former Coach Dan Reeves, who alienated just about everyone in the personnel department. Fassel uses reason and logic to get his point across, while Reeves often tried to bully the organization into doing things his way by complaining publicly to the news media.
"I get my point across in different ways," Fassel said.
Meanwhile, a number of team executives said Accorsi was doing one of the best jobs in the league at managing the salary cap while simultaneously acquiring talent. The Giants lost six free agents, but have picked up some good players in return, and done so without destroying their salary cap situation.
 
Broncos Want Character
One of the most discussed topics at last week's owners meetings was off-field violence. Some teams have vowed to be more selective in drafting players, staying away from those with troubled pasts.
Denver Coach Mike Shanahan said last week that the Broncos had already removed 10 players from the draft board because of what he called "various problems." The issues ranged from having serious conflicts with the coaching staff to drug abuse to violent behavior off the field.
And the Broncos owner Pat Bowlen told the owners last week to put as much emphasis on character as teams do on talent.
 
League Worried by Salaries
Several owners say that the N.F.L. is concerned about the ever-increasing player salaries, particularly with the signing bonuses. The league has even gone so far as to lecture teams sternly to watch their spending habits. . . . The Jets are still willing to listen to trade offers for Keyshawn Johnson despite the proclamation he is off the trading block. Look for trade discussions to heat up again in the days leading up to the draft. . . . More on the draft: The Cleveland Browns, at least for now, are not going to budge from that No. 1 overall spot, and will probably select either the Penn State pass rusher Courtney Brown or his teammate, linebacker Lavar Arrington. Meanwhile the hottest draft rumor -- and this time of year there is always lots of draft gossip -- has Denver trying to trade up to the fourth spot to pick Florida State wide receiver Peter Warrick. . . . Minnesota Coach Dennis Green is interested in quarterback Bubby Brister, who was cut by the Broncos. The interest, however, may be intended to put pressure on Jeff George, who is hesitating to sign a one-year deal with the Vikings.

HEADLINE: A New Player Enters the Campaign Spending Fray

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 1

 BODY:
George Gorton is hardly a political novice.
For 30 years, since he was a college student supporting James L. Buckley's campaign for the United States Senate from New York, he has worked for candidates from Richard M. Nixon to Pete Wilson to Boris N. Yeltsin. But even he had not thought much about Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code -- at least not until last year. 
 "I was walking around complaining to everybody that I could find about the amount of money that organized labor was spending on issue advocacy," said Mr. Gorton, who cut his teeth as national college coordinator for Nixon's Committee for the Re-election of the President in 1972. "And somebody said to me, 'George, that's their First Amendment right.' And I decided labor wasn't wrong to do it; they were right to do it, and so I decided pro-business people should do it, too."
So Mr. Gorton, who runs a Republican consulting business based in San Diego, started Shape the Debate, a nonprofit political organization that, under Section 527, can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money, with no disclosure requirements for donors, as long as it does not expressly advocate the election or defeat of any candidate. Its inaugural television advertisement, which began airing this week in California and New York, accuses Vice President Al Gore of political hypocrisy, in a mock game show in which contestants answer questions on various topics, including Mr. Gore's support for campaign finance overhaul despite his appearance at an illegal fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple.
"Shape the Debate strongly believes that free enterprise and conservative ideas are more likely to become public policy when candidates and public officials honestly and publicly discuss their positions on them," according to the group's credo, which can be found on its Web site, shapethedebate.com. "Shape the Debate will therefore use stinging ads of rebuke, where appropriate, or gentle praise to remind leading candidates and public officials to honestly discuss our issues, as a means to keep conservative and free enterprise issues uppermost in the minds of the American public."
The group is among the latest entrants in a growing field of independent campaign expenditure efforts, spurred on by recent court rulings interpreting the tax law. The group's literature emphasizes that contributions are not a matter of public record, and Mr. Gorton said that was an appealing point for donors, most of them Republicans and many of them Californians who supported Mr. Wilson's past campaigns for governor and senator. So far the group has raised about $1.5 million, in chunks of multiple thousands of dollars; Mr. Gorton hopes to raise another $2 million to $3 million for advertising campaigns this year.
"In the atmosphere that's been created by the Clinton-Gore administration, where the secret F.B.I. files of Republican appointees turned up in White House hands, you have to wonder about retribution," he said. "The heart of the First Amendment is that you can criticize your government without fear of retribution."
Mr. Wilson, who was forced out of office by term limits last year, has helped raise money for the group. As governor, he tangled repeatedly with public employee unions that undertook campaigns opposing his policies, and former Wilson aides say they see the latest effort as a way of evening the score a bit.
"Television is what really does shape the debate," said Mr. Wilson, who since last fall has been working for Pacific Capital, an investment banking concern in Beverly Hills. "The candidates certainly have that obligation, and sometimes they fulfill it and sometimes they don't. But the fact is, there are very definite limits on what they can reasonably expect to raise through their own efforts. Arguably, Bob Dole in 1996 was dead before he ever got to the convention in San Diego, because of the tremendous pummeling he took in the interim in independent expenditures directed against him."
Mr. Wilson added, "I think what you've got now is a situation in which most of the spending on television on both sides is going to be financed by independent groups and not the candidates themselves."
State and national Democratic officials swiftly denounced Shape the Debate's efforts as "underground financing" waged by "George W. Bush's ally," in the words of a Democratic National Committee news release. In fact, Mr. Wilson's former aides say, he has never had particularly warm relations with Mr. Bush and has regarded him warily for years as a rival. When Mr. Wilson decided last year not to purse his own presidential campaign, and Mr. Bush telephoned to wish him well, at least one senior Wilson aide urged him not even to return the call.
Mr. Wilson, who battled a severe recession in his first term before presiding over a sharp recovery, nevertheless remains controversial in California, where his strong stands against affirmative action and illegal immigration provoked a backlash. Mr. Bush has not generally tapped the old network of Wilson advisers in his campaign here, and Mr. Gorton said he did not believe the two men had talked in months.
"I think Peewee's trying to find a way that George Bush will give him a call," said former State Senator Art Torres, the chairman of the California Democratic Party, using his party's derisive nickname for Mr. Wilson. "The problem is, he's now created even more of a fire wall, because of the sensitivity he's created with this ad. They have no sense of subtlety and they never did."
But Mr. Wilson said: "I have gotten into this because I think George W. Bush should be president. I also think that had he faltered, John McCain should have been president. And I don't think the vice president should be. It's as simple as that."

HEADLINE: Congress and Regulators Start Efforts to Crack Down on Deceptive Lending Practices

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
After several years of inaction, pressure is building in Washington to impose tighter rules on banks and finance companies that specialize in lending money to homeowners with blemished credit records.
Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the House Banking Committee, said last week that his committee would be pressing for more vigorous enforcement of a law adopted in 1994 to combat deceptive lending practices, and may do more. 
 "The question is, do we need stronger legislation, more aggressive regulatory oversight or both?" Mr. Leach said in an interview. "I am increasingly thinking we need both."
The consumer finance industry, which is regulated by the states, has been sharply criticized in recent years for the actions of aggressive lenders who mislead borrowers into taking out home equity loans with excessively high fees and interest rates. Some borrowers have lost their homes and others are struggling to meet escalating payments.
In 1994, Congress enacted a law intended to curb those practices, but more than two years ago, the Federal Reserve Board and the Department of Housing and Urban Development warned that the law had failed to stem a tide of deceptive lending.
"Abusive practices continue to exist" and would continue unless Congress drafted "substantive protections" of consumers, the report said.
Little action resulted, even as the industry continued to expand with billions of dollars raised by leading Wall Street investment banks. Neither the Fed nor HUD followed up with a formal legislative proposal, Congressional aides said. And the Republican leadership in Congress, which believed the 1994 law gave regulators broad authority to attack the problem, was distracted by presidential impeachment, a global financial crisis and a prolonged fight over Depression-era laws governing banks and brokerage houses.
That all may be about be change.
Even before Mr. Leach's blunt call for stronger steps by regulators, all four federal banking regulators -- including Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve -- had spoken out against deceptive lending practices, and some are beginning to develop new regulations.
In addition, a large and influential corporate player in the nation's mortgage markets, Fannie Mae, has decided to put its considerable influence to work to establish enforceable industry standards.
And with state lawmakers taking matters into their own hands -- North Carolina has already adopted the toughest law in the country and other states are considering action -- some segments of the industry are becoming more willing to consider a federal law that could head off 50 state laws restricting their business.
Complaints about unfair and deceptive loan practices have intensified since 1994, when Wall Street began to pump substantial amounts of money into the industry through the sale of securities backed by home equity loans to so-called subprime borrowers, those with less than perfect credit ratings.
One company that specialized in subprime loans, First Alliance Corporation, a nationwide home equity lender based in Irvine, Calif., recently stopped making new loans and filed for bankruptcy protection. The mortgage company was facing a number of lawsuits accusing it of deceptive sales practices.
The industry insists that deceptive practices are rare and that subprime lenders make credit more available for people who once had few options beyond the local pawnshop.
But consumer advocates and regulators -- and lately, a few mortgage industry leaders -- say even some of the largest subprime lenders engage in predatory practices.
"I think the problem is getting worse because it's getting more brazen," said Franklin D. Raines, the chief executive of Fannie Mae, a government-chartered corporation that finances most of America's home mortgages through the purchase of loans from original lenders.
"Too many legitimate lenders are being tempted to get into this because of its profits," Mr. Raines said. "And if this goes mainstream, we've really got a very serious problem."
Mr. Raines's company and another federally chartered loan financing corporation, Freddie Mac, are already taking steps to ensure that their own loan purchases do not encourage predatory practices.
But Mr. Raines, in a recent interview, said he also intended to lead an industrywide campaign -- fashioned after an earlier nationwide effort to discourage investment in South Africa -- that could deny abusive lenders access to Wall Street capital.
His approach is modeled after the Sullivan Principles, named after the Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, the Philadelphia civil rights leader who in 1977 developed a code of conduct for companies doing business in South Africa. His efforts have been cited for helping to end apartheid.
"It is very hard for Wall Street to know, from where it sits, which loans are predatory," Mr. Raines said. But once "Sullivan-like" principles are in place and adequately monitored, he said, Wall Street could refuse to finance any lender that did not subscribe to those principles.
Wall Street, where Fannie Mae is a formidable voice, is also sensitive to the views of Mr. Greenspan. And he, too, recently condemned predatory lending practices.
Although markets have "vastly expanded credit to virtually all income classes," Mr. Greenspan said in a speech on March 22, he was concerned about "abusive lending practices that target specific neighborhoods or vulnerable segments of the population."
The Fed has formed a multiagency study group to explore ways to address predatory lending, aides to Mr. Greenspan said.
Mr. Greenspan's remarks echoed warnings by John D. Hawke Jr., the comptroller of the currency; Donna Tanoue, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and Ellen Seidman, the chairman of the Office of Thrift Supervision.
On Tuesday, Ms. Seidman will call for public comments on the problem, the first step in developing new rules.
As for new legislation, Representative John J. LaFalce, a Democrat from Buffalo and the ranking minority member of Mr. Leach's committee, is preparing to submit an antipredatory lending bill. Mr. Leach did not openly support that effort, but his interest in the issue was encouraging, consumer advocates said.
The report the Fed and HUD made to Congress nearly two years ago provided a road map for legislation. Its recommendations included providing clearer and earlier disclosure of loan fees and loan amounts; prohibiting certain loan terms, like large balloon payments that force borrowers to refinance their mortgages; and establishing minimum standards for foreclosures, which are now governed by state law.
Like Mr. Leach, the report called for more active enforcement, but it also recommended tougher penalties for violating fair-lending laws, and called for steps to make it easier for consumers to sue deceptive lenders.
Enforcement of all federal fair-lending laws falls largely on the Federal Trade Commission, which has recently made lending cases a top priority, said David Medine, associate director of the commission's division of consumer protection.
The National Home Equity Mortgage Association, which represents subprime lenders, has spent at least $300,000 in the last three years on lobbying efforts in Washington, according to records assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Its allies include the Consumer Mortgage Coalition, representing many large mortgage lenders, which has spent more than $2.2 million on lobbying since 1997.
Both organizations -- and some consumer advocates -- adamantly oppose Fannie Mae's involvement in the subprime market. Mr. Raines says such opposition "only invigorates us," but industry opposition nevertheless could distract Congress from taking meaningful action.
Even here, though, there are signs of a thaw in the industry's views.
People in Congress who have recently tested industry sentiment say they found less uniform resistance in recent weeks. "They're divided -- there is some support for a federal law, and there are others who just aren't decided yet," one Congressional aide said.
Action would become far more likely, of course, if the mortgage industry determines that federal legislation is preferable to a proliferation of strong state laws addressing predatory lending.

HEADLINE: Immigrants Flock to Union Banner at a Forum

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Immigrant workers, a huge but often voiceless group, were given a chance to speak up yesterday, and speak they did: about abuses on the job, about mandatory 70-hour weeks, about not being allowed to take bathroom breaks, about making just $2 an hour.
These workers were given their soapbox at an unusual forum sponsored by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which is seeking to persuade millions of immigrant workers to join unions, though labor has long turned a cold shoulder to them. 
 The forum, at a union hall in Lower Manhattan, was the official kickoff of a nationwide effort by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to reach out to immigrant workers as labor leaders increasingly acknowledge their importance to the future of American unions.
"Immigrants are not only the history of the union movement, they are its future, its soul, its spirit," Linda Chavez-Thomson, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s secretary treasurer, told the 300 people at the forum. "We are on the side of working people everywhere, and that means we are on the side of immigrants."
The forum was part educational session, part revival meeting, part public relations vehicle, aimed at burnishing labor's image among immigrants. The forum was held at the headquarters of Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International Union, a local that represents 55,000 building service workers from 54 countries.
Many immigrants at the forum appeared happy to flock to the union banner. Herbert Jean-Baptiste, an immigrant from Haiti, complained that 90 percent of immigrants who work at nursing homes lack health insurance.
Syed Armughan, a limousine driver from Pakistan, said that many drivers had to work 70-hour weeks, received no health insurance or retirement benefits and earned less than $30,000 a year.
And Zonia Villanueva, a housekeeper from El Salvador, complained that many employment agencies charged exorbitant fees and that many homeowners cheated their maids out of wages.
"We are workers who contribute to the economy," Ms. Villanueva said. "People depend on us to clean their houses and care for their children. We have been in the country for many years and we pay taxes. We want to stand up for our rights. We want to live and work free from intimidation. We only want the respect that every worker deserves."
The forum reflected a sharp change in organized labor's approach toward immigrants. For decades, many unions and union members looked askance at newcomers, viewing them as interlopers stealing jobs and driving down wages.
But as the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has focused increasingly on unionizing workers on the lowest rungs, like waiters, janitors and hotel maids, union leaders have recognized that they have to improve labor's image among immigrants.
Explaining the reason for the forum, Ms. Chavez-Thompson said, "We want to bring a better understanding within the labor movement because there has been such strong opposition to immigrants."
Yesterday's forum came six weeks after the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations reversed its longstanding policy and called for granting legal status to all illegal aliens and repealing laws that bar employers from hiring illegal immigrants. In the mid-1980's, the labor movement, worried about high unemployment, backed legislation that made it illegal for employers to hire illegal immigrants.
"There's been an amazing sea change in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s attitude toward immigrants," said Kent Wong, director of the labor studies center at the University of California in Los Angeles, who attended yesterday's forum.
In many ways, the forum was a stacked house, filled with union leaders and pro-union immigrants who repeatedly talked about all that unions could do for immigrants. Not surprisingly, none of the immigrants invited to speak criticized the many union leaders who do a poor job fighting for workers or the many construction unions that long turned their backs on non-European immigrants.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. plans similar forums in Atlanta (April 29), Chicago (May 6) and Los Angeles (June 10). The purpose of these meetings, union officials said, is to listen to immigrants speak about their problems at work, while also spreading the word about how unions can help them.
Immigrant after immigrant talked yesterday about how, just when a unionization drive was gathering steam, their employers called in immigration authorities to crack down on illegal immigrants. That tactic, these workers said, often took the wind out of organizing drives.
John Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, spoke angrily of how immigration officials, acting on an employer's tip, arrested eight hotel maids who worked at a Holiday Inn in Minneapolis. The arrests came four days after the hotel's housekeepers voted to unionize, and all eight arrested were on the union's negotiating team.
Joshua Bernstein, a policy analyst at the National Immigration Law Center, said this fear of arrest and deportation "is bad for American workers because it adds a weapon to the arsenal businesses can use to undermine efforts to improve all of our working conditions."

HEADLINE: CHINA INDICATING CAUTION ON TAIWAN

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
Chinese leaders have told the United States that they plan to stick with a "wait and see" attitude toward Taiwan's new president and that they are open to resuming a dialogue with the estranged island, a senior administration official said today.
The Chinese assurances, if borne out, come at a crucial time for the administration, which is scrambling to put relations with China on an even keel and to persuade Congress to upgrade economic relations before President Clinton leaves office. 
 This week, President Jiang Zemin and other top Chinese leaders indicated to the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, that China's initial, restrained reaction to the election of Chen Shui-bian as Taiwan's president last month was part of a "considered policy," in the words of the American official.
President-elect Chen's party had previously called for independence from China, something Beijing has sworn it will wage war to prevent, and he only recently muted that stance.
The Chinese have decided, at least for the time being, to try to reach an accommodation with his new government, which is expected to be formed in May, the official said.
"They don't quite know what to make of the situation," he said, describing Mr. Berger's two-day talks with the Chinese. "But they are not inclined to act in a precipitous way and they want to find a way to reach an accommodation consistent with their principles."
Mr. Berger traveled to China, in part, because the administration is simultaneously seeking to smooth relations between mainland China and Taiwan even as it tries to assemble a Republican-dominated coalition of lawmakers willing to grant China permanent trading rights in the American market.
Congressional leaders said any flare-up in tension between China and Taiwan would almost certainly derail the administration's hopes of winning passage of the trade measure anytime soon. The administration, in turn, has warned that failure to pass the measure could seriously set back relations with China and diminish American influence there.
"There is an important national security argument for going forward with permanent normal trade relations which is if anything intensified by developments related to Taiwan," said the administration official. "It not only creates a degree of interdependence between China and the world community but also to the economic integration of China and Taiwan."
During the election in Taiwan four years ago, the Chinese lobbed missiles around the island in an attempt to intimidate voters. Chinese leaders also gave bellicose warnings to Taiwan shortly before the latest elections, apparently to persuade voters to back candidates considered more favorable to reunification than Mr. Chen.
Despite its earlier statements, and perhaps relieved by Mr. Chen's conciliatory comments after his election, China now seems inclined to remain open to dialogue, the administration official said. Though any resumption of talks would most likely take many months to get under way, the mere prospect may reduce the risk that rising tensions will block passage of normal trade relations, which President Clinton has called his top remaining foreign policy priority. A Congressional vote on the matter is expected in May, the same time Taiwan's new government takes power.
The administration has asked Congress to give up its annual review of China's trade status, granting it same trading rights -- called permanent normal trade relations -- that most other countries have. The step is required if United States companies are to benefit fully from a market-opening agreement the administration negotiated as part of China's continuing effort to join the World Trade Organization. Talks between China and the European Union over China's entry into the trade group broke down on Friday.
Supporters argue that the economic rationale for giving up the annual review is overwhelming. The agreement requires China to open its markets and overhaul its regulatory regime, making way for foreign competitors in every area from agriculture to the Internet. But, as President Clinton has noted, "it's a one-way deal" that does not require reciprocal trading concessions by the United States.
Mr. Clinton has argued that granting permanent normal trading relations is essential for national security. He said the step would support reformers, lock China's bureaucracy into a rules-based trading regime and contribute to stability in Asia.
The vote, however, has become freighted both with ideological concerns about China's Communist government and domestic political worries in an election year. While America's business community has begun a national lobbying campaign on behalf of the measure, labor unions have mounted a vigorous opposition intended to culminate in what unions are promising will be a huge mobilization of supporters in Washington and around the nation on April 12. Union leaders say that the use of child labor by China and its hostility to free labor unions allow it to compete unfairly with American workers and have worsened the loss of American industrial jobs.
Senate passage is considered likely. But if the measure slips through the House, President Clinton will have the Republicans to thank; early vote counts show that that two-thirds of his own party's members in the House will vote against permanent normal trade relations.
The administration and the Republican leadership in the House have begun to work to build a coalition across party lines in support of the measure. Dennis Hastert, the House majority leader, has acceded to administration pleas and agreed to set a date for the vote in late May, aides said, even though Republican leaders acknowledge that Mr. Clinton has not met what they had insisted was a prior condition: proof that he can produce enough Democrats to ensure passage.
Getting 218 votes may prove difficult. Although business pressure on Republicans has been intense, some members of the party argue that the administration should work actively for the overthrow of the Chinese government instead of extending it upgraded trading rights.
Republican aides say the party will struggle to produce 150 votes in favor of permanent normal trade relations, the number that supported annual renewal of China's trading rights last year. That means supporters will need about 70 Democrats to vote in favor. Democratic lawmakers who favor the measure say that is still possible, but acknowledge that most of their potential supporters are currently uncommitted.
President Clinton has started a major campaign aimed primarily at securing support from wavering Democrats. Mr. Clinton, aides said, is spending more time on China trade than any other single item on his agenda. He will make his sixth major address on the subject on Monday in California and has scheduled numerous evening talks with lawmakers in the White House residence this month.
The president has also assigned five cabinet secretaries to make China their top priority.
"This is an intensive, all-out effort, member by member, district by district, explaining what this agreement is really about and what's at stake in terms of relations with China," said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative. Ms. Barshefsky negotiated the sweeping trade agreement with China and is spending most of her time these days lobbying for it. "What we're saying is that this decision is about the best way to influence China, not just on economics but all the surrounding issues as well," she said.
Some people in Congress have said that their vote will be influenced by how Beijing handles Taiwan's transition now that Mr. Chen, of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, has won election, ending the Nationalist Party's half-century dominance of the island's politics.

As Life for Family Farmers Worsens, the Toughest Wither

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TRYON, Neb.

 BODY:
Walking across the prairie, stepping carefully around cow pies, Mike Abel confesses that he has told his son and daughter not to follow in his line of work.
He sounds for a moment like a repentant bank robber. But Mr. Abel, 45, is in an even less promising field: He is a cattle rancher. 
 Ranchers like Mr. Abel on the lovely desolation of the Nebraska prairie near this hamlet, miles and miles from nowhere and nothing, evoke the gritty determination and toughness of John Wayne on a good day. These days the ranchers evoke something else -- poverty.
This rural area, McPherson County, is by far the poorest county in the country, measured by per capita income. Federal statistics show that people in McPherson County earned an average of $3,961 in 1997, the most recent year for which statistics were available, compared with $5,666 for the next poorest county, Keya Paha, also in Nebraska. The richest, New York County, better known as Manhattan, had a per capita income of $68,686 in 1997.
Cowboys like Mr. Abel might seem the last people to cry. But with much of the agricultural economy in deep distress, with dreams of family farms fading like old cow bones on the prairie, even the cowboys' lips are sometimes trembling.
"What always hurt us was when we're at the table trying to figure out how to make a land payment, and the kids are seeing us crying as we wonder what happens if we can't make the payment," said Mr. Abel, a sturdy man with flecks of gray in close-cropped hair. "We'd always hoped this would be a family operation. But why should my son, Tyler, struggle and make money only two out of five years when he could get a good-paying job in the city somewhere?"
While most of the American economy is going gangbusters, many rural areas are undergoing a wrenching restructuring that is impoverishing small ranchers and farmers, forcing them to sell out, depopulating large chunks of rural America and changing the way Americans get their food. The gains in farming and ranching efficiency are staggering, but so is the blow to the rural way of life.
Just a few years ago, the United States thought it had a plan to revitalize the agriculture economy: the Freedom to Farm Act.
Passed by the Republican Congress and signed by President Clinton in 1996, the law aimed to phase out subsidies but ease regulations and promote exports to make farming profitable without government aid.
Almost everyone agrees that the law has not worked (although there is also a consensus that it is the other guy's fault). Direct federal payments to farmers last year rose to a record $23 billion. That is far more than the federal government spent on elementary and secondary education, school lunches and Head Start programs combined.
With the failure of American farm policy, no one has much of a plan anymore, even though the present course appears unsustainable. The growing cost of federal farm programs, the replacement of small family farms with huge factory farms, the fading of rural hamlets -- all these point to historic changes under way in American agriculture. Yet the changes are happening without anyone guiding them or the nation paying them much heed.
The poverty statistics can seem misleading to city dwellers, for the poor farming areas rarely have homeless people or anything like a slum, and in any case cattle and hog prices are rising this year. But prospects look dismal, adding to the pressure on many rural areas.
The depopulation is evident in the grade school in Ringgold, a crossroads village in the east end of McPherson County. Leah Christopher, an effervescent eighth grader who is an outstanding gymnast, will graduate from the school in a few months at the top of her class, and at the bottom. She is the only eighth grader.
The entire school, from kindergarten to the eighth grade, has only one teacher and seven students, four of them from Leah's family. Another grade school in the county has just four students and will drop to three next year.
"I took a training course once where the other teachers were talking about using the school psychologist and other resources like that," said Elnora Neal, the teacher at the Ringgold school. "Well, I'm everything. At this school, I'm teacher, nurse, psychologist, P.E. teacher and janitor."
McPherson County had 1,692 people in 1920, and since then its population has been steadily falling, to about 540 today. At its peak, it had 20 post offices, 5 towns and 63 school districts; now it has 1 post office, 5 schools and, if one is generous enough to include Ringgold, 2 towns. The average age in the county is in the late 50's, the average American farmer today is 54.
 
The Efficiency
Surge in Output Keeps Prices Down
Rusty Moore, a lanky, rail-thin fifth-generation rancher, complains bitterly about the difficulties as he sorts cattle on an icy, overcast day on his 13,000-acre ranch.
"I went to college for four years and decided to come back and live in poverty," Mr. Moore, 26, said laughing, as he stomped his feet against the cold.
But while there are many reasons for the misery in the agricultural economy, perhaps Mr. Moore's greatest adversary is himself -- and all the other farmers and ranchers like him who have figured out how to increase the output of their land. In Mr. Moore's grandfather's day, it took about 18 acres of this land to sustain a cow and her calf. Now, ranchers have improved efficiency so that they need just 7 acres for a cow and a calf.
This surge in output is the main force driving the restructuring of agriculture. In 1969, the average pig used for breeding produced 6.7 piglets per year. By last year, that had risen to 16 piglets per year, and the most efficient operators got 22.
Those kinds of productivity increases have resulted in a world awash with grain, pork, beef and milk, even though the proportion of the American public living on farms and ranches has tumbled to 1.5 percent today from 42 percent in 1900. Some experts believe that with biotechnology, the productivity increases are now beginning to accelerate.
For many years, the agricultural equivalent of the four-minute mile has been the yield of 400 bushels of corn per acre. The average is about 150 bushels, but last year an Iowa farmer, Francis R. Childs, achieved celebrity by producing 394 bushels under tight monitoring.
Just as Roger Bannister changed the world's understanding of human athletic potential when he ran a sub-four-minute mile in 1954, so Mr. Childs is waking up agricultural economists. If his techniques could be replicated and spread widely, that could mean a doubling of corn output.
"I don't see any reason why that can't be done," Mr. Childs said.
Yet he acknowledges that he is a bit worried about what could be done with all that corn. Historically, increases in productivity have brought falling prices that punish the farmers, while rewarding consumers.
"Consumers have a great life ahead of them," said Neil E. Harl, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. "We're entering a new era, especially in crops but also in livestock."
 
The Factory
Mass Producing Under Contract
You can smell the future of farming as you approach it on a narrow dirt road just west of McPherson County, in neighboring Arthur County.
A series of long, low warehouses contain what is less a hog farm than a pork factory. The factory is still being expanded, but ultimately it will cost $5 million and produce 120,000 pigs each year.
To anyone who thinks that hogs are dirty and humans are clean, a visit to this farm is an indignity. Before being allowed near the pigs, all employees and visitors must strip, shower, shampoo and change into new underwear, socks, boots and overalls that the farm provides. The aim is to protect the pigs from diseases brought in by nonhygienic humans.
The sows spend their days lying in tiny pens, eating, drinking and growing piglets inside of them. After giving birth, the sows suckle their piglets until being weaned at 17 days and then after a few days' respite they come in heat and the process begins again.
The sows are taken into a pen next to several boars, whose sole job is to sweet talk the sows and get them sexually excited.
At that point, a technician artificially inseminates the sows, as the boars watch from the next pen.
"It must be a frustrating existence for the boars," acknowledged Dwayne Fritzen, the manager of the operation.
The pregnant sows even get ultrasound examinations at 30 days and 60 days to make sure their pregnancies are going well.
"This is efficiency," Mr. Fritzen said. "I grew up on an old-fashioned hog farm, where you go out and buy hogs and you don't know the pedigree. Here, you know everything about these gals" -- gestured to the sows -- "and if you don't like the results, then you switch genetic companies" and get new sows or new semen.
Industrialized agriculture began to replace traditional family farms in poultry, and one study found that these days the average poultry farmer raises 240,000 birds a year and earns just $12,000 for his labor.
Many scholars say that increasingly, livestock and crops alike will be produced under contract to large food companies.
"The farmer in those contracts is somewhere between what you'd call a businessman and a laborer," said Chuck Hassebrook, program director for the Center for Rural Affairs, a Nebraska research center. "Management decisions are typically made by the company."
Mr. Hassebrook added: "More and more, the people on the land become simply laborers. The returns are siphoned out of their communities."
 
The Poverty
Being Squeezed By the System
With the welfare system hugely curtailed in the last few years, there is more scrutiny than ever of what critics see as a major welfare system for grain and cotton farmers. Moreover, though the evidence is mixed, some economists argue that the billions of dollars in federal payments are helping to drive out family farmers and ranchers.
"Congress talks about saving the family farm, but it pours the money disproportionately to larger farmers," said John A. Schnittker, who runs an agricultural economics consulting firm in California. "As you subsidize these large farms, they can pay more in buying land, and they can pay more in renting land. And so the system we have now really concentrates farming among the large operators."
Two situations loom, neither one encouraging: payments may continue to soar until they threaten the budget, or Congress may be forced to cut payments, leaving farmers in desperate shape.
"We're in a quandary," said Keith Collins, the chief economist for the United States Department of Agriculture. Mr. Collins said the department's projections were that this year's price for wheat would be the lowest since 1986, for cotton the lowest since 1974 and for soybeans the lowest since 1972.
While grain farmers are ever more dependent on the agricultural dole, ranchers -- who get left out of the payment system -- are often irritated by the payments.
"Just to subsidize people because the price is low -- that kills ingenuity," said Doug Schmidt, 45, struggling to make a go of cattle ranching on a small spread, near Ringgold.
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman says that farm policy has to be revamped and broadened to do more than make payments to distressed farmers. He says that it should also help them add value to their products, make it easier for them to insure against risks and work on mechanisms to help people run businesses in rural communities.
"As much as we'd like to use farm programs as the panacea for problems out there affecting rural America, they cannot be," Mr. Glickman said. He added, "We've also got to make rural America economically thriving, so that people will have a reason to stay on family-sized farms even if they can't get all their income" from farming.
The larger question is why the government should work so energetically and expensively to preserve the family farm. Family-owned restaurants, bookstores and newspapers were all widely regarded as beneficial to their communities, yet in each case America allowed many of them to fade and be replaced by more ferocious and efficient economic competitors. Only in the case of family farms, presumably because they are so rooted in American mythology and in Jefferson's ideal of the yeoman farmer-citizen, are Americans willing to spend $23 billion a year fighting economic change.
 
The Future
Corporate Flags Over Giant Spreads
As dawn comes in McPherson County, a glorious orange sun rises from the prairies and casts a glow on LaVerne Neal, a 73-year-old rancher feeding his cattle.
Mr. Neal has 240 cows and 3,840 acres, and he had always assumed that his family would ranch here forever. But he now realizes that his land is really too small for future generations to make a living, and he sees his problem as emblematic of a larger pattern of the decline of the family farm.
"I don't think there are going to be family farms for too many more years," Mr. Neal said wistfully, driving his pickup over the fields. "Those big outfits are taking over."
That is one of the most common laments in agriculture. The underlying problem for small farms and ranches is diminishing margins and a tiny return on capital. Many farmers and ranches have million-dollar investments that are losing them money, and so the country's poorest county probably has a high proportion of millionaires.
Yet paradoxically, for all the fears of corporations sneaking into agriculture, dismal returns are the best protection family farms have. If McDonald's announced that it were going to produce its own beef, wheat, lettuce and tomatoes, its shareholders would sell in panic, because the return on the investment would be dreadful.
"Why would they want the aggravation?" asked Ed Sowder, a county commissioner. "If you've got ranchers out there who think they're working for themselves, why bother?"
Only about 2 percent of farms are run by corporations. But corporate oligopolies dominate both the input side (selling seed and equipment) and output side (four companies now control 80 percent of the beef market).
The consolidation of farms under way today seems to be a continuation of a trend that goes back 100 years. The average American farm has gone from 139 acres in 1910 to 435 acres today, and the driving force behind this change is simple: economics and a yearning for a better life. For all the rosy glow that is conjured by the phrase "family farm," it was often a harsh life.
"When I was a boy, for my birthday all I'd get was a pair of socks," Mr. Neal recalled. "Come to think of it, that's all I used to give my children, as well. But these days, you walk into a kid's room, and you have to kick aside half a dozen teddy bears just to step inside."
As the pain in the farm sector drags on endlessly, farmers like the Abels decide that if they are to keep their children in teddy bears, they may be better off in other lines of work.
"If you pass on your ranch to your son," Bob Long, a county commissioner and rancher, said, "then it's child abuse."

HEADLINE: Putin's Team Hammers Out a Plan to Untwist, Level and Streamline Russia's Economy

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 1

 BODY:
The victory of Vladimir V. Putin in the presidential election last Sunday has focused attention on an opulent Moscow building known as Aleksandr House, where a team of liberal-minded economists and other experts has been quietly drafting Mr. Putin's blueprint for Russia.
German O. Gref, head of the Center for Strategic Research and master of Aleksandr House, confidently predicted this week that by late May Mr. Putin will be ready to release "a breakthrough scenario envisaging the most radical reforms," from an overhaul of Russia's cumbersome tax code to a streamlining of its infamous bureaucracies. 
 With the exception of tax reform, the contents of the program are still vague and, on critical issues like land reform, still under debate. But the Aleksandr House team -- which includes some of Russia's best-known pro-market reformers -- has already firmly established itself as the beachhead of liberal economics in the coming Putin administration.
Now, as Mr. Putin prepares to assume his new mandate at inauguration ceremonies scheduled for early May, the question is how Mr. Gref and his ambitious plan will survive in the battle over access and influence in the Putin Kremlin, which is being watched as keenly in the United States as in Russia itself.
The stakes in the next round of Byzantine intrigue and infighting -- a regular feature of former President Boris N. Yeltsin's rule -- are unusually high.
"There is a struggle going on over the strategy for Russia," noted Boris Nemtsov, once one of the Kremlin's young reformers and now a leader of the Union of Right Forces, which has broadly backed Mr. Putin. "Either it will be crony capitalism with tycoons, corruption, underground deals and social polarization, or it will be a Western-style economy."
At a news conference this week, Mr. Gref made clear that he has Mr. Putin's ear, and his backing. He said that Mr. Putin, offered three scenarios for growth targets, picked the most ambitious one. "This means we will really have our work cut out for us," Mr. Gref said.
Perhaps most significant, Mr. Putin this week included Mr. Gref in a small inner cabinet that has been charged with overseeing the transition and, in Mr. Gref's words, with ensuring that government practice does not stray from the Aleksandr House team's policies. Other members of the working group include First Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, Minister of Finance Aleksei Kudrin and Aleksandr Voloshin, the Kremlin chief of staff, who is the most visible holdover from Mr. Yeltsin's inner circle.
Furthermore, Mr. Gref noted, the working group had been empowered to amend government legislation, now pending in Parliament, that contradicts the center's policies -- a veiled reference to bills on state registration of foreign trade transactions and capital flight that seemed to fly in the face of the center's deregulatory bent.
"Gref is building pressure on his rivals by assuring that the president and the future cabinet will need only the center's program," the daily newspaper Segodnya commented.
At his news conference this week, Mr. Gref said: "There is no alternative program. There may be different positions on different issues, and if they are well grounded, they will be presented to the president."
At age 35, Mr. Gref is the latest fresh face to become the standard bearer for Russian reform. He is a lawyer with a faint Van Dyke beard, a church-going Lutheran of German descent who, like his patron, Mr. Putin, has a background in St. Petersburg city government, where he once headed an experiment in housing reform.
Since last December, when the center was created by Mr. Putin, then the prime minister, Mr. Gref has been coordinating the collection of opinions on the full spectrum of Russia's unfinished agenda. His brief career spans reform of the military and bank restructuring, strengthening the courts and shrinking one of the world's largest and most corrupt bureaucracies.
In interviews and meetings and in an open letter to the voters written for Mr. Putin during the election campaign, Mr. Gref has elaborated on Mr. Putin's commitment to a strong and efficient government, property rights, openness and the rule of law -- all elements needed to turn Russia's twisted economy into a level playing field suitable for desperately needed investment.
The goal, Mr. Gref said this week, is to make the Russian economy "manageable and market-oriented." At this point, he said, it has "stagnated in a semireformed state.
"Our task," he said, "is to take it to normal market conditions."
But it is not surprising that his efforts have already run into resistance. Boris A. Berezovsky, the financier and media tycoon who boasts of his influence over the tiny group that held sway in the Yeltsin Kremlin, recently poured scorn on the Aleksandr House team, dismissing their efforts as "unprofessional" and their ideas as "naive."
Most experts see the battle shaping up in the Kremlin as a repeat of an old rivalry between Mr. Berezovsky and Anatoly B. Chubais, another Kremlin insider with the credentials of a reformer who now heads Russia's national electric utility company. Another group reportedly vying for influence is headed by Pyotr Aven, a former minister who is now president of Alfa-Bank.
But the real issue is whether Mr. Putin, who owes his popularity to his image as a tough, uncompromising former K.G.B. agent, will be able to prove his independence from all of these competing clans, and steer Russia on to a more predictable course.
An even greater challenge, many say, will be to override an entrenched bureaucracy that has long experience in defeating the best of plans. For this, they say Mr. Putin, when he moves, will have to strike fast and hard, or risk being overwhelmed by vested interests at all levels of government. Many foreign business leaders say the appointment of Mr. Gref or members of his teams to the new government would be a good start. "Gref is strongly committed to liberal economics," said Glenn Waller, director of the Petroleum Advisory Forum, a Moscow-based lobbying group representing foreign oil and gas companies. "If Gref or anyone associated with him were to take a senior position in the government, it would be a clear signal that Putin wants to pursue reform."
Besides Mr. Gref, the Aleksandr House team includes such reform economists as Yevgeny Yasin, considered the captain of the reform team; Aleksei Ulukayev, a deputy at the economics institute headed by Yegor T. Gaidar, Mr. Yeltsin's first, reform-oriented prime minister; Oleg Vyugin, a former deputy finance minister and an analyst at Troika Dialog, a Moscow investment firm; and Andrei Illarionov, a liberal economist who was a strong critic of Mr. Yeltsin's early reform governments and is now thought to be in line for a post as Mr. Putin's chief economic adviser.
A crucial ally of the Gref team is the finance minister, Mr. Kudrin, a longtime associate of Mr. Putin from St. Petersburg who helped bring the future president into the Yeltsin administration in 1996.
"There are a limited number of people in Russia who can advise the government on macroeconomic policy," said Vladimir Mau, another deputy at Mr. Gaidar's institute who is also advising the Aleksandr House team. "The same people keep coming back, in different proportions, but they are the same people."
During the last three months, Mr. Putin has conducted his own economic seminars, as he toured the country prior to the March 26 elections. Meeting with foreign investors on March 13, he impressed many of them with his advanced preparation, and his attention to detail, said Mr. Waller and other businessmen present at the meeting.
But so far, his commitment to economic reform has remained largely rhetorical, apparently in anticipation of the actual Gref program. He has frequently repeated the broad principles of free-market reforms, although during the campaign, he uttered occasional populist comments that veered toward blunt protectionism.
Of all the reforms now under discussion, only changes to Russia's awkward and antiquated tax code have already been drafted, in preparation for a debate in the Parliament later this spring. The new code, which would reduce tax rates, and shift from revenue-based levies to profit-based levies, must be adopted by July 1, if it is to be implemented next year.
Mr. Gref said he did not expect any political opposition to the changes in taxation, one of the few issues on the reformers' agenda that also has the support of Russia's Communist Party. He said opposition was likely in the Parliament on other elements of the program, but he added, with calm understatement, "I don't think there will be an atmosphere of sharp confrontation."

Mr. Putin will be inaugurated as president in early May, but there are doubts about whether Mr. Gref will survive the Kremlin infighting that lies ahead.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Sees Increase In Evasion of Taxes On Gifts to Heirs

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
To save on taxes, Americans routinely understate the value of what they give their heirs, particularly stock in family-owned businesses and real estate, new data from the Internal Revenue Service shows. But the agency has almost no resources to stop the problem, and a recently passed law has only increased the chances of not getting caught.
More than 80 percent of the 1,651 tax returns reporting gifts of $1 million or more that were audited last year understated the value of the gift, the I.R.S. found. The average understatement was about $303,000, on which about $167,000 in additional gift taxes was due. This alone cost the government about $275 million last year. 
 Understatement also appears to be flagrant among the quarter-million Americans who each year make smaller gifts, I.R.S. records show. On the 650 of these returns that were audited, the average additional gift tax the I.R.S. recommended was $97,000. The I.R.S. would not estimate the total cost to the government of understated gifts.
But it is clear that a far greater percentage of Americans who owe gift taxes shortchange the government than do Americans paying income taxes and other levies. What is more, the sums involved in each case are much larger.
Taxes on gifts and estates, while intended to make the system fairer, breed tremendous resentment, and many Americans think they should be eliminated or sharply reduced. Last year, Congress voted to repeal the gift and estate tax. President Clinton vetoed the measure.
But as long as they are the law, people are obligated to pay them, said the I.R.S. commissioner, Charles O. Rossotti. People who do not, and whom the I.R.S. fails to force to pay, end up with a much better deal than their neighbors who are playing by the rules.
"Our system depends on voluntary compliance," Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said. "Individuals cannot decide for themselves if the rules apply."
The I.R.S., its auditing and legal staff shrinking in recent years even as the number of complex tax returns grows, lacks the resources to find most of the Americans who understate the value of their gifts and estates or even fail to report any transfer of property, said John Dalrymple, director of I.R.S. operations. The I.R.S. has just 78 lawyers assigned to gift tax audits, each of whom is responsible for auditing more than 3,300 gift tax returns this year. And even when the agency does find abuses, it lacks the resources to fight more than a small number of the cases in court.
I.R.S. lawyers said they were frustrated by their inability to stop what they described as rampant cheating on gift taxes.
One such lawyer in Manhattan, the nation's wealthiest tax district, said his desk was piled high with gift tax returns that will get little scrutiny."There is all this added work and no staff," said the lawyer, who insisted he not be identified. "I know that there are millions and millions and millions of dollars being passed untaxed right over my desk and there is nothing I can do about it."
Of the more than 250,000 gifts of less than $600,000, only 1 in 400 is even audited, while among gifts of $600,000 to $1 million, fewer than 1 in 55 is audited. By contrast, the I.R.S. has been auditing 3 of every 4 gifts of more than $1 million, but says that this is inadequate and that it is hiring 3 more lawyers so it can audit 85 percent of returns reporting very large gifts.
The agency's task has only become more difficult. For one thing, the number of gifts of $1 million and up jumped 21 percent last year from 1996, and the I.R.S. expects additional increases of at least 5 percent annually.
Resources are further strained by a sharp rise in estate tax returns, which are expected to grow by a third in the next four years.
Each year, nearly three times as many gift tax returns are filed as estate tax returns, although the estate tax raises six times as much money. But the gift tax, more than the estate tax, has recently increased the I.R.S.'s workload, because of a law passed by Congress in 1997 to require speedy audits of gift tax returns.
The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 gives the agency three years to audit gift tax returns -- or accept them as filed. Under the old law, such returns could be audited and challenged years or decades later, typically when the donor had died and his estate tax return was filed. The new law, and the widespread knowledge that the I.R.S. can hardly audit all gift tax returns, has encouraged some taxpayers to aggressively undervalue assets on the assumption that the I.R.S. either will not notice or will fail to act before the three-year audit period ends.
Data compiled by the I.R.S. shows how the problem has grown. In 1996, 1,816 gift tax returns with values of $1 million or more were filed. Last year, there were 2,194 such returns. The average amount of additional taxes owed because gifts were undervalued was $167,000 last year, up 45 percent from $115,000 in 1996.
These numbers show "we have a compliance problem," said Tom Hull, national director of specialty taxes for the I.R.S.
The amounts were calculated using rules set by Congress and the courts to measure the value of assets. The rules are based on factors like the cash flow of a business or its history of dividends or, in the case of real estate, sales of comparable properties.
In cases of direct gifts of cash and publicly traded securities, there are few problems, Mr. Hull said. The understatements involve harder-to-value assets, mostly family-owned businesses and real estate.
Gift and estate taxes, which are taxes on transfers of property during life and after death, respectively, are the fastest-growing source of tax revenue for both the federal government and the states. This reflects the rise in the stock market and in real estate in the past decade, the aging of the World War II generation, which owns most of this wealth, and the decision by Congress not to adjust the gift and estate tax to take inflation and other factors into full account.
The I.R.S. collected $2.7 billion in gift taxes in 1997, a figure that is expected to grow to $3.6 billion this year.
The gift tax works this way. For each gift to another person of more than $10,000 in a year, a gift tax return must be filed indicating the amount of the gift. When the total of such gifts exceeds $675,000 during the giver's lifetime, the gift tax kicks in. It must be paid on additional gifts greater than $10,000 per person each year.
The gift tax rates are the same as those levied on estates when people die, but the law creates powerful incentives to give before one dies.
Consider an individual with $1 million to give who is in the top tax bracket, which is 55 percent. When a gift is made while the giver is still alive, the heir gets $645,000 and the gift tax is $355,000. But if he gives away the money after death, the heir gets $450,000 and the estate tax will take $550,000. Thus, making the gift during the giver's lifetime puts $195,000 extra, or 43 percent more, in the heir's pocket.
But many Americans resent the tax and easily find ways to lower the amount they pay. "In my experience as an estate planner, it is very hard to get people to make taxable gifts," said Professor Edward J. McCaffery of the University of Southern California Law School. "So when such gifts are made, we are by definition looking at extremely wealthy and extremely aggressive and dynastically inclined people, who are very sophisticated and who are going to shop around for a good appraiser and let him know they want to come in on the low side."
Professor McCaffery said, "There is a way of signaling to even the best of the appraisers whether you want a high value, which you want if you are selling your business or making a charitable gift, or if you want a low value because you are doing tax planning."
He said many wealthy business owners planning to make large gifts to their children "will first kind of muck up the business" by taking on debt or making other temporary changes to help an appraiser justify a figure much lower than the true value of the business.
Luther J. Avery, a San Francisco lawyer who often writes on flaws in the gift and estate tax system, said: "There is a tremendous competition among appraisers, and each is trying to buy business from someone else, so they are low-balling their appraisals. Of course a client will choose the lowest appraisal."
Mr. Rossotti, the I.R.S. commissioner, said a rapidly growing industry is luring many prosperous Americans into illegal tax avoidance schemes with promises of huge savings through methods like placing their homes in trusts or opening offshore investment accounts. These schemes are illegal if they lack a business purpose other than tax avoidance or if the income from offshore accounts is not fully reported. Americans are taxed on their worldwide income.
Shannon Pratt, widely regarded as the father of the business appraisal industry and the publisher of a newsletter read by many estate tax lawyers, said that in valuing businesses and real estate no one figure is correct. "There is a range of values" depending on how one interprets cash flow, competition and comparable sales of real estate, he said. He said reputable appraisal firms come up with a fair range of values, but there are also disreputable firms producing unjustifiably low appraisals.
The I.R.S. said its problems are with appraisals, and with discounts applied to those appraisals, that fall outside a reasonable range. Discounts may be applied for such factors as restrictions on the resale of stock in a family business or a minority interest in real estate.
But the I.R.S. does not have the staff to stop even many of the most outrageous cases.
Take the tax agency's Fresno, Calif., office, whose workload is typical of many I.R.S. offices. It received 11,000 gift tax returns last year, and has three lawyers to audit them, Joseph D'Amico, a recently retired I.R.S. supervising estate lawyer, told a legal seminar in January.
Over all, such lawyers will spend 31 minutes auditing each tax return reporting a very large gift this year. Such returns typically run dozens of pages, with appraisals, descriptions of trusts and legal opinions.
One major area of cheating cannot even be detected under the current auditing system, two I.R.S. lawyers said. When a gift tax return indicates that total lifetime gifts have not reached the $675,000 threshold where taxing begins, the return is not audited. But both lawyers said that when they examined such returns at random, they found many cases in which gifts declared at a sum like $10,000 were really worth many times that.

I.R.S. audits of gifts given to heirs show that the value of the gifts is routinely understated, costing the government many millions of dollars in lost tax revenue. But, because of a lack of lawyers to audit the returns on which gifts are reported, there is concern that a lot of the understatement goes undetected.

HEADLINE: Vast Trade in Forced Labor Portrayed in C.I.A. Report

BYLINE: By Joel Brinkley 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
As many as 50,000 women and children from Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe are brought to the United States under false pretenses each year and forced to work as prostitutes, abused laborers or servants, according to a Central Intelligence Agency report that is the government's first comprehensive assessment of the problem.
 
 The carefully annotated and exhaustively researched, 79-page agency report - "International Trafficking in Women to the United States: A Contemporary Manifestation of Slavery" - paints a broad picture of this hidden trade and of the difficulties that government agencies face in fighting it
 Completed in November, the report is based on more than 150 interviews with governnment officials, law-enforcement officers, victims and experts in the United States and abroad, as well as investigate documents and a review of international literature on the subject.
 Law-enforcement officials have seen episodic evidence for years of trafficking in immigrant women and children, some as young as 9 years old But the report says that officers generally do not like to take on these cases because they are difficult to investigate and prosecute. What is more, it says, the nation does not have sufficient laws aimed at this problem, meaning that the penalties often are insubstantial.
 Two years ago, Attorney General Janet Reno chartered an interagency task force, saying, "We are not interested in containing modern-day slavery; we want to eradicate it." The report mentions many efforts to fight the problem, but also many barriers to doing so
 Over the last two years, while up to 100,000 victims poured into the United States, where they were held in bondage, federal officials estimated that the government prosecuted cases involving no more than 250 victims. The Justice Department said it could not provide precise figures.
 The report was prepared by a government intelligence analyst who was working on assignment to the CIA While the report is not classified, it has not been made public. Another government official who wanted the report's findings publicized provided a copy
 It describes case after case of foreign women who answered advertisement for au pair, sales clerk, secretarial or waitress jobs in the United States but found, once they arrived, that the jobs did not exist. Instead they were taken prisoner, held under guard and forced into prostitution or peonage. Some of them were, in fact, sold outright to brothel owners, the report says.
 "Examples of this may include Latvian women threatened and forced to dance nude in Chicago," the report says. Thai women were brought to the United States "but then forced to be virtual sex slaves." Chinese-Korean women were "held as indentured servants." And "Mexican women and girls, some as young as 14," were promised jobs in house-keeping or child care but, upon arrival, "were told they must work as prostitutes in brothels serving migrant workers."
 Girls from Asian and African countries, some 9 years old, were essentially sold to traffickers by their parents, "for less than the price of a toaster," one government official said. This mainly happens in cultures where female children are not valued. The girls are smuggled into the United States where, in a typical case, they are forced to work "in an indentured sexual servitude arrangement," the report says.
 A Nigerian smuggling ring, the report says, citing an Immigration and Naturalization Service case, charged parents from that country $10,000 to $12,000 to bring their children to New York so they would have "better educational opportunities." But once here, the smugglers "forced the Nigerian children to work as domestics."
 Some of these cases received news coverage when they were discovered. But they are only a tiny fraction of the problem. The report says 700,000 to two million women and children worldwide are victimized by traffickers each year. Although the numbers who come to the United States are relatively small, the report says that the problem "is likely to increase in the United States."
 At a conference in Manila this week, delegates from 23 Asian countries called on governments to seize the profits of the crime syndicates involved. A Filipino group estimated those profits at up to $17 billion a year.
 The countries that are the primary sources for traffickers are Thailand, Vietnam, China, Mexico, Russia and the Czech Republic, the report says. Other countries that are increasingly providing victims include the Philippines, Korea, Malaysia, Latvia, Hungary, Poland, Brazil and Honduras, the report says.
 The I.N.S, one of several federal agencies with jurisdiction in this area, noted in an internal assessment last fall that agents had found 250 brothels in 26 cities that appeared to be holding trafficking victims. It was not always easy to tell, the C.I.A. report says, because the victims generally did not speak English and might have been even more afraid of law-enforcement officers than of their captors. After raiding one of these brothels, the immigrations officers generally move to deport the women because they are in the country illegally. Often the officials do not have enough information to prosecute their captors.
 Government officials said the problem is not new, but the scope seems to have increased in recent years. The biggest reason is that, since the mid-1990's, traffickers from Russia and the former republics of the Soviet Union have aggressively entered the business, taking advantage of women from those countries who are looking to the West for opportunities.
 "It's accelerated tremendously in the last 10 years," said Donna Hughes, director of the Women's Studies Program at the University of Rhode Island. She has monitored the issue for a decade. "An important reason is that there's increased migration of women now for purposes of work."
 A C.I.A. analyst derived the estimate of 50,000 victims per year from public and classified intelligence data, a government official said. No comparable estimates were made in previous years, the official said, but the widespread opinion among government officials was that the number was uch smaller 10 years ago.
 One reason for the scrutiny of the problem now is that Clinton administration officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Attorney General Reno, in addition to the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, have spoken out on the issue.
 The task force that Ms. Reno established federal efforts to fight the problem meets every two or three months. It sponsors training seminars for law-enforcement personnel and pilot projects for victims, among other efforts. The Justice Department set up a hot line for victims, staffed during business hours, Monday through Friday.
 Other federal officials, and the report itself, say the government's efforts are often fragmented and ineffectual. Many agencies have theoretial jurisdiction - the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the I.N.S., the Department of Labor, the State Department, among others - but none of them see trafficking of women and children as their clear responsibility, or as a desirable assignment because "investigating trafficking and slavery cases is arduous" and unrewarding, the report says.
 Even when trafficerks are convicted, the penalties are usually light. In fact, there are few federal or state laws aimed directly at this crime. One federal law does forbid "sale into involuntary servitude." It carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Many recent trafficking convictions have brought sentences that were shorter than that.
 In one case last year involving 70 Thai laborers "who had been held against their will, systematically abused and made to work 20-hour shifts in a sweatshop," the report says, seven defendants received sentences of four to seven years; one received seven months.
 "These low penalties and the long, complicated and resource-intensive nature of trafficking cases tend to make them unattractive to many U.S. attorneys," the report says.
 Despite interest in the issue from the Clinton administration, government officials said, few resources have been devoted to it.
 "We have hundreds and hundreds of government analysts looking at drugs, arms, economic issues," a government official said. "But hardly anyone is on this."
 Two pending bills, in the House and the Senate, would increase prison time for traffickers, provide assistance for victims and increase resources and training for law-enforcement officers.
 The bills would require the State Department to public an annual report on trafficking and recommend sanctions against countries that are not, in the administration's view, fighting it aggressively enough. This would be similar to the annual State Department reports on human rights and drug trafficking. But the department strongly opposes this idea, threatening the bills.
 Although the C.I.A. report was distributed within the government last November, it does not appear to be getting much attention.
 "No one really knows what do with it," one government official said. "I'm not sure people are really focusing on this."

HEADLINE: New Economy;
The nouveaux riches of the Internet take a new approach to charity, with the accent on Web education and start-ups.

BYLINE: By Saul Hansell 

 BODY:
DOES a New Economy need a New Philanthropy?
That's a question being asked by some of the financiers and executives who have Web-browsed their way into billions over the last few years. 
 Some who have already bought a sports car, a couple of houses and an airplane without denting their portfolios are now beginning to ask if it's time to give some money away. Of course, for the people whose wealth was earned on some variant of the the slogan "this is going to change everything," giving money to the same old charities simply won't do.
"People don't just want to give to the United Way, they want to have an impact," said Jonathan Nelson, the 32-year-old chief executive of Organic, a big Web development shop that went public in February. "You saw the Carnegies and the Fricks create libraries and national parks and universities. The titans of the information revolution are talking about things like cleaning the water in Africa or wiping out diseases."
The titanic Mr. Nelson hasn't decided what he wants to do with his newfound wealth, and S.E.C. rules prevent him from tapping into the several hundred million dollars in paper gains for a few more months. Moreover, if the Nasdaq composite index keeps falling as it has of late, who knows how expensive a problem he will be able to solve. Organic had a stock-market value of $1.7 billion last Friday, down two-thirds in seven weeks.
Until recently, charities have found it much harder to raise money from the princes of Silicon Valley and Alley than from, say, the corporate raiders of Wall Street. But there are signs that the oft-noted stinginess of the technology elite may be starting to ease.
One sign of change began last year, when Bill Gates, who had said he would give away his money once he got old, handed his charitable foundation more than $8 billion, adding $5 billion this year. (Only a cynic would believe that Microsoft's antitrust fight with the government had anything to do with the timing.) In February, James Barksdale, former chief executive of Netscape Communications gave $100 million to improve reading in his native Mississippi.
And in Silicon Alley, Flatiron Partners, the Internet venture capital firm, is starting two funds with some $5 million, devoted to applying the methods of the New Economy to social problems.
These are not isolated examples. Contributions to the San Francisco Foundation, a major Bay area charity, are up 300 percent from a year ago, as the charity taps into the region's high-tech wealth. Sandra Hernandez, a medical doctor who is the foundation's chief executive, said that it had simply taken a while for many entrepreneurs to get around to giving.
"People have made a lot of money overnight and are still working 18 hours days," she said. "It's not they don't have the inclination to give. It's they haven't had the time."
Moreover, when the technology executives do turn their attention to charitable causes, she said, they want to incorporate their business ideas into their giving. For some contributors this means bringing access to the Internet to public schools and poor neighborhoods. For others, it is spreading the gospel of entrepreneurship as a force for social change.
Into this second category falls the effort by Flatiron, a venture firm founded by Fred Wilson and Jerry Colonna in 1996 with the seemingly improbable idea, at the time, of making Internet investments in New York.
"When we formed this fund we said the Internet will be big, and ultimately a lot of people copied us," Mr. Wilson said. "Now we're saying that social entrepreneurship will be big, and we hope even more people will follow suit."
Flatiron is creating both a traditional charitable foundation and a new venture capital fund that will invest in for-profit businesses that are deemed to have socially redeeming goals. This will support the trend among many charities to set up for-profit affiliates as a way to raise money.
"Most nonprofits spend 95 percent of their time sucking up to fat cats and raising money," Mr. Wilson said. "There has to be a better way than that."
Flatiron intends to back ventures that help prepare children for life in the digital age; that encourage giving by other winners in the new economy, and that expand access to capital for entrepreneurial ventures by women, minorities and others who have not traditionally had access to capital.
"We see so many deals that we normally need to see a five- or ten-time return in order to invest," Mr. Colonna said. "This fund can invest in things that only have a potential for a 2-X return if they are good for society."
Flatiron's new foundation will make traditional grants to nonprofit groups, but it too will try to apply the disciplines of a venture capitalist.
"We will take board seats and we will measure these groups the way we measure deals: did they achieve their business plans for the year?" Mr. Wilson said. Moreover, like any venture capitalist encouraging cross-pollination within its portfolio, Flatiron will try to get the for-profit companies it invests in to donate cash, stock and promotion to its charitable ventures.
Mr. Wilson declined to say how much he, Mr. Colonna and Robert Greene, the third Flatiron partner, have personally made so far. But it surely amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars. Flatiron's funds have produced a total profit of about $3 billion, and the typical venture capital firm takes in about 20 percent of the gain.
But what happens if the captains of the new economy see their bubble burst by an old-fashioned bear market?
Flatiron said that it is committed to donating and investing $3 million to $5 million over the next year, regardless of the movements in the Nasdaq. And Mr. Colonna said he hoped to set an example for others. "We're saying that entrepreneurs need to develop a culture of philanthropy the same way that the Fortune 1000 has," he said.
But Mr. Colonna conceded that charity loves a bull market.
"If people's perception of being wealthy changes, they will feel less philanthropic," he said. "But I'm sure that giving to the church basket goes up and down with the market too."
And for all the talk of the nouveau economy's riches begetting a new style of philanthropy, some long-time nonprofit executives worry that solving some of society's oldest problems is a lot harder than starting a Web portal.
"Someone will say, 'Show me five schools I can wire on a weekend,' " said Dr. Hernandez of the San Francisco Foundation. "I'll say that's great. Then I'll take them out to show them a program that is really making a difference in homelessness. We know it works. But it serves 38 people, when we need the resources to serve 3,800 people."

How America Online Recruited a Top Recruiter

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
America Online has said little about how its corporate culture may change once it acquires Time Warner. But there is at least one clue that its eyes are now as much on traditional entertainment as on the Internet.
America Online has created a position called chief talent scout, and it has hired a big-time headhunter, Michele James, to fill it. Ms. James was co-head of the media convergence practice at Korn/ Ferry International, the big recruiting firm, where she filled jobs in both new and old media. 
 For example, she recruited Robert Bowman to run the new-economy venture Cyberian Outpost, Strauss Zelnick to be the chief executive of Bertelsmann's old-media record label BMG Entertainment and Stuart Snyder to run Feld Entertainment, the producer of an old old-media operation: the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus.
Ms. James was also involved early with the online business, doing a lot of work for Prodigy and Time Warner's Pathfinder Web site.
At AOL, her job will involve both recruiting outsiders to the company and helping to redirect Time Warner executives into the merged company.
So how is a recruiter recruited?
Mark Stavish, America Online's head of human resources, called to tell Ms. James of the new position just after the America Online-Time Warner merger was announced in January.
"I said, 'Who are you thinking about?' " Ms. James recalled. "And he said 'You.' I said, 'That's flattering, but no thanks.' "
Ultimately, however, "they cajoled me," she said. And it was agreed that she would remain in New York with her family, rather than move to Virginia, where AOL is based. (That is not an option available to all recruits, she acknowledged.)
What happens to Ms. James after the merger is completed? As she will tell recruits, there are no guarantees.
"In order to take a job like this, you have to be a thrill seeker," she said. "This is like being in the Nina, the Pinta or the Santa Maria. You don't know what will happen, but you want to be there to find out." SAUL HANSELL

An Unemployed Guy Who Won't Follow Doctor's Orders

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
Rulo (Luis Margani), the indefatigably persevering central character of Pablo Trapero's powerfully gritty film "Crane World," is a divorced, unemployed 49-year-old day laborer in Buenos Aires who is desperate for whatever work he can scrounge up. Most of his job opportunities come through his best friend, Torres (Daniel Valenzuela), who has connections in the Argentine construction industry.
When Torres recommends him for a job as a crane operator, Rulo doesn't blink twice, even though he has never operated one before. When the two men visit the building site, Torres coaxes the overweight, beer-bellied Rulo out on a scaffold and re-assures him that he'll quickly conquer any fear of heights. A confident mechanic who finds the secrets of machines readily decipherable, Rulo is eager to get started as soon as possible. 
 In its utter plainness "Crane World," which New Directors/New Films is screening at the Museum of Modern Art tonight at 8:30 and tomorrow night at 6 before it opens on Friday at the Screening Room, is a stylistic throwback to 1940's Italian neo-realism. The movie's grainy, sepia-toned cinematography and low-key naturalistic performances by a cast of nonprofessionals enhance its slice-of-life authenticity. Rather than tell a story, "Crane World" immerses us in the world of Rulo, his family (he is supporting a mother and a layabout son) and co-workers.
Before starting work Rulo must have a physical checkup. During the examination the doctor advises Rulo to lose 40 or 50 pounds and to cut down on cigarettes and beer. Rulo forgets the warning until he arrives for his first day on the job and discovers another man running the crane. The boss curtly informs him that he was rejected by the insurance company for being overweight. Rulo is infuriated, but his anger quickly fades into resignation. That's just the way it goes in the world of semiskilled labor.
Without making a moral or political fuss about it and without sentimentalizing Rulo and his friends as downtrodden heroes, "Crane World" paints a blunt eye-level vision of the realities of Argentine working-class life. Unlike workers in the wealthier, more socially fluid United States where the spectacle of overnight millionaires puts everyone on edge, Rulo and his friends appear completely settled in their class and comfortable with who they are.
Twenty years earlier, we learn, Rulo had a momentary fling at celebrity as a member a rock band that proved to be a one-hit wonder. But although proud of his glory days, Rulo feels no bitterness. Now his 19-year-old son Claudio (Federico Esquerro) is a member of a struggling rockabilly band. When the father and son get on each other's nerves, Rulo sends Claudio to live with his mother (Graciana Chironi).
Rulo also strikes up a relationship with Adriana (Adriana Aizemberg), an exuberant middle-aged woman who owns a local kiosk. Just as their romance is gathering steam, Rulo lands a job operating an excavating machine in distant Patagonia. Here the workers live dormitory style in a remote farmhouse, and the relationship between management and labor is tenuous. One day when the workers are not given lunch, they simply refuse to continue until they are fed.
"Crane World" offers a bedrock vision of humanity making do. The social outlook of Rulo and his friends couldn't even be described as of one of lowered expectations. What keeps them going is an instinctual optimism, a rough-hewn camaraderie and an elemental faith in themselves and in the world to meet their needs and give them enough to indulge in a few simple pleasures.

HEADLINE: Patents;
What's in a name? A sign of other changes at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

BYLINE: By Sabra Chartrand 

 BODY:
WITH a couple of minor changes, officials at the federal agency responsible for patents and trademarks last week began what they say is a makeover to render the organization more efficient and responsive to inventors, patent holders and intellectual property lawyers.
The real import of the changes, however, appears to come not from the patent office's efforts to streamline operations, but from revised procedures for handling the increasing number of applications for Internet-related patents, like those in business method software and electronic commerce. 
 On the face of it, many of the changes appear cosmetic. The agency once known as the Patent and Trademark Office renamed itself the United States Patent and Trademark Office last Wednesday. It also altered its leader's title, from commissioner to director.
But other changes are more substantive. In return for meeting specific goals in customer service and performance, the agency is released from government protocols on hiring, procurement and budget-handling. Other reforms include eliminating employee sign-in sheets, offering flexible working hours and developing new procedures for buying computers.
The changes are intended to inaugurate the agency's new role as a so-called performance-based organization, an element of Vice President Al Gore's program to reinvent government. Only one other agency has metamorphosed this way, the Office of Student Financial Assistance in the Education Department.
But while promoting its makeover last week, the patent and trademark agency also took the opportunity to address a heated controversy over the way it handles business method software patents, a category that includes patents on ways of doing business on the Internet. Responding to complaints that the agency's examiners are too quick to patent basic methods of doing business, Q. Todd Dickinson, the office's director, announced plans for increased training, supervision and review of examiners, as well as a program to reach out to the software and computer industries for help in understanding technology and business trends.
"We do a good job of examining business methods patents now," Mr. Dickinson insisted. "We keep up very well. But this area is as cutting-edge as can be; it's emerging so fast that we've got to ensure the public's level of confidence."
While Mr. Dickinson said the new procedures were part of the agency's long-planned transformation, they came after months of mounting reproach from outsiders over the agency's awarding of patents for simple online business methods like "one-click" shopping, reverse auctions, customer profiling and electronic payment systems.
The explosion in e-commerce has been followed by a boom in business method software patents, as more entrepreneurs and investors realize the value of owning a way to do business on the Internet. In 1997, the agency created a separate department for processing those patents. At the time, 12 examiners were assigned to evaluate 920 applications. The next year, in 1998, the number of applications increased to 1,300, and they doubled in 1999 to 2,600. By then, 40 examiners were working on them.
Each application takes an average 26 months to process, compared with 18 months for general patents. In 1999, 583 business method software patents were issued.
The agency issued 161,000 patents over all in 1999, so the number of business method software patents was still a fraction of the total. Still, they are a crucial component of the high-technology economy.
Critics have said the agency approves such patents too readily because its examiners do not understand current technology and Internet practices well enough. They have charged the agency with hampering competition and innovation, by allowing commonplace business practices to be rendered private property, and with restricting innovation by entrepreneurs wary of infringement lawsuits.
"That argument has been made many times and has never proved to be the case," Mr. Dickinson countered. "On the contrary, patents spur innovation."
He cited the dispute over a patent for "one-click" shopping that was awarded to Jeffrey Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon.com. The patent is one of the most contested, and is at the center of a lengthy court battle. But Mr. Dickinson believed that it resulted from a process that is intended to encourage innovation and reward it through patent protection.
"I heard that Barnes & Noble has now invented a new system," he added. "I understand they created something better. That's how innovation works."
Nevertheless, the patent office seems to have concluded that some of these patents might deserve greater scrutiny.
The new procedures sound remarkably similar to those begun in 1994, after a crisis over patents for software-related inventions. At the time, the agency was denounced for awarding undeserved patents because its examiners were not trained software engineers, were unaware of the latest innovations in software and lacked comprehensive research materials.
The patent office countered with plans to face the future by hiring new examiners and training them for two years, and by expanding its meager software library. Yet the future has arrived, bringing software for Internet business practices with it, along with renewed charges from critics that the agency is still unprepared and continues to award patents for universal practices.
Mr. Dickinson made it clear that even though his agency might be redoubling its hiring and training to process this new type of software patent application, there will be no re-evaluation of the merit of business method patents.
"Inventors who worked at a workbench or in a garage are now online," he said. "But they're still creating inventions they deserve to have protected, so people can't come along and rip them off."

HEADLINE: CNNfn's President Faces Tough Fight In a New Arena;
Varied Career Brings Journalist Up Against a Viewer Favorite

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG 

 BODY:
C. Shelby Coffey III is a neat, soft-spoken man, and his new office on the 21st floor of 5 Penn Plaza at Eighth Avenue and 34th Street, CNN's New York headquarters, is stark white with a view of the Statue of Liberty.
The walls are bare save for two large color prints of the 1997 Mike Tyson-Evander Holyfield fight, in which Mr. Tyson bit off part of Mr. Holyfield's right ear. Mr. Coffey, who tries to hit a heavy bag a few times a week, likes to point to the prints when people question his toughness. 
 "I enjoy boxing," he said one recent morning in addressing his gentle, outward nature.
The reference was apropos. Four months after he took over as president of CNNfn, Mr. Coffey is in the early rounds of a truly tough brawl, an attempt to reverse one of Ted Turner's rare failures: a financial news network that is being pummeled by the sassy, fast-moving CNBC and that is so weak that many of its corporate cousins, Time Warner's cable systems, refuse to carry it.
Taking odds on his chances has become casual sport among top news media executives, who wonder if Mr. Coffey, 53 -- basically a print journalist with relatively scant financial experience who was not the first choice for the job -- is up to the task, or if anyone is. Today, Mr. Coffey is expected to announce an expansion from 18 hours to 24 hours of coverage, a move CNN executives clearly hope will dispel doubts about the financial network's future.
Mr. Coffey has been around. He has popped up Zelig-like in some of the most interesting moments in post-Watergate news media, serving under some of the industry's most imposing figures. He worked for Benjamin C. Bradlee as a pioneer of The Washington Post's Style section, served briefly as Mortimer B. Zuckerman's editor at U.S. News & World Report and edited The Los Angeles Times for the Chandler family, encountering Mark H. Willes, the Times Mirror executive who wanted to revolutionize newspapers. In Los Angeles, he became friendly with Michael D. Eisner, the Walt Disney chairman, and Michael Ovitz, the Hollywood power broker, and he eventually worked for Mr. Eisner at Disney's ABC News.
Now, Mr. Coffey is finding himself in the service of three more media titans: Mr. Turner, Time Warner's vice chairman; Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner's chairman; and soon Stephen M. Case, the America Online chairman -- in what is perhaps this era's most intriguing media arena, television financial news. There, analysts are treated like senators, and markets are moved with the mere hint of a merger.
Mr. Coffey arrived at CNNfn as CNBC was solidifying its position as almost a cultural marker of the era, a regular fixture in health clubs, bars and brokerage houses that draws more daytime viewers than even CNN. CNNfn languishes with too few viewers to be rated by Nielsen Media Research.
What's worse, the CNN financial unit's onetime source of pride, "Moneyline News Hour" -- simulcast on CNNfn and CNN -- has almost precipitously dropped in the ratings as its main competitor, CNBC's "Business Center," has risen. Though "Moneyline" is still CNN's top revenue generator, it has not recovered from the loss of Lou Dobbs, a popular host and the CNNfn president, who left in June after repeatedly clashing with his colleagues in Atlanta, most specifically Rick Kaplan, president of CNN/ U.S. It is generally believed that Mr. Dobbs will land at CNBC one day and make life even worse for his former network.
The Dobbs-Kaplan wars left CNNfn staff members adrift and demoralized. Many have left. The gloom grew heavier when Paul E. Steiger, managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, declined the CNNfn presidency after entertaining an offer for weeks.
So it is fair to say that Mr. Coffey is handicapped in his match against CNBC, which is run by Bill Bolster, a brash by-the-bootstraps executive with long experience in local TV news. Though the front-runner, Mr. Bolster comes off as the scrappy underdog, and Mr. Coffey displays the quiet confidence of the one in the lead.
And that style is indicative of where Mr. Coffey says he wants the network to go. Mr. Coffey said he wanted CNNfn to be a reasoned voice above the din of rumors and often baseless stock run-ups.
"You want to be first, but you want to be right," he said. "You want to analyze well, so people will see you as a trusted guide through a media world that has many, many voices now. For us, context is king."
But is that the way to lure viewers and cable operators? CNNfn, which had its debut in 1995, is available in 13.3 million homes. CNBC, which had its debut in 1989, is available in 72 million.
Besides the move to 24-hour coverage, changes so far have been modest. But Mr. Coffey says he aims to increase coverage of biotechnology and electronic commerce on the West Coast. New cameras have been placed in the San Francisco offices of The Industry Standard, the Internet-focused business magazine. More will be placed in the offices of eCompany Now, which Time Warner plans to roll out this month. Mr. Coffey's first new show, scheduled to have its premiere later this month, will focus on the new economy.
But CNN and Time Warner executives say that the key to the network's growth -- now hindered by limited space on cable systems -- lies not only with content but with the expanded capacity offered by digital cable, satellite TV and, in light of America Online's planned purchase of Time Warner, the Internet.
They say CNNfn could be a great asset in the online-digital-wireless world. Mr. Coffey spent a day recently with AOL executives plotting possibilities. AOL features CBS MarketWatch, and the executives hope that it will eventually feature CNNfn.com, which Time Warner executives say is the network's saving grace, clearly ahead of CNBC.com.
But satellites, digital distribution -- these are relatively new issues for Mr. Coffey.
The grandson of a United States senator from Tennessee, Mr. Coffey started his career in the sports department of The Washington Post. At 25, he was promoted to editor of the Sunday Magazine. In 1976, at 29, he took over the Style section, where he was credited with helping develop a form of journalism that is now prevalent -- gossipy, smart and analytic feature writing. Features with an edge, it has been called.
Groomed to take over for Mr. Bradlee, he left in 1985 for U.S. News & World Report when it became clear he would not win the top job. He had met the magazine's owner, Mr. Zuckerman, at a cocktail party; he left after less than a year.
But he had another life raft. At a Washington gym, Mr. Coffey came to know Otis Chandler, and Mr. Chandler brought him to Times Mirror as editor and vice president of The Dallas Times Herald. Just months after he took the job, the Chandler family sold the newspaper. Mr. Coffey was transferred to The Los Angeles Times in the fall of 1986. He was elevated to editor and executive vice president in 1989.
He almost immediately redesigned the newspaper to make it more reader-friendly with graphics and color, set up investigative units and re-emphasized breaking news. The newspaper won five Pulitzer Prizes under his watch and was a finalist 25 times. In 1995, he was named editor of the year by the National Press Foundation.
But Mr. Coffey also had a reputation among some staff members as someone who was afraid to take on tough decisions, and in some cases, tough journalism. He had become friendly with Hollywood power players like Mr. Ovitz and Mr. Eisner. Often, if stories were toned down or held, reporters ascribed social climbing motives.
Reporters complained publicly in 1991 when Mr. Coffey held articles about financial problems at the studio of Jerry Weintraub, the movie executive, and about Mr. Eisner's Disney.
"He has great skills because he's a wise fellow, he does his homework, he looks and watches," said Irv Letofsky, who was removed as an editor at The Times magazine under Mr. Coffey. "But the attitude was that he is very shallow. That is what people have said about him over time."
David Shaw, The Los Angeles Times's media reporter, said he considered a lot of the criticisms of Mr. Coffey unfair, at least when arch motives are ascribed to him. If Mr. Coffey came across as indecisive, Mr. Shaw said it was because of "a reluctance on his part to hurt anybody."
"On that level," Mr. Shaw said, "you make decisions, somebody gets hurt."
Mr. Coffey said he was aware of the criticism and understood it as part of the job of being an editor. "You're doing fairness, which is a broad and sometimes difficult concept to get around, but it is a really important one in journalism," he said. "Let's go the extra step to make sure we're fair. Or, if we've been unfair, let's give right to reply, or, if necessary, do a correction. There are some people who don't enjoy that, question your motives."
When Mr. Willes, the chief executive of Times Mirror, named himself publisher of The Los Angeles Times, ordered 150 layoffs and began bringing down the wall between the editorial and advertising divisions, Mr. Coffey left. In June 1998, he moved to Mr. Eisner's ABC.
It was not the easiest fit. As the news division's No. 2, Mr. Coffey was in large part brought in to be a journalistic compass for David Westin, the incoming ABC News president, who had spent most of his career as a corporate lawyer. Mr. Westin says of Mr. Coffey, "He brought us a level of editorial maturity and experience in journalism at time when we needed it."
Still, Mr. Coffey's role was ill-defined and spread thin. He helped draft the division's online and cable strategies and helped Mr. Westin rethink "Good Morning America," which was in a ratings free fall. He would even go in on weekends and tweak scripts for the weekend news.
But in his most visible position, as Mr. Westin's journalistic ethicist, Mr. Coffey did not save the new president from much of the high-profile battering he had been hoping to avoid. Mr. Westin, for instance, took lumps in the news media and inside his division for canceling a report about problems with pedophiles at Disney World -- a report Mr. Westin had said was not appropriately put into context. Mr. Coffey left the call to the journalistic novice, Mr. Westin. In his defense, Mr. Coffey said last week that the reporting on the story had begun before he had arrived.
Mr. Coffey said, however, there were plenty of instances when he did make tough decisions, an assertion Mr. Westin echoed. The decision to leave for CNNfn was apparently not one of the tough ones. Mr. Westin did not hold Mr. Coffey to his contract.
Now comes the latest round. Though he increased technology and business coverage at The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Coffey has never run a 24-hour news operation solely dedicated to business news, and that could provide some journalistic challenges.
And there could be another challenge, a political one. When Mr. Dobbs ran CNNfn, he constantly fought with CNN's executives in Atlanta, who were trying to bring more CNNfn programming into the CNN schedule. Mr. Dobbs -- who, like Mr. Coffey, was in charge of business programming for the entire CNN family of networks -- saw that as a dilution of the CNNfn brand. By making CNNfn programming available on CNN, the theory goes, cable operators have less incentive to pick the network up. CNN has added three business shows produced by CNNfn since Mr. Dobbs' departure.
"I think he's got to look out for 'fn' and what fn needs," said David Bohrman, one of Mr. Dobbs's top lieutenants at CNNfn, who is now president of Pseudo.com, an Internet TV service. Often, he said, that means clashing with Atlanta and making tough calls.
So far, his troops have a mixed opinion of their new leader -- excited by his background and enthusiasm but still waiting for a vision that will take them to the next level.
Mr. Coffey urges patience. Again, it comes back to a boxing reference.
"It's a sport that is about keeping concentrated and calm, and enduring until you see the right openings," he said. "Then you strike with speed and power."

HEADLINE: Road From Prison to Jobs Gets Smoother

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 2

 BODY:
Most job applicants have butterflies. People who have just finished serving time in prison have more than usual.
They dread the inevitable question about what landed them in prison. Some parolees say they try to keep their ankles out of sight because they must wear electronic ankle tethers that help probation officers keep track of them. And many fear getting their hopes up, only to be put on a "bubba bus," prison slang for a trip to a job recruiter who has no intention of hiring anyone with a criminal record. 
 But now, with the economy thriving and unemployment rates at near-record lows, former convicts are finding it easier to find work. Even here, in a city that was the 1980's symbol of industrial decline and double-digit unemployment rates, they are getting job offers.
"Ten years ago, an employer wouldn't even look at an ex-con," said Willy Walker, director of the Detroit Employment and Training office. Now that the city's unemployment rate is 5.5 percent, down from 14.1 percent 10 years ago, some companies have changed their approach. "Employers will call and say, 'We need somebody right away -- if you have any ex-cons, clean them up and send them over,' " Mr. Walker said.
Most local and national experts agreed that ex-offenders are having an easier time getting jobs, but figures on this are difficult to establish.
The majority of prisoners are in state-run prisons, and few states keep records on how many prisoners being released get jobs. The federal government does not keep track. But New York State found that about 40 percent of former prisoners had jobs last year, up from 35 percent six years ago. In Texas, 15,046 ex-offenders found work last year, up from 13,727 two years before. Michigan does not keep such records.
Every Wednesday, Michigan runs a job-hunting workshop here for ex-offenders. The men -- they are mostly men -- must write a resume and post it in a computerized resume bank, used by 38,000 employers now that the state's unemployment rate has dropped to 2.6 percent, far below the national average of 4.1 percent.
One recent workshop included a mock job interview. Michael S. Leverette, 32, who had served four years for home invasion, straightened his stocking cap and introduced himself to the pretend boss, Jermaine McGee, 26, who had served eight months for selling drugs.
Mr. McGee asked the question haunting most former prisoners: "Why should I hire you as opposed to a worker with a clean record?"
Mr. Leverette replied: "I believe that it is something that I've done in the past, and I'm moving on from that. I already forgave myself, and I believe I can be a great asset to your company." He got the pretend job.
Typically, half the men in these classes will find a job within two weeks. Social workers and recruiters say that companies still hesitate to hire men convicted of murder, armed robbery or other violent crimes. But more companies are willing to hire those convicted of nonviolent crimes like welfare fraud, drug dealing and shoplifting.
Fifteen months ago, Air Louvers, a California subsidiary of Activar Inc. of Minneapolis, hired Joe Greene, 48, a convicted bank robber who was an experienced metal worker.
"There's a labor crunch on right now for good, skilled people," explained Gary M. Stillwell, assistant general manager of Air Louvers, which makes window louvers and other metal products. "This is kind of a liberal thing to do -- both my boss and I are kind of conservative -- so this was kind of like stepping out of the box for us."
Whatever the sentiment, Mr. Greene said he was happy to get the job. "I felt that if somebody would give me a chance, I could prove myself," he said.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission holds that companies may discriminate in the hiring of convicted felons only when there is "a justifying business necessity." Employers may consider three factors: the gravity of the crime, when it was committed and whether the crime was related to the nature of the job. Most recruiters interpret that to mean, for instance, that convicted bank robbers need not be considered for bank teller openings.
Prisoners released today are also helped by demographics. There are fewer people in their late teens and early 20's, prime ages for filling entry-level jobs. But the dearth of young workers will not last, and by 2008, "it will be as hard for future prisoners as it was for prisoners released 10 years ago," said Jeffrey Fagan, a professor of public health at Columbia University.
There are longer-term concerns, too. "When they leave prison, relatively few offenders are really trained to move into the 21st-century economy and work force," said Ira M. Schwartz, dean of the University of Pennsylvania's School of Social Work. "We need to be teaching people to be Webmasters, not to work in food service."
But for now at least, more former prisoners are likely to find work. "With the booming economy now, it is easier for everyone to find a job, including ex-offenders," said Miles D. Harer, a research analyst with the Federal Bureau of Prisons. "It has little to do with less stigma, but rather the economic interest of the employer: they're willing to hire people they were able to ignore in the past."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Diplomatic Outsider Lobbies Washington's Inner Circle

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AT an embassy that is not an embassy, the ambassador who is not an ambassador can only imagine what it is like to be a full-fledged member of Washington's diplomatic corps.
"In the evenings, you attend cocktail parties, champagne dances," Stephen Chen said wistfully of the black-tie world from which he is largely excluded. "This is the very routine, beautiful picture of the diplomat in a textbook." 
 Mr. Chen, the director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, the de facto embassy here for the government of Taiwan, is a charming pariah.
While he represents the interests of 22 million of the freest and richest people in Asia, the 66-year-old diplomat might as well be invisible, at least as far as many of the State Department's China experts are concerned.
The snubs, Mr. Chen suggested, are an obvious effort to appease Beijing, and they are more than a little unfair to a government that is only weeks away from a peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected leader to another, the first time that has happened in almost 5,000 years of Chinese history.
"There is a kind of unfairness," Mr. Chen tells a visitor, the wall behind his desk decorated with a painting of the delicate blossoms of the winter plum, Taiwan's national flower. "We have been a model student for freedom, democracy and a market economy."
"We don't mind if the United States has rapprochement with mainland China -- we think it's good to bring the P.R.C. into the family of civilizations," he says of the People's Republic of China, which considers Taiwan to be a renegade province. "What we ask is that the interests of Taiwan not be sacrificed."
Because the United States has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan and has recognized the Communist government in Beijing as the sole representative of the people of China, Mr. Chen and his staff of nearly 200 are barred from the premises of the State Department.
They are not invited to diplomatic receptions at the White House, or to most of the dinner parties and glittery balls held at the embassies of nations that recognize Beijing.
When Taiwanese diplomats want to talk with Clinton administration officials, the meetings are often held in hotel coffee shops.
"We must meet in a neutral setting, that is the rule," says Mr. Chen, explaining the awkward logistics of the job.
Relations with China have been especially jittery since Taiwan's election last month of the new president, Chen Shui-bian, a former democracy activist who long advocated Taiwan's independence and whose victory ended half a century of Nationalist rule.
On the eve of the election, Chinese leaders all but warned of an invasion if Mr. Chen and his party were victorious. Since the election, both Mr. Chen and Beijing have softened their rhetoric, and Mr. Chen has recently insisted that he sees no need for an independence declaration.
Stephen Chen, who is not related to the new president, welcomes the moderated rhetoric from Taiwan's new government. The Communist leaders in Beijing, he says, would strike only "if they should be unnecessarily provoked."
"We have been dealing with them for more than 60 years," he said. "We know when they are bluffing, when they are not bluffing. If we don't give them an excuse, I don't think they're going to attack."
MR. CHEN, who was born in the Chinese city of Nanjing, last saw the mainland in 1949, when his family was on the run from the victorious Communist forces of Mao Zedong. They fled to Taiwan, his father a diplomat in the service of the Nationalist leader, Chiang Kai-shek.
His father was assigned to the embassy in the Philippines when Mr. Chen was 15, and he remained there for more than a decade, attending college in Manila, marrying his Chinese-Filipino high school sweetheart and becoming fluent in English.
In 1960, he returned to Taiwan and passed the foreign service exam. He was first sent to Rio de Janeiro, and then to Argentina and Bolivia. In 1973, he was named consul general to Atlanta, where he remained until the United States severed relations with Taiwan and recognized Beijing six years later.
Mr. Chen said he can remember sitting in his living room in Atlanta, watching the televised announcement by President Carter that the United States would recognize the Communist government. "I felt that I was being clobbered," he recalled. "A baseball bat on the head."
"It seemed very unfair," he continued. "It was as if the United States wanted to reward a bad guy, the lousy student, and to punish the good student. That was my feeling."
In the years since, he said, Taiwanese diplomats have learned how to innovate, especially in Washington, where they employ some of the city's most powerful lobbyists and retain close ties to many prominent conservative members of Congress.
Mr. Chen says his office has an annual budget for lobbying of about $1.2 million and contracts with 15 firms. "They help open doors, they make appointments for us," he said. "But we make the presentations."
Under a 1979 law, Taiwan can continue to buy American weapons.
And Mr. Chen has been a frequent visitor to Capitol Hill in recent weeks as his government seeks Congressional approval for the sale of a wish list of sophisticated weapons. "If we are deprived of basic defensive weapons, then of course we are thrown to the wolves," he said.
Mr. Chen is considering a visit to the lair of the wolves. After 40 years in the diplomatic service, he is nearing retirement, and he is planning a vacation on the mainland, which is now permitted.
"I tell you very frankly, I would like to see the Great Wall," he said. "This belongs to the legacy of China. It has nothing to do with Communism."

HEADLINE: Canada's Anti-Corporate Crusader

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
Cocooned in the spiral staircase of a downtown bookstore recently, Naomi Klein gleefully popped corporate marketing balloons as she brought her war on modern corporations to hundreds of office workers who had skipped lunch to hear a fire-and-brimstone treatment of their bosses.
"Branding means selling us our desires," said Ms. Klein, whose new book, "No Logo," has made her Canada's 29-year-old media meteor and the most visible face of a sometimes scattershot anti-corporate youth movement, which is planning a show of force in Washington in mid-April. 
 "If you listen to Starbucks," she said, "we long for community. If you listen to Barnes & Noble, we long for libraries. If you listen to Microsoft, we long for communications."
Her book has become something of a movement bible here, staying on Canadian best-seller lists since its release in January, just weeks after days of protests at a World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle thrust the complaints of her generation before a global audience.
Mixing activism with analysis, she has filled university auditoriums, has won a column in The Globe and Mail and has been kicked off a television debate show by an angry conservative writer. In the first week of April, she will hopscotch from debates in New York to "counter-summits" in Washington, where protesters are preparing to demonstrate at meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
While her book is being published simultaneously in Australia, Britain and the United States (Picador), translations are in the works in French, German, Italian and Spanish, and a documentary is being negotiated with British filmmakers.
Her war on modern corporations boils down to a central theme: as companies' marketing budgets become more and more lavish, they maintain profit margins by farming out manufacturing to sweatshops in the poorest corners of the globe.
In so doing, they break with a basic, Henry Ford principle of 20th-century manufacturing: create a mass market by paying workers well enough so they can buy the products they produce. At the same time, Western consumers are targets of what she calls "Big Brother branding."
"My generation has grown up completely under the marketing microscope," she said.
Energetic and optimistic, Ms. Klein incarnates that generation's reinvention of the North American left. One of Ms. Klein's grandfathers, a Marxist, was fired by Walt Disney for trying to unionize the animators of "Fantasia." Her parents left the United States in the late 1960's to protest the Vietnam War, her mother becoming a feminist filmmaker and her father, a doctor, a supporter of Canada's national health system.
As an adolescent in Montreal, she rebelled against her socialist parents by becoming a self-described "mall rat," working after school in a chain clothing store.
At the University of Toronto she edited the campus newspaper, becoming, in her words, "Miss P.C." She denounced campus violators of a lengthening list of "isms." Recalling that phase of "identity politics," she said, "I watched the left get smaller and smaller."
After college she edited This Magazine, a leftist review in Toronto that limped along on dwindling circulation. Pulling dusty back issues from the stacks, she discovered that once upon a time there was "a movement on the left."
At the same time, she remembered that when advertisements started to infiltrate bathroom stalls at the University of Toronto, students fought back with felt-tip pens against marketing omnipresence.
Four years later, her book contains some of her favorite "culture jamming" examples: perky models morphed into skulls; Nike's "Just Do It" slogan tweaked into "Justice. Do It"; Apple Computers' "Think Different" campaign mysteriously embellished with a photo of Stalin and the ominous slogan "Think Really Different."
Gloria Steinem recalls watching Ms. Klein at a book promotion in New York, handing out little cutting tools to allow people to cut designer labels off their clothes.
"In the women's movement, in the labor-left movement, we focused on how much money was earned and by whom," said Ms. Steinem, who has published Ms. Klein's essays in Ms. magazine. "Now, Naomi is focusing on the next step, which is how the money is spent."
The resonance of Ms. Klein's ideas speaks volumes here about how Canada sees itself today.
While Americans generally see Canadians as economic equals, Canada missed the American boom of the 1990's. After a decade of economic stagnation, Canadian per capita income fell in 1998 to $16,487, or 13 percent below that of Mississippi, the poorest American state.
At the same time, Canada has moved away from the isolated, nationalist economy of years past. In the last 15 years, foreign investors have roughly tripled their holdings in Canada, controlling about 13,000 corporations, which are worth about $500 billion and responsible for about a third of the country's corporate profits. Once an economic hinterland, Canada became the industrialized world's most trade-dependent country in the 1990's, with 43 percent of its economy tied to trade.
In such an economy, Ms. Klein's anti-multinational message has appealed to people who complain of a loss of local economic control.
"Canadians feel a little bit on the sidelines in the way the global economy is changing," said Paul Tough, who published many of Ms. Klein's essays in Saturday Night, an intellectual monthly here. "In the states you feel you are in the center. In Canada sometimes you feel you are in the center, but sometimes you feel you are in Indonesia, the Philippines or somewhere where you are being acted upon, not acting."
It is that kind of anti-corporate, anti-marketing anger that boiled over in Seattle. "The real anarchists in Seattle," Ms. Klein said, "were the businessmen, who were saying, 'We don't want any rules.' "
Then, warning that her generation's activists are not going to abandon their critique of laissez-faire globalism, she looked ahead to another meeting of World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, in Prague in September, and predicted with ill-disguised glee, "Prague is going to be nuts."

HEADLINE: M.T.A.'s Plan Spawns Warnings Of a Debt Crisis and Higher Fares

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 2

 BODY:
In the last month, government and private analysts have developed a striking consensus that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's five-year, $16.5 billion capital improvement plan is a disaster-in-waiting, built on a mountain of borrowed money, that would force a major fare increase.
They say the crush of debt would cripple the authority's ability to keep New York City's subways and buses and the commuter railroads in good repair, and would make the financing of future capital plans nearly impossible. The plan would require by far the largest sale of municipal bonds in history, more than $20 billion. 
 As a dire view of the plan has achieved critical mass, it has begun to put significant pressure on Gov. George E. Pataki, who controls the authority, to do something. Several private groups have issued reports pleading with the governor to help plug the holes with state money. Legislative leaders have begun arguing that the state must put the authority on a sound financial footing, and that such action should be linked to talks over the state budget.
This discourse has largely been obscured by the separate debate over the plan's elements, including whether to build a full-length Second Avenue subway. But in recent weeks, advocates of a Second Avenue line have linked the two issues, saying that it is pointless to begin the project if the authority later cannot afford to finish it.
Broadsides at the plan's financing have come from State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, leaders of both houses of the State Legislature, the Regional Plan Association, the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce, the New York City Independent Budget Office, the Straphangers Campaign and others. Even some officials in the transportation authority acknowledge that they do not have a comprehensive plan for repaying all the debt they envision.
"We are looking at a return to the 1970's, with the M.T.A. running out of money for operations and good repair, and no credible way of financing new projects," said Robert R. Kiley, a former chairman of the authority who is now president of the New York City Partnership, an alliance of major businesses.
Marc V. Shaw, executive director of the authority, said: "This plan represents our best efforts both to deal with the base-line infrastructure needs of the M.T.A. and at the same time move forward with expansion plans. We were very careful as we put together the plan to try to balance the resources we believed were available at the time."
Critics contend that at a time of unparalleled prosperity and large surpluses in Albany, the state should give more to the capital program, a position both houses of the Legislature accept. To a lesser degree, they are also looking for more money from New York City.
The governor has so far remained silent on the idea, and his office did not return repeated calls last week seeking his views.
The state contributed heavily to the authority's first three capital plans, starting in 1982, but Mr. Pataki put an end to that when he took office in 1995. He installed a new administration at the authority, led by the chairman, E. Virgil Conway, with the explicit mission of making do with less from Albany. Some authority officials now say that state money is needed, but that no one at the authority dares ask for it for fear of angering the governor.
Mr. McCall, a Democrat who is planning for the possibility of running for governor in 2002 -- and who was one of the first to criticize the plan -- described the authority's thinking as "get the governor through the end of his term and push it for somebody else to worry about in the future."
The capital plan, proposed in September, needs the approval of the Legislature, but both houses have rejected it, in part because the legislators believe the financing is shaky. The Democrats who control the Assembly have also demanded that the transportation authority commit to building the Second Avenue subway the length of Manhattan, rather than from 125th Street to 63rd Street, as the authority has proposed, a condition that would probably make the whole plan cost more.
Nearly everyone involved in this debate believes it is inevitable that fares will increase to help pay for capital improvements, a prospect Mr. Shaw would not comment on. Many government officials and private analysts predict a 25-cent increase to the current $1.50 fare for subways and buses before the year is out, though no one expects this to happen until after the legislative elections in November, and some analysts say another increase will be needed before the five-year plan expires.
But even with higher fares and more state aid, the authority would end up deeply in debt, and transit advocates acknowledge that they are not entirely sure how to solve the problem.
The financing is being debated as the authority contemplates the first major expansion of the transit network since the IND subway was completed in 1940: the partial Second Avenue subway, a Long Island Rail Road link to Grand Central Terminal, and extension of the N subway line to La Guardia Airport. The authority proposed spending $2.6 billion on these projects through 2004, and $10 billion more to complete them under future capital programs.
"The plan has already succeeded from our perspective because it has, out there on the table, funding expansion projects that a few years ago no one was even discussing," Mr. Shaw said. "Now people are arguing about how big a Second Avenue subway are we going to have. That in itself is a success."
Most capital plan spending would be for routine maintenance of the sprawling system, and for buying thousands of subway cars, commuter train coaches and buses to replace old ones.
Transit advocates say a fare increase would be palatable if riders got a solid plan and important improvements like the Second Avenue line in return.
"As it stands now it's a crummy deal," said Gene Russianoff, a lawyer with the Straphangers Campaign. "You can't just borrow the dough and hope that somewhere, sometime, someone figures out how to pay it back. It's untenable."
The plan calls for $4.5 billion in federal financing. But independent analysts say that amount is far from secure because the federal government will not contribute unless the plan is sound overall. The plan assumes federal support for the Second Avenue subway and Long Island Rail Road projects, but the federal budget for such "new starts" is limited, and competition for it is fierce.
The plan does not anticipate any state money for capital improvements, though Mr. Pataki has proposed an $800 million increase over five years in state aid for daily operations, which would help the overall picture. The plan calls for $530 million over five years from New York City, along with smaller sums from several other sources.
Most of the money would be raised by selling bonds, to be repaid out of riders' fares. Fiscal experts say that the magnitude of the borrowing would overwhelm the authority, and that the way this borrowing would be structured would make the problem worse by increasing the repayment costs.
"If the M.T.A.'s plan is not modified in a major way, you're going to come into 2005 and 2010 with a fiscal crisis for the M.T.A. that's going to make this one look pretty modest," said Albert Appleton, a senior fellow at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit group that advocates expansion of the transit system. "It imperils future capital plans and it imperils their operating budget, and that would ultimately imperil the state's budget."
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan, said the plan "is badly in need of being shored up by a greater state commitment."
State Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Nassau County Republican who sits on a state board that will decide whether to approve the plan, agreed. He proposed that the state ask voters to approve a bond issue for both highways and mass transit, with the state, not the authority, responsible for repayment.
Until recently, the authority did not rely heavily on fare-backed debt, but used fares almost exclusively to pay for day-to-day operations. But that approach changed under Mr. Pataki, and the M.T.A.'s most recent capital program contained more than $3 billion in fare-backed bonds. Even that figure made transit advocates nervous, but it is small compared with the proposal for the next five years.
Mr. Shaw called the recent program a success, adding, "we now have a track record of proving the naysayers wrong."
Today, 11 cents of every dollar in fares is used to repay bonds. Under the authority's plan, that would increase to 23 cents in 2004, and it would keep rising. That would put a burden on the operating budget, which is already projected to run large deficits in coming years.
The financing plan has two basic elements. First, the authority would sell more than $11 billion in bonds for new debt. Second, it would refinance most or all of its $12 billion in existing debt by selling new bonds.
In all, the agency would sell up to $23 billion in bonds over five years, far exceeding the record $7 billion bond sale in 1998 to pay for the state's partial takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company. Some analysts doubt that the municipal bond market can absorb so much new debt, meaning that the authority may be forced to pay above-market interest rates to attract buyers.
The newly issued bonds would be heavily back-loaded, meaning that the payments would start out small, so the authority could get through the next few years, and then balloon. That practice is generally shunned by financial experts, who favor level repayment, and it would add billions of dollars to the long-term cost of repayment over the 30-year life of the bonds.
The refinancing of the $12 billion in existing debt would stretch the repayment from an average of 13 years left on the old notes to 30 years for the new notes. The point of the exercise would be to reduce the yearly payments in the short run, freeing more than $1 billion over the next five years. But lengthening the terms of the debt would once again add billions of dollars in interest costs over the life of the bonds.
The authority refinanced much of its debt (without lengthening the repayment) in the early to mid-1990's to take advantage of low interest rates. Experts say that refinancing today would almost certainly mean paying higher interest rates, in addition to tens of millions of dollars in underwriting and legal fees, violating a basic principle of sound fiscal management.
"I think it's fair to say that it's completely inappropriate," said Ronnie Lowenstein, chief economist and deputy director of the Independent Budget Office. "There seems to be no reason for it except a shortsightedness that will tie the authority's hands in the future."
The New York City Partnership estimates that the way the bonding would be structured -- back-loading, stretching out repayment, and refinancing at higher rates -- would add at least $8 billion to the long-term cost, and possibly much more.
The analysts who want a larger state commitment also want more money from the city, an idea Giuliani administration officials have declined to comment on. In the 1980's, New York City contributed as much as $300 million a year to transit improvements. The amount dropped to about $100 million in the last recession, and has remained there.
Even if the critics of the capital plan get what they want, paying for the plan remains a daunting challenge. Some propose a $2 billion state share, and a $500 million increase in the city's. A 25-cent transit fare increase at the end of the year and equivalent increases on the commuter railroads would raise $1.6 billion over four years.
Taken together, those steps would still leave $7 billion to be raised through borrowing.
"Nobody," Mr. Kiley said, "ever said this would be easy."

HEADLINE: Deceptive Home Loan Practices

 BODY:
State attorneys general and consumer advocates increasingly have expressed alarm over abusive practices in the "subprime" home equity market, which caters to people with blemished credit records and charges them higher interest rates and fees. Practices like tacking exorbitant fees onto loans without adequate disclosure can cause unsuspecting consumers to borrow more than they can repay, driving them into default and resulting in the loss of their homes.
Last week, a New York-based home loan company, Delta Financial, settled a lawsuit filed by three federal agencies accusing it of predatory lending to minority homeowners. Earlier, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, gave added prominence to the issue by voicing his concern about such practices. 
 Mr. Greenspan indicated that the Federal Reserve is working with several federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to examine deceptive behavior in this market. Other agencies, individual states and some in Congress are also pressing for a crackdown. The subprime lenders are largely regulated by the states, whose laws can vary substantially.
In many cases, the chief pressure on lenders has come from private consumer lawsuits. Last month, the First Alliance Corporation, a prominent subprime lender that is facing lawsuits by several homeowners and the AARP for deceptive practices, filed for bankruptcy protection. First Alliance, the subject of a report by The Times's Diana Henriques and ABC News, denies the accusations. The bankruptcy proceeding will freeze the legal actions and force the plaintiffs to pursue their claims in bankruptcy court. First Alliance is also facing suits by regulators in Illinois and Massachusetts.
The bankruptcy filing will give no relief to customers of First Alliance who face high repayments. But the troubled lender says it will stop making new loans. Meanwhile, federal regulators need to examine the adequacy of state regulations and intensify federal oversight in this market.

HEADLINE: Columbia to Put Learning Online for Profit

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Columbia University and several other of the world's most prestigious academic centers are planning to capitalize on their wealth of scholarly talent and stores of knowledge by offering them on the Internet, for a price.
The university is to announce today the formation of a for-profit online partnership with the New York Public Library, the British Library, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, the London School of Economics and Political Science and Cambridge University Press. 
 The goal of the company, Fathom .com, will be to provide knowledge in its broadest form -- classes taught by prominent academics like the historian Simon Schama, reference books like the Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, interviews from Columbia's oral history archive with people like Dorothy Parker and Frank Lloyd Wright, and documents like Magna Carta.
Columbia has been one of the most aggressive universities in mining the commercial potential of its intellectual property through patents and royalties, which bring it more than $100 million a year. Its new plan will try to harvest a similar type of bounty through new-media technologies.
Many offerings will be available free, while others will be sold. The company also expects to have advertisers and sponsors.
At a time when big-name professors are beginning to strike deals with independent Internet companies, George E. Rupp, Columbia's president, describes the creation of Fathom.com as both an offensive and defensive move, one that creates an avenue for its professors to reach audiences beyond their Morningside Heights classrooms.
"We want to make sure that our core intellectual capital is not picked off by outside for-profit vendors," Dr. Rupp said. "But for that, we have to be able to say to our faculty that we will devise ways they can communicate with a wider audience, which many of them would like."
Dr. Rupp said there were already "tight constraints in the way Columbia faculty can use the Columbia name and work with outside entities." But the university will not bar professors from working with other companies once Fathom is operating. Professors will not be required to contribute to Fathom, but they will be paid if they do.
A professor, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, called Fathom "a great experiment." But, he said, while "Columbia has thought more about intellectual property than most other universities, there are still huge holes."
"It worries me a lot that universities think about the Internet as a way to increase productivity of teaching," he said.
Columbia has given Fathom a five-year license and will hold part ownership of the new venture, which will have its own board of directors and which could someday sell shares to the public. The university will also continue separately to develop its ability to offer classes over the Internet to its own students.
Many other universities and companies have already crowded into the arena of Internet education. But Internet experts say the new Columbia venture differs from other online education projects in that it offers a range of materials, rather than just individual courses or degree programs.
"The idea of bringing together universities, libraries and museums -- the cultural repositories of the world -- and making them available through the Internet is important," said Gene DeRose, chairman of Jupiter Communications, an Internet research company based in New York. "I have not seen anything like it."
Although the partners have their own Internet sites, several said they were drawn to Fathom because it offered access to a wider audience and help in putting more of what they have online.
Robert Sullivan, associate director of public programs at the Smithsonian's Natural History Museum, said Fathom was giving the museum "tremendous production capacity," enabling it to put material online more quickly. He said that other Smithsonian institutions may eventually join Fathom, too.
Both Mr. Sullivan and Michael Zavelle, a senior vice president at the New York Public Library, said there would be no charge for most of what they post through Fathom or on their own Web sites.
The company also plans to add partners and to market courses from colleges and universities that are not partners. Michael M. Crow, executive vice provost at Columbia, said there are about 70,000 courses available on the Web now, and said he hoped that about 10,000 courses from many universities might eventually be available through Fathom.
Fathom will spend tens of millions of dollars developing its site, he said, and at least part of it should be operating sometime this summer.
The partners hope that a key attraction will be their own reputations and credibility and what they called the site's "authenticated knowledge." Like a university, the Web site will have its own academic council, comprising senior faculty, curators and other officials from the participating institutions and headed by Columbia's provost, Jonathan R. Cole.
"They are the insurance that as these great institutions put their intellectual capital in our hands, we'll do right by them," said Ann Kirschner, the president and chief executive of Fathom and its primary architect.
Some faculty members are applauding the new venture. Professor Schama, the Columbia historian, said it was important that institutions like Columbia and its partners be on the Internet.
"Learning is on the verge of a revolution," he said. "I'm concerned that not just the marketplace determines what goes online, but that institutions like Columbia and the British Library play a creative part in shaping what goes on the Internet. It really oughtn't just be left to the first person who decides to put a course up on the Internet."
He said that he was too busy now to contribute to Fathom, since he is working on a 16-part series on the history of Britain for the BBC (which will also be made available through BBC online). "But," he added, "one day, I'd love to."

HEADLINE: California Wine Region Torn By Debate Over Use of Land

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ALAMOS, Calif., March 29

 BODY:
It all began 30 years ago, when Jeanette Sainz's daughter wandered home with a shoe box containing a chunky black and ivory salamander that neither had seen on their ranch before. Curious, Mrs. Sainz took it to the natural history museum in nearby Santa Barbara. Scientists there had not seen the bug-eyed amphibian in the area either, they said. So Mrs. Sainz let them explore the ponds on her beautiful rolling property to learn more.
It was a civic-minded act that, Mrs. Sainz now says bitterly, may have been a costly mistake, and puts her in the middle of the latest battle over development in this bucolic agricultural landscape in one of the most promising and fastest-growing new wine regions in California. 
In January, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service surprised people here and gave that pokey six-inch creature, the California tiger salamander, an emergency listing as an endangered species.
The action is almost certainly a prelude to a permanent listing later this year under the Endangered Species Act. It made it a crime to harm the salamander or its murky habitat. The government has not yet identified the precise location or range of the species or specified how the seasonal ponds in which it breeds must be preserved. But many farmers, who face up to a year in jail and a $50,000 fine for harming the salamander, fear any continuation of their normal activities. That places hundreds of millions of dollars in jeopardy, they say, freezing work like mowing and plowing, as well as converting farms to vineyards.
The whole northern end of Santa Barbara County, a spectacular stretch of valleys and oak-dotted ranches popular with celebrities including Ronald Reagan and Michael Jackson, is in an uproar. It is a telling statement about the dilemma in which many people here find themselves, for the emergency listing of the obscure salamander in an area 60 miles north of the affluent city of Santa Barbara comes amid pressure from creeping urbanization and deep changes in the agricultural economy.
Cattle ranching, long a mainstay, has become unprofitable, so landowners have been forced to seek other uses. Add to that a prosperous wine market, especially for the premium wines that command retail prices of $10 a bottle and up, and the nearly ideal grape-growing conditions here, and there are the makings of an unsettling boom.
Since 1996, the amount of land dedicated to vineyards has gone from about 9,000 acres to more than 20,000 in place or being developed. But the transformation has come at a price.
For Mrs. Sainz it is personal. The sudden government announcement halted her long-planned conversion of about 500 acres of grazing land into vineyards -- in painful contrast to her neighbors, who have already completed their plantings.
"We were the only ones dumb enough to have tried to do everything right," said Mrs. Sainz, who added that in her 65 years on the ranch, acquired by her grandfather a century ago, she had seen but two salamanders. "We've had to sit here and watch everyone else put their grapes in," she said. "I feel betrayed."
This, however, is not the first confrontation over the changes in the land. Even before the homely salamander lumbered into the picture, there were bitter disputes over the uprooting of California live oaks for vineyards, over the way some some slopes were being bulldozed and over events like weddings and concerts that some wineries had tried to hold.
The battles have produced distrust. Environmental groups and officials say that the emergency listing of the salamander was necessary because money-hungry farmers were planning huge plantings of vines that would have wiped out the fragile salamander habitats.
"It became evident that with the rapid rate of land conversions there was a distinct possibility that there was a real threat to the population and possibly even extinction," said Carl Benz of the Fish and Wildlife Service.
The farmers call that bunk and say that the ill-planned listing of the salamander has paralyzed not just those converting to grapes but also some growers who have raised crops like broccoli, strawberries and beans here for decades, with no apparent impact on the salamanders.
"They talk about stopping conversions, but I'm not planning to convert anything," said Jim Campbell, whose family has used its 1,200 acres near Lompoc for raising beef cattle and growing row crops for 75 years. "I have no doubt they're probably there on my land, although, if you can believe it, I've seen exactly one in my 65 years here. I have no desire to do anything to hurt the tiger salamander. It's the way they can shut you down with so little information. They treat you like a criminal on your own land."
Mr. Campbell, like many farmers, also harbors a suspicion that many of the conservationists are urban residents from the southern, wealthier end of Santa Barbara County, trying to preserve the open appearance of the land for aesthetic reasons. Indeed, at least part of the argument seems to be not who owns the land but who owns the landscape.
"I am enough of a biologist to tell you that a lot of this stuff about the salamanders is junk science," said Adam Firestone, the president of Firestone Vineyards, one of the oldest here. "The greatest threat to the salamanders is cars, not vineyards. But this has less to do with the species and more to do with the politics. That was true of the oaks, too. The problem really wasn't oaks. It was all about open space, this image some people have of the way the land should look."
Local political battles over development and conservation have generally followed the north-south split, and the county seat, based in the more populous south, has tended to favor the preservationists.
The board of supervisors has no official role in the emergency listing, but its chairman wrote to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt pleading that efforts be made not to disrupt traditional farming just weeks before the planting, and that the government work more quickly to define what land needs to be set aside and how the habitat should be preserved so growers can go about their business.
This is not the first time that economic changes have affected this countryside. Sixty years ago, it was a major oil-producing region. Most of the reservoirs are dry, but there are many old wells still pumping, some of them in the middle of vineyards.
When the oil companies began selling off huge tracts of land, much of it was bought by ranchers, who raised cattle and horses and, in several waves of what Mr. Firestone calls "fantasy farming," fad livestock like Arabian horses and ostriches. Many old oil-company tracts are now vineyards -- at a steep investment price, since it can cost more than $10,000 an acre for the land and an additional $30,000 or so an acre to plant a field.
The first explosion of resistance came three years ago when Kendall-Jackson acquired the 1,300-acre Barham Ranch and planted 700 acres of grapes. In the process, the company bulldozed about 900 live oaks, the majestic, spreading trees that embellish the landscape. In perhaps the worst affront, the land was right along Highway 101, the principal road through the area.
The company was pilloried by environmental groups, and it eventually agreed to plant hundreds of trees elsewhere. Jim Caudill, a spokesman for the company, said that it had uprooted only about 10 percent of the oaks, or roughly a tree and a half an acre, and some of those were dead or dying. But he acknowledged that it had been a humbling experience.
"From a technical point of view, we do everything differently now," Mr. Caudill said.
Many vineyards now leave some oaks, despite the expense and the problems they create for machinery.
"The oaks give a lot of character to the vineyards," said Kevin Merrill, whose family has farmed here for seven generations and who now manages Premiere Coastal Vineyard. "And they are also good nesting grounds for the birds that keep the squirrels down. It's a plus to leave them, and we do, but we don't get much credit for that."
One of the most frustrating aspects of the salamander listing for the farmers and ranchers is that the animals are so little understood. Dr. Sam Sweet, a biologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, is an expert on them and an adviser to the government. He acknowledged that the creatures are enigmatic.
He described them as having the intelligence "of a wet sponge." Most of their lives are spent underground, in the burrows of ground squirrels or gophers. What they eat exactly is not known. It is not known why the squirrels tolerate their company in the close quarters of a dark tunnel.
What is known is that they make their way to the vernal ponds to mate when it is cold and pouring rain.
"You go out on the most miserable night of the year, maybe around midnight, and that's when you find them," he said.
The farmers have savaged the government's listing on the grounds that, with so little known, efforts to set aside hundreds if not thousands of acres of habitat amount to irresponsible guesswork. That argument angers environmentalists, who say the lack of understanding is that much more reason for preservation efforts to be swift and broad.
But farmers wonder why a species that lives on the cusp of obscurity in the best of times, that mates in ponds that exist for only a few months a year, if at all, is so important.
"It's the canary in the mine syndrome," said Paul W. Collins, a biologist at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. "If the salamanders go it tells you something is fundamentally wrong with the ecosystem."
The debate has made some environmental advocates nostalgic for the oil companies, and highlighted the question of where capitalism ends and the public interest begins.
"We've always had a special feeling for the salamanders," Mrs. Sainz said as she shared her views while watching a coyote chase and catch a squirrel on the brow of a nearby hill. "I'm proud to have them here, and I'm proud that I told the museum about them. The problem is the laws and the way they are used. The salamanders have never been threatened on this property, and I've told them I'll set aside over 100 acres so they won't be disturbed. The question is if you can be allowed to make a living on your property."

HEADLINE: Analysts See Risk for Microsoft, But Gates Hopes to Win Appeal

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR and JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
With the collapse of settlement talks in its federal antitrust case, Microsoft finds itself facing a harsh legal road ahead that threatens to embolden private litigants, depress the company's stock price and erode its dominant influence in computing, according to industry analysts.
"Microsoft is now back in the legal quagmire, and nothing good is going to happen to the company anytime soon," said David Readerman, a managing director at Thomas Weisel Partners, a technology investment firm in San Francisco. 
 Yet at Microsoft's corporate campus in Redmond, Wash., there is no evidence of panic. Its executive team, led by William H. Gates, the chairman, is taking the long view, planning to battle the antitrust case in the courts through appeals for years, if necessary.
"We absolutely believe that the judicial system will ultimately rule in our favor," Mr. Gates said in an interview yesterday. And for Microsoft, the risks of that course clearly seemed preferable to offering further concessions in the mediation efforts abandoned on Saturday.
Microsoft's plight could also possibly be altered by this year's presidential election. A Republican administration and a new set of political appointees heading the Justice Department could take a different view of the case, and George W. Bush has said he believes antitrust enforcement should be confined mainly to combating price fixing.
Microsoft's corporate reputation has been tarnished repeatedly during the long-running antitrust suit, filed in May 1998, which accuses the big software maker of being a bullying monopolist that has stifled competition. In his findings of fact last November, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson largely agreed with the case presented by the Justice Department and 19 states.
Yet the more indelible legal blow will come within days, as Judge Jackson makes his finding of legal liability. The judge's conclusions of law will surely find that Microsoft violated the nation's antitrust laws, though it remains uncertain how sweeping his ruling will be.
If the sides had reached an out-of-court settlement, Judge Jackson's strongly worded findings of fact could have been pulled off the table. But a legal ruling cannot -- and both it and the findings of fact become a permanent part of the legal record of the case.
And that legal record -- a finding of monopoly power and abuse of that power -- will make it easier for companies and class-action lawyers to bring cases against Microsoft. Already, dozens of class-action suits have been filed against the company.
"Microsoft is in for a bumpy ride over the next several months, as it will face an energized group of private litigants," observed William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University law school.
After Judge Jackson rules, he will then move to consider what sanctions, or remedial steps, should be ordered. The suggested remedies range from forcing Microsoft to alter its business practices to breaking up the company.
The judge can ask for papers from experts, and he can call witnesses. The court-ordered remedies and Judge Jackson's final order may not be filed until the end of the summer. Until then, in theory, the two sides can still settle, a possibility that seems remote. Microsoft will almost certainly appeal the ruling to the federal appeals court, and possibly to the Supreme Court. Those appeals could take a year or two.
The uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the case, industry experts say, could well slow down Microsoft at a time when the center of gravity in computing is increasingly moving beyond the personal computer, Microsoft's stronghold, and toward the Internet, where the company faces far more competition.
In the Internet arena, they note, Microsoft is forging partnerships with companies in many industries, from cable television to telecommunications, to ensure that its software is used on a widening array of Internet-connected devices. But those efforts could be hampered if potential partners have questions about Microsoft's future.
"As long as this case hangs over Microsoft, it will affect its influence in the marketplace," said David Yoffie, a Harvard Business School professor. "It just reduces Microsoft's credibility, its ability to set technology standards as it has in the past."
Microsoft has no illusions about its near-term prospects in the courts. In an e-mail message on Saturday to Microsoft employees informing them of the breakdown in the settlement talks, for which he blamed "divisions and extreme views on the other side," Mr. Gates wrote that Judge Jackson would announce his legal judgment as soon as Monday and "we don't expect the ruling to be favorable to Microsoft."
William Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, said yesterday: "We're not giving up in this court, but we think this is toward the high-water mark for the government. We'd rather be in the appeals court, and we're confident about our prospects."
Legal experts say there is almost no chance that Judge Jackson's judgment, which they believe will find Microsoft repeatedly violated the law, can be reversed entirely. "Microsoft's bet seems to be that through a process of attrition on appeal Judge Jackson's decision is narrowed in scope considerably," Mr. Kovacic, the law school professor, noted. "The result would still be a government victory, but one that supports a remedy that is not very drastic."
Microsoft also faces a wave of private litigation, including dozens of class-action suits. A strong ruling by Judge Jackson would simplify the task of winning such cases, according to Terry Gross, a lawyer in San Francisco involved in a class-action suit against Microsoft. Most of the class-action suits are on behalf of individuals and companies that say Microsoft charged too much for its industry-standard Windows operating system.
In the legal opinion, Mr. Gross said lawyers involved in the class-action litigation would be looking most closely for what Judge Jackson says, if anything, on Microsoft as a monopolist overcharging consumers for Windows.
Microsoft recognizes that the class-action suits could be costly and time consuming, but it is confident it can win them. As it has throughout the federal suit, Microsoft says the price it charges for Windows is a small percentage of the price of a PC and is far below what a garden-variety monopolist could charge.
"These class-action cases are just piling on," Mr. Gates said. "There is no economic theory to show that ours was not the most aggressive price for Windows. We've taken the high-volume, low-cost approach. And we've acted as a restraint on the prices of other operating system companies."
Because the government antitrust case focuses mainly on accusations that Microsoft bullied industry partners and rivals to favor its software, some legal experts said that Judge Jackson's legal decision might be most useful to rival software companies in private antitrust suits.
In Silicon Valley, home to many Microsoft rivals, the ruling is likely to be read closely in many corporate legal departments. "Any private company that thinks it has a beef ought to test it in court," said Scott McNealy, the chairman of Sun Microsystems, a Microsoft rival. "Now, you will just need to prove that they did something to you and then figure out what the cost was."
In Silicon Valley, there was some relief that the settlement talks had collapsed. On Friday evening, some senior computer executives who were read a summary of a government proposal became alarmed that the proposal was too limited and would prove difficult to enforce. Mr. McNealy and Steven P. Jobs, the chairman of Apple Computer, were read elements of the proposed settlement and expressed their dissatisfaction to some government officials.
"What I heard was worse than weak," Mr. McNealy said.
Another executive said the result "would have been a landslide for Microsoft."
In recent months, the Justice Department and the states have talked to industry executives, including several Microsoft rivals, about a range of possible remedies in the Microsoft case. But the government officials say this is mainly information-gathering process rather than seeking their approval.
Yet within Microsoft, there has long been the hardened view that the antitrust suit was largely the work of its enemies, who convinced the Justice Department and the states to pursue the company. "Leaking settlement proposals to companies raises the question of who this lawsuit is for," Mr. Gates said.
Government officials scoff at the notion that they are doing anything but enforcing the law. "The facts of this case speak for themselves," one government lawyer said, "and the facts show that Microsoft has clearly and repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws."

HEADLINE: Not-So-Rich Get a Hand On Housing In Westchester;
Above Library, a Rarity: Subsidized Apartments

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

DATELINE: IRVINGTON, N.Y., April 2

 BODY:
Vincent Astuto, Irena Korneva, Michelle Piacintino and Marc Jacoby had no realistic chance of settling in this Westchester County village, with its grand estates, sweeping river views and a median family income of nearly $100,000.
Mr. Astuto was still under his parents' roof at age 31, unable to pay his own way on an ambulance driver's salary. Ms. Korneva, easing off welfare, was living in Dutchess County, enrolling in school in White Plains, and sure that the only subsidized housing in Westchester would be in a slum. 
 Mrs. Piacintino, a newlywed whose father is the village fire inspector, figured she would have to move because there was no way she could afford Irvington on her income as a manicurist and her husband's as an attendant at a laundry.
And Mr. Jacoby, with a family of four, was barely hanging on here with a patchwork of jobs teaching music at day care and recreation centers.
"I'd watch people go off on the train to New York City to make six figures while I was singing 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star' to their children," said Mr. Jacoby, known locally as Marc the Music Man. "There was a huge amount of economic pressure to leave this town."
Now, though, Mr. Jacoby and the others live here, in river-view apartments in a historic building that was once home to a greenhouse manufacturer. The apartments were, in effect, an afterthought to a plan for a new library, which was financed partly with government tax credits for affordable housing.
The $7 million project, combining the library and 22 apartments, is a collaboration between a developer, a nonprofit foundation, the village, the county, the state and the federal government.
It blends the passions and talents of Brahmins and Buddhists, environmentalists and accountants. And, experts say, it sets a new standard in Westchester County, one of the wealthiest in the nation, where many communities have gone out of their way to avoid building housing for all but the rich.
According to a report this month by the Westchester County Housing Opportunity Commission, 20 of the 43 municipalities in the county have not built a single affordable housing unit this decade and 19 have not endorsed the county's modest and nonbinding goals for each community. There are 97 applicants for every new affordable housing unit in Westchester, the report said, and 15,000 people on the waiting list for federally subsidized housing for the poor.
"Affordable housing" is no vague euphemism in wealthy suburbs; rather it is a category designed to make it possible for village employees, the elderly and the children of longtime residents to remain in communities with steadily rising housing prices. Eligibility is based on a percentage of the county's median income, for this project 50 percent to 60 percent. "Low income" housing, by comparison, is available to those who earn 30 percent of the median or less.
Neither category is popular with developers.
"Private developers don't want to build, because there's not much money in it, and neither do municipalities because existing homeowners say, 'We made it; let's stay the way we are,' " said Norman Glickman, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, which aided Westchester County in setting its goals.
New Jersey, Professor Glickman said, is thought to be the only state to require municipalities to build affordable housing, or pay for it in nearby communities, under the terms of two State Supreme Court rulings, in 1975 and 1983, known as the Mount Laurel decisions.
The situation in Westchester, he said, is more common, with county officials in a "bully pulpit situation," limited to exhorting municipalities and offering technical assistance and government money.
Irvington, a village of 6,348 people, accepted affordable housing as a means to an end: the new library and the restoration of the Burnham Building, listed in the National Register of Historic Places, where greenhouses and conservatories were built for the New York Botanical Garden, Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and Lyndhurst, Jay Gould's estate in Tarrytown, N.Y.
The impetus was the library board. The library had outgrown its quarters and the board approached the village eight years ago with a proposal to buy the derelict factory, at the foot of Main Street. The board negotiated the price down to $750,000 from $1.5 million, and the village passed a referendum to go forward.
But nobody had a clue where the money would come from to restore and develop the building, or what would be done with the upper floors. "I found myself wondering what we had gotten ourselves into," said Stephen A. McCabe, the village administrator.
The first developer could not come up with a viable plan. So the village turned to Jonathan F. P. Rose, a scion of the New York City real estate and philanthropic dynasty, who is president of the Affordable Housing Development Corporation in Katonah, N.Y.
Mr. Rose cobbled together a financial package that includes equity, tax credits, grants and loans. Of the $4.6 million needed for the housing, nearly half came from corporations that buy tax credits in affordable housing projects, which entitles them to a dollar-for-dollar income tax benefit.
The library side of the project, which cost $2.4 million, depended heavily on private donations. One in five families here, or 2,500 households, gave a total of $1.4 million. Mary Morrisett, the president of the library board, was flabbergasted by how easy her task seemed on her very first fund-raising call. She made her pitch to three couples. Each pledged $100,000.
The primary beneficiaries of Mr. Rose's expertise and Mrs. Morrisett's powers of persuasion are the tenants, selected according to income eligibility standards (most earn 50 percent of the county median income, which at the time of selection was $79,900 for a family of four) and a point system that favors local residents. Six units were earmarked for people on the county waiting list for Section 8 housing, subsidized by the federal government.
The tenants, who moved in last summer, are amazed at their good fortune. In a village where the rare rental apartments go for around $2,000, the Piacintinos, for instance, pay $736 a month for a duplex with a spacious master suite. Mr. Astuto pays $763 for a gabled aerie with original yellow pine roof timbers and views from the Tappan Zee Bridge to the World Trade Center.
Mr. Jacoby and his wife, Mary, have a two-bedroom, two-bath unit, with river views and tongue-and-groove wainscoting, for $881. And Ms. Korneva pays nothing for her two-bedroom apartment, under the rules of Section 8 housing, until she is finished with her computer training and employed.
The library, too, is bustling with delighted patrons, used to the cramped nooks and crannies on the second floor of Village Hall. The gleaming new quarters, at 10,000 square feet three times larger than the old library, have state-of-the-art technology, access for the handicapped, a public meeting room with a kitchenette and amenities like infants' changing tables.
The restoration, by Stephen Tilly, an architect in nearby Dobbs Ferry, is but one element of Irvington's riverfront development. Old manufacturing buildings have become home to a tapas bar, a yoga studio, a day spa and an art gallery. A waterfront park, the village's second, is under construction. There is talk of condominiums and housing for the elderly on the far side of the railroad tracks.
Mr. Rose, who next plans a project in nearby Hastings, said that all his projects were intended to provide below-market-rate housing that is environmentally sound, and that Irvington officials embraced his philosophy.
The Burnham Building, as a historical restoration, is the quintessential recycling project. Its location, steps from the train station, encourages residents to use public transit. It is right on Main Street, walking distance from stores and the post office. And there are many so-called green elements in its construction, including triple-glazed windows and recycled cellulose insulation.
To select the tenants and manage the building, Mr. Rose chose the Greyston Foundation in Yonkers, a Buddhist-inspired organization, which began as a bakery and a Zen center and grew into a developer of housing and services for the homeless and people with AIDS.
Mr. McCabe, the village administrator, said he had worried that the community would resist the six Section 8 units, required by the county as a condition of financial support. In fact, he said, it was the candidates from the public assistance rolls who were wary of living here.
Ms. Korneva, for one, feared she would feel like an outsider among the wealthy, said Shelley Weintraub, who screened the tenants for the Greyston Foundation. Ms. Weintraub convinced Ms. Korneva, a Soviet refugee, that she owed her children the advantages of the Irvington school system.
All the river towns have working class neighborhoods along the Hudson, where descendants of the 19th- and early 20th-century factory workers remain. And, for the most part, it is these people, the elderly on fixed incomes and the young adults just getting started, who fill the remaining 16 apartments.
They earn $28,000 to $48,000 and include a 90-year-old man who had been living in an apartment that Ms. Weintraub described as a firetrap, a school janitor who is also a volunteer firefighter, and a bank teller.
The Jacobys have taken some criticism from envious friends. In another place, or another time, they would be solidly middle class. But this is Westchester in a gilded age.
Mr. Jacoby said the family was "totally thrilled" on two counts. First, because he views his selection as a salute to his role in the lives of Irvington's children.
"I don't view this as someone subsidizing my life," he said. "I serve my community."
And second because his own boys, 9 and 10 years old, will have the experience of growing up with truly disadvantaged children.
"My only misgiving about living here is there is not enough diversity," Mr. Jacoby said. "I like that my kids will see more of that, be a part of it."

To the Editor:
 I found Paul Krugman's March 29 column, "Pursuing Happiness," interesting mostly because of its shortsightedness. Mr. Krugman argues that although he is not totally enamored of the American system, it "still takes the prize." Yet I can't imagine what prize he is talking about.
The gap between rich and poor continues to widen, and more people than ever are counted as part of the working poor, the unemployed and the imprisoned. True, other countries suffer worse; however, to say that our system is simply the best and leave it at that is unwise. Our lives are fleeting, and this period in history is a mere blip on the screen. 
 The Romans once thought their system took the prize, as did the English when the power and influence of their empire was unquestioned. Only time will tell whether the American system truly has merit or whether in years to come history will judge it harshly.

To the Editor:
 In "Pursuing Happiness" (column, March 29), there is an ingenious argument against the "living wage" movement's call for a higher minimum wage. Since researchers have found that money cannot buy happiness -- or at best, only a little bit -- increasing the minimum wage would be counterproductive. The unhappiness of people laid off as a result would outweigh the tiny increase in happiness gained by those still able to work. 
 Whether unemployment would increase is a question for the economists. But the aim of increasing the minimum wage is not to give people the luxury of "more happiness." It is to ensure that no one working full time will fall below the poverty line. That way, people can be unhappy about where they'll find the money for their children's braces instead of where they'll find the money for their children's food.

 Before we think that the hesitation of the French before the prospect of "capitalisme sauvage" -- and the associated willingness to tolerate a high unemployment rate -- is simple irrationality (column, March 29), we might note that the rate of child poverty in the United States, at about one in five, is more than three times higher than that of France, at 1 in 15. 
 I suggest that before we hand out any prizes to various countries' economies, we might wish to examine a wider selection of indicators.

Salamander Versus Farmers
The government's emergency listing of the California tiger salamander as an endangered species has set off the latest battle over development in northern Santa Barbara County.

To the Editor:
"Day Care at Night? New York Lags Behind" (front page, April 2) underscores the critical need for more high-quality and affordable child care for families from all socio-economic levels. 
 More parents are working outside the home, and this trend is likely to increase. We must significantly increase the compensation of America's child care workers, the vast majority of whom are being paid little more than minimum wage.
In addition, we must support child care that will have the flexibility to match the needs of working parents in the new information economy.

To the Editor:
Despite Thomas L. Friedman's admonitions (column, March 31), the World Bank and International Monetary Fund are hardly "bit players" in the world economy. Together, they are responsible for development schemes and austerity measures that have been a disaster for much of the world. 
 Genuinely responding to the crisis of the poorer parts of the world requires dialogue about how international financial power is organized, and the highly disproportionate role played by the United States in important decisions. The meetings of these organizations should be protested for their secrecy and fixation on monetary issues at the expense of human well-being.

HEADLINE: Clinton Stumps for Chinese Trade Pact

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., April 3

 BODY:
President Clinton took his lobbying campaign for a decisive Chinese trade agreement to Silicon Valley today and rallied the support of high-tech executives as he made the case that China cannot resist the liberalizing influences of the Internet.
"There's no question China has been trying to crack down on the Internet," Mr. Clinton said. "Good luck." 
 Mr. Clinton said the Chinese leadership clearly understands how the Internet age may "threaten the old order," and said that is "proof that we should keep going in this direction, not that we should hold back."
As he tries to sway reluctant House members in both parties to clear the way for China to enter the World Trade Organization, Mr. Clinton received today what his aides have been seeking for weeks: a Congressional commitment to hold a vote on a bill granting China permanent normal trade relations with the United States.
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said today that the legislation would be taken up by May 29, when the House breaks for a weeklong Memorial Day recess. The bill faces easier prospects of passage in the Senate.
Mr. Clinton also praised the support of the governors of 40 of the 50 states, plus Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and American Somoa. From the high-tech industry, he released a letter from nearly 200 chief executive officers who are backing the trade agreement, including those at Microsoft, Compaq, Lucent Technologies and Xerox.
Those executives said in a letter to lawmakers that giving China upgraded trade status is "the most critical vote you will make in support of our high technology industries this year." The United States promised to work to grant China permanent trading rights as part of a sweeping trade accord it negotiated as part of China's effort to join the W.T.O.
White House vote counters say the outcome could still go either way in the House, depending on the decisions of scores of uncommitted lawmakers in both parties. To sway them, Mr. Clinton is focusing on Democrats in safe seats who are close to the high-tech industry and can resist the entreaties of labor unions, many of which have sharply criticized the trade measure as detrimental to the interests of American workers.
The White House has also sought to generate support among members of Congress who represent districts with heavy agricultural interests because the trade accord frees up trade in many farm products.
A vote in May, backers say, would allow the issue to be decided before the arguments become bogged down in the national political conventions.
Speaking today at the Tech Museum of Innovation, Mr. Clinton said: "This vote by Congress is on an agreement that lowers no American trade barriers, lowers no American tariffs, grants no greater access to China to any part of the American economy -- nothing, zip, zilch, nada, zero. On the other hand, Chinese tariffs will fall by more than half over five years in every sector -- from telecommunications to automobiles to agriculture."
Backers of the deal received an important new convert today: Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of San Jose and a leader in the House Democrats' outreach effort to the burgeoning high-tech industry.
"Free markets cannot prosper in authoritarian regimes, and in a global world authoritarian regimes cannot waltz by the impact of freedom and free markets," said Ms. Lofgren, who had been undecided on the issue and was being pressured by both supporters and opponents.
Mr. Clinton praised her statement of support as "a brave announcement" and urged other lawmakers to follow her lead. "If we do this, 20 years from now we will wonder why we ever had a serious debate about it," Mr. Clinton said. "If we don't do it, 20 years from now we'll still be kicking ourselves for being so dumb. And there is no point in my being delicate about this. I think this is a big deal."

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 3

 BODY:
Americans bought new cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles at a sizzling pace last month, closing out the best quarter ever for the auto industry as the nation's economy appeared to be following up a winter of brisk economic growth with a springtime of continued strong expansion.
Ford Motor said today that its sales in the United States leaped 7.2 percent from a year earlier to the highest level ever for a single month. Four other big automakers had their best March ever: DaimlerChrysler, up 4.4 percent from last year; Toyota, up 16 percent; Honda, up 20.3 percent; and Mitsubishi, up 25.4 percent. 
 The industry's overall pace of sales rose nearly 9 percent from a year earlier, but did not set a record and was a little weaker than in February. The reason was simple: General Motors offered generous discount coupons in February which produced a sharp jump in sales then, followed by weaker sales last month. G.M.'s sales climbed just 1 percent in March from a year earlier.
Ward's Auto Infobank, a data research firm, estimated that G.M.'s market share fell last month to 27.4 percent, well below the company's target of 30 percent. Paul Ballew, G.M.'s general director for global market and industry analysis, said that sales last month suffered because of the marketing campaign in February. The campaign was aimed at existing owners of G.M. automobiles, who tend to buy G.M. models sooner or later and sometimes time their purchases to take advantage of discounts.
The automakers' announcements today of robust auto sales coincided with the release of a national survey by the National Association of Purchasing Managers, which also showed that the economy continued to grow vigorously last month.
Auto sales and the purchasing managers' survey are usually the first statistics released each month about the strength of the economy the month before. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has long watched auto sales particularly closely, having first earned his reputation as an economic forecaster in the 1950's and 1960's while specializing in the steel and auto industries.
Diane C. Swonk, a senior vice president and chief economist at the Bank One Corporation, said that rising interest rates and higher gasoline prices seemed to be having little effect so far on the auto industry, traditionally a sector particularly sensitive to rates and gas prices. Battling for market share, automakers have been offering low rates on auto loans, thereby insulating their customers so far from the Fed's attempts to raise short-term rates and slow economic growth to a more sustainable level
"Vehicle sales are one of the primary reasons why consumer spending seems to be accelerating even from the frenzied pace of the fourth quarter," Ms. Swonk said. "It does up the ante in terms of how far the Fed has to go when the automakers are offering 0.9 percent financing."
Mark M. Cornelius, the president of Morgan & Company Inc., an auto forecasting and consulting company in West Olive, Mich., estimated that for March alone, the industry's sales rose 8.3 percent from a year earlier, running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17.8 million.
The overall first quarter was even better. Mr. Ballew, G.M.'s senior market analyst, said that the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales for all of the first quarter was about 18.5 million automobiles, beating the previous record of 18.2 million, set in the third quarter of last year. He predicted that sales would moderate somewhat by the end of this year, particularly because of the Fed's actions, but said that the moderation would not turn into a sharp downturn.
The steep increase in gasoline prices during March appeared to have little effect on the types of automobiles that Americans wanted to buy. Sales of minivans soared while sales of full-size sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks were fairly strong. There was some weakness in sales of small pickups, which tend to be the most fuel-efficient light trucks, although they still get much worse gas mileage than cars.
Mr. Ballew said that gains in market share would slow somewhat for these vehicles over the next few years, as most automakers, with the exception of G.M., have slowed their introductions of such models. "Some of the extraordinary shifts we've seen in the last 10 years are beginning to ebb a bit," he said.
Nissan's sales rose 23.4 percent last month from a year earlier, although it was not the company's best March ever. Subaru posted its best March since 1989, with a 4.7 percent gain, while Volkswagen had its best March since 1979, with a 19.6 percent increase.

HEADLINE: U.S. Ready for Much Larger Security Council

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 3

 BODY:
After years of trying to hold the 15-member Security Council to what it considers a manageable size, the United States is prepared to drop its insistence that the limit should be 20 or 21 seats in any expansion, Richard C. Holbrooke, the American ambassador to the United Nations, told a General Assembly working group today.
Mr. Holbrooke, who did not suggest an upper number, is facing an uphill battle to reduce American dues to the organization. And the issue of Security Council size is important for dozens of new members, whose ambassadors here contend that the council no longer represents the world. 
 The five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- have held those positions since 1945, when the United Nations had 51 members. The 10 rotating seats are shared by 183 other countries, some of which are unlikely ever to have a chance at council membership. The rotating seats are held for two years, with five new members elected each year to maintain overlap.
The council, something of a United Nations cabinet of countries, is the only body that can call for enforcement of its decisions by military means, if necessary.
Several years of sometimes rancorous debate in an open-ended working group -- envoys call it the "never-ending working group" -- have failed to bring any voluntary changes in membership. Europe, for example, can also hold one or two rotating seats in addition to its three permanent ones, if Russia is counted. And many nations say the time has come to discuss one or two permanent seats for the European Union, to be apportioned as they choose. France and Britain are resolutely opposed.
The situation is further complicated by German and Italian demands for permanent seats, which carry veto powers. Japan is also campaigning for a permanent place, citing its high level of contributions and the need for a democratic free-market Asian voice among the most powerful nations.
Most delegations say the council is out of date in not giving enough seats -- and no permanent seats -- to the developing countries that form a substantial numerical majority in the General Assembly. Those nations themselves are a long way from deciding which would hold seats if the number is increased.
India desperately wants one. But Indonesia and maybe even Korea may also still be in the running from Asia. Africa has an abundance of candidates, among them Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa. In Latin America, Brazil and Mexico, and possibly Argentina or even Chile, would be among the competitors.
When Bill Richardson, now energy secretary, was the ambassador here, he suggested an additional five seats, for Germany, Japan and three developing nations. That would put the membership at 20.
Now members are proposing a body as large as 28 members, nearly double its present size.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
Market Intervention by Japan Sends Yen Down vs. Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Japanese yen posted its biggest decline in 10 months against the dollar and sank against the euro after the nation's central bank sold yen in an effort to keep exports competitive and a modest economic recovery on track.
The bank's move followed a surge of nearly 4 percent against the dollar last week and came after the bank's quarterly survey of business confidence, the tankan, showed somewhat greater optimism. 
 The currency sales drove the yen as weak as 105.65 to the dollar compared with 102.64 late Friday, and to 100.7 to the euro, from 98.19. In New York trading, the yen rebounded somewhat, settling at 104.85 to the dollar.
David Durrant, a currency strategist at Bank Julius Baer, said of the Japanese central bank: "The message is definitely that rapid appreciation is not in their best interest. There's no question they were not appreciative of what had happened on Friday."
The yen surged then on speculation that the tankan survey would point to a pickup in growth in Japan's economy in coming months, drawing investors.
The survey's headline number, which gauges confidence among big manufacturers, matched expectations today and showed improvement from the previous report in December. Yet it remained negative, at -9, from -17 in December, meaning that more businesses were pessimistic about their prospects than optimistic.
The disclosure that Japan's prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, was in a coma after having suffered a stroke had little immediate effect, but the political uncertainties could hurt the yen in coming weeks, traders said. The chief cabinet secretary, Mikio Aoki, is serving for now as acting prime minister.
The developments could hurt the yen if they make it more difficult for Japan to introduce new spending in case the economy slows, Mr. Durrant of Bank Julius Baer said.
The central bank began the new fiscal year by selling an estimated $5 billion worth of yen immediately after it released the tankan survey. A sharp rise in the currency's value is unwelcome as it could slow the economy by making exports more expensive and eroding returns on overseas securities held by Japanese investors.

HEADLINE: No Signs of Slowing Economy As Manufacturing Expands

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
Manufacturing expanded for a 14th consecutive month in March, while rising costs for oil and other raw materials pushed an index of prices paid by factories to its highest in five years, an industry survey showed.
"There's no evidence of slowing in the economy," which entered a record 10th year of expansion in April, Tim O'Neill, chief economist at Harris Bank and Bank of Montreal, said today. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management said its monthly factory index was 55.8 last month, as gauges of production and inventories rose. While the March number was down from 56.9 in February, any index reading above 50 indicates an expansion.
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that construction spending rose 1.5 percent in February, to a record annual rate of $758.7 billion.
Together, the reports add to evidence that five Federal Reserve interest rate increases since June have not yet slowed growth, analysts said. "When the economy's on a roll, you're going to have to put down more than a couple of rate increases to slow it," Mr. O'Neill said. "There's no question the Fed's got its work cut out for it."
The purchasing managers' prices-paid index rose to 79.8 in March from 74.1 during February -- mostly reflecting oil costs, which have declined since midmonth. The March reading was the highest since 81.7 in February 1995.
Overall readings above 50 mean the number of manufacturers saying business improved is greater than the number saying it deteriorated. The index has now been at 50 or higher since February 1999. Asian and Latin American economies have recovered from a currency crisis that began in 1997, and that has led factories to crank up to supply overseas buyers in addition to United States consumers.
The new-orders index, a gauge of current demand, fell to 56.9 in March from 60.5 in February. The employment index also fell, to 51.5 from 53.2.
The production index increased, with a reading of 61.8 the highest since June. The index had been 61.3. The inventory index, a measure of pent-up demand, rose to 48.4 in March from 45.2 during February.
The February increase in construction spending reflected stepped-up work on new single-family homes and office buildings. In January, spending rose a revised 2.2 percent, to a $747.6 billion annual rate, previously reported as a 2.7 percent gain. Analysts expected February spending to fall 0.1 percent, to $751 billion.
The level of the prices-paid index suggests that companies are still being affected by higher oil costs. Crude oil futures for May delivery traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange surged to $32.48 on March 7, the highest since November 1990, though futures have been below $30 a barrel since March 13.
The report also noted increases in metals, chemicals and plastics. "Those are also influenced by demand," said Norbert Ore, chairman of the purchasing managers' group.
Even so, "it's kind of hard to say" when consumers will be paying more, Mr. Ore said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Competitors of Telmex Say It Still Acts Like a Monopoly

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, April 3

 BODY:
If any company represents the marriage of Mexico and modern business, it is Telefonos de Mexico, the telecommunications giant that towers over its industry at home and is the Mexican stock that Wall Street investors love to own.
Since it was sold by the government a decade ago to a private consortium headed by Carlos Slim Helu, now Latin America's wealthiest man, Telmex more than any other enterprise has symbolized Mexico's passage from an inward-looking state-controlled economy to a thriving globalized free market. 
 And since the former monopoly was forced to face competition in both long distance and recently in local service, the government has cited the opening as an example of its commitment to free trade and attracting foreign investment.
But United States companies that took Mexico at its word and tried to challenge Telmex in long distance say they have hit a wall raised by a powerful conglomerate that presses many lingering monopoly advantages and subdues the regulators who are supposed to impose discipline. This clash has forged an improbable alliance between two of the biggest phone competitors in the United States, AT&T and MCI Worldcom, which find themselves underdogs in Mexico.
In a report released on Friday, the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said she was seriously concerned about what she called regulatory failures in Mexico, and she said that Telmex was "inhibiting the creation" of telecommunications competition.
Because Telmex is the flagship of this country's privatization process, its apparent reluctance to play on a level field, and the soft-spoken approach of Mexican regulators to the problem, have cast a shadow on President Ernesto Zedillo's often-stated pledge to honor open-border economics.
Telmex has also provided a close-up view of Mr. Slim's business style. As a financier he is an acknowledged master of bargain spotting and management turnaround, recently demonstrated by his purchase of Prodigy, the foundering American Internet service provider, which he transformed in two years into a booming Latin American Web channel. But his competitors say that with Telmex, the heart of his empire, Mr. Slim has proved to be a hardball tactician who exploits the advantages afforded by the company's holdover monopoly status.
Telmex officials reject suggestions that the company does not play fair. They attribute their long-distance competitors' hardships to less-than-expert management and inexperience with the Mexican market.
"We have made concession after concession to create a healthy market," said Arturo Elias Ayub, a senior official and the company's spokesman. "But they are never happy. They always want more."
Telmex and top regulators agree that Mexico has opened itself to telecommunications competition at unusual speed. "Given the progress of regulation and the penetration of the competitors," said Jorge Nicolin, director of the Federal Telecommunications Commission, "our opening compares very favorably with other countries. The competitors are here. They're working."
This is not a dispute between a leading Mexican company and foreign interlopers, although it is often presented that way in the Mexican press. While Mr. Slim and a small group of other Mexican investors control 51 percent of Telmex, much of the rest is evenly divided between SBC International, a subsidiary of SBC Communications, and France Telecom.
Avantel, MCI Worldcom's long-distance company in Mexico, is 55 percent-owned by Banacci, a large Mexican bank. AT&T holds 49 percent of its Mexican affiliate Alestra, while 51 percent is split between Grupo Alfa, a manufacturing conglomerate, and Bancomer, another large Mexican bank.
The confrontation is drawn between an alliance of newcomers to Mexico's telecommunications industry and Mr. Slim, an established figure with a broad hold on Mexican business. Mr. Slim's properties now account for more than half of the value of the companies in the main Mexican stock index.
After three years of competition, Telmex still has about 75 percent of the $4.4 billion long-distance market while eight competitors share the rest. Avantel and Alestra each have about 10 percent. Between them, they have invested more than $2 billion.
The core dispute is over the cost of linking calls from Telmex's local lines to the competitors' long-distance networks. The cost of these connections has continued to rise while the rates companies charge have slid. "They caught us in a pincer action," said Francisco Gil Diaz, the chief operating officer of Avantel. Both Avantel and Alestra said they pay about 60 percent of their revenue directly to Telmex.
Connection costs keep rising because they are pegged by regulation to inflation. In addition, the smaller companies argue that the rates they pay to Telmex were set at artificially high levels by regulators. Mexico pledged, when it first set the rules for long-distance competition, to promptly bring those rates down, close to the cost of providing the service. That has not happened.
The competitors contend that Telmex has pushed down rates to its own customers by subsidizing its long-distance service with the generous cash flow from its local business and with discounts written into big commercial contracts.
They also say that Telmex has subjected its competitors to crippling failures of service. Both Avantel and Alestra rely on Telmex to provide special high-traffic lines that carry Internet and corporate data. For nine months, Telmex stopped providing these lines, on the grounds that the competitors had failed to pay back bills. The Mexican regulator took no effective action. In January, the Federal Communications Commission levied a $100,000 fine on Telmex based on the damage to customers in the United States.
At one point, Mr. Gil Diaz said, Telmex disconnected 40 of his best business customers to force Avantel to pay disputed bills. Two years ago, Avantel tried to introduce a service allowing Mexicans to make long-distance calls from public phones using prepaid cards. Telmex refused to give Avantel a free number for the calls to go through.
Mr. Nicolin, the regulator, agreed that the competitors' costs are too high. But he said that his agency had been restrained from acting by aggressive legal challenges from Telmex.
Last week, at least a year after he was expected to act, Mr. Nicolin issued special rules governing Telmex, intended to bring down costs and improve service. Mr. Elias, the phone company's spokesman, said Telmex will "fight very hard" in the courts against the regulator's new rules, which he said were intended "to tie Telmex's hands and feet."
But Frank Voytek, AT&T's representative on Alestra's board, sees matters differently. "Our expectation when we made our investment," he said, "was that the regulator would enforce the regulations."

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: THE GOVERNMENT;
U.S. to Examine Remedies That Fit the Offense

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
Ebullient over their legal victory against Microsoft, Justice Department antitrust officials said today that they would examine possible remedies to put an end to what a federal judge described as the giant software company's monopolistic practices.
In his ruling, United States District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson wrote that Microsoft violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. His decision will provide the basis for further court hearings -- and possibly settlement negotiations -- to determine what legal remedies to impose on Microsoft. The company said it would appeal. 
 At a news conference, Joel I. Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, offered little indication of what specific steps government lawyers would recommend to Judge Jackson, who must decide on any sanctions against the company.
"While no final decision has been made," Mr. Klein said, "the department is committed to finding a remedy that will protect consumers, innovation and competition by putting an end to Microsoft's widespread and persistent abuse of its monopoly power and to rectifying its unlawful attempt to monopolize the Internet browser market."
At the news conference, Attorney General Janet Reno expressed satisfaction over the ruling. "We are pleased," she said, "that the court agreed with the department that Microsoft abused its monopoly power, that it violated the antitrust laws, and that it harmed consumers. Microsoft has been held accountable for its illegal conduct by a court of law."
The decision, in a case argued by a team of lawyers headed by David Boies, the Justice Department's special counsel, was the culmination of the Clinton administration's most ambitious antitrust effort.
A spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic presidential candidate, said that Mr. Gore had no comment on the ruling. The vice president received an icy reception when he visited the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., last November. Mr. Gore did not explicitly embrace the antitrust action, but said then that "the values that are inherent in the antitrust laws are ones that are sound."
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the likely Republican candidate, said that as president he would "fully enforce antitrust laws," but he declined to discuss specifics of the case because it remained in litigation and would be appealed by Microsoft.
Mr. Klein said the ruling would bring positive change, adding, "It will benefit America's consumers by opening the door to competition, increased innovation and increased consumer choice in the software industry." He said the ruling "demonstrates once again that no company, no matter how powerful or how successful, can refuse to play by the rules, and thwart competition for America's consumers."
"Competition has been at the heart of America's economy," Mr. Klein added, "and protecting competition at the heart of antitrust enforcement for a long time."
Attorneys general for some of the states that joined in the federal government's case said they favored strict sanctions, which might include the breakup of Microsoft. Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, urged Judge Jackson to "adopt remedies that are as far-reaching and fundamental as Microsoft's abuses of its monopoly."

HEADLINE: Bickering in Albany Over Budget Grows on News of $1.6 Billion Surplus From the Last Year

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 3

 BODY:
Fighting over state spending and tax cuts escalated today after the New York State comptroller's office released a report showing that the state finished its fiscal year with a surplus of $1.6 billion.
The report on the fiscal year that ended on Friday was the latest evidence that the state's economy continues to grow at a strong pace, and generated nearly $750 million more in tax revenues than budget officials for Gov. George E. Pataki had originally predicted. 
 Republican and Democratic lawmakers welcomed the news, although it was not completely unexpected. Lawmakers from both parties argued that it bolstered their contention that the economy was robust enough to warrant spending more than the $76.8 billion that Mr. Pataki proposed in the budget he released earlier this year.
The report came as Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders from both parties remained deadlocked in negotiations over a new state budget. Adoption of the budget was due on Saturday, but Mr. Pataki and the leaders have been divided over how much money should be spent.
Days ago, the Republican governor was said to have reached an agreement with his chief Democratic rival in the Legislature, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, on an overall spending figure. That figure was $1.4 billion more than the governor originally proposed, though Mr. Silver was said to be asking for more money this evening.
But Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the Senate, has refused for days to agree to the apparent deal, saying that none of the additional $1.4 billion would further one of his priorities for the year: tax cuts.
Mr. Bruno, who was the governor's main ally in the Legislature until a few months ago, when the two had a falling out, is pushing a plan to enact an array of tax cuts that would total $1.2 billion when phased in over the next four years.
Mr. Pataki, a strong proponent of tax cuts himself, is generally supportive of the tax-cut plan. But the governor's aides say he is concerned about the impact the cuts would have in future years on the state's finances, particularly if there is an economic downturn.
Republicans who control the Senate renewed their call for tax cuts today, saying that the numbers released by the comptroller's office show that the economy is strong enough to enact their tax plan without creating long-term problems for the state.
In releasing the report, the comptroller, H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, assailed Mr. Pataki and the Legislature for failing to enact a timely budget. He said the strong economy, along with the unanticipated revenues, should make it easier to reach a timely budget deal.
Mr. McCall also said the additional money should not be spent hastily, suggesting that it be set aside to hedge against a slowing of the economy. "Sooner or later, the Wall Street-generated surpluses will end," he said. "This year's surplus must be used wisely to promote fiscal stability for the future."

HEADLINE: Despite a Stricken Leader, Japan Keeps a Level Head

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, April 4

 BODY:
The reaction to news that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was in the hospital was testament to the Japanese determination to maintain the "wa," the social harmony that this country so greatly prizes.
Although Mr. Obuchi lay in the hospital in serious condition, various economic developments caused the stock market to roar ahead to its highest level in three years. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index rose 1.9 percent to close on Monday at 20,726.99, and companies continued to churn out news releases outlining their plans for alliances, investments and new products. 
 Indeed, there was no panic when the market opened today, as investors seemed ready to continue their recent strategy of shifting money out of stocks tied to the "new economy" and into some of the lumbering giants that, by some measures, are undervalued. At midmorning, the Nikkei had given up almost half of Monday's gains, but that was attributed to the fall in the Nasdaq market in the United States.
That was in stark contrast to the gyrations that roiled the stock market in America when there was even a remote possibility that President Clinton might be impeached.
"The general view of the business world is that if the political vacuum is short, the influence on the economy will be limited," said Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of the Fuji Xerox Corporation and leader of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, one of the four large business lobbies here.
To be sure, the government was careful to keep news that Mr. Obuchi was hooked up to a respirator to itself until well after trading stopped on Monday, making sure that investors focused on the good news emanating from the currency market and from a survey of business confidence released on Monday rather than on the prime minister's illness.
He had not designated a successor before his stroke, which occurred in the wee hours of Sunday morning, and that lapse also contributed to the delay in announcing the severity of his medical condition.
"I think there was a very cautious calculation made by the party bosses in the Liberal Democratic Party not to disclose everything at once," said Shigenori Okazaki, an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo, referring to the governing party. "Instead, they released the news gradually, and the shock was mitigated."
There was no sign of panic in the markets this morning, either. The party already seems to be lining up Yoshiro Mori as Mr. Obuchi's successor. A colorless party loyalist, Mr. Mori is unlikely to change the policies Mr. Obuchi pursued. Japan changes its prime ministers almost as often as Italy does.
"The common wisdom among Japanese and foreign investors I talked to yesterday was that his replacement is unlikely to hammer out a different policy course," said Kathy Matsui, chief strategist at Goldman, Sachs (Japan) Ltd. "The post tends to change hands rather often here without any serious consequences."
The normal ebb and flow of funds has also helped to cushion the market. Many companies and banks, which typically have an investment portfolio, tend to have hoarded cash prior to the close of the fiscal year on March 31, in an effort to improve the look of their balance sheets.
They traditionally open the fiscal year by redeploying that cash in the stock and bond markets. The quarterly survey of business confidence, or Tankan, which was released yesterday, showed business confidence rising for the fifth consecutive quarter, another sign that corporate investment is picking up.
"I hope both the ruling party and the opposition parties will work to make the political situation stable so we can quickly take measures to compile a domestic and foreign agenda for the country as quickly as possible," said Hiroshi Okuda, chairman of the Toyota Motor Corporation.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Wipeouton Nasdaq Goes Well Beyond the Pummeling of Microsoft

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
It wasn't just Microsoft.
The Nasdaq composite index endured one of its worst days ever yesterday, as technology stocks broadly sold off. The decline, 7.6 percent, was the worst daily performance for the index since the summer of 1998. 
 Microsoft, which is just one of the 4,827 stocks in the Nasdaq composite but makes up 8.5 percent of the index's value, was responsible for only about a sixth of the 349.15-point decline, which was a record in terms of points. Its shares fell $15.375, to $90.875 -- shaving $80 billion off the company's market value -- as investors waited for the ruling that the company had violated antitrust laws, a ruling made after the end of regular trading.
But the Nasdaq wipeout was far broader than Microsoft's plunge. Of the 100 stocks in the Nasdaq 100 -- generally the largest companies in the composite index -- 86 fell in value. They included some of the highest flyers heretofore, like Cisco Systems, which for a time last month was the most valuable company in the country, and Qualcomm, the mobile phone technology company that is now down nearly 30 percent from the peak it reached in the first trading day of this year.
Over all, it was the fifth-worst day ever for the index, measured by percentages, trailing just the 8.6 percent fall of Aug. 31, 1998, and three days during the 1987 stock market crash. The 1998 fall came amid worry that the world's financial system was crumbling, and the 1987 declines came as the entire American stock market seemed to be collapsing.
By contrast, yesterday's move came on a day when many stocks were doing quite well, thank you. The Dow Jones industrial average leaped 2.7 percent -- and would have been up 3.7 percent had it not been weighed down by the changes Dow Jones made last November, when it added Microsoft and Intel to the list.
Just what the Nasdaq plunge means -- or whether it means much of anything at all -- is not easy to analyze because volatility in the Nasdaq market has been running at record levels this year, and big falls have often been followed by equally large rebounds. The Nasdaq composite is down 16.3 percent from the peak it reached on March 10. But it is still up 3.8 percent since the end of last year. The Dow, by contrast, is up 13 percent since March 10, but is down 2.4 percent in 2000.
That kind of opposite movement for the Dow and the Nasdaq is far from common. The Nasdaq index, which dates back to 1971, has seen 41 daily declines of at least 3 percent before this year. The Dow declined on 40 of those days, the only exception being on Oct. 20, 1987, the day after the market crash. That exception reflected not so much investor sentiment about the relative weakness of the Nasdaq issues but a quirk of the previous day. The decline in Nasdaq the day before had been smaller than the Dow's because many of the brokers that made Nasdaq markets chose not to answer their phones, and thus kept reported prices artificially high.
But as the Nasdaq has gyrated wildly this year, the Dow has often moved to a different drummer. Of the 11 days in 2000 on which the Nasdaq has fallen at least 3 percent, four of them have seen the Dow go up.
For now, at least, it appears that the new-economy stocks that zoomed last year and early this year are falling. Meanwhile, the old-economy stocks that did not rise much if at all in that period are gaining ground.
It used to be that when panic struck equity investors they bailed out of stocks in general, putting money into cash. But these days it appears that they are more likely to buy other stocks instead. The belief in technology stocks is being challenged, but not the faith over all in the stock market.
General Electric, which rose $3.3125, to $158.9375, yesterday, is again the most valuable company in the land, with a market value of $527 billion, compared with $506 billion for Cisco and $473 billion for Microsoft, according to Bloomberg Financial Markets. A week ago, G.E. was in third place.
Microsoft is among the most widely held stocks in the country, both in individual portfolios and in mutual funds. But the extent to which holders were hurt yesterday depended largely on what else was held. Diversified funds with many large stocks were not badly damaged, while funds concentrated in technology stocks were. The Fidelity Magellan Fund, for which Microsoft was the largest holding at last report, was off just 0.3 percent yesterday, in part because G.E. was the fund's second-largest holding. But the Fidelity OTC Portfolio and the Fidelity Select Technology Fund, for which Microsoft was also the largest holding, fell 7.8 and 9.2 percent, respectively.
The easy-come, easy-go nature of this market is illustrated by the PBHG Technology and Communications Fund, which fell 13.6 percent yesterday. At its peak on March 9, the fund was up 71.5 percent from the end of 1999. Now its gain for the year has been cut to 7.9 percent.

Hurricane Hugo

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela

 BODY:
One of the newest government office buildings in Caracas is the marbled-sided Ministry of Finance. Walking through the lobby there the other day I noticed that the huge clock overlooking the reception desk was either (a) broken or (b) 20 minutes slow. I didn't stay long enough to see which. But I did stay in Venezuela long enough to realize that many people were asking the same thing about President Hugo Chavez's leadership.
Is it broken? Or is it just a little late in blooming? Is he leading Venezuela in a transition, the exact direction of which will emerge after the May 28 presidential elections, or is he leading Venezuela into a dead end? 
 Who is Hugo Chavez? You hear that a lot here, and not just from the corrupt politicians who ruled Venezuela for four decades before the populist Mr. Chavez ousted them in a vote last year that amounted to an electoral revolution. With unemployment here at 20 percent, and with the economy having shrunk by 7.2 percent last year, even some of the poor have turned against Mr. Chavez with graffiti: "He feeds us rhetoric to fill our minds, but our stomachs are empty."
Maybe the best description of Mr. Chavez was from a diplomat here who said: "Hugo Chavez is a work in progress -- and a piece of work."
The Hugo Chavez who is a piece of work is the Chavez who ordered U.S. military ships steaming to Venezuela -- on an emergency aid mission to rebuild the vital coastal highway destroyed by mudslides -- to go away. Mr. Chavez, a former army colonel and pal of Fidel Castro, didn't want to look too dependent on the U.S. He recently described Mr. Castro's medical-welfare system as a "sea of happiness" -- ignoring how many Cubans were risking their lives to swim away from that sea.
But the Hugo Chavez who is a work in progress is equally interesting. Venezuela's political system needed a radical overhaul, and Mr. Chavez is doing that. But so far his biggest reform has been to rewrite the Constitution to widen his powers and lengthen his potential time in office.
If Mr. Chavez is re-elected in May -- he is being challenged by Francisco Arias Cardenas, a former comrade who has charged Mr. Chavez with incompetence -- the big question is, what will he build on his new foundation, and with whom? Frankly, his team has a certain Keystone Kops, not-ready-for-prime-time quality to it.
The challenge is obvious. Venezuela is a country that has been cursed with oil. The reigning assumption in this nation, which sits atop some of the world's richest oilfields, has been that Venezuela is naturally rich and if it is getting poorer it is because someone in power is stealing. So politics has tended to be about whom to lynch, not what to build. The truth is, though, that with 85 percent of its foreign currency coming from oil sales, Venezuela is a country that has forgotten how to create wealth. It only knows how to distribute it. First the oligarchs distributed it to their cronies. Now Mr. Chavez wants to give more to the underclass.
But there isn't enough oil money anymore, and Mr. Chavez has not detailed any credible plan for creating new wealth -- by attracting non-energy-related foreign investment and building globally competitive companies -- so that one-fifth of the country doesn't have to work for the government. Today, the biggest export of Venezuela's private sector is itself; the managers and scientists who have global skills are leaving, frightened by the rising crime wave and the Chavez populism that suggests that anyone here who has money must have stolen it.
Hugo Chavez ran for office as Robin Hood in a country that needs Bill Gates -- someone who not only redistributes wealth but knows how to create it. Mr. Chavez came into office with a deep suspicion of globalization. But on his recent trip to Beijing it was the Chinese who told him to pay more attention to developing a globally competitive private sector.
Mr. Chavez deserves a chance to prove himself as something more than Robin Hood. If he can use his credibility with Venezuela's underclass to lead it to a more modern economy, he will become one of the most important figures in Latin America. If he doesn't, Venezuela, which is America's largest supplier of oil, is going to witness some really explosive and destabilizing politics.
Time is short, and, somewhere at least, a clock is ticking.

Reaction in the Northwest Favors Gates and Company Even as the Stock's Value Falls by Billions of Dollars

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash., April 3

 BODY:
When Microsoft got its legal thrashing from a federal judge today, the Seattle area's roaring economy got a bit of a jolt, too. With about 40 percent of the company's stock in the hands of people who live in the region, roughly $32 billion, on paper anyway, vanished here between the time William H. Gates and Steve Ballmer, the company's two top leaders, rose this morning and the time they stepped to a podium here to respond to the judge's finding.
But sounding no less self-assured than they have throughout their antitrust battle with the government, both men calmly defended the software giant's actions, predicted vindication in both the marketplace and the legal arena, and reiterated a through-the-looking-glass depiction of how government prosecutors had misunderstood the company. 
 "This ruling turns on its head the reality that consumers know -- that our software has helped make PC's more accessible and more affordable to millions," said Mr. Gates, Microsoft's co-founder and chairman. "Innovation will continue to be the No. 1 priority at Microsoft."
And while Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson concluded that the company had violated antitrust laws and kept "an oppressive thumb" on the competition, Mr. Ballmer in effect insisted that Microsoft's legal and image problems stemmed from the fact that it had never been able to shed its little-guy mentality.
"We've spent the past 25 years thinking of ourselves as a small, aggressive company playing catch-up to industry giants even though at some point along the way we became a large company," said Mr. Ballmer, the chief executive. "Our intense focus on moving forward has at times been seen as threatening and our passion for being the best has been misinterpreted. We can do better. But that doesn't mean innovating any less or delivering any less value to consumers."
If such a view may inspire derision from competitors in Silicon Valley, it still has considerable resonance in the Seattle area, where today's news did not seem to generate any large sense of panic. In fact, it prompted many people in the street to express anger that -- as more than one person put it -- their taxpayer dollars were being spent to "harangue" the company.
"When the government typed up the indictment, what did they use to type it up with?" said Selah Houdin, a student at Seattle Central Community College. "They used Microsoft. They had the option to use other programs to type it up. They chose Microsoft because it's best."
Money managers who are heavily invested in Microsoft stock were clearly not happy, but most said they considered the company's long-term prospects excellent and were not inclined to sell off now.
"I really don't think the outlook is much different than it was Friday," said Bill Whitlow, manager of the Safeco Northwest Fund, a mutual fund with roughly 6 percent of its $152 million in holdings in Microsoft stock. Like many other analysts here, he noted that the stock had actually enjoyed a run-up recently, built in part on unrealistic expectations that a settlement was at hand. And several noted that even if the company was broken up, a prospect they still considered unlikely, the sum of its parts might well be worth more than its current whole, as was famously the case with John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust.
Glenn Pascall, a senior fellow at the Institute for Public Policy at the University of Washington, who has studied the company's impact on the local economy, said many people here viewed today's ruling as an "interim legal event" in a long-running fight.
"I'm just not sure you're going to see a lot of gnashing of teeth in response to this," said Mr. Pascall, who is also a columnist in The Puget Sound Business Journal. Asked to characterize the fallout from today's ruling, he said: "I would say that a small number of people with large holdings of Microsoft stock suffered a large one-day paper loss because of an overreaction to the end of an unrealistic expectation of an early resolution. The market has totally discounted the fact that Microsoft would have had to make significant concessions to resolve the process through negotiation."
If such sanguine reactions were typical here, they may themselves wind up being overly optimistic.
Microsoft's role in the Northwest economy is obviously huge, and the company now accounts for nearly 60 percent of the total market value of all publicly traded companies in the Pacific Northwest, according to Mr. Whitlow at the Safeco fund.
As big a hit as its stock took today, the company could be battered even more severely if the case drags on for months or years, or if today's ruling, as many analysts predict, prompts a flood of new lawsuits from competitors or even disgruntled individual customers. Such lawsuits would drain more resources of the company and bring more bad publicity, regardless of whether Microsoft prevails in the courts. And the whole case has arisen at a crucial juncture in the development of software, which is rapidly being fused to the Internet.
While some people faulted the company for failing to strike a deal with the government, others applauded Microsoft for resisting that option, and Mr. Ballmer hardly appeared in a conciliatory mood.
"Until the appeal's over, nothing's settled -- we've learned that through experience," he said. "I couldn't be more proud of this great company, its incredible employees and its breakthrough products." And, he added, "I believe in this company more today than I ever have."

HEADLINE: Lagging in Education, the South Experiments

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, April 3

 BODY:
The states of the South, long home to the nation's poorest and worst-performing students, have desperately begun to experiment with education theories and school reform plans in ways that are drawing national attention.
While experimentation is going on in a few states in other regions, almost every Southern governor, Republican or Democrat, is either hunting for new school money or trying combinations of familiar and occasionally untested ideas for improving student achievement. Some of the plans mix new spending for large state education agencies and teacher salaries with conservative proposals like vouchers and an end to teacher job protection. 
 "The Southern states have really been pushing the envelope," said Kathy Christie, who runs the information clearinghouse at the Education Commission of the States, a nonprofit policy group based in Denver. "They may be low in achievement, on average, but they have a number of high-quality proposals out there that may start to change that in the next few years."
Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky seemed to be speaking for the entire South earlier this year when he informed state lawmakers of his top four priorities: "Education, education, education and education." Not all his colleagues have been quite so wry about it, but in virtually every statehouse in the South, the priorities are essentially the same.
Georgia is about to become the first state in the country to wipe out all job protection for teachers, a measure Gov. Roy Barnes pushed through the state legislature over the objections of teacher organizations as a message that the world had changed. The end of tenure is the most attention-getting element of Mr. Barnes's sweeping education overhaul, approved last month, which mandates smaller class sizes, bonuses for teachers in good schools and a new education bureaucracy to monitor annual testing.
South Carolina has been spending more than $70 million a year to raise teacher salaries above the regional average and provide scholarships for future teachers, and it has established a new training institute for principals.
A Texas approach begun in the early 1990's and enhanced by Gov. George W. Bush has put a strong emphasis on testing, breaking new ground in the close monitoring of low-income and minority students.
North Carolina -- hailed along with Texas in a 1998 study by the National Education Goals Panel as having made among the largest gains in reading and math scores in the first part of the 1990's -- is tightening the licensing of both new and experienced teachers. At the same time, it is offering substantial bonuses for teachers in high-performing schools.
Florida has pioneered a program to provide private-school vouchers for students in poorly performing public schools. The program was recently ruled unconstitutional by a state judge, but the state is appealing the decision.
As the region with the lowest per-capita income, the South has always lagged the rest of the country in educational achievement, burdened by its former reliance on low-skill jobs and the residue of segregated school systems. Forty percent of Americans without high school diplomas are in the South, twice the percentage of any other region, according to the Southern Regional Education Board, a cooperative compact to improve the public schools.
The South was slower than the rest of the country to begin its school reform, and for all the recent years of innovation, performance has just barely begun to move up. The Southeast is still the lowest-ranking of the nation's four regions on the federal government's National Assessment of Education Progress tests.
Of the 16 states that belong to the regional board, only 6 meet the national average for proficiency in fourth-grade reading (although others have shown some improvement), and only 3 do so in eighth-grade reading. In the Deep South, only North Carolina meets the national proficiency averages for both grades.
"We've lagged behind the rest of the country for so long that there is a much greater receptivity to experimentation," said John Dornan, executive director of the Public School Forum, a nonprofit public policy group based in Raleigh, N.C. "The states are trying a lot of high-stakes programs, but we're just now starting to fight our way up to average."
As in most states, the effort to improve public schools began in the South with the dire warnings published 17 years ago in "A Nation at Risk," a federal commission's report attacking the quality of American education, and was prodded by business leaders who said the regional economy was at stake. But the South had much further to go than the rest of the country. It spent less on education than any other region, and had by far the largest number of dropouts and failing students. Nowhere was the connection between student poverty and school performance more evident.
"We just didn't put importance in the state of public education until the last few years," Governor Barnes, of Georgia, said in an interview last week, riffling through bulging folders of education statistics. "Because in the South you didn't have to. You had manufacturing concerns -- kids could drop out in high school and go to work at a mill. Well, the mills are no longer there; the mills are in Mexico or Asia. The economy has changed, and we've got to improve our standards or we won't have the smart people to fill those jobs."
Governors of the New South like Lamar Alexander in Tennessee and Richard Riley in South Carolina first began talking like this in the 1980's, trying to repair their states' reputations with the first wave of school reforms like testing and improving teacher quality. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, one of the earliest and most successful education advocates among the governors, was the founding chairman of the national standards board that certifies teachers in their fields, and his state now leads the nation in board-certified teachers.
Other states, particularly in the Deep South, moved more slowly, but now it is no longer possible to be a Southern governor without a similar agenda. In Mississippi, which has the nation's lowest-performing schools, Gov. Ronnie Musgrove promised in his inaugural address in January to find $286 million to raise teacher salaries to the regional average over the next five years (although he has not yet persuaded legislators).
Next door, in Alabama, Gov. Donald Siegelman has also proposed substantial raises for teachers, in exchange for making it easier to dismiss them without a lengthy procedure. But after his plan for a state lottery to support education failed last year, he said the money would have to come out of the same pot as is used for higher education, and now university administrators have come out against the proposal.
In any case, it is the South's wealthier states, like Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas, that are setting the pace for innovation. Georgia's plan, centering on school accountability, is typical of what other Southern states are approving or considering, and Governor Barnes frankly admits that much of it was borrowed from North Carolina.
The Georgia plan, passed overwhelmingly in the state legislature last month and set to be signed into law in a few weeks, is based on annual tests in Grades 1 through 12 in reading, writing, mathematics, science and social studies. If students meet the goals set by a new State Office of Education Accountability, the teachers in their school will get bonus pay. If students in a school fail repeatedly, they will be allowed to move to a different school, and teachers and administrators can be disciplined or dismissed.
At the same time, class sizes will be limited to 21 students in first through third grade, down from the current maximum of 33; in later grades, class sizes can grow to 28. School councils of parents, teachers and business leaders will be set up to work with principals.
Any teacher dismissed will be given a written reason but will not have the right to a hearing. Although a few other states have shortened the hearing process, none of them have eliminated it entirely.
The larger of two state teachers organizations, the Professional Association of Georgia Educators, eventually dropped its opposition when Mr. Barnes agreed that the dismissal rule would be applied only to teachers hired from now on, not to existing faculty. But a smaller teachers group, the Georgia Association of Educators, remains opposed; its executive director, Drew Albritton, said the provision would drive away good teachers by permitting arbitrary dismissals.
Mr. Barnes, a Democrat who ran the risk of alienating a crucial constituency of his party with the measure, acknowledged that there was no statistical link between teacher tenure rights and student achievement. But he said the move sent a message to educators that change would be pronounced. "Tenure is an outdated concept," he said, "born of a time when we treasured process over performance."
Georgia's consensus is not always easy to come by, however, especially in states that passed the first reform measures some time ago and are now coming to realize that the costs only go up. In Kentucky, which has seen steady improvement since passing a school reform bill in 1990, legislators have been unable to agree on Governor Patton's proposal to pay for enhanced teacher training programs. Gov. Mike Foster of Louisiana has not been able to find the $220 million he wants to raise teacher salaries to the Southeastern average, and the state's teachers groups are murmuring about an autumn strike.
"We've actually made a lot of progress, considering where we were," said Mark Musick, president of the Southern Regional Education Board. "But we had a lot of room to make progress. The next steps are going to be even harder."

Excerpts From the Ruling That Microsoft Violated Antitrust Law

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the main points of the ruling yesterday by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of Federal District Court in Washington in the antitrust case against the Microsoft Corporation:
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
The United States, 19 individual states, and the District of Columbia ("the plaintiffs") bring these consolidated civil enforcement actions against defendant Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The plaintiffs charge, in essence, that Microsoft has waged an unlawful campaign in defense of its monopoly position in the market for operating systems designed to run on Intel-compatible personal computers ("PC's"). Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that Microsoft violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by engaging in a series of exclusionary, anticompetitive, and predatory acts to maintain its monopoly power. They also assert that Microsoft attempted, albeit unsuccessfully to date, to monopolize the Web browser market, likewise in violation of Section 2. Finally, they contend that certain steps taken by Microsoft as part of its campaign to protect its monopoly power, namely tying its browser to its operating system and entering into exclusive dealing arrangements, violated Section 1 of the Act. 
 Upon consideration of the court's Findings of Fact ("Findings"), filed herein on Nov. 5, 1999, as amended on Dec. 21, 1999, the proposed conclusions of law submitted by the parties, the briefs of amici curiae, and the argument of counsel thereon, the court concludes that Microsoft maintained its monopoly power by anticompetitive means and attempted to monopolize the Web browser market, both in violation of Section 2. Microsoft also violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by unlawfully tying its Web browser to its operating system. The facts found do not support the conclusion that the effect of Microsoft's marketing arrangements with other companies constituted unlawful exclusive dealing under criteria established by leading decisions under Section 1.
The 19 states and the District of Columbia ("the plaintiff states") seek to ground liability additionally under their respective antitrust laws. The court is persuaded that the evidence in the record proving violations of the Sherman Act also satisfies the elements of analogous causes of action arising under the laws of each plaintiff state. For this reason, and for others stated below, the court holds Microsoft liable under those particular state laws as well.
 
I. SECTION TWO OF THE SHERMAN ACT
A. Maintenance of Monopoly Power by Anticompetitive Means
Section 2 of the Sherman Act declares that it is unlawful for a person or firm to "monopolize . . . any part of the trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations." This language operates to limit the means by which a firm may lawfully either acquire or perpetuate monopoly power. Specifically, a firm violates Section 2 if it attains or preserves monopoly power through anticompetitive acts. See United States v. Grinnell Corporation ("The offense of monopoly power under Section 2 of the Sherman Act has two elements: (1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident."); Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services ("Our Section 2 monopolization doctrines are . . . directed to discrete situations in which a defendant's possession of substantial market power, combined with his exclusionary or anticompetitive behavior, threatens to defeat or forestall the corrective forces of competition and thereby sustain or extend the defendant's agglomeration of power.")
 
1. Monopoly Power
The threshold element of a Section 2 monopolization offense being "the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market," the court must first ascertain the boundaries of the commercial activity that can be termed the "relevant market."
In this case, the plaintiffs postulated the relevant market as being the worldwide licensing of Intel-compatible PC operating systems. Whether this zone of commercial activity actually qualifies as a market, "monopolization of which may be illegal," depends on whether it includes all products "reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes." See Rothery Storage & Van Co. v. Atlas Van Lines Inc. ("Because the ability of consumers to turn to other suppliers restrains a firm from raising prices above the competitive level, the definition of the 'relevant market' rests on a determination of available substitutes.")
The court has already found, based on the evidence in this record, that there are currently no products -- and that there are not likely to be any in the near future -- that a significant percentage of computer users worldwide could substitute for Intel-compatible PC operating systems without incurring substantial costs. The court has further found that no firm not currently marketing Intel-compatible PC operating systems could start doing so in a way that would, within a reasonably short period of time, present a significant percentage of such consumers with a viable alternative to existing Intel-compatible PC operating systems. From these facts, the court has inferred that if a single firm or cartel controlled the licensing of all Intel-compatible PC operating systems worldwide, it could set the price of a license substantially above that which would be charged in a competitive market -- and leave the price there for a significant period of time -- without losing so many customers as to make the action unprofitable. This inference, in turn, has led the court to find that the licensing of all Intel-compatible PC operating systems worldwide does in fact constitute the relevant market in the context of the plaintiffs' monopoly maintenance claim. The plaintiffs proved at trial that Microsoft possesses a dominant, persistent, and increasing share of the relevant market. Microsoft's share of the worldwide market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems currently exceeds 95 percent, and the firm's share would stand well above 80 percent even if the Mac OS were included in the market. The plaintiffs also proved that the applications barrier to entry protects Microsoft's dominant market share. This barrier ensures that no Intel-compatible PC operating system other than Windows can attract significant consumer demand, and the barrier would operate to the same effect even if Microsoft held its prices substantially above the competitive level for a protracted period of time. Together, the proof of dominant market share and the existence of a substantial barrier to effective entry create the presumption that Microsoft enjoys monopoly power.
At trial, Microsoft attempted to rebut the presumption of monopoly power with evidence of both putative constraints on its ability to exercise such power and behavior of its own that is supposedly inconsistent with the possession of monopoly power. None of the purported constraints, however, actually deprive Microsoft of "the ability (1) to price substantially above the competitive level and (2) to persist in doing so for a significant period without erosion by new entry or expansion." Furthermore, neither Microsoft's efforts at technical innovation nor its pricing behavior is inconsistent with the possession of monopoly power.
Even if Microsoft's rebuttal had attenuated the presumption created by the prima facie showing of monopoly power, corroborative evidence of monopoly power abounds in this record: Neither Microsoft nor its OEM customers believe that the latter have -- or will have anytime soon -- even a single, commercially viable alternative to licensing Windows for pre-installation on their PC's. Moreover, over the past several years, Microsoft has comported itself in a way that could only be consistent with rational behavior for a profit-maximizing firm if the firm knew that it possessed monopoly power, and if it was motivated by a desire to preserve the barrier to entry protecting that power.
In short, the proof of Microsoft's dominant, persistent market share protected by a substantial barrier to entry, together with Microsoft's failure to rebut that prima facie showing effectively and the additional indicia of monopoly power, have compelled the court to find as fact that Microsoft enjoys monopoly power in the relevant market.
 
2. Maintenance of Monopoly Power by Anticompetitive Means
In a Section 2 case, once it is proved that the defendant possesses monopoly power in a relevant market, liability for monopolization depends on a showing that the defendant used anticompetitive methods to achieve or maintain its position. Prior cases have established an analytical approach to determining whether challenged conduct should be deemed anticompetitive in the context of a monopoly maintenance claim. The threshold question in this analysis is whether the defendant's conduct is "exclusionary" -- that is, whether it has restricted significantly, or threatens to restrict significantly, the ability of other firms to compete in the relevant market on the merits of what they offer customers. See Eastman Kodak (Section 2 is "directed to discrete situations" in which the behavior of firms with monopoly power "threatens to defeat or forestall the corrective forces of competition.")
If the evidence reveals a significant exclusionary impact in the relevant market, the defendant's conduct will be labeled "anticompetitive" -- and liability will attach -- unless the defendant comes forward with specific, procompetitive business motivations that explain the full extent of its exclusionary conduct.
If the defendant with monopoly power consciously antagonized its customers by making its products less attractive to them -- or if it incurred other costs, such as large outlays of development capital and forfeited opportunities to derive revenue from it -- with no prospect of compensation other than the erection or preservation of barriers against competition by equally efficient firms, the court may deem the defendant's conduct "predatory."
As the District of Columbia Circuit stated in Neumann v. Reinforced Earth Co.: P redation involves aggression against business rivals through the use of business practices that would not be considered profit maximizing except for the expectation that (1) actual rivals will be driven from the market, or the entry of potential rivals blocked or delayed, so that the predator will gain or retain a market share sufficient to command monopoly profits, or (2) rivals will be chastened sufficiently to abandon competitive behavior the predator finds threatening to its realization of monopoly profits.
 Proof that a profit-maximizing firm took predatory action should suffice to demonstrate the threat of substantial exclusionary effect; to hold otherwise would be to ascribe irrational behavior to the defendant. Moreover, predatory conduct, by definition as well as by nature, lacks procompetitive business motivation . . .
In this case, Microsoft early on recognized middleware as the Trojan horse that, once having, in effect, infiltrated the applications barrier, could enable rival operating systems to enter the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems unimpeded. Simply put, middleware threatened to demolish Microsoft's coveted monopoly power. Alerted to the threat, Microsoft strove over a period of approximately four years to prevent middleware technologies from fostering the development of enough full-featured, cross-platform applications to erode the applications barrier. In pursuit of this goal, Microsoft sought to convince developers to concentrate on Windows-specific API'sS and ignore interfaces exposed by the two incarnations of middleware that posed the greatest threat, namely, Netscape's Navigator Web browser and Sun's implementation of the Java technology. Microsoft's campaign succeeded in preventing -- for several years, and perhaps permanently -- Navigator and Java from fulfilling their potential to open the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems to competition on the merits. Because Microsoft achieved this result through exclusionary acts that lacked procompetitive justification, the court deems Microsoft's conduct the maintenance of monopoly power by anticompetitive means.
 
a. Combating the Browser Threat
The same ambition that inspired Microsoft's efforts to induce Intel, Apple, RealNetworks and I.B.M. to desist from certain technological innovations and business initiatives -- namely, the desire to preserve the applications barrier -- motivated the firm's June 1995 proposal that Netscape abstain from releasing platform-level browsing software for 32-bit versions of Windows. This proposal, together with the punitive measures that Microsoft inflicted on Netscape when it rebuffed the overture, illuminates the context in which Microsoft's subsequent behavior toward PC manufacturers ("OEM's"), Internet access providers ("IAP's"), and other firms must be viewed.
When Netscape refused to abandon its efforts to develop Navigator into a substantial platform for applications development, Microsoft focused its efforts on minimizing the extent to which developers would avail themselves of interfaces exposed by that nascent platform. Microsoft realized that the extent of developers' reliance on Netscape's browser platform would depend largely on the size and trajectory of Navigator's share of browser usage. Microsoft thus set out to maximize Internet Explorer's share of browser usage at Navigator's expense. The core of this strategy was ensuring that the firms comprising the most effective channels for the generation of browser usage would devote their distributional and promotional efforts to Internet Explorer rather than Navigator. Recognizing that pre-installation by OEM's and bundling with the proprietary software of IAP's led more directly and efficiently to browser usage than any other practices in the industry, Microsoft devoted major efforts to usurping those two channels.
 
i. The OEM Channel
With respect to OEM's, Microsoft's campaign proceeded on three fronts. First, Microsoft bound Internet Explorer to Windows with contractual and, later, technological shackles in order to ensure the prominent (and ultimately permanent) presence of Internet Explorer on every Windows user's PC system, and to increase the costs attendant to installing and using Navigator on any PC's running Windows. Second, Microsoft imposed stringent limits on the freedom of OEM's to reconfigure or modify Windows 95 and Windows 98 in ways that might enable OEM's to generate usage for Navigator in spite of the contractual and technological devices that Microsoft had employed to bind Internet Explorer to Windows. Finally, Microsoft used incentives and threats to induce especially important OEM's to design their distributional, promotional and technical efforts to favor Internet Explorer to the exclusion of Navigator.
Microsoft's actions increased the likelihood that pre-installation of Navigator onto Windows would cause user confusion and system degradation and therefore lead to higher support costs and reduced sales for the OEM's. Not willing to take actions that would jeopardize their already slender profit margins, OEM's felt compelled by Microsoft's actions to reduce drastically their distribution and promotion of Navigator. The substantial inducements that Microsoft held out to the largest OEM's only further reduced the distribution and promotion of Navigator in the OEM channel. The response of OEM's to Microsoft's efforts had a dramatic, negative impact on Navigator's usage share. The drop in usage share, in turn, has prevented Navigator from being the vehicle to open the relevant market to competition on the merits.
Microsoft fails to advance any legitimate business objectives that actually explain the full extent of this significant exclusionary impact. The court has already found that no quality-related or technical justifications fully explain Microsoft's refusal to license Windows 95 to OEM's without version 1.0 through 4.0 of Internet Explorer, or its refusal to permit them to uninstall versions 3.0 and 4.0. The same lack of justification applies to Microsoft's decision not to offer a browserless version of Windows 98 to consumers and OEM's. . . .
To the extent that Microsoft still asserts a copyright defense, relying upon federal copyright law as a justification for its various restrictions on OEM's, that defense neither explains nor operates to immunize Microsoft's conduct under the Sherman Act. As a general proposition, Microsoft argues that the federal Copyright Act endows the holder of a valid copyright in software with an absolute right to prevent licensees, in this case the OEM's, from shipping modified versions of its product without its express permission. In truth, Windows 95 and Windows 98 are covered by copyright registrations that "constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright." But the validity of Microsoft's copyrights has never been in doubt; the issue is what, precisely, they protect.
Microsoft has presented no evidence that the contractual (or the technological) restrictions it placed on OEM's ability to alter Windows derive from any of the enumerated rights explicitly granted to a copyright holder under the Copyright Act. Instead, Microsoft argues that the restrictions "simply restate" an expansive right to preserve the "integrity" of its copyrighted software against any "distortion," "truncation," or "alteration," a right nowhere mentioned among the Copyright Act's list of exclusive rights, thus raising some doubt as to its existence. . . .
The court has already found that the true impetus behind Microsoft's restrictions on OEM's was not its desire to maintain a somewhat amorphous quality it refers to as the "integrity" of the Windows platform, nor even to ensure that Windows afforded a uniform and stable platform for applications development. Microsoft itself engendered, or at least countenanced, instability and inconsistency by permitting Microsoft-friendly modifications to the desktop and boot sequence, and by releasing updates to Internet Explorer more frequently than it released new versions of Windows. Add to this the fact that the modifications OEM's desired to make would not have removed or altered any Windows API's, and thus would not have disrupted any of Windows' functionalities, and it is apparent that Microsoft's conduct is effectively explained by its foreboding that OEM's would pre-install and give prominent placement to middleware like Navigator that could attract enough developer attention to weaken the applications barrier to entry. In short, if Microsoft was truly inspired by a genuine concern for maximizing consumer satisfaction, as well as preserving its substantial investment in a worthy product, then it would have relied more on the power of the very competitive PC market, and less on its own market power, to prevent OEM's from making modifications that consumers did not want.
 
ii. The IAP Channel
Microsoft adopted similarly aggressive measures to ensure that the IAP channel would generate browser usage share for Internet Explorer rather than Navigator. To begin with, Microsoft licensed Internet Explorer and the Internet Explorer Access Kit to hundreds of IAP's for no charge. Then, Microsoft extended valuable promotional treatment to the 10 most important IAP's in exchange for their commitment to promote and distribute Internet Explorer and to exile Navigator from the desktop. Finally, in exchange for efforts to upgrade existing subscribers to client software that came bundled with Internet Explorer instead of Navigator, Microsoft granted rebates -- and in some cases made outright payments -- to those same IAP's. Given the importance of the IAP channel to browser usage share, it is fair to conclude that these inducements and restrictions contributed significantly to the drastic changes that have in fact occurred in Internet Explorer's and Navigator's respective usage shares. Microsoft's actions in the IAP channel thereby contributed significantly to preserving the applications barrier to entry.
There are no valid reasons to justify the full extent of Microsoft's exclusionary behavior in the IAP channel. A desire to limit free riding on the firm's investment in consumer-oriented features, such as the Referral Server and the Online Services Folder, can, in some circumstances, qualify as a procompetitive business motivation; but that motivation does not explain the full extent of the restrictions that Microsoft actually imposed upon IAP's. Under the terms of the agreements, an IAP's failure to keep Navigator shipments below the specified percentage primed Microsoft's contractual right to dismiss the IAP from its own favored position in the Referral Server or the Online Services Folder. This was true even if the IAP had refrained from promoting Navigator in its client software included with Windows, had purged all mention of Navigator from any Web site directly connected to the Referral Server, and had distributed no browser other than Internet Explorer to the new subscribers it gleaned from the Windows desktop. Thus, Microsoft's restrictions closed off a substantial amount of distribution that would not have constituted a free ride to Navigator.
Nor can an ostensibly procompetitive desire to "foster brand association" explain the full extent of Microsoft's restrictions. If Microsoft's only concern had been brand association, restrictions on the ability of IAP's to promote Navigator likely would have sufficed. . . .
In sum, the efforts Microsoft directed at OEM's and IAP's successfully ostracized Navigator as a practical matter from the two channels that lead most efficiently to browser usage. Even when viewed independently, these two prongs of Microsoft's campaign threatened to "forestall the corrective forces of competition" and thereby perpetuate Microsoft's monopoly power in the relevant market. Therefore, whether they are viewed separately or together, the OEM and IAP components of Microsoft's anticompetitive campaign merit a finding of liability under Section 2.
 
iii. ICP's, ISV's and Apple
No other distribution channels for browsing software approach the efficiency of OEM pre-installation and IAP bundling. Nevertheless, protecting the applications barrier to entry was so critical to Microsoft that the firm was willing to invest substantial resources to enlist ICP's, ISV's, and Apple in its campaign against the browser threat. By extracting from Apple terms that significantly diminished the usage of Navigator on the Mac OS, Microsoft helped to ensure that developers would not view Navigator as truly cross-platform middleware. By granting ICP's and ISV's free licenses to bundle Internet Explorer with their offerings, and by exchanging other valuable inducements for their agreement to distribute, promote and rely on Internet Explorer rather than Navigator, Microsoft directly induced developers to focus on its own API's rather than ones exposed by Navigator. These measures supplemented Microsoft's efforts in the OEM and IAP channels.
Just as they fail to account for the measures that Microsoft took in the IAP channel, the goals of preventing free riding and preserving brand association fail to explain the full extent of Microsoft's actions in the ICP channel. With respect to the ISV agreements, Microsoft has put forward no procompetitive business ends whatsoever to justify their exclusionary terms. Finally, Microsoft's willingness to make the sacrifices involved in cancelling Mac Office, and the concessions relating to browsing software that it demanded from Apple, can only be explained by Microsoft's desire to protect the applications barrier to entry from the threat posed by Navigator. . . .
 
b. Combating the Java Threat
As part of its grand strategy to protect the applications barrier, Microsoft employed an array of tactics designed to maximize the difficulty with which applications written in Java could be ported from Windows to other platforms, and vice versa. The first of these measures was the creation of a Java implementation for Windows that undermined portability and was incompatible with other implementations. Microsoft then induced developers to use its implementation of Java rather than Sun-compliant ones. It pursued this tactic directly, by means of subterfuge and barter, and indirectly, through its campaign to minimize Navigator's usage share. In a separate effort to prevent the development of easily portable Java applications, Microsoft used its monopoly power to prevent firms such as Intel from aiding in the creation of cross-platform interfaces.
Microsoft's tactics induced many Java developers to write their applications using Microsoft's developer tools and to refrain from distributing Sun-compliant JVM's to Windows users. This stratagem has effectively resulted in fewer applications that are easily portable. What is more, Microsoft's actions interfered with the development of new cross-platform Java interfaces. It is not clear whether, absent Microsoft's machinations, Sun's Java efforts would by now have facilitated porting between Windows and other platforms to a degree sufficient to render the applications barrier to entry vulnerable. It is clear, however, that Microsoft's actions markedly impeded Java's progress to that end. The evidence thus compels the conclusion that Microsoft's actions with respect to Java have restricted significantly the ability of other firms to compete on the merits in the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems.
Microsoft's actions to counter the Java threat went far beyond the development of an attractive alternative to Sun's implementation of the technology. Specifically, Microsoft successfully pressured Intel, which was dependent in many ways on Microsoft's good graces, to abstain from aiding in Sun's and Netscape's Java development work. Microsoft also deliberately designed its Java development tools so that developers who were opting for portability over performance would nevertheless unwittingly write Java applications that would run only on Windows. Moreover, Microsoft's means of luring developers to its Java implementation included maximizing Internet Explorer's share of browser usage at Navigator's expense in ways the court has already held to be anticompetitive. Finally, Microsoft impelled ISV's, which are dependent upon Microsoft for technical information and certifications relating to Windows, to use and distribute Microsoft's version of the Windows JVM rather than any Sun-compliant version.
These actions cannot be described as competition on the merits, and they did not benefit consumers. In fact, Microsoft's actions did not even benefit Microsoft in the short run, for the firm's efforts to create incompatibility between its JVM for Windows and others' JVM's for Windows resulted in fewer total applications being able to run on Windows than otherwise would have been written. Microsoft was willing nevertheless to obstruct the development of Windows-compatible applications if they would be easy to port to other platforms and would thus diminish the applications barrier to entry.
 
c. Microsoft's Conduct Taken As a Whole
As the foregoing discussion illustrates, Microsoft's campaign to protect the applications barrier from erosion by network-centric middleware can be broken down into discrete categories of activity, several of which on their own independently satisfy the second element of a Section 2 monopoly maintenance claim. But only when the separate categories of conduct are viewed, as they should be, as a single, well-coordinated course of action does the full extent of the violence that Microsoft has done to the competitive process reveal itself. In essence, Microsoft mounted a deliberate assault upon entrepreneurial efforts that, left to rise or fall on their own merits, could well have enabled the introduction of competition into the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems. While the evidence does not prove that they would have succeeded absent Microsoft's actions, it does reveal that Microsoft placed an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune, thereby effectively guaranteeing its continued dominance in the relevant market. More broadly, Microsoft's anticompetitive actions trammeled the competitive process through which the computer software industry generally stimulates innovation and conduces to the optimum benefit of consumers.
Viewing Microsoft's conduct as a whole also reinforces the conviction that it was predacious. Microsoft paid vast sums of money, and renounced many millions more in lost revenue every year, in order to induce firms to take actions that would help enhance Internet Explorer's share of browser usage at Navigator's expense. These outlays cannot be explained as subventions to maximize return from Internet Explorer. Microsoft has no intention of ever charging for licenses to use or distribute its browser. Moreover, neither the desire to bolster demand for Windows nor the prospect of ancillary revenues from Internet Explorer can explain the lengths to which Microsoft has gone. In fact, Microsoft has expended wealth and forsworn opportunities to realize more in a manner and to an extent that can only represent a rational investment if its purpose was to perpetuate the applications barrier to entry. Because Microsoft's business practices "would not be considered profit maximizing except for the expectation that . . . the entry of potential rivals" into the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems will be "blocked or delayed," Microsoft's campaign must be termed predatory. Since the court has already found that Microsoft possesses monopoly power, the predatory nature of the firm's conduct compels the court to hold Microsoft liable under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.
 
B. Attempting to Obtain Monopoly Power in a Second Market by Anticompetitive Means
In addition to condemning actual monopolization, Section 2 of the Sherman Act declares that it is unlawful for a person or firm to "attempt to monopolize . . . any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations." Relying on this language, the plaintiffs assert that Microsoft's anticompetitive efforts to maintain its monopoly power in the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems warrant additional liability as an illegal attempt to amass monopoly power in "the browser market." The court agrees.
In order for liability to attach for attempted monopolization, a plaintiff generally must prove "(1) that the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with (2) a specific intent to monopolize," and (3) that there is a "dangerous probability" that the defendant will succeed in achieving monopoly power. Microsoft's June 1995 proposal that Netscape abandon the field to Microsoft in the market for browsing technology for Windows, and its subsequent, well-documented efforts to overwhelm Navigator's browser usage share with a proliferation of Internet Explorer browsers inextricably attached to Windows, clearly meet the first element of the offense.
The evidence in this record also satisfies the requirement of specific intent. Microsoft's effort to convince Netscape to stop developing platform-level browsing software for the 32-bit versions of Windows was made with full knowledge that Netscape's acquiescence in this market allocation scheme would, without more, have left Internet Explorer with such a large share of browser usage as to endow Microsoft with de facto monopoly power in the browser market.
When Netscape refused to abandon the development of browsing software for 32-bit versions of Windows, Microsoft's strategy for protecting the applications barrier became one of expanding Internet Explorer's share of browser usage -- and simultaneously depressing Navigator's share -- to an extent sufficient to demonstrate to developers that Navigator would never emerge as the standard software employed to browse the Web. While Microsoft's top executives never expressly declared acquisition of monopoly power in the browser market to be the objective, they knew, or should have known, that the tactics they actually employed were likely to push Internet Explorer's share to those extreme heights. Navigator's slow demise would leave a competitive vacuum for only Internet Explorer to fill. Yet, there is no evidence that Microsoft tried, or even considered trying, to prevent its anticompetitive campaign from achieving overkill. Under these circumstances, it is fair to presume that the wrongdoer intended "the probable consequences of its acts." Therefore, the facts of this case suffice to prove the element of specific intent.
Even if the first two elements of the offense are met, however, a defendant may not be held liable for attempted monopolization absent proof that its anticompetitive conduct created a dangerous probability of achieving the objective of monopoly power in a relevant market. The evidence supports the conclusion that Microsoft's actions did pose such a danger.
At the time Microsoft presented its market allocation proposal to Netscape, Navigator's share of browser usage stood well above 70 percent, and no other browser enjoyed more than a fraction of the remainder. Had Netscape accepted Microsoft's offer, nearly all of its share would have devolved upon Microsoft, because at that point, no potential third-party competitor could either claim to rival Netscape's stature as a browser company or match Microsoft's ability to leverage monopoly power in the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems. In the time it would have taken an aspiring entrant to launch a serious effort to compete against Internet Explorer, Microsoft could have erected the same type of barrier that protects its existing monopoly power by adding proprietary extensions to the browsing software under its control and by extracting commitments from OEM's, IAP's and others similar to the ones discussed in Section I.A.2, supra. In short, Netscape's assent to Microsoft's market division proposal would have, instanter, resulted in Microsoft's attainment of monopoly power in a second market. It follows that the proposal itself created a dangerous probability of that result. Although the dangerous probability was no longer imminent with Netscape's rejection of Microsoft's proposal, "the probability of success at the time the acts occur" is the measure by which liability is determined.
This conclusion alone is sufficient to support a finding of liability for attempted monopolization. The court is nonetheless compelled to express its further conclusion that the predatory course of conduct Microsoft has pursued since June of 1995 has revived the dangerous probability that Microsoft will attain monopoly power in a second market. Internet Explorer's share of browser usage has already risen above 50 percent, will exceed 60 percent by January 2001, and the trend continues unabated.
 
II. SECTION ONE OF THE SHERMAN ACT
Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits "every contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce . . . ." Pursuant to this statute, courts have condemned commercial stratagems that constitute unreasonable restraints on competition, among them "tying arrangements" and "exclusive dealing" contracts. Tying arrangements have been found unlawful where sellers exploit their market power over one product to force unwilling buyers into acquiring another. Where agreements have been challenged as unlawful exclusive dealing, the courts have condemned only those contractual arrangements that substantially foreclose competition in a relevant market by significantly reducing the number of outlets available to a competitor to reach prospective consumers of the competitor's product.
 
A. Tying
Liability for tying under Section 1 exists where (1) two separate "products" are involved; (2) the defendant affords its customers no choice but to take the tied product in order to obtain the tying product; (3) the arrangement affects a substantial volume of interstate commerce; and (4) the defendant has "market power" in the tying product market. The Supreme Court has since reaffirmed this test in Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services Inc. All four elements are required, whether the arrangement is subjected to a per se or rule of reason analysis.
The plaintiffs allege that Microsoft's combination of Windows and Internet Explorer by contractual and technological artifices constitute unlawful tying to the extent that those actions forced Microsoft's customers and consumers to take Internet Explorer as a condition of obtaining Windows. While the court agrees with plaintiffs, and thus holds that Microsoft is liable for illegal tying under Section 1, this conclusion is arguably at variance with a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in a closely related case, and must therefore be explained in some detail. Whether the decisions are indeed inconsistent is not for this court to say.
The decision of the District of Columbia Circuit in question is United States v. Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft II") which is itself related to an earlier decision of the same circuit, United States v. Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft I"). The history of the controversy is sufficiently set forth in the appellate opinions and need not be recapitulated here, except to state that those decisions anticipated the instant case, and that Microsoft II sought to guide this court, insofar as practicable, in the further proceedings it fully expected to ensue on the tying issue. Nevertheless, upon reflection this court does not believe the District of Columbia Circuit intended Microsoft II to state a controlling rule of law for purposes of this case. As the Microsoft II court itself acknowledged, the issue before it was the construction to be placed upon a single provision of a consent decree that, although animated by antitrust considerations, was nevertheless still primarily a matter of determining contractual intent. The court of appeals' observations on the extent to which software product design decisions may be subject to judicial scrutiny in the course of Section 1 tying cases are in the strictest sense obiter dicta, and are thus not formally binding. Nevertheless, both prudence and the deference this court owes to pronouncements of its own circuit oblige that it follow in the direction it is pointed until the trail falters.
The majority opinion in Microsoft II evinces both an extraordinary degree of respect for changes (including "integration") instigated by designers of technological products, such as software, in the name of product "improvement," and a corresponding lack of confidence in the ability of the courts to distinguish between improvements in fact and improvements in name only, made for anticompetitive purposes. Read literally, the District of Columbia Circuit's opinion appears to immunize any product design (or, at least, software product design) from antitrust scrutiny, irrespective of its effect upon competition, if the software developer can postulate any "plausible claim" of advantage to its arrangement of code.
This undemanding test appears to this court to be inconsistent with the pertinent Supreme Court precedents in at least three respects. First, it views the market from the defendant's perspective, or, more precisely, as the defendant would like to have the market viewed. Second, it ignores reality: The claim of advantage need only be plausible; it need not be proved. Third, it dispenses with any balancing of the hypothetical advantages against any anticompetitive effects.
The two most recent Supreme Court cases to have addressed the issue of product and market definition in the context of Sherman Act tying claims are Jefferson Parish and Eastman Kodak. In Jefferson Parish, the Supreme Court held that a hospital offering hospital services and anesthesiology services as a package could not be found to have violated the anti-tying rules unless the evidence established that patients, i.e. consumers, perceived the services as separate products for which they desired a choice, and that the package had the effect of forcing the patients to purchase an unwanted product. In Eastman Kodak the Supreme Court held that a manufacturer of photocopying and micrographic equipment, in agreeing to sell replacement parts for its machines only to those customers who also agreed to purchase repair services from it as well, would be guilty of tying if the evidence at trial established the existence of consumer demand for parts and services separately.
Both defendants asserted, as Microsoft does here, that the tied and tying products were in reality only a single product, or that every item was traded in a single market. In Jefferson Parish, the defendant contended that it offered a "functionally integrated package of services" -- a single product -- but the Supreme Court concluded that the "character of the demand" for the constituent components, not their functional relationship, determined whether separate "products" were actually involved. In Eastman Kodak, the defendant postulated that effective competition in the equipment market precluded the possibility of the use of market power anticompetitively in any after-markets for parts or services: Sales of machines, parts, and services were all responsive to the discipline of the larger equipment market. The Supreme Court declined to accept this premise in the absence of evidence of "actual market realities," ultimately holding that "the proper market definition in this case can be determined only after a factual inquiry into the 'commercial realities' faced by consumers."
In both Jefferson Parish and Eastman Kodak, the Supreme Court also gave consideration to certain theoretical "valid business reasons" proffered by the defendants as to why the arrangements should be deemed benign. In Jefferson Parish, the hospital asserted that the combination of hospital and anesthesia services eliminated multiple problems of scheduling, supply, performance standards, and equipment maintenance. The manufacturer in Eastman Kodak contended that quality control, inventory management, and the prevention of free riding justified its decision to sell parts only in conjunction with service. In neither case did the Supreme Court find those justifications sufficient if anticompetitive effects were proved. Thus, at a minimum, the admonition of the District of Columbia Circuit in Microsoft II to refrain from any product design assessment as to whether the "integration" of Windows and Internet Explorer is a "net plus," deferring to Microsoft's "plausible claim" that it is of "some advantage" to consumers, is at odds with the Supreme Court's own approach.
The significance of those cases, for this court's purposes, is to teach that resolution of product and market definitional problems must depend upon proof of commercial reality, as opposed to what might appear to be reasonable. In both cases the Supreme Court instructed that product and market definitions were to be ascertained by reference to evidence of consumers' perception of the nature of the products and the markets for them, rather than to abstract or metaphysical assumptions as to the configuration of the "product" and the "market." In the instant case, the commercial reality is that consumers today perceive operating systems and browsers as separate "products," for which there is separate demand. This is true notwithstanding the fact that the software code supplying their discrete functionalities can be commingled in virtually infinite combinations, rendering each indistinguishable from the whole in terms of files of code or any other taxonomy.
Proceeding in line with the Supreme Court cases, which are indisputably controlling, this Court first concludes that Microsoft possessed "appreciable economic power in the tying market" . . . While courts typically have not specified a percentage of the market that creates the presumption of "market power," no court has ever found that the requisite degree of power exceeds the amount necessary for a finding of monopoly power. Because this court has already found that Microsoft possesses monopoly power in the worldwide market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems (i.e., the tying product market), the threshold element of "appreciable economic power" is a fortiori met. . . .
As for the crucial requirement that Windows and Internet Explorer be deemed "separate products" for a finding of technological tying liability, this Court's Findings mandate such a conclusion. Considering the "character of demand" for the two products, as opposed to their "functional relation," Web browsers and operating systems are "distinguishable in the eyes of buyers." Consumers often base their choice of which browser should reside on their operating system on their individual demand for the specific functionalities or characteristics of a particular browser, separate and apart from the functionalities afforded by the operating system itself. Moreover, the behavior of other, lesser software vendors confirms that it is certainly efficient to provide an operating system and a browser separately, or at least in separable form. Microsoft is the only firm to refuse to license its operating system without a browser. This court concludes that Microsoft's decision to offer only the bundled -- "integrated" -- version of Windows and Internet Explorer derived not from technical necessity or business efficiencies; rather, it was the result of a deliberate and purposeful choice to quell incipient competition before it reached truly minatory proportions.
The court is fully mindful of the reasons for the admonition of the District of Columbia Circuit in Microsoft II of the perils associated with a rigid application of the traditional "separate products" test to computer software design. Given the virtually infinite malleability of software code, software upgrades and new application features, such as Web browsers, could virtually always be configured so as to be capable of separate and subsequent installation by an immediate licensee or end user. A court mechanically applying a strict "separate demand" test could improvidently wind up condemning "integrations" that represent genuine improvements to software that are benign from the standpoint of consumer welfare and a competitive market. Clearly, this is not a desirable outcome. Similar concerns have motivated other courts, as well as the District of Columbia Circuit, to resist a strict application of the "separate products" tests to similar questions of "technological tying."
To the extent that the Supreme Court has spoken authoritatively on these issues, however, this court is bound to follow its guidance and is not at liberty to extrapolate a new rule governing the tying of software products. Nevertheless, the court is confident that its conclusion, limited by the unique circumstances of this case, is consistent with the Supreme Court's teaching to date.(6)
 
B. Exclusive Dealing Arrangements
Microsoft's various contractual agreements with some OLS's, ICP's, ISV's, Compaq and Apple are also called into question by plaintiffs as exclusive dealing arrangements under the language in Section 1 prohibiting "contract s . . . in restraint of trade or commerce . . . ." Each of these agreements with Microsoft required the other party to promote and distribute Internet Explorer to the partial or complete exclusion of Navigator. In exchange, Microsoft offered, to some or all of these parties, promotional patronage, substantial financial subsidies, technical support, and other valuable consideration. Under the clear standards established by the Supreme Court, these types of "vertical restrictions" are subject to a rule of reason analysis. . . .
To evaluate an agreement's likely anticompetitive effects, courts have consistently looked at a variety of factors, including: (1) the degree of exclusivity and the relevant line of commerce implicated by the agreements' terms; (2) whether the percentage of the market foreclosed by the contracts is substantial enough to import that rivals will be largely excluded from competition; (3) the agreements' actual anticompetitive effect in the relevant line of commerce; (4) the existence of any legitimate, procompetitive business justifications offered by the defendant; (5) the length and irrevocability of the agreements; and (6) the availability of any less restrictive means for achieving the same benefits. . . .
The only agreements revealed by the evidence which could be termed so "exclusive" as to merit scrutiny under the Section 1 Rule of Reason test are the agreements Microsoft signed with Compaq, AOL and several other OLSs, the top ICPs, the leading ISVs, and Apple. The findings of fact also establish that, among the OEMs discussed supra, Compaq was the only one to fully commit itself to Microsoft's terms for distributing and promoting Internet Explorer to the exclusion of Navigator. Beginning with its decisions in 1996 and 1997 to promote Internet Explorer exclusively for its PC products, Compaq essentially ceased to distribute or pre-install Navigator at all in exchange for significant financial remuneration from Microsoft. AOL's March 12 and Oct. 28, 1996 agreements with Microsoft also guaranteed that, for all practical purposes, Internet Explorer would be AOL's browser of choice, to be distributed and promoted through AOL's dominant, flagship online service, thus leaving Navigator to fend for itself. In light of the severe shipment quotas and promotional restrictions for third-party browsers imposed by the agreements, the fact that Microsoft still permitted AOL to offer Navigator through a few subsidiary channels does not negate this conclusion. The same conclusion as to exclusionary effect can be drawn with respect to Microsoft's agreements with AT&T WorldNet, Prodigy and CompuServe, since those contract terms were almost identical to the ones contained in AOL's March 1996 agreement.
Microsoft also successfully induced some of the most popular ICPs and ISVs to commit to promote, distribute and utilize Internet Explorer technologies exclusively in their Web content in exchange for valuable placement on the Windows desktop and technical support. Specifically, the "Top Tier" and "Platinum" agreements that Microsoft formed with thirty-four of the most popular ICPs on the Web ensured that Navigator was effectively shut out of these distribution outlets for a significant period of time. . . . Notwithstanding the extent to which these "exclusive" distribution agreements preempted the most efficient channels for Navigator to achieve browser usage share, however, the Court concludes that Microsoft's multiple agreements with distributors did not ultimately deprive Netscape of the ability to have access to every PC user worldwide to offer an opportunity to install Navigator. Navigator can be downloaded from the Internet. It is available through myriad retail channels. It can (and has been) mailed directly to an unlimited number of households. How precisely it managed to do so is not shown by the evidence, but in 1998 alone, for example, Netscape was able to distribute 160 million copies of Navigator, contributing to an increase in its installed base from 15 million in 1996 to 33 million in December 1998. As such, the evidence does not support a finding that these agreements completely excluded Netscape from any constituent portion of the worldwide browser market, the relevant line of commerce.
The fact that Microsoft's arrangements with various firms did not foreclose enough of the relevant market to constitute a Section 1 violation in no way detracts from the court's assignment of liability for the same arrangements under Section 2. As noted above, all of Microsoft's agreements, including the nonexclusive ones, severely restricted Netscape's access to those distribution channels leading most efficiently to the acquisition of browser usage share. They thus rendered Netscape harmless as a platform threat and preserved Microsoft's operating system monopoly, in violation of Section 2. But virtually all the leading case authority dictates that liability under Section 1 must hinge upon whether Netscape was actually shut out of the Web browser market, or at least whether it was forced to reduce output below a subsistence level. The fact that Netscape was not allowed access to the most direct, efficient ways to cause the greatest number of consumers to use Navigator is legally irrelevant to a final determination of plaintiffs' Section 1 claims. . . .
 
III. THE STATE LAW CLAIMS
In their amended complaint, the plaintiff states assert that the same facts establishing liability under Section Section 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act mandate a finding of liability under analogous provisions in their own laws. The Court agrees. The facts proving that Microsoft unlawfully maintained its monopoly power in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act are sufficient to meet analogous elements of causes of action arising under the laws of each plaintiff state. The court reaches the same conclusion with respect to the facts establishing that Microsoft attempted to monopolize the browser market in violation of Section 2, and with respect to those facts establishing that Microsoft instituted an improper tying arrangement in violation of Section 1.
The plaintiff states concede that their laws do not condemn any act proved in this case that fails to warrant liability under the Sherman Act. States' Reply in Support of their Proposed Conclusions of Law at 1. Accordingly, the Court concludes that, for reasons identical to those stated in Section II.B, supra, the evidence in this record does not warrant finding Microsoft liable for exclusive dealing under the laws of any of the plaintiff states. . . .
The court turns finally to the counterclaim that Microsoft brings against the attorneys general of the plaintiff states under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983. In support of its claim, Microsoft argues that the attorneys general are seeking relief on the basis of state laws, repeats its assertion that the imposition of this relief would deprive it of rights granted to it by the Copyright Act, and concludes with the contention that the attorneys general are, "under color of" state law, seeking to deprive Microsoft of rights secured by federal law -- a classic violation of 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.
Having already addressed the issue of whether granting the relief sought by the attorneys general would entail conflict with the Copyright Act, the court rejects Microsoft's counterclaim on yet more fundamental grounds as well: It is inconceivable that their resort to this court could represent an effort on the part of the attorneys general to deprive Microsoft of rights guaranteed it under federal law, because this court does not possess the power to act in contravention of federal law. Therefore, since the conduct it complains of is the pursuit of relief in federal court, Microsoft fails to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983. Consequently, Microsoft's request for a declaratory judgment against the states under 28 U.S.C. Section Section 2201 and 2202 is denied, and the counterclaim is dismissed.

HEADLINE: An Abrupt Transition in Japan

 BODY:
Japan is suffering from a leadership crisis far deeper than the sudden disability of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. A new prime minister will soon be named to replace Mr. Obuchi, who was left in a coma by a stroke over the weekend and is not expected to recover. But none of the current contenders are likely to have the political clout or daring needed to energize Japan's creaky government machinery or to jolt its economy out of an almost decade-long recession.
Dismissed as a colorless hack when he took office almost two years ago, Mr. Obuchi scored some successes. He carried out a badly needed banking bailout, applied the kind of powerful fiscal stimulus that had long been sought by Japan's major trading partners, including the United States, and in the process modestly revived the political fortunes of his sagging Liberal Democratic Party. But he failed to follow up these initial economic achievements with the kind of bold deregulation that was needed to rationalize Japan's banking and business systems and to stimulate a resurgence of consumer demand. As a result, Japan's economy is once again contracting and the Liberal Democrats remain dependent on coalition partners who make it difficult to provide effective and consistent governance. 
 Japan's political system appears particularly threadbare at times of unexpected turbulence, whether they involve natural disasters like the latest volcanic eruptions of Mount Usu or human events like Mr. Obuchi's illness. For more than 24 hours the Japanese public was fed misleading information disguising the gravity of Mr. Obuchi's condition. Then came a hasty announcement that power was being passed, on a caretaker basis, to a cabinet official, Mikio Aoki, who appears to lack the political stature to hold the job on his own.
That will leave it to the Liberal Democrats' powerful faction leaders to choose among several more formidable contenders. The top candidate now seems to be Yoshiro Mori, the party's secretary general. The winner will probably serve only a few weeks before facing the voters in new elections now expected before the Group of 8 economic summit meeting in Okinawa in July. The Japanese people should use that election to demand that their political leaders show more courage in devising bold economic reforms that can lead Japan out of its prolonged and costly recession.

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT:THE DECISION;
An Eye on the Next Step

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
When Joel I. Klein filed the government's antitrust case against Microsoft nearly two years ago, he sent courtesy copies of the 53-page legal complaint to a number of appellate judges and Supreme Court justices.
The move by Mr. Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, appeared to reflect the Justice Department's judgment that -- for all of the importance of the trial before Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson -- the fate of the case would ultimately be in the hands of a higher authority. 
 Today, Judge Jackson issued his conclusions of law, and it was clear from the scope and tone of the decision that the judge shared Mr. Klein's strategic vision about the importance of trying to build legal arguments that could survive appeal.
While the judge's sweeping factual conclusions last November that Microsoft was a monopolist had practically guaranteed a ruling that the company had violated federal antitrust law, the decision today was somewhat more measured than had been anticipated. Rather than take a blunderbuss approach, Judge Jackson accepted two of the central tenets of the government's case and rejected a third.
He also took on a federal appeals court on a central issue involving the tying of Microsoft's Windows operating system with its Internet Explorer Web browser. The judge said that a three-judge appeals panel had overlooked Supreme Court precedent in 1998 when it reversed him at the outset of the case.
Hardly endearing to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that will also hear the appeal of the latest ruling, the judge's comments may find a more receptive audience at the Supreme Court. But Judge Jackson's comments are almost certain to be seized by Microsoft as an example of how the judge was unable to follow the instructions of the appeals court.
But the appeals court in Washington is often deeply polarized over high-profile legal issues, and it is difficult to predict how it will react to Judge Jackson's decision. Indeed the last Microsoft appeal in the case split one panel 2 to 1. That legal uncertainty, in fact, may ultimately lead to further settlement talks.
Judge Jackson's conclusions that Microsoft repeatedly violated the Sherman Antitrust Act may add new impetus for the government to seek to have its proposed remedies imposed on Microsoft even before the case reaches the appellate stage. Government officials today declined to discuss what remedies they would propose. Nor would they discuss whether the government would oppose an effort by Microsoft to have any remedies postponed until after the case is reviewed by higher courts, a process that may take another two years.
In the meanwhile, Judge Jackson's reasoning gives him broad latitude to impose almost any kind of remedy he may see fit. As he now begins preparing a schedule for the final phase of the case in his courtroom, today's decision could be used to justify anything from imposing tough new restrictions on Microsoft executives to breaking up the company into several pieces, as several of the attorneys general representing states have advocated.
"The department now has to almost certainly at a minimum offer a plan to break up the company," said Robert E. Litan, a former antitrust official at the Justice Department and now director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution.
Other antitrust experts predicted that the government would offer breaking up the company as one of several alternatives.
In failing to reach a settlement over the weekend, Microsoft is wagering that either it will once again find a more sympathetic appeals court bench or that advances in technology will make the case moot. Indeed, if the case still takes several years to reach a conclusion, any remedy short of a breakup could prove largely irrelevant.
The company may also benefit from a change in the White House since Governor George W. Bush, the expected Republican candidate for president, has suggested that antitrust enforcement should be confined mainly to price-fixing cases.
But today's decision will make it more difficult politically for any new administration to simply drop the case. And for the time being, Microsoft executives will continue to have to contend with Judge Jackson's powerful findings that the company repeatedly violated the Sherman Act. Any one of the judge's legal conclusions could lead to a severe punishment for Microsoft. Taken over all, they invite the state and federal governments to ask the judge to have the company split up.
The judge concluded, for instance, that Microsoft had maintained its monopoly power over operating software through anticompetitive means, ruthlessly striving over four years to crush any potential threat to its domination over operating system software. He also found that the company had tried to monopolize the market for Internet browsers in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
"In essence, Microsoft mounted a deliberate assault upon entrepreneurial efforts that, left to rise or fall on their own merits, could well have enabled the introduction of competition into the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems," the judge wrote. "While the evidence does not prove that they would have succeeded absent Microsoft's actions, it does reveal that Microsoft placed an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune, thereby effectively guaranteeing its continued dominance in the relevant market. More broadly, Microsoft's anticompetitive actions trammeled the competitive process through which the computer software industry generally stimulates innovation and conduces to the optimum benefit of consumers."
Handing a small bone to Microsoft, Judge Jackson dismissed the government's contentions that the company's marketing arrangements with other companies like Compaq and Apple Computer had violated Section 1 of the antitrust act.
But on a fourth major issue, one on which an appeals court had previously reversed him and ruled in Microsoft's favor, the judge was unyielding. Instead, he took the highly unusual position for a lower court judge of both criticizing and dismissing the appellate court decision.
The appeals decision, issued a month after the current case was filed, is one of Microsoft's strongest legal defenses. When it was handed down, it forced the government to broadly expand the case. The appeals judges lifted an injunction imposed by Judge Jackson after they found that Microsoft had not violated the Sherman Act by bundling its Windows operating system with its Internet Explorer software.
The appeals court also set a high standard for the government to make a successful case under Section 1 of the act. It said Microsoft should be free to blend its Web browser into Windows as long as it could make a "plausible claim" of business efficiency or consumer benefit from doing so.
But Judge Jackson called the appeals opinion "inconsistent with the pertinent Supreme Court precedents" and "not formally binding."

HEADLINE: As Crimes Rise In China, Four Germans Are Killed

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, April 3

 BODY:
A German family of four was stabbed to death on Sunday in Nanjing, a rare incident of violence against foreigners that underscores a creeping increase in crime in China.
The father, the deputy general manager of a DaimlerChrysler joint venture to make buses, Jurgen Pfrang, found four intruders in his house shortly after midnight on Sunday, Chinese and German officials said. Mr. Pfrang, 51, was reportedly stabbed in a struggle with the men, who killed his wife, 14-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son. 
 Guards at the housing compound in central China caught the men, four unemployed farmers from nearby Anhui province, said the Nanjing Foreign Affairs Bureau and the German consulate here. Robbery was apparently the motive.
China has long been remarkably safe for foreigners. In the 1970's and 80's, many travelers were amazed when lost wallets or even plastic combs were returned to them by Chinese eager to demonstrate the strength of their country's moral fiber. Most foreign residents still do not think twice about wandering the streets alone at any hour of the night.
But a breakdown in central control, growing income disparities and rising unemployment have gradually led to increased crime. Several foreign businessmen were killed in the late 90's. Moreover, many Americans felt less safe after NATO bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last year in the Kosovo conflict. The bombing, which few Chinese believe was accidental, set off violent demonstrations in several cities.
Most violence against foreigners has occurred in smaller cities, where the foreign presence is small. But several incidents in the last year have been in larger cities. In July, a Canadian was hacked by a machete-wielding intruder in his rented luxury villa in Shanghai. The man survived, but lost partial use of one hand. In January, a Chinese-American was found slain in a bar in Beijing.
Much of the crime has been attributed to the droves of migrant workers, many of them unemployed farmers who have congregated in China's cities looking for work. Beijing has tried various strategies to control the tide like leveling migrant shanty towns and sending vagrants home. But as China's economy continues its painful reorganization, the number of such workers grows.
In February, as many as 20,000 laid-off miners rioted in the northeastern city of Yangjiazhanzi. Last month, trains between Shanghai and Nanjing were interrupted for most of a day as protesters who lost money in a financial fraud blocked the railway.

HEADLINE: New Jersey May Allow Self-Service Gas Stations

 BODY:
New Jersey's ban on self-service gas stations could be phased out under a proposal announced yesterday by the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee that would let drivers pump their own gas at the state's 3,200 gas stations.
State Senator Gerald Cardinale, a Republican from Cresskill, said that letting drivers pump their own gas would reduce the price of petroleum by as much as 5 cents per gallon. 
 New Jersey and Oregon are the only states that require full service at all gas pumps.
"For a consumer not to be able to put a gas pump nozzle into their car and press some buttons is an absurdity," said Mr. Cardinale.
But State Senator Garry J. Furnari, a Democrat from Nutley who also serves on the Commerce Committee, said that a few pennies would not ease the concerns of consumers who watch helplessly as petroleum prices "soar out of control." Mr. Furnari, who called for more committee hearings, said Mr. Cardinale's bill would amount to a "red herring" that would mask the real issue of price gouging.
Adding self-service gas pumps was one of several proposals introduced at yesterday's committee meeting that aimed at reducing skyrocketing gas prices.
Other suggestions included urging the federal government to pass less restrictive oil-quality requirements, dredging areas near oil refineries so ships would have easier access and conducting investigations into allegations of artificial price inflation.
New Jersey has the country's fourth-lowest gas tax and one of the largest petroleum markets.

An Actor's Take On the Homeless
"If someone is unfortunate enough to be homeless, I don't think that makes him a criminal," STANLEY TUCCI said at a party at Gallagher's Steak House on West 52nd Street after the premiere of the film "Joe Gould's Secret."
Mr. Tucci stars in the film (he is also the director and a co-producer), which recounts the life of a writer who discovers an educated but deranged homeless philosopher, played by IAN HOLM. In real life the title character became infamous among artists in New York in the 1940's while compiling an oral history of the time. 
 "Joe Gould would be in prison if he lived in New York City today," Mr. Tucci said of Mr. Gould, who died in 1954. The director said he hoped the movie would prompt people to think about the homeless, especially the Giuliani administration's policy of arresting homeless people for loitering or expelling the unemployed from shelters.
"You have to remember, Joe Gould was mentally ill," Mr. Tucci said at the party last week. "Most of the homeless people on the street are. The homeless do not belong in jail."
 
Some Thanks For Financial Aid
The conversation at the Sky Club in the MetLife Building above Grand Central Terminal the other night was the kind that might be expected from any group of poets, writers and artists: namely, their need for patronage. But this group was celebrating their Guggenheim fellowship money and, more importantly, the poetry, writing and art that the money made possible.
It has been 75 years since the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation began awarding fellowships. The former fellows at the party included PAUL A. SAMUELSON, the economist and professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; EDMUND KEELEY, a professor emeritus at Princeton; the author JOYCE CAROL OATES; and JEAN STROUSE, the biographer of Alice James and J.P. Morgan. She said that she had lived for a year on her $15,000 Guggenheim grant.
The playwright WENDY WASSERSTEIN said her fellowship had allowed her to write "The Heidi Chronicles," which won a Pulitzer Prize. Winning a fellowship, she said, "means not only do you take yourself seriously, but someone else does too."
She laughed and added, "It also means you're not crazy."
 
Helping Beautify Rikers Island
So how many lawyers does it take to dig up shrubs in Rockefeller Center at 6 a.m.?
About a dozen, it turns out. They did their shovel-and-elbow-grease maneuvers in quick time, removing shrubs from the Channel Gardens and helping load them onto two trucks from the city's Department of Corrections.
They were finished by 7:16 a.m., and the last truck left at 10:07.
The digging was done for the Horticultural Society of New York, and the diggers were volunteers, although the fact that a boss was involved might have provided some inspiration.
"One of our board members, DENNIS HIRSCH, is the managing partner in mergers and acquisitions at Davis, Polk & Wardwell," said ANTHONY SMITH, the president of "the Hort," as the society is known to its members. "He is also an ardent and passionate gardener. During a board meeting, I mentioned that we needed people to dig, and I invited the entire board to be out there. There was silence in the room. Then Dennis smiled and said, 'I'll be there and my guess is that there will be a number of young associates who will want to be there too.' "
Afterward, Mr. Hirsch asked how many associates he should bring. Mr. Smith said, "As many as you can get." Mr. Hirsch mentioned 25. "I told him no, to bring maybe 10," Mr. Smith recalled.
Mr. Hirsch said that the crew he assembled was not just associates, but also some partners. "I took the 10 hardiest," he said.
The trees were taken to Rikers Island to be tended by inmates in a greenhouse the society maintains. NEIL MacFARQUHAR with C.J. Satterwhite, Karen W. Arenson and Joe Brescia

Census Time: Will the Felon Please Rise

BYLINE: By Clyde Haberman 

 BODY:
IT seems that a lot of Americans are unwilling to stand up and be counted. Or even to sit down and be counted. They have not, tsk tsk, been filling out their census forms, so the government has had to dispatch brigades of temporary workers to ring doorbells and make sure everyone is recorded.
The good news is that the temps will not have to look hard to find one group that, to borrow from Joe Louis, can neither run nor hide. We're talking about the roughly 1.8 million Americans who are behind bars, whether in federal and state prisons or in local jails. They are, if you will, down for the count. 
 There is a special wrinkle to the inmate census, a detail that has probably flown under most people's radar. Convicts are counted as residents of the place where they are imprisoned, not where they come from and where their families live. This has long been true. The same rule also applies to college students attending schools far from home.
Until recently, this qualified as an interesting but not especially important factoid. But the explosion of the prison population during the last couple of decades has changed all that. It is creating a noticeable shift in government dollars and political influence, generally to the advantage of rural areas at the expense of big cities.
Nobody can say for sure how much money is at stake in the new census, but it is safe to assume that, in New York State alone, it runs in the many millions of dollars.
New York's prisons hold nearly 72,000 inmates. Compare that with a mere 12,500 in the early 1970's, when the Attica uprising took place and prison reform captured voters' attention for a spell.
Now consider this: more than 90 percent of today's inmates are housed upstate, even though 7 of every 10 inmates in this state come from New York City.
As a result, a felon from the South Bronx doing time at the Clinton Correctional Facility is recorded as belonging to Dannemora, near the Canadian border, and not his home city.
Now multiply that fellow by 50,000, roughly the number of convicts from New York City serving sentences in northern parts. It does not require great imagination to see how there would be a transfer of poverty funds and other census-based federal payments from the five boroughs to upstate towns. Political influence would shift as well, at least to some degree, because the census is also the basis for reshaping election districts.
Where would that power go? "From low-income, inner-city neighborhoods of color to white, rural upstate areas," says City Project, a coalition of groups involved with urban issues.
That conclusion was part of a report that City Project issued yesterday, examining the extent to which New York City's crime has become upstate's economic development.
THE census is but one example. Even leaving it aside, the reality is that one prison after another has been built in rural New York during the last 20 years, 38 in all since 1982, at a cost of $4.5 billion, the report notes. Today, it says, half the state's prisons are in the districts of just four state senators, all Republicans.
The authors of the study blame pork-barrel politics, plus maybe a dab of racial bias. Total nonsense, the Republican senators reply. The reason so many prisons are built where they live, they say, is that land is cheap there and the Nimby factor is powerful in New York City and its suburbs.
No matter which side you take, there is little question that, when it comes to prison construction, Dimby rules upstate: definitely in my backyard. Prisons mean jobs and economic opportunities for hard-pressed areas that have neither. That explains why some towns practically claw one another to win state contracts.
It may also explain, the City Project report suggests, why some politicians have no interest in adjusting New York's Rockefeller-era drug laws, which have put thousands of nonviolent offenders behind bars. Those laws have come under broad attack, including from some prominent Republicans, who say that many convicts present no threat to their communities and would be better off in drug treatment programs than in prison.
"Has the economics of prison expansion blinded influential state lawmakers to the need for better criminal justice practice?" the report asks.
It doesn't directly answer the question. But it doesn't have to. As with the impact of the census, you can figure out its leanings pretty easily.

Williams Designated To Take a Back Seat

BYLINE: By Harvey Araton 

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif.

 BODY:
WHO said the Yankees didn't have a left-handed designated hitter? As long as Bernie Williams's throwing shoulder hurts, they've got the best one they've ever had.
"A dull ache, but it doesn't hurt when I swing," Williams said in a clubhouse charged with the anticipation of a new season, another one promising to last into October, no matter what those Grapefruit League standings said. 
 Somehow, the Yankees survived another Darryl Strawberry walk on the wild side, and Ed Yarnall's lack of control and a few Florida afternoons when George Steinbrenner was about to burst. That's what spring training is for, working out the kinks, weeding out the kooks and getting your serious lineup together and intentions in order just in time for opening day.
Speaking of serious and well-intentioned, here's Williams on the eve of the Yankees' 2000 debut last night -- on American soil but past everyone's bedtime back East, and how come Mark McGwire doesn't sound off about that?
"It's not that we want to win more than anybody else," Williams said before the Yankees used a familiar formula -- solid starting pitching (by Orlando Hernandez) and timely hitting -- to defeat the Angels 3-2 at Edison Field. "It's what we're playing for, the generations."
If that sounds hokey, then go explain the amazing century not long ago concluded with the Yankees' third World Series title in four years, the last two in four-game sweeps, for a 20th-century grand total of 25, or the most glorious .250 batting average there'll ever be.
Explain Williams entering a 10th season in a Yankee uniform and a 15th year at work for one organization, which is so much against the odds of modern sports economics that Williams's face must be on a dartboard somewhere in Marvin Miller's basement.
Oh, it's an old story how Williams was so close to signing with the Red Sox in November 1999 that he could smell the Fenway Park sausage. The point is, he didn't, because Steinbrenner coughed up $87.5 million (over seven years) and Williams weighed a few extra Boston millions against center field in Yankee Stadium and all that interlocking history stitched into his cap and shirt.
New York being New York, Williams heard that although he was a wonderful guy and that old softie Steinbrenner had made the sentimental decision, maybe Albert Belle would have been a better idea, given Williams's visits to the disabled list. Then the verdict came in, and the contemporary notion that long-term security is the death of motivation, especially for a player like laid-back Bernie, had been debunked.
"I'm proud of the fact that I played 158 games, despite the fact that my left shoulder was killing me in the second half of the season," he said.
He more than played; he produced. Career highs in hits (202), runs batted in (115) and runs scored (116). Yes, there were times in the early months last season when Williams seemed to be on cruise control, but, as Manager Joe Torre said, "He's one of those guys who's struggling, and you look up and he's hitting .330."
For the record, Williams hit .342, another career best. "He's our superstar on a team that supposedly doesn't have superstars," David Cone said. "Derek Jeter is the de facto captain, the guy we look to as a leader. But Bernie is the guy who can really carry us, with those power numbers."
Of course, Williams not only played down Cone's assertion that he is the difference between very good and great, but almost looked baffled by it, before deferring to his elders, like Paul O'Neill. "He's 37 and he's got 6 percent body fat," Williams said. "Being around guys like Paul motivates me."
Williams, hitless in four at-bats in his d.h. debut, should be plenty fired up after watching O'Neill's 430-foot, two-run clout over the center-field fence give the Yankees a 2-1 lead in the sixth, minutes after Hernandez fanned Mo Vaughn with the bases loaded.
You could almost smell opportunity at that point and the Yankees, as is their trademark, did not waste it. They played it training-camp cool down in Florida, but the exhibitions ended, mercifully, and the Yankees did have a better record than the Red Sox, so how bad was it?
Everybody should have the Yankees' problems. Ramiro Mendoza will cover the No. 5 spot until Steinbrenner's baseball people figure out a permanent solution. And as for the d.h., that's where Williams started last night -- with Ricky Ledee in center field -- and is likely to remain for a while.
Williams took a back seat last night. He used the extra time on the bench to hit off the tee, watch some video, root El Duque through on a night he didn't have his best stuff. All those exciting pastimes that come so naturally for a star who hides in the clubhouse, strumming his guitar. Then you look up, and he's hitting .342.

HEADLINE: Computer Scientist Picked As President of Stanford

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 3

 BODY:
Underscoring Stanford University's deep relationship with Silicon Valley, John Hennessy, the provost and a professor of electrical engineering and computer science who founded a semiconductor company, today was named president of the institution.
A well-known computer architect who has taught at Stanford for 22 years, Dr. Hennessy, who is 47, was appointed provost in July. 
 Within months he had secured a $150 million donation to the university, the largest since its founding, from James H. Clark, a former colleague in the computer science department who went on to found the Netscape Communications Corporation. The money is being used to develop Dr. Hennessy's pet project, an interdisciplinary program in biomedical engineering and sciences.
In addition to founding the semiconductor company, MIPS Technologies, Dr. Hennessy wrote with David Patterson, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, a seminal textbook on designing computers, "Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach" (Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 1990).
Despite Stanford's connections to the very start of Silicon Valley -- when the former Stanford students William Hewlett and David Packard began an electronics company in a garage in Palo Alto -- Dr. Hennessy is the university's first president with an engineering background.
Before becoming provost, he was the popular dean of the school of engineering, where he developed its first online degree program -- a master's in electrical engineering -- and increasingly offered online classes.
His appointment as president was expected; Stanford has a long history of appointing leaders from within.
Dr. Hennessy will succeed Gerhard Caspar, a constitutional law scholar who announced his retirement in September after eight years. Dr. Caspar, who said he planned to take a sabbatical and then return to teaching, transformed Stanford into one of the most effective fund-raising universities in the world, stabilizing a university that had been accused of bilking the federal government for research. Dr. Caspar directed Stanford's most comprehensive cost-cutting efforts in 30 years, remade the undergraduate curriculum and oversaw a $1 billion construction, preservation and restoration program.
In an interview this afternoon, an ebullient Dr. Hennessy said he planned to continue to "build on the foundation" that Dr. Caspar created.
One issue Dr. Hennessy faces as a Silicon Valley president is assuaging concerns that Stanford is becoming a "techie" paradise at the expense of its humanities and social science departments. An editorial in today's Stanford Daily urged him to make a special commitment to the humanities.
Dr. Hennessy said he intended to devote attention to the fields, including using his connections in Silicon Valley to help the humanities and social science departments secure more support for their programs.
"I think there are a lot of entrepreneurs who come from these backgrounds and appreciate their importance," he said.
Another challenge, Dr. Hennessy said, is keeping and recruiting faculty members in the most expensive housing market in the country. The university must also keep students from being lured away by the high-paying Silicon Valley companies before earning their degrees, he noted.
The university is finishing a housing study he commissioned as provost, he said, to address ways to develop housing that faculty members can afford. As for retaining staff and students, he said: "We're in the heat of the gold rush. After a little while it will calm down a little bit. There will still be a lot of students interested in entrepreneurship and the new economy. But they'll want to get their graduate studies done first. I fully believe that."

HEADLINE: Start-Up Need Help? Hire Dad Or Mom

BYLINE: By AMY ZIPKIN 

 BODY:
Fifteen months ago, 34-year-old Gregory P. Sullivan enlisted a retired financial executive in Lancaster, N.H., to help start an Internet company called Flagship Communications that specialized in e-support and telemarketing services.
The older man, a one-time division controller at the James River Corporation (now the Fort James Corporation) in Deerfield, Ill., became Mr. Sullivan's first employee and, overnight, his workplace confidant. He accepted a board position and even traveled to Portland, Me., and stayed in his new boss's guest house while the two worked around the clock on the project. 
 "When your child comes to you and has a need, you go," said Kevin Sullivan, 58, who is Gregory's father.
Bill Gates isn't the only Internet entrepreneur to put his dad on the payroll. (He appointed the elder Mr. Gates co-chairman of the $21.8 billion Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation last year.) In the dot-com world, peopled largely by 20-somethings and 30-whatevers, an increasing number of chief executives are turning to their fathers and mothers to tap into the one qualification the whiz kid lacks by definition: experience.
"It's amazing how common it is," said Bruce Tulgan, president of Rainmaker Thinking, a New Haven, Conn., consulting firm. "People come up to me at conferences all the time and say, 'I'm working for my child, or my dad is working for me.' "
Experts cite a variety of factors for the trend, starting with the youthfulness of dotcom chief executives. One 1998 study by the Wells Fargo Bank of San Francisco and the National Federation of Independent Business in Washington, showed that people under 35 were responsible for 42 percent of all business start-ups.
Perhaps the biggest motivator is an intangible: the desire to have older people around with old-economy skills, sound judgment and an unquestioned commitment to the boss's well-being.
"Children tend to trust their parents more than they could trust someone else," says Linda Dash, 52. Her son Darien, 28, founder of DME Interactive Holdings, a New York company that provides Internet access and customized content to minority households, hired her last May as general manager to oversee operations after it began trading publicly. "I never in a million years expected to be doing this," Ms. Dash said. As a self-described "do-everything person," she said she became computer-literate on the job. One of only two employees over 35, she dispenses motherly advice to co-workers by stressing the importance of education. "I'm having a ball," she said.
While parents like Ms. Dash bring enthusiasm and energy to their new jobs, others have resumes that would make them a catch almost anywhere.
Martin Kogon, 59, who was hired to run a unit of his son's dot-com business last year, holds an M.B.A. from Wharton and owned four businesses the last three and a half decades, including National Dynamics, Management Ventures and Central Metals Recycling, all based in Atlanta.
Since he took over as president of Websiteforfree.com, a division of Definition 6, a Web development and design company in Atlanta that his son Michael, 30, started in his garage in 1997, Mr. Kogon has helped assemble a board and taken a leading role in contract negotiations. In early January he relinquished the title to become director of special projects for the entire company.
His co-workers affectionately call him "gray matter," a reference to both his hair color and his experience, and seek his advice about everything from reading a person's character to making a home purchase. The father, though, takes care to rein in his opinions about the business. Otherwise, he said, his fellow employees would take his comments to mean, "Marty said to do it that way, either because I'm older or have more knowledge or I'm Michael's dad."
At most, his son Michael says, he might tell a midlevel manager, "If the vote were mine, this is what my suggestion would be."
Father and son have an informal strategy for resolving disagreements. "I say if you're not nice to me, I'll tell your mother," jokes the elder Mr. Kogon. In response, he says, Michael usually says: "Be nice to me, or I'll tell my mother."
For all the jesting, reversing the traditional power relationship in an office setting can be tricky. "Misunderstandings arise when roles aren't clearly defined or when parents are used to telling the child what to do," said Ross W. Nager, executive director of the Arthur Anderson Center for Family Business in Houston.
Other specialists issue even direr warnings. Paul Karofsky, executive director of Northeastern University's Center for Family Business in Boston, says he can guarantee that going into business together won't strengthen the bonds between parent and child and might weaken them. "When there's stress in the business, stress in the family comes to the fore," he said.
The elder Mr. Sullivan, the retired executive who helped his son start Flagship Communications in Maine last year, found that out. When he switched from reporting to his son's former partner to answering directly to his son, he found himself wanting to march in and issue reprimands. "The most difficult thing was the role reversal," he said. "In the office, you're Kevin, not Dad."
The younger Mr. Sullivan said he, too, had his doubts. And so, shortly after a joint venture in which Flagship Communications was a partner was spun off last January, Kevin Sullivan jumped ship and became a partner at the new company.
But Gregory Sullivan apparently could not get enough paternal advice. Three weeks before his father left, he hired his stepfather, Bob Gilbert, 64, to fill the newly created position of executive vice president for operations.
"I'm doing it because I love Gregg," said Mr. Gilbert, who has 23 years of experience in selling and establishing fulfillment and lead distribution systems. Another reason for choosing Flagship Communications over several competing offers, he said, was that it did not require relocation.
So far, he has no regrets. "I've told the human-resources guy: get a mix of people in here," he said. If I'm having this much fun, why shouldn't other people?"

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Thenew economy causes a shift in the way two Madison Avenue agencies serve clients.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
TWO well-known agencies based in New York are reorganizing in ways that are indicative of the substantive shifts taking place along Madison Avenue to try matching the pace of change in cyberspace and at client companies.
One agency, Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer/ Euro RSCG, is combining under one roof a variety of services outside the realm of traditional advertising that include interactive marketing, sales promotion, retail advertising, data base management, direct marketing and design. 
 Those communications services are being offered by Messner Vetere, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising, under the name Fuel North America. That had been the name of a unit devoted to handling the retail account of a large client, Volvo.
And Mezzina/Brown, an agency that has added a skein of dot-com accounts to a client roster that includes DuPont; Goldman, Sachs; and R. J. Reynolds, is being reorganized under the name Mezzina Brown & Partners. The goal of the principals of Mezzina Brown, who are teaming up with outside companies that include Netcentric Partners, a venture capital firm, is to place additional emphasis on business development for so-called new-economy marketers.
Ron Berger, chief executive and chief creative officer at Messner Vetere, offered an explanation of the shifts at his agency that described the motivations of both shops.
"We want to design and evolve the agency's offerings to reflect where the world is today," Mr. Berger said, "building on our experience with brands and our clients' needs."
Fuel North America has about 140 employees handling assignments with billings estimated at $100 million, which include the Volvo retail account, creating campaigns for the automaker's dealer associations, as well as for other Messner Vetere clients like Intel, MCI WorldCom, J. P. Morgan, New Balance, Philips and Schering-Plough.
Among the operations being combined under the Fuel North America banner, in addition to the Volvo unit, are the New York office of Cohn & Wells Partners, which specialized in direct marketing; Compelling Content, an interactive agency acquired in September by Cohn & Wells; and the Messner Vetere divisions focused on design, sales promotion and Internet ad work.
Fuel North America, which reports to Mr. Berger, has four partners, headed by Beth Waxman, 37, managing director, who continues as a partner at Messner Vetere, where she had been overseeing the Intel account. The other partners at Fuel North America, all creative directors, are: Bertrand Garbassi, 40; Marshall Karp, who declined to give his age; and Paul Trantanella, 37.
At Mezzina Brown, which has about 120 employees and billings estimated at $145 million, a highlight of the restructuring is the formation of a specialty division, MB Capital and Consultancy, "devoted to helping pre-I.P.O. dot-coms identify business models, determine efficient revenue streams and even if necessary write their business plans," said William G. Brown Jr.
Mr. Brown, 52, becomes senior partner and chief executive of the agency after serving as president before the reorganization. John Mezzina, 51, shifts from chairman and executive creative director to senior partner and chief strategy officer. Mark A. Morrissey, 41, executive vice president and client services director, becomes partner and chief operating officer. And David Frutko, 49, continues as chief financial officer while moving from executive vice president to partner.
Mr. Brown said that Mr. Mezzina would take "a temporary leave of absence" from the agency to focus on Freeride.com L.L.C., an Internet company spun off from Mezzina/ Brown in 1996 that offers computer users rewards meant to strengthen their ties to companies with which they do business.
"John's leave is to shepherd that business to the next level," Mr. Brown said, smiling. He declined to elaborate.
Can you say initial public offering?
Among the dot-com clients of Mezzina Brown, which started an interactive division in 1993, are Freeride.com, NexGenix, Newsweek magazine, Real Media, VarsityPlanet.com and Wit Capital.
"In response to the new economy, we've created our consultancy group," Mr. Brown said, "which can also help source capital through Netcentric Partners," with a war chest planned to reach $200 million.
Cheryl L. Benton is joining Mezzina Brown as managing director for interactive services, overseeing the MB Interactive division. Ms. Benton, 49, had been executive vice president at JMCP Touch Interactive, a division of Jordan McGrath Case & Partners/Euro RSCG, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas.
In another change, seven top executives at Mezzina Brown are being promoted because, Mr. Brown said, "with the dramatic shift in the marketplace for key talent, it's important to offer partnerships to our key players."
The new partners are: Jean Andrews, 38, manager for strategic support services; Robert Earl, 58, managing director for direct marketing creative services; Robert Moore, 47, managing director for account services; Clark Moss, 38, managing director for creative services; Donna L. Walters, 36, managing director for graphic services; Gary Watson, 40, managing director for client services; and Margaret A. Williams, who declined to give her age, managing director for administrative services. The majority shareholders are Messrs. Brown, Frutko, Mezzina and Morrissey.

An Entertainment Titan Finds a Home Where the Action Is

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
The initials SFX may not be as well known in the theater district as TKTS, but just give them time. Say, about six months.
That is when SFX Entertainment Inc., which has quickly become the nation's largest provider of live entertainment, plans to move into the Candler Building, 220 West 42nd Street. Across the street is the Ford Center for the Performing Arts, one of 120 theaters, amphitheaters, arenas and concert halls that SFX controls in the United States. 
 "A lot of our business is right there in the neighborhood," said Michael G. Ferrel, president and chief executive of SFX Entertainment.
The company is leasing the entire 24-story Candler Building for 20 years from Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers of Hartford, a subsidiary of the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company.
Cornerstone, meanwhile, is close to finishing the Muse, a 200-room hotel that has been created by remodeling and expanding the former Leavitt Building, a 12-story manufacturing loft at 130 West 46th Street.
On the ground floor of the hotel, which is to open in July, will be a 75-seat restaurant designed by David Rockwell, of the Manhattan firm Rockwellgroup, and managed by Gino Diaferia, a partner in the Veritas restaurant, 43 East 20th Street.
Rates at the Muse will run from $250 to $350 a night for rooms and $450 to $600 for suites. It is to be operated by Interstate Hotels of Pittsburgh and was designed by Perkins & Will/Lapidus.
"These two properties are indicative of our philosophy -- doing sound research about markets and where growth lies," said Thomas G. Dudeck, a managing director of Cornerstone. But the rebirth of Times Square, he acknowledged, occurred "with more velocity than we thought."
So has the growth of SFX Entertainment, which Robert F. X. Sillerman spun off in 1998 from SFX Broadcasting. (In radio jargon, "SFX" stands for "sound effects.") The company has consolidated the live-entertainment industry by acquiring companies including Delsener/Slater Enterprises, Bill Graham Presents, the Pace Entertainment Corporation and Livent Inc., builders of the Ford Center. SFX produces everything from Broadway shows to monster-truck events.
SFX plans to merge later this year with Clear Channel Communications Inc. of San Antonio, which operates 867 radio stations, 19 television stations and 550,000 outdoor advertising displays. Corporate headquarters will be in Texas, but the SFX unit will stay in New York, Mr. Ferrel said.
The Candler Building can accommodate 500 to 600 employees, said Peter A. Strauss, vice president and assistant general counsel of SFX.
SFX now has 13 offices in New York, including space in 650 Madison Avenue, at 59th Street; 150 East 58th Street; 888 Seventh Avenue, at 56th Street; and 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street. Many of these offices will be consolidated in the Candler Building.
The company is to receive $3.5 million in tax breaks, tied to job retention, relocation and creation, from the New York City Industrial Development Agency. It will also receive a $500,000 grant from the Empire State Development Corporation.
"SFX is one of the premier -- if not the premier -- entertainment booking agencies," said Michael G. Carey, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. "To have this sort of company on 42nd Street is a tremendous accomplishment."
As 42nd Street reached its nadir, the fortunes of the Candler Building also ebbed. In the 1980's, its occupancy rate dropped to zero, it figured in a municipal corruption scandal and it went into foreclosure.
But there was no discussion of demolishing the building, because zoning rules would have prohibited anything larger on the site, said Stephen J. Schofel, executive managing director of GVA Williams, the leasing and managing agent since 1992.
Instead, Cornerstone renovated the exterior and rebuilt the interior, going so far as to move all four passenger elevator shafts to create more efficient layouts. "The floor slabs and the steel are the same," Mr. Schofel said. "Everything else has been upgraded."
Neither Cornerstone, GVA Williams nor SFX would disclose the rent. And it is difficult to assess independently, because the building includes highly desirable retail frontage, oddly shaped midrise floors and upper stories with such sweeping panoramas that they seem to be suspended in space.
According to Julien J. Studley Inc., the New York brokerage firm that represented SFX, the average annual rent in mid-Manhattan at the end of 1999 for other than Class A office space was $44 a square foot. That suggests that SFX is paying around $10 million annually for its 227,000 square feet in the Candler Building, but this could not be confirmed.
Cornerstone invested about $40 million redeveloping the tower, constructed in 1913 by Asa Griggs Candler, who built the Coca-Cola Company into a national giant. The renovation is by the Manhattan architectural firm Swanke Hayden Connell. The original architects of the white terra-cotta tower were Willauer, Shape & Bready.
Ornamenting the arches in the fourth-floor windows, above an entablature inscribed "Candler," are the state seals of his native Georgia, followed by Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.
The base of the building will probably have three floors of retail space. No tenant has been signed yet, Mr. Strauss said, but whoever takes the space could build a five-story sign outside.
It will be a challenge to design such a sign without obscuring the facade of the building, which is not a city landmark but is on the National Register of Historic Places, a status that allowed the owners to claim a tax credit for the renovation.
"We and SFX are fully aware of the architectural significance of the building," said Mr. Dudeck of Cornerstone. "The historic tax credit and the historic character of the building have to be taken into account."

HEADLINE: A Peru 'Phenomenon': Rags to Presidential Bid

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru April 4

 BODY:
Alejandro Toledo grew up shining shoes in the grimy port city of Chimbote, one of 16 brothers and sisters whose father was a bricklayer and whose mother sold fish in a street market.
It is an unlikely background for a would-be president in class-conscious Peru. But today Mr. Toledo is doing something that Mario Vargas Llosa, this century's most prominent Peruvian author, could not do in 1990 and that Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former United Nations secretary general, could not do in 1995. 
 Mr. Toledo is giving President Alberto K. Fujimori, the "giant killer" in those two previous runs for the presidency, the toughest political battle of his life. Mr. Toledo is attracting votes from disaffected urban lower-class voters who are rejecting the traditional ruling elites.
Only five weeks ago, Mr. Toledo was a little known business school professor, one with a remarkable rags-to-middle-class story but no credible chance of defeating Mr. Fujimori. His extraordinary political climb -- leapfrogging over several formidable opposition candidates, including the mayor of Lima and a former director of the social security system -- has been called the "Toledo phenomenon" by the press here.
The polls indicate that he will probably stop Mr. Fujimori from winning a first-round victory in the presidential election on Sunday unless there is fraud and that he could even beat Mr. Fujimori in a runoff, which would be in May or June.
The "Toledo phenomenon" represents the coming of age of a huge class of Peruvians: the more than eight million people who have migrated from mostly Indian villages in the Andean highlands to cities across the country in the last 30 years. These Peruvians have given up their little plots of land to work in factories or on fishing boats or simply to beg in the streets.
Mr. Toledo has strong Indian physical traits, making him popular with Indians and those of mixed race, who are known as mestizos or, in Peruvian slang, "cholos." And at 54 he has accomplished the cholo dream of achieving an education, rising from poverty and marrying a woman of higher social status.
Mr. Toledo earned a doctorate at Stanford University, where he met his wife, Eliane Karp, a Belgian-born naturalized American citizen who is an anthropologist and consultant.
"When these people see that I can become president, they realize they can become president too," said Mr. Toledo, seated with his legs intertwined comfortably with his wife's in their rented campaign plane. "It is a matter of hopes and dreams. I'm an example of what people can do who have good health care and an education."
As Mr. Toledo travels across the country, the enthusiasm surrounding his candidacy has grown from week to week even though he has never held high office and who might make up his future cabinet is a total mystery. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people block his campaign caravans along roads and jump on top of his "cholomobile" van in what sometimes appears to be mad, uncontrolled excitement.
On the stump, Mr. Toledo mixes moving accounts of his youth with a centrist message that promises more government loans for small businesses and farmers and a gradual phasing out of government handouts of milk and cereal. He takes the time to explain the importance of balancing the government budget and attracting foreign investment -- and in a break from customary Peruvian politics, makes a point of saying that he cannot promise easy, instant solutions to this country's vast social problems.
"I didn't bring you rice or cooking oil because votes cannot be bought," he said, in a pointed criticism of President Fujimori's campaign tactics, before a screaming crowd of 25,000 in the agricultural center of Ica last Friday night. "I've come to bring my talents to bear to offer you jobs, jobs, jobs. I know my people and my people don't want charity. They want jobs."
The crowd responded by chanting what has become the unofficial slogan of Mr. Toledo's campaign, "Cholo si, Chino no!" a reference to Mr. Fujimori, who is popularly known as "El Chino" even though he is of Japanese descent.
Mr. Toledo went on to invite everyone to his inaugural party, where he promised to serve local favorites like fermented corn juice, sweet potatoes and ceviche, marinated raw fish. The crowded responded robustly, chanting, "Toledo is justice!" and "The dictatorship will fall!"
Many of those same people had turned in the past to Mr. Fujimori -- who comes from an immigrant family of fairly modest means -- as an alternative to Mr. Vargas Llosa and Mr. Perez de Cuellar, representatives of the traditional light-skinned Lima elite who are the descendants of the Spanish colonial power structure. But now an increasing number of Peruvians are choosing someone whose features and background more closely resembles theirs.
"From the submissive cholo, Toledo has risen to the sure-footed cholo, and that automatically makes him a leader -- and with a blonde, gringa wife to boot," said Raul Vargas Vega, director of Radioprogramas, Peru's leading radio network. "He has a story that is similar to hundreds of thousands of Peruvians but with a successful ending."
So far, Mr. Fujimori remains ahead in Lima, where he controls most of the news media and has delivered an array of social programs to the shantytowns, as well as in the rural Indian areas, where his free milk and cereal programs still benefit hundreds of thousands of poor people.
But about half of the population of Peru now live in middle-sized cities where people have given up their Indian ways but now appear to have a renewed respect for their ethnic identity. It is in those places, cities like Ica, Iquitos and Arequipa, where Mr. Toledo's campaign has taken off.
The crowds seem not to care that Mr. Toledo is entirely untested as a leader and that he is viewed, perhaps unfairly, as an untrustworthy opportunist by other opposition leaders. Those leaders have openly attacked Vladimiro Montesinos, Mr. Fujimori's intelligence chief, for engaging in dirty campaign tricks. Mr. Toledo has not been spared, but he has responded differently.
Newspapers that are said to take directions from Mr. Montesinos have bombarded Mr. Toledo with charges that he was an adviser to a shady financier whose pyramid scheme collapsed a few years ago and that he has an illegitimate daughter he does not support. But Mr. Toledo, who denies the charges, has quietly sent emissaries to aides of Mr. Montesinos to open talks with him. And with Mr. Toledo's poll numbers continuing to move skyward, he attributes his ability to overcome the attacks to his innate toughness, his wife's support and his ethnic appeal.
Mr. Toledo got his big break in life at 16 when Peace Corps volunteers helped him obtain a one-year scholarship to the University of San Francisco. He managed to continue his studies by pumping gas and getting a soccer scholarship.
He went on to earn two master's degrees and a doctorate in the economics of human resources. He eventually became chief economic adviser to the president of the Central Bank and the minister of labor during the Fernando Belaunde government of the early 1980's. He has since worked for the World Bank and directed research at a prestigious Lima business school.
"I'm a dreamer," Mr. Toledo said, "and I don't apologize for it."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
U.S. TradeRepresentative May Take Action Against Mexico

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, April 4

 BODY:
The United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said today that Mexico was failing to support competition in telecommunications and warned that she might take action against Mexico before the World Trade Organization.
"In Mexico, it appears that progress towards a level playing field for telecommunications carriers is now stalled," Ms. Barshefsky said, calling the situation "extremely serious." 
 The United States will decide by July 28 whether to lodge a formal grievance against Mexico with the W.T.O., the Geneva-based group that makes the rules for global commerce. If the W.T.O. were to rule in favor of the United States, Mexico could face punitive sanctions.
The notice to Mexico was part of an annual United States review in which Ms. Barshefsky also threatened to file W.T.O. complaints against South Africa because its telecommunications monopoly had refused to provide high-volume private circuits to competitors.
 AT&T and MCI WorldCom have pressed the trade representative to take Mexico to the W.T.O., arguing that Telefonos de Mexico has abused its advantages as a former monopoly to suppress competition in the Mexican telecommunications industry. Telmex stopped providing dedicated lines for Internet and business service to competitors and charges high rates to complete long-distance calls carried by other companies, the competitors said.
Between them the two international telecommunications giants have invested more than $2 billion in building new networks in Mexico.
The trade representative also criticized Mexican regulators for not bringing Telmex into line. On March 27, only days before the United States' report was due, the Mexican regulatory agency announced new rules to force Telmex to bring down costs and provide services to its competitors. But Ms. Barshefsky's report noted that "Telmex has frustrated similar efforts over the past two years." Telmex has vowed to challenge the regulator's new rules.
The report also criticized Israel for imposing extra charges on calls to the United States and Canada that it did not charge for any other country. Israel has announced that it will cancel the surcharges by Dec. 31, 2001. The trade representative said she could go to the W.T.O. if Israel did not eliminate the charge.

HEADLINE: A Key Economic Forecasting Gauge Declined Slightly in February

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The index of leading economic indicators fell in February for the first time in five months as factory orders for capital goods, building permits and stocks declined, a private research group reported yesterday.
The Conference Board's index decreased 0.3 percent in February, after rising 0.2 percent in January. The drop in the index, a gauge of future growth, comes after three successive monthly increases and because of that it does not signal that the record economic expansion is in jeopardy. 
 "We don't think the decline in February indicates any economic softness," said Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM MoneyWatch in New York. "We will probably see some rebound next month."
That suggests that a series of five rate increases by Federal Reserve policy makers since June has yet to slow growth as intended. Even the rate-sensitive housing industry is still showing signs of strength.
Homebuilders completed work on more houses in February than they had in a year. Housing completions rose 7.5 percent that month, to an annual rate of 1.712 million after falling 4.9 percent to a pace of 1.593 million units in January. Housing construction has not slowed in the first two months of the year from last year's pace, when 1.636 million houses were completed.
The February drop in the leading indicators index was the first since a 0.1 percent decline in September. Yesterday's report showed 8 of the 10 index components were negative contributors in February, and 2 had positive effects. Negative contributors were a narrower spread between 10-year Treasury notes and the Federal Reserve's overnight bank lending rate, drops in building permits, orders for nonmilitary capital goods, stock prices, money supply and consumer expectations, faster supplier deliveries and a rise in jobless claims. Increases in factory worker hours and consumer goods orders were positive contributors.

HEADLINE: Sears Agrees to Change Sabbath Work Policy

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Sears, Roebuck & Company has reached a settlement with the New York State attorney general's office that will bar its stores from firing employees or rejecting job candidates because their religion forbids them to work on certain days.
The agreement stems from a Sears policy that required repair technicians to work on Saturdays. The policy was challenged by Orthodox Jews, who observe the Sabbath on Saturdays, and will also apply to Seventh-day Adventists and other groups. 
 The settlement, which was filed yesterday in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, comes after five months of negotiations between Sears and the state attorney general's office.
The agreement applies only to Sears operations in New York State, but the attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, said in an interview that "any company that sees our agreement with Sears should understand that if we hear of evidence of them acting similarly, they will be getting a call from us."
Peggy Palter, a corporate spokeswoman for Sears, which is based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., denied that it had discriminated against anyone but acknowledged that its schedules might have been limiting to some workers.
Ms. Palter said the company had agreed to an 18-month trial period in which its New York State repair operations will be open on Sundays to accommodate schedules of those who observe the Sabbath on Saturdays.
She said the agreement allowed the company to return to the state attorney general for further negotiations if being open on Sundays proved to be an economic hardship for the company.
According to the agreement, Sears must provide back pay and hire the initial five complainants and pay their legal fees, create a work schedule to accommodate those who observe the Sabbath on Saturdays, and train all company employees involved in hiring and training to deal with religious accommodations.
The agreement also allows anyone who comes forward with a similar complaint in the next 90 days to take it to arbitration. The company also has to pay $100,000 for the cost of the attorney general's investigation, $225,000 for the American Law Institute to establish additional training materials on religious accommodations, and 10 scholarships for Sabbath-observant people to attend technical school.
The case began in December 1998, when Richard Katz, an Orthodox Jew from Borough Park, Brooklyn, applied for a job as a repair technician at the Sears office at 4701 Glenwood Road. Mr. Katz said that he was told that he had scored high on the test but that the managers told him that he would not be hired because he was unable to work on Saturdays. Mr. Katz said he offered to work on Sundays or nights but was rebuffed.
Sears officials, in interviews and court papers, repeatedly asserted that the reason for this problem was because Saturdays were the busiest days, but state law enforcement officials said that was untrue. The attorney general's office began investigating in October of last year and started negotiations with Sears, which were completed last week.
In 1972, Congress amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require employers to accommodate reasonably an employee's religious practice or observance, unless to do so would impose an undue hardship on the company. This standard applied to scheduling of work on Sabbath days, as well as accommodations for those required to wear religious garb.
But legal experts said a series of later Supreme Court rulings set the financial standard of undue hardship so low that it had made it difficult for employees, especially when dealing with scheduling, to win such cases.
Since 1997, dozens of religious organizations have been lobbying Congress to pass a workplace religious freedom act, which would more strictly define and raise the undue-hardship standard.

HEADLINE: Newark's Rebirth Pushes Westward;
On a Clear Day, Future Is Visible From the City's Tallest Building

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, April 4

 BODY:
On any given day, as many as 250 construction workers, plumbers, electricians, restoration specialists and elevator mechanics buzz like bees in and out of the city's tallest building, a 34-story Art Deco confection on the main downtown street.
For the last 18 months, they have been remaking the 70-year-old building at 744 Broad Street, a sentinel on the farthest outpost of Newark's revival. 
 Just about everything these days is viewed as a test of the city's rebirth: from the large, like the March announcement that the New Jersey Nets and Devils teams would be under the same ownership, making a new downtown arena more likely; to the small, such as the prospect of the city's first Starbucks.
So, what happens with 744 Broad is a test of the demand for office space; specifically, whether it can move beyond the Gateway complex, the safe haven of glass and steel built from 1971 to 1988. Clustered around Pennsylvania Station, the four block-shaped structures are connected, fortresslike, by pedestrian bridges. They have been the most marketable and indeed the only prime office space in the city, in large part because of fears about street crime.
But now, just three blocks away, 744 Broad beckons potential tenants to the grand, weathered structures on the old boulevard that have spanned the boom, bust, riot and decay of New Jersey's largest city.
"Perception is as important as reality for places like Newark," said Donald Eisen, executive managing director of Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey. "And every success to a place like Newark is outsized and has a big impact."
Completed in 1930 as the Newark and Essex National Bank Building, the tower at 744 Broad was a showpiece. With its interior gilding, intricate molding, classical touches and massive murals depicting high points in the city's history from Colonial times onward, it was the apotheosis of Newark as the banking and legal center of New Jersey.
After the city's fortunes sagged, and then plummeted in the 1960's, the building's blue chip tenants left the city. Neglected for two decades, the building sits amid a hodgepodge of sidewalk merchants hawking umbrellas and handbags, as well as sneaker emporiums and cheap retail shops that serve the city's mostly poor, black residents.
The Cogswell Realty Group bought the skyscraper in 1998 at a fire-sale price of $7 million, with plans to invest $50 million into refurbishing it. The investors are restoring the gold leafing and plaster molding to its grand, vaulted entry and are repointing the brickwork. They are refitting the building with 144 strands of fiber optic cabling per floor, T-1 lines for high-speed Internet access throughout, and new coaxial cable.
Arthur Stern, the group's president, said Cogswell was marketing the office space, with some modest success, to high-technology businesses. The space rents for $23 to $33 per square foot, depending on the floor, compared with rents of $28.50 per square foot for the limited available space at the Gateway Center.
Fittingly, a large retail space under renovation on the ground floor is planned as the home of Newark's first Starbucks, Mr. Stern said. A Starbucks spokesman said it did not comment on new outlets until leases were signed.
"If Starbucks comes, can the Gap be far behind?" asked Florence Reichenberg, a partner in a California interiors company, Space Design, which recently signed a lease.
Cogswell is about to close on the purchase of another building across the street at 765 Broad Street, which it plans to refurbish. The company also owns a 30-story downtown office building at 1180 Raymond Boulevard, which it is trying to retrofit as dormitories for students from nearby Seton Hall University Law School, Rutgers Law School and the University of Medicine and Dentistry.
But the new buoyancy on Broad Street has its limits, as well as its skeptics. When Cogswell bought the old bank building, about a quarter of it was occupied. That has risen to 75 percent, but the space remains a difficult sell, some real estate analysts say.
Mr. Eisen of Cushman & Wakefield said the building's layout was too idiosyncratic to qualify as "Class A office space," but that it had charm for renters who did not want "plain vanilla." Many new e-commerce companies and Internet start-ups like such space, he said, and it is even more in demand because the prime space at Gateway is all leased.
There have been difficulties. In January, a leaseholder that planned to operate a restaurant on the restored mezzanine was ousted in a dispute with the building's management. Mr. Stern has renewed the search for a restaurateur willing to take on the conspicuously ornate space, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, that once housed banking cages and was the building's prosperous face in its heyday.
Some of the building's neighbors are ambivalent, hoping for its success but wondering what that may mean for them. "I'm for anything that improves the city's image," said Carmine Masullo, who with his sister, Maria, owns and operates Jim's Tools a block away on Market Street.
But, Mr. Masullo said, "We have been here in the lean times, and there is a chance that we may not be here for the fat times."
Looking around his narrow, cluttered hardware store, he said it was the antithesis of a fancy franchise store, adding, "I now find myself wondering how this place will look as a Houlihan's or a T.G.I. Friday's."
Irvin McKnight, the owner of Heaven on Earth, a men's clothing store that has been three blocks to the north for 28 years, was bitter but resigned. He said that he and several other minority-group business owners who had done well with low rents and a loyal clientele, despite years of being redlined by lenders, feared that "gentrification on a large scale" would shut them out.
"There is no doubt in my mind that Newark is coming back," Mr. McKnight said. "The question is whether it is coming back black."
Not all black business owners feel that way. Feldman Middleton, a partner in the Commerce Food Court, a downtown lunch spot that caters to office workers, is cheered by the resurgence and said the new tenants at 744 Broad were "redefining Newark."
Other second-tier cities in the Northeast are searching for ways to revive their central business districts, but Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University, said Newark has unique features at its disposal: the three-year-old New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts; the determined faithfulness of some large corporations like Prudential Insurance, which kept its headquarters here; and a major airport 10 minutes from downtown.
"It took years for Newark to decline, and it will take years to come back," Mr. Moss said. "And one Starbucks doesn't do it."
Mr. Stern of Cogswell talks about his building with a pioneer's zeal, saying he has taken advantage of the extensive fiber optics network installed in Newark by Bell Atlantic, which has its state headquarters here.
"The challenge here was to take all of the original elements like moldings, architectural touches, mahogany-paneled elevators, and restore them, while supplementing the building with new technology and bandwidth capability," he said. "We think it is the combination of these things that make the difference."
His tenants share his zeal. Ellen Traberman, president of Quickcut, a software company that moved from Poughkeepsie, N.Y., said it was important for her company to have high-speed Internet connections. And, she said, "I'm an Art Deco fan." She acknowledged that Newark's checkered past had been a concern. "But we saw a resurgence here, and wanted to be a part of it," she said.
A bit of nostalgia caused Gerald Krovatin, a well-known criminal defense lawyer, to move his law office from the suburbs to the building's 19th floor in December. He said his first job out of law school was at a firm that had offices in the building until the mid-1980's. "I was where the action was," he said, and he said he felt a bit like that again.
"We all wondered what Cogswell would do with this great old lady that had gone to rack and ruin," he said. "But there is scaffolding and plaster dust everywhere, and things are happening here again. I think I'm catching the wave and even getting a little ahead of it by being here."
Ms. Reichenberg of Space Design said the company chose Newark because of a northern New Jersey market that included clients like Microsoft, Lucent and AT&T. She said the company's West Coast growth had tracked the blossoming of dot-com culture in aging urban settings like Oakland, Calif.
"We tend to go where that kind of growth is taking place and where everybody is looking for that new frontier, that new value," she said. "And Newark is that new frontier."

HEADLINE: 2 Phone Giants Said to Be Near Deal to Merge Wireless Units

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Hoping to create a national giant in wireless communications, BellSouth and SBC Communications are near a deal to merge their North American wireless operations, executives close to the negotiations said yesterday.
The companies' boards were scheduled to meet last night to approve the deal, the executives said, and the companies hope to announce the agreement as soon as today. 
 BellSouth and SBC, which does business as Ameritech, Pacific Bell and Southwestern Bell, declined to comment.
After years of fragmentation, the wireless communications business is now in a period of furious consolidation. As wireless companies merge and form wide-ranging joint ventures, they are searching mostly to expand their geographic reach.
Controlling a national network allows a wireless carrier to attract customers looking to use their cellular phones across the nation. But at least as important, a nationwide system also allows carriers to achieve economies of scale in advertising and marketing and allows them to reduce the "roaming" fees they pay when their customers use other carriers' systems.
BellSouth and SBC, both created in the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1984, are each titans in the local telephone business. SBC, the No. 1 local phone company, is the main local carrier from Illinois to Texas and also in California. BellSouth is the dominant local phone company from the Carolinas to Florida to Louisiana.
But neither company's wireless operation yet enjoys national scope. By merging, the combined BellSouth-SBC wireless unit, concentrated in the fast-growing Sun Belt, would be able to serve more than half the nation's population.
The combined wireless unit would serve more than 16 million total subscribers and would have annual revenue of more than $8 billion. Based on the valuations that investors have given other wireless companies, the combined unit would probably have a market value of at least $60 billion were it publicly traded.
People close to the deal said that BellSouth and SBC do intend to offer stock in the new unit to the public, though perhaps not until early next year.
Last year, Bell Atlantic and Vodafone AirTouch P.L.C. reached a similar deal to merge their United States wireless operations and on Monday, Bell Atlantic announced that it would call the new venture Verizon Wireless. Yesterday, the new Bell Atlantic-Vodafone operation said it would sell stock to the public but did not say when the initial offering would take place or how much stock would be put up for sale.
In any case, the numbers are likely to be big for both Verizon and the combined BellSouth-SBC unit. Last week, AT&T said that it intended to raise up to $13.2 billion when it sold new shares meant to track its national wireless operation. AT&T's offering will probably take place late this month.
Because federal rules do not allow one company to own multiple major wireless licenses in any given market, Bell Atlantic, Vodafone and GTE, which has agreed to be acquired by Bell Atlantic, have faced the prospect of shedding broad swaths of their overlapping wireless properties. SBC dealt with the same issue after it agreed to acquire Ameritech; SBC and Ameritech were wireless competitors in markets including Chicago and St. Louis.
It would take months for SBC and BellSouth to win regulatory approval for their joint venture, but they would not face nearly as much of a divestiture problem because the two companies' wireless units do not overlap much, analysts said.
What will overlap, however, are the two companies' management roles. According to executives close to the talks, SBC and BellSouth will have equal power over management decisions in their new venture, overseeing a single chief executive.
That is something of a departure for SBC, which has traditionally preferred to control its ventures outright. But BellSouth insisted that it not be a junior partner to SBC, executives close to the talks said, and in the end SBC agreed to share control.
That was not the first time the two companies had had that discussion. Before SBC agreed to acquire Ameritech in 1998, SBC had in fact preferred the idea of acquiring BellSouth, according to people close to those discussions. But BellSouth would not sell and Ameritech would.
In the new wireless venture, SBC will control 60 percent of the economic interest while BellSouth will control 40 percent, reflecting the fact that SBC's existing wireless business is bigger than BellSouth's, according to an executive close to the talks.
One person close to the deal said that SBC and BellSouth had not yet decided on a chief executive for the new operation. The person added that SBC and BellSouth intended to form a new brand for the new unit, but said the companies had not yet created it.
The new wireless venture, which is to involve the companies' wireless holdings both in the United States and the Caribbean, is set to include not only wireless telephone systems but also wireless data networks. BellSouth controls the national network used by the new Palm VII handheld computer.

Prices on Treasury Issues Rise For Seventh Consecutive Session

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury prices bolted higher for their seventh consecutive session yesterday as a huge midday sell-off in stocks sent investors racing to the safety of government securities.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gained 20/32to 10627/32 and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell from 5.81 Monday to 5.77 percent, its lowest since May 25 when it was at 5.74. 
 Wall Street dealers said the 13.6 percent midsession decline on the Nasdaq index set off a rush into Treasuries just as dealers were scrambling to find securities after the Federal Reserve reportedly bought nearly $10 billion in bills and notes for the Bank of Japan.
"People misjudged the magnitude of nearly $10 billion of securities and you throw in a stock market which was down more than 10 percent at one point. That's a pretty strong cocktail thrown at the market," said Bill Kirby, head of governments trading at Prudential Securities.
"There was definitely some panic buying," said one trader at a primary dealer.
Analysts said while shorter-dated issues benefited from a flight-to-quality asset allocation out of stocks, longer-dated Treasuries were also lifted by hopes that stock declines would reduce the need for significantly higher interest rates to rein in the still-booming economy.
"You're having a reversal of the wealth effect, which should impact consumer confidence and consumer demand, which should help stay the Fed, which should be good news for yields," said Bill Hornbarger, fixed income strategist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
Analysts said Friday's government report on employment, which usually adds a cautious tone to trading, would return to the forefront but took a back seat to gyrations in equities yesterday, as it did in Monday's session.

HEADLINE: Bill to Raise Basic Wage Advances In Hartford

BYLINE: By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 4

 BODY:
A bill to increase Connecticut's minimum wage to $6.75 an hour was approved today by a key legislative committee, a measure that, if approved by the General Assembly, would give the state the highest minimum wage in the nation next year, along with Massachusetts.
Despite today's vote, it remains unclear whether the bill will be approved by the House of Representatives and the Senate before this year's extra-short session ends on May 3. It is also uncertain whether the full 60-cent increase will be enacted. 
 The bill's prospects were complicated by today's vote in the General Assembly's Joint Appropriations Committee, which eliminated a provision to tie any future increases in the state's minimum wage to the annual rate of inflation.
That amendment was approved by the Appropriations Committee chairman, Senator Joseph J. Crisco Jr., a Democrat from Woodbridge, despite an oral vote by committee members that appeared to defeat it. It could damage the bill's chances by effectively delaying its time-sensitive path to the House, which must approve the bill and send it to the Senate. In Connecticut, all amended bills are rerouted back to nonpartisan analysts who change the bill's language and cost estimates, a process than can eat up weeks of time and make it difficult to get a vote before the session ends.
"I'm of the mind that some increase in the minimum wage will pass this year," Representative Christopher G. Donovan, a Democrat from Meriden and the co-chairman of the Labor and Public Employees committee that sponsored the bill, said after the committee vote. But he said the bill could still be changed to reduce the amount of the proposed increase.
In each of the last two years, the General Assembly voted to increase the state's minimum wage. In January 1999, it went to $5.65 an hour from $4.25, the rate established in 1988. On Jan. 1, the wage was raised to $6.15 an hour for most jobs, second-highest in the nation behind Oregon and Washington State, where the minimum is $6.50.
If the bill is approved with its current language, Connecticut, which has the highest per-capita income of any state, will join Massachusetts with the highest minimum wage. The $6.75 wage in Massachusetts goes into effect Jan. 1.
The increase in Connecticut would affect only a small fraction of the state's 1.68 million workers. Those affected would include retail and service employees in areas like sales, fast food and janitorial services.
On Friday, New York State raised its minimum wage to $5.15 from $4.25, the level since 1991. New Jersey's minimum wage has been $5.15 since 1998. Federal law mandates a minimum wage of $5.15 an hour but allows states to create lower minimums for certain employees, like farm and food-service workers.
While most Democrats and labor unions argued for the need to increase the state's minimum wage, Republicans and even some conservative Democrats said it would be an unnecessary burden on employers, especially small-business owners.
"Connecticut is arguably the highest-cost state in which to live, and it has one of the fastest-growing gaps between rich and poor," said Larry Dorman, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO in Connecticut. "One way to close that gap and to promote living-wage jobs is to enact a higher minimum wage."
Senator Edith Prague, a Democrat from Columbia and one of the bill's most ardent advocates, said the extra $24 a week the minimum wage raise represents would make a "big difference" in the lives of workers coming off the state's welfare rolls. And Senator Toni Nathaniel Harp, a Democrat from New Haven, noting that most people living in poverty are women, called the proposal "a pro-women-who-have-to-work bill."
But Senator William A. Aniskovich, a Republican from Branford, said raising the minimum wage would cause a spate of job cuts that would penalize low-income workers the most.
"Many of the people who work for minimum wage are not trying to make a living off minimum wage," Senator Aniskovich said. "To do this, I think, causes more dislocation and harm than good."
Bonnie Stewart, a lobbyist with the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said increasing the minimum wage would only drive up the price of goods and services, and drive customers out of state.
"When you have a state as small as Connecticut," she said, "it's a real problem increasing the minimum wage because it's just too easy for people to cross the border to purchase products and services that are cheaper."

HEADLINE: U.N. Says Bad Government Is Often the Cause of Poverty

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 4

 BODY:
After years of treading carefully around the issue of why so many countries stay poor or become poorer, the United Nations put a lot of the blame in a report today on bad government, a message many leaders seeking more aid and debt relief will not want to hear.
The report from the United Nations Development Program, the world's largest aid agency, calls for rethinking traditional ideas about battling poverty in the third world. It reflects the debates in many nations, including the United States, about why poverty persists even in regions of substantial economic growth and political freedom. 
 The report makes "good governance" the top priority in poverty-fighting by the development program under a new administrator, Mark Malloch Brown, whose organization supports a range of governance projects. Without good governance, reliance on trickle-down economic development and a host of other strategies will not work, the report concludes.
Mr. Malloch Brown, a Briton who came to the United Nations last year from the World Bank, has drawn hostility from developing countries. They accuse him of interfering in the internal affairs of governments, a criticism also leveled at Secretary General Kofi Annan for suggesting that nations with human rights abuses can no longer hide behind their borders, claiming national sovereignty.
"This report is particularly important for me in terms of skewering a particularly odd U.N. debate which flourishes in this curious greenhouse at the East River," Mr. Malloch Brown said at a news conference today, "which is that somehow the U.N.D.P. was getting out of poverty and into governance work. What this report clearly demonstrates is that governance is a critical building block for poverty reduction."
Embracing democracy is often not enough, and certainly not a panacea, the report found.
"Having regular elections -- free and fair -- contributes to accountability, especially if they are also held at the local level," the report says. "But such democratic forms are no vaccination against poverty."
Development experts now accept the idea that local governments, often neglected or nonexistent in the developing world, must play a crucial role in poverty reduction. Historically, foreign aid has gone to central governments. When donors could no longer ignore how much aid was being siphoned off in corruption or misuse of funds, nongovernmental agencies, not local governments, were given the money or goods.
A growing number of development experts now believe that this shift bred its own problems as the private agencies invented projects to get more money or funneled aid in line with their own priorities, making national efforts disjointed.
Big, expensive surveys of poverty are not much good either, the report says. It recommends frequent and rapid monitoring studies to assess programs and policies.
The United Nations Development Program's report is being published as the General Assembly prepares to review progress since the 1995 international conference on social development in Copenhagen. At that conference, nations made three commitments: to estimate the incidence of poverty within their borders, to set targets for reducing or eliminating poverty and to introduce anti-poverty plans.
Surveying 140 of the United Nations' 188 members, the report found that 77 percent of countries had estimated their incidence of poverty -- including extreme poverty, measured by the inability to buy enough food for daily needs -- but that only 40 percent had incorporated anti-poverty measures into national planning and 29 percent had dedicated anti-poverty projects.
Countries with the most active and focused measures against poverty were found in the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa, with Asia and the Pacific falling behind sub-Saharan Africa. The survey highlights some of the successful projects found around the world.
The new report from the United Nations Development Program -- "Overcoming Human Poverty: UNDP Poverty Report 2000" -- builds in some ways on the agency's pioneering annual human development reports, a creation of the Mahbub ul Haq, a late Pakistani expert who shifted criteria for measuring development away from per capita income figures to aspects of human life that play a role in social and economic growth.
Three factors used by the human development surveys -- adult illiteracy, the proportion of children under 5 who are underweight and the probability of dying before 40 -- are also assessed in the new report. It shows most regions lagging on all three fronts, and sometimes moving backward, even as democracy spreads and economic growth rates rise.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ISSUES;
Bitter Partisan Fight Brewing Over Medicare Drug Benefits

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
Seven months before Election Day, the struggle over expanding Medicare to cover prescription drugs for the elderly is escalating, with both parties maneuvering furiously on an issue that matters, deeply, to a critical group of voters.
As the debate over the Republican budget resolution began today in the Senate, for example, Democrats were pushing for an amendment that would require the creation of a Medicare drug benefit before any tax cut could take effect. 
 President Clinton declared that the amendment was "good policy, the will of the American people and addresses a longstanding unmet need."
Republicans asserted that, as a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, put it, "Republicans are committed to providing this benefit," and would reserve the money to do so.
In poll after poll, expanding Medicare to cover prescription drug benefits for the nation's elderly -- a third of whom lack any drug coverage at all -- ranks near the top of the voters' agenda.
Border wars over prescription drugs are erupting to the north. Democratic candidates for Congress have been traveling to Canada to underscore its lower drug prices; a coalition led by the pharmaceutical industry is countering with a major advertising campaign on the failures of the Canadian health care system.
"They wait longer for new cures," an announcer warns, in television advertisements that began running last week across the northern United States -- a clear reaction to the public's concern over drug prices.
In short, the political pressure for legislation this year is great, a variety of analysts and politicians say. But so is the level of partisan mistrust on the issue, as well as the philosophical disagreement over how to deal with it.
As a result, many politicians say the odds are still against a benefit being enacted this year, but as one administration official put it, "It's such a hot issue, and in an election year on a hot issue things can change."
Congressional Democrats, President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have been campaigning for prescription drug benefits for more than a year now, and the rhetoric is expected to escalate, with a series of speeches and events planned for this month's Congressional recess.
"It may be the single most potent issue we have back home," declares Representative Martin Frost of Texas, who heads the House Democratic Caucus. "People really do care about this and the Republicans are clearly not going to do anything of consequence."
For their part, leaders in the Republican-controlled House are scrambling to produce a prescription drug plan of their own, having already set aside $40 billion over five years in their recently passed budget resolution for Medicare "reform" and a drug benefit.
The Senate Finance Committee, whose Republican chairman, William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, is in a tough race for re-election, is in the early stages of writing a bill to tackle the issue. And the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush promises to address prescription drugs when Mr. Bush gives a series of health care speeches this spring.
In their more partisan moments, Democrats assert the Republicans are simply looking to neutralize the prescription drug issue, not solve the problem; Republicans counter that some Democrats want a political weapon, not a law. Representative J. C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, who heads the House Republican Conference, declared of his Democratic colleagues, "I'm afraid this is another one of those issues where they don't want good policy, they want politics," adding that he nevertheless remained optimistic that a law would pass.
The politics are, in fact, compelling to both parties. In the last presidential election, Americans over 65 years old voted at twice the rate of 18- to 24-year-olds. They are heavily represented in the big states that are expected to be battlegrounds this fall, including Pennsylvania, Illinois and Florida. Their concerns are important to their middle-aged children, many of whom not only worry about their parents but are close enough to their own retirement to take the issue personally, pollsters say.
And neither party can take the retiree vote for granted. Long considered a dependable part of the Democratic coalition, the over-60 vote was carried by the Republicans in the last three Congressional elections -- by a margin of 10 percentage points in 1998, according to exit polls. (Democrats have done better in recent presidential elections, carrying the votes of older Americans in the last two elections.)
When a net pickup of just six seats could give the Democrats control of the House, some strategists say they cannot afford to lose the elderly vote again -- certainly not by the margin they lost it in 1998, when it may well have kept them from regaining control of the House, said Mark Gersh, a Democratic analyst.
The economic and health policy implications of the issue are also powerful, at a time when both the costs and the use of pharmaceuticals keep climbing. Prescription drugs have become a prime tool in treating many of the ailments of aging, from high blood pressure to osteoporosis; the elderly account for 13 percent of the population but more than a third of the nation's drug expenditures. Yet Medicare, developed 35 years ago for a profoundly different era of medicine, generally fails to cover outpatient prescription drug costs.
While two-thirds of the elderly have some form of drug coverage through employer-sponsored plans, health maintenance organizations, or other means, such coverage "varies widely across plans, is often limited, and is expected to decline in the future," as the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group, recently put it. Lawmakers say they routinely hear of elderly constituents straining -- and often failing -- to meet their drug bills, as well as the other normal costs of living.
The pressure to enact a prescription drug benefit was also increased by last week's rosy report on the financial health of the Medicare hospital trust fund; one of the major arguments against new benefits has been that Medicare could barely cover the existing ones.
"I think the report yesterday adds a great deal of momentum for a prescription drug benefit within Medicare," said Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, a Maryland Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.
For all these reasons, the prescription drug issue is no longer simply a sideshow to the debate over restructuring and modernizing Medicare, which it appeared to be 18 months ago. In fact, some lawmakers worry that it will be far easier and politically appealing to enact a new drug benefit than to restructure Medicare, and thus the effort to make Medicare more efficient and financially solvent before the baby boomers retire will be left to languish.
"If you do prescription drugs and don't do reform, you'll never get reform," said Senator John B. Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat who headed a bipartisan commission on Medicare that ended in a deadlock last year. "It's the classic dessert before the meal analysis." The administration's plan links drug benefits with a broader restructuring of the program, and Republican officials have long been committed to "modernizing" Medicare, although those elements could be pared down in the legislative process.
Despite the forces pushing legislators to act this year, there are huge hurdles. The task of creating a prescription drug benefit touches on some of the most profound disagreements in health policy: Should the benefit be universally available and subsidized, as other core benefits are under Medicare, or essentially directed to low-income people, as some Republicans have suggested? How much of a role should the federal government play in designing, delivering and regulating the benefit -- and how much of a role should the private insurance industry play?
"I think there will be legislative action this year," said Mr. Cardin. "Whether it will be enacted into law is unlikely."
Privately, some Democratic strategists say that with the House so close within their grasp, it does not make sense to settle this year for a bare-bones benefit. The political calculus, though, is complicated: Mr. Clinton, looking toward his legacy, has one set of interests when it comes to the decision to compromise. Mr. Gore and House Democrats, looking toward the potential of a new administration, may have different views. "This is not the year when Democrats ought to be accepting half a loaf on any important policy prescription," said one Democratic strategist on Capitol Hill.
Another big variable is the pharmaceutical industry, which has been warning for months now that any new prescription drug program that relies on government to hold down prices will have dire consequences for research. Now, in the face of all this momentum in Congress to act, the industry not only has to decide what the best deal is, but when to try to strike it, which means assessing the odds of a Democratic House and a Democratic administration next year.
Industry spokesmen assert that Democrats have been trying to "demonize" them for political gain. In their campaign to highlight the burden of prescription drug costs on the nation's elderly, some House Democrats have begun issuing studies suggesting that pets get a better deal than retirees on the cost of some medications. Such efforts clearly touch a nerve.
Alan F. Holmer, president and chief executive officer of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said, "The sponsors of this so-called study know that it costs far more to develop a drug for a person than for a dog."
In short, the political wars over prescription drugs rage on, with an avid audience.
"This is an extremely important reference point to older voters, and remember, it's a big change in the debate," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. "For the better part of the last decade, we've been talking about how to cut back on benefits to seniors in terms of Medicare and Social Security. This is the first debate in a while about how we extend new benefits to older Americans. And seniors are very receptive to that."

Judge in Microsoft Case Hopes for Swift Conclusion
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson told lawyers he wants to finish the remedy phase of the Microsoft case within 60 days. 
 The judge proposed a "fast track" proceeding that would give the Justice Department 30 days and Microsoft 60 days to propose their remedies. He also said he would ask the Justice Department to file for an expedited Supreme Court hearing, which would bypass the appellate court that overturned him in an earlier Microsoft case. Page A1.
 
Icahn Bids for Nabisco Group
Nabisco Group Holdings is reviewing the latest bid by Carl C. Icahn to buy the company. Icahn, who already owns about 9 percent of the company, bid $5.2 billion, or $16 a share, to buy the rest. Nabisco had rejected Icahn's earlier offer to buy 30 percent of the company for $13 a share, but in response to the new offer Nabisco has hired investment bankers to consider its options. C6.
 
Coke Sees Profit and Sales Growth
Coca-Cola told investors that it expects long-term sales growth of 7 percent to 8 percent and profit growth of 15 percent a year, but its optimistic presentation was tempered by news that first-quarter growth will be only about 1.5 percent and that the company will take a $400 million charge in the period to close poorly performing plants.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Fed Likely to Stay Its Course Despite Gyrations in Stocks

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
For a while today, Alan Greenspan got just what he wanted: a sharp break in the stock market's ever-upward psychology and a broad downturn in prices that took a big chunk of wealth out of investors' bulging pockets.
But then the markets snatched it right back. After a stomach-churning plunge, stock prices rebounded smartly in the afternoon, closing with losses that, while not trivial, were hardly paradigm changing. The prevailing assumption -- that every dip is a buying opportunity -- held more or less intact, though day traders no doubt ended the session wondering whether investing was still as easy as it had been last year. 
 And Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve were left to wonder anew what it would take to rein in Wall Street, which they have come to view as the channel through which inflation is most likely to infect the economy.
True, technology stocks have taken a battering over the last week. But most of the wealth created in the market over the last few years is still intact, fueling consumer spending and a general sense of economic invulnerability. And by some measures, stocks are still grinding their way upward.
Mr. Greenspan's preferred measure of market performance, the Wilshire 5000, which captures the movement of nearly all stocks, is still up about 1 percent so far this year, and up 10.9 percent since last June 30, when the Fed began its current round of rate increases. For all its troubles in the last few weeks, the Nasdaq index is still 54 percent higher than it was on June 30.
All of which suggests that nothing that happened today will deter the Fed from continuing to raise rates. The very resiliency of the markets might even lead the central bank to conclude that it needs to raise rates further, and in bigger increments than it has so far, to grab the attention of investors.
"Right now we have neither a sustained correction in the stock market nor a significant slowdown in the economy," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Norwest Bank in Minneapolis. "To keep the market contained will require at least a couple more interest rate hikes and a continued open mouth policy on the part of Chairman Greenspan."
Investors will no doubt be listening intently when Mr. Greenspan speaks on Wednesday afternoon at a White House conference on the economy. Mr. Greenspan is expected to discuss technology's effect on the economy, a subject that would give him ample opportunity, if he chooses, to assess the markets and signal his intentions for the next Fed policy meeting on May 16.
There are many reasons the economy continues to stampede, not least that low unemployment and rising wages are making most people feel confident and willing to spend. But Mr. Greenspan has repeatedly emphasized the potential for the wealth generated by the market to be the force that leads the economy to overheat and start throwing off inflation.
The Fed chairman has said repeatedly that he is not aiming at the stock market per se. But he has also made clear that, absent a pronounced slowdown in some other sector of the economy, the market's sustained rise would have to slow considerably to allow the economy to remain on an even keel.
Mr. Greenspan has even set out a speed limit for the market: asset values should not rise faster than household income. His equation roughly implies that stock prices should not rise at more than a 6 percent annual rate.
Measured from the start of this year, the markets are generally within the speed limit, at least as measured by the Wilshire 5000.
But over longer periods the upward surge in equity prices remains too rapid for Mr. Greenspan's taste. And with markets so volatile, it is hard to say whether there is a sustainable trend of deceleration.
"If you look at where we are today relative to the beginning of the year, you'd say we're not too far from the beginning of the neutralization of the wealth effect," said Richard D. Rippe, an economist at Prudential Securities. "But since the market is so volatile, your perception can change substantially in a couple of weeks."
Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm, said the decline in the Nasdaq had only taken the index back to where it was two months ago, "and we don't recall seeing much evidence back in February that the economy was slowing down."
If stock prices stabilize where they are now, "we think there will probably be some measurable impact on consumer confidence over the next month or two," Mr. Shepherdson said. "But it will not be enough to slow the economy as much as the Fed wants."
The next big indicator of the economy's performance will come Friday, when the Labor Department reports on job creation and the unemployment rate for March. If the economy continues to create jobs at a robust pace, and if the unemployment rate falls back to 4 percent or below, it would be another sign that economic growth remains at a level far beyond what the Fed considers prudent.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Nasdaq Goes Into Free Fall Before Making A Recovery

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL and KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
On their roller coaster ride yesterday, investors and executives in technology companies traded on the Nasdaq market could be expected to feel a little queasy.
A co-worker approached Dr. Pehong Chen, chief executive of a software company called Broadvision, based in Redwood City, Calif., and asked him how he was early in the morning. "He saw me standing at the trash can and thought I was throwing up," Dr. Chen said. In fact, "I was peeling an orange." 
 Though he said he had lost about $2.5 billion on paper over the last two weeks, Dr. Chen seemed calm yesterday. Then again, his stake is still worth at least a couple of billion dollars since the stock was one of the best performers on Nasdaq last year.
Other executives punished by the stock market also sounded philosophical, suggesting that they had hit a speed bump -- and nothing more. Their comments were echoed by many smaller investors, who continue to sit on profits after a year of tremendous gains. Some even find the rapid decline an encouraging sign because excesses are being quickly wrung out of the market.
"The valuations were such that this was a balloon looking for a pin," said Kent Simons, manager of the $2 billion Neuberger Berman Focus fund. "Things that used to take six or seven weeks are now over in six or seven days."
And what a few days it has been. A rout that began in the Nasdaq market early last week picked up steam on Monday as investors braced for the ruling that Microsoft had violated antitrust law. After falling 14.5 percent on Monday, shares of the company fell an additional $2.3125 yesterday, or 2.5 percent, to $88.5625.
Yesterday, stock prices plunged in the morning and early afternoon in what some traders described as panic selling by individuals and hedge funds forced to unload shares to meet margin calls. At one point, the Nasdaq composite index was down nearly 575 points, or 13.6 percent. That spilled over to the Dow Jones industrial average, which fell as much as 504 points, or 4.5 percent.
The panic lifted soon afterward as one market participant said mutual funds began buying. The major gauges then retraced much of the lost ground.
By the end of the day, the Nasdaq and the Dow had recorded their largest point swings ever. Though the main gauges closed only moderately lower than they had on Monday, the final numbers do not convey the volatility, nor the pain and psychological damage inflicted on investors.
"The only positive thing you can take away from this is that you did see almost capitulation selling," said Rob Cohen, co-head of block trading at Credit Suisse First Boston.
By the close, the Nasdaq was down 74.79, or 1.8 percent, to 4,148.89. The 634-point swing in Nasdaq from its peak to its trough yesterday was its biggest ever in a single day and was twice the previous record of 328 points on March 30.
At its low point, the Nasdaq was down nearly 28 percent from its peak on March 10. By the end of the day, it was about 18 percent off its peak. For the year, it is up 1.9 percent.
For the day, the Dow slipped 57.09, or 0.51 percent, to 11,164.84. And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 11.24, or 0.8 percent, to 1,494.73.
Perhaps it is just wishful thinking, but stock analysts said some of the speculative excess that has been building in technology stocks has now been purged.
"A lot of people who thought the market owed them a living now realize that the market won't go up forever," said Laszlo Birinyi, who runs his own stock market research firm in Westport, Conn.
William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said "a lot of speculators have either seen the light or run out of cash."
Shares of highly speculative companies in the technology and Internet world suffered the most and could fall further.
Alan F. Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones, a St. Louis-based brokerage firm, said stock values have been totally out of whack. "We have a new economy, but the same old rules of investing still apply," he said. If you buy companies with no earnings, "you're going to get burned."
"We think this is the beginning of the end of the wild, wild West style of investing."
Mr. Skrainka pointed to a joint study by Edward Jones and Ned Davis Research, a securities research firm in Venice, Fla., on the stock performance of companies whose shares reached levels equivalent to 100 times their annual earnings. Among the resulting 1,780 Nasdaq stocks since 1972 (ending in 1995), the five-year median return was just over 10 percent, or 2 percent a year. And the risk was 17 times more for these stocks than for the S.& P. 500 and 100 times more than for Treasury bills.
Edward Kerschner, chief market strategist at PaineWebber, issued a warning last week about the values of what he called the "new, new industrial" stocks trading at high multiples of earnings, if they have earnings that is. As of yesterday morning, the stocks on his list, including Ciena, Akamai and Juniper Networks, were still about 40 percent overvalued, Mr. Kerschner said. By midday, those stocks "were down another 15 percent to 20 percent," he said. "That means they need to fall another 20 percent."
Even as he called for a sharp correction in these stocks last week, Mr. Kerschner reiterated his generally positive outlook for stocks.
"I don't think you will see a widespread correction, but a cleansing action in the frothier parts of the Nasdaq," he said.
Investors who have ridden the technology wave in recent years cannot be easily shaken from their seats. Howard Appel, 43, of Merrick, N.Y., said yesterday that he had a big loss in his 401(k) retirement account because it was invested in technology stocks. "If I was retiring in the next few years, I'd be in a panic," he said. "It's not fun losing $50,000 in a week.
"Now I'm going to be able to buy a lot more shares at a lower price," he added. "I expect in the near future, technology and the Nasdaq are going to come roaring back."
Robert Hopkins, a 68-year-old retired publisher of trade magazines who lives in Keswick, Va., said he remained on the sidelines yesterday. "I was tracking it all day long," he said. "I don't think anybody could watch it and not be concerned."
But he said he did not sell anything in his portfolio, which has fat profits from recent years. "I'm still playing on house money," he said.
Throughout Silicon Valley, where so much wealth has been minted in the last few years, there is plenty of ticker checking going on in the hallways at work. And the tension is heightened at companies whose insiders will soon get their first chance to sell after the lock-up period imposed following a public offering. More than half the initial public offerings this year are now trading under their offering price, challenging the market wisdom that getting into a hot initial public offering is easy money in the bank.
Michael Beindorff, president and chief operating officer of PlanetrX.com, an online pharmacy in South San Francisco, said that the volatility is "not terribly surprising."
Still, "It's scary for everybody," said the executive, whose stock went public in October, peaked around 36, hung around 20, but then slid steadily. It finished yesterday at a new low of 5 11/16, down from its offering price of 16.
The stock had been under pressure because its lock-up period ended on Monday, Mr. Beindorff said. In recent days retail investors sold the stock in anticipation that company insiders would do so when they could, he explained.
Despite the demoralizing dips, executives at some of these technology companies said it was premature to consider buying back company stock or repricing options granted to employees. The message they are trying to send to employees is that if they keep the company on track, valuations will follow.
Chris Slatt, 41, chairman and chief executive of WatchGuard Technologies, an Internet security company in Seattle whose stock has fallen 30 points in the last several weeks, to 75 1/2, but which remains far above its opening price of 13 last July, sent an e-mail message intended to bolster employee morale 10 days ago.
"With these fluctuations, you'll literally drive yourself mad looking everyday" at your personal worth, said Mr. Slatt, whose said his own net worth had fallen some $500 million in the last two weeks.
Yet he and other executives of public companies say they are keenly aware of one benchmark: how their own company's stock is doing relative to that of direct competitors. In short, executives say they have learned to live with wild drops they say are largely beyond their control, but are far less comfortable when their stocks fall in percentage terms more than that of business rivals.

Japanese Stock Strength Defies Bad News

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 4

 BODY:
Japan's languid economy slid into another recession late last year, companies are struggling to overhaul themselves, the government's debts are piling up and the prime minister is comatose with a stroke.
None of that news seems to have fazed the Japanese stock market, which has outperformed the United States market over the last year. On Monday, even with word that the condition of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was grave, investors bid up share prices, and the benchmark Nikkei index reached the highest level since late 1997. 
 The market demonstrated its resilience again today, retreating only modestly despite the political uncertainties. Much of that weakness was attributed to the carry-over effect of the Nasdaq market's severe drop the day before in the United States. At midday on Wednesday, stocks were a little more than 1 percent lower. The yen weakened against the dollar.
The Japanese market's recent strength does not necessarily signal a better future for this country's economy, the world's second largest, which has been struggling for years to recover from the bursting of the speculative bubble a decade ago.
The forces that have been driving the market higher reflect some trends that have not been seen before. A flood of new Japanese mutual funds, for example, has reversed a prolonged contraction in the industry. Mutual fund activity, in turn, has spurred buying by momentum investors, who hope to profit by purchasing shares that big investors are buying.
Moreover, people have been moving their money into stocks that reflect a modest boom in information technology, telecommunications and the Internet, at the expense of traditional Japanese companies.
Their moves are intensified by a shortage of stocks in those sectors; only 12 Japanese stocks are pure Internet investments.
"There's the feeling that the worst of the economic news is behind us," said Ichizo Takeuchi, marketing director at the Kokusai Asset Management Company, which supervises 11 trillion yen in assets -- currently $105 billion. "Investment in information technology is growing," he said, "and the structure of the economy is changing." Mr. Takeuchi added that the market this year had been driven by Japanese investors, rather than the foreigners who piled in last year, and by more individual investors than in the recent past.
The Japanese are among the world's great savers, so any indication that they are beginning to risk some of that money in the stock market, where many had been badly burned in the early 1990's, could represent a new source of demand for shares. "Because of the large pool of savings here," Mr. Takeuchi said, "once households begin to share risks in the capital markets, that will in turn contribute greatly to improvement of the Japanese corporate sector in which they are investing."
His opinion is not necessarily shared by other money managers here. Some worry that individual Japanese investors may be stepping back into the market just in time to be wiped out again, as was their experience when the asset bubble burst. "My sense is that those hurt when the bubble popped are not part of this thing," said Craig Chudler of Nikko Salomon Smith Barney. "But new companies that are listing and seeing their shares bid up very, very rapidly -- you hear the 'bubble' word come out of their mouths. They're dumbfounded by the rise in stock prices."
Just in the last few weeks, a bit of air has come out of the market. While the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues is up 8.77 percent since the beginning of the year, the Topix index, a much broader piece of the market, is off 0.9 percent after having been up 2.3 percent less than a month ago.
Gary Evans, strategist at HSBC Securities here, said: "I asked two of my analysts the other day to tell me how the market had performed without looking at their numbers, and both of them said it was up somewhere in the range of 15 percent. That's not the case, but their perception is one that is widely shared by many investors, who are enthusiastic about Japan and its future."
That is most apparent in the mutual fund industry. The funds, known here as investment trusts, having been net sellers of stocks for much of the last decade, have been piling into the market. From the beginning of the year through the second week of March, funds made net stock purchases of 671 billion yen. They were exceeded only by foreign investors, who were net purchasers of 991 billion yen in stock, though most have been investing in Japan at a much slower pace than last year.
It is not surprising that mutual funds account for a large part of recent investment in the equity market, since there are so many new ones. The most prominent so far is Nomura Securities' Big Project N, the largest Japanese fund ever. Its success in attracting one trillion yen to the stock market, a good chunk of it from Nomura's own bond funds, helped expedite the creation of other stock funds. From mid-January through mid-March, 62 stock funds have been introduced, according to Morningstar, the mutual fund research company.
And that does not include three new funds announced a few weeks ago by Fidelity Investments. "We've seen a significant increase in our business almost across the board," said Robert H. Auld, chief investment officer at Fidelity Investments Japan. Like others, Mr. Auld sees differences between the stock market and the economy. "Certainly, Japan has stumbled about from a macroeconomic policy point of view, and everyone knows that," he said. "But a lot of companies are starting to restructure their businesses and in ways that are independent from what the government is doing."
This makes it easier to distinguish winners from losers. "There's a little more divergence in the fortunes of individual companies," Mr. Auld said. "Where historically all companies tended to rise and fall with the overall movement of the tide, there are now companies able to determine their own fortunes independent of whether the tide is moving in or out."
Ahead of the funds are the momentum buyers, who seek to exploit the links between the funds and the indexes they use as benchmarks. Trading volume exploded earlier this year after Nomura announced Big Project N, and momentum investors rushed to buy shares ahead of the fund, hoping to profit from its need to hold certain stocks.
Among those must-have stocks are NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile telephone company and the first company anywhere to commercialize Internet access over a phone, and Sony, which has sought to convince investors, with some success, that it is transforming itself from a consumer electronics manufacturer into an Internet company.
As had been the case in the United States, the most tenuous connection to the Internet has commanded a high premium in the market. Thus, shares of the Itochu Techno-Science Corporation, the company that developed a wildly popular system for tapping the Internet using a mobile phone, have risen 330 percent since they were first floated in December on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
CJK, which sells and services imported information-processing and telecommunications equipment, has risen more than 150 percent since its shares were offered a month and a half ago. Even the Meikyosha Company, a retailer that sells games, software and electronics, is up nearly 20 percent from its offering price since it went public in February.
The voracious appetite for these stocks and others like them, combined with their limited availability, has created risks for investors. Of the 70 companies with the biggest market capitalizations, the seven largest funds devoted to investing in the domestic market hold shares in only 27, and only 3 are not related to technology or information services: the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi; Takeda Chemical Industries, a drug and vitamin company, and Seven-Eleven Japan, modestly higher because of its plans to link its business to cyberspace.
Mr. Evans said he thought that concentration was too heavy and had probably hurt fund performance so far. Of the 10 stocks that have risen the most this year, half are old-line electronics companies, like Mitsubishi Electric and Sanyo Electric, or pharmaceutical companies.

HEADLINE: Expedited Appeal Proposed by Judge in Microsoft Case

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY and STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The presiding judge in the Microsoft antitrust case, meeting with lawyers for both sides in Washington yesterday, said he wanted to put the remedy phase of the case on a "fast track" and consider encouraging the litigants to appeal the outcome directly to the Supreme Court, according to a transcript of the meeting.
One day after he issued his judgment that found Microsoft in broad violation of the nation's antitrust laws, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson laid out a tight schedule for filings from both parties every 10 or 15 days "under a genuine fast track which would enable us to conclude the remedy phase within 60 days" of Monday, he said. 
 No decisions were made, and at one point Judge Jackson discussed possibly bypassing the appeals court and encouraging the Justice Department to take the case directly to the Supreme Court, under a law that allows that procedure in antitrust cases of national importance.
"I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that I will be inviting from the government a motion to provide for direct review in the Supreme Court," he said.
Lawyers for both sides raised questions about the various ideas, suggesting that they were not sure what the law permitted.
At the same time, Microsoft faces the threat of a rising wave of consumer class-action cases and other private lawsuits.
During the meeting, Judge Jackson said: "My transcendent objective is to get this thing before an appellate tribunal -- one or another -- as quickly as possible because I don't want to disrupt the economy or waste any more of yours or my time on a remedy if it's going to come back here."
In the remedy phase, the court will decide what penalty, or remedy, is assigned to Microsoft. Ideas range from moderating the company's conduct to breaking the company up.
The judge issued his verdict on Monday, just 48 hours after settlement talks broke down. In his conversations with the lawyers yesterday, he asked them to give him the last offers each side had made in the talks, an idea that both sides resisted. David Boies, the lead government lawyer, noted that offers discussed in mediation talks are often of a different character than those offered to a trial judge.
Both sides were also concerned about making their last offers from the settlement talks part of the public record of the trial, to which Judge Jackson said he would be willing to take them under seal.
No decisions were made, and the lawyers left to discuss the questions with others at the Justice Department and Microsoft.
If the case were sent directly to the Supreme Court, the court could presumably refuse to accept it, thereby sending it to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Apart from the appeals process, Microsoft could face a raft of suits from the private sector. With Judge Jackson having ruled on Monday that Microsoft was a "predatory" monopolist that repeatedly violated antitrust laws, private plaintiffs have a far less daunting challenge in suits already filed -- and in actions being considered by companies that believe they have suffered from abuse of Microsoft's market power.
"This is now an awfully big invitation to plaintiffs' lawyers," said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at the Columbia University law school. "We may have reached a point for Microsoft, as there was in the tobacco cases, that basic attitudes have shifted, and a powerful defendant is no longer seen as invulnerable."
Some of Microsoft's leading rivals, and even its biggest customers, could bring private suits, according to legal experts. But they will almost surely hold off, at least until they see what sanctions the courts approve against Microsoft -- sanctions that could, among other things, limit its ability to retaliate.
Judge Jackson's judgment was not surprising, after his findings of fact in November sided with the version of the case presented in court by the Justice Department and 19 states. But this week's ruling was a crucial step because it means that many of his findings -- that Microsoft is a monopoly, for example -- may be accepted as proof by other courts in private suits.
Several companies that could now step forward as plaintiffs sent witnesses to Judge Jackson's courthouse to testify on behalf of the government, including Netscape Communications, America Online, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer and I.B.M. In his ruling, the judge cited those companies as suffering from Microsoft's "oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune."
The judge ruled, for example, that the company not only used its market power to defend its monopoly in operating systems but also illegally tried to monopolize the market for Internet browsing software. The principal victim of that tactic was Netscape, the pioneer in the browser market, which was acquired by America Online in late 1998. That judgment makes it far easier for America Online to sue for damages.
Because the judge ruled that Microsoft's monopoly power allowed it to overcharge for Windows, the big personal computer makers including Dell, Compaq, Gateway and I.B.M. could have cause to file suit. If they won, such judgments could yield hundreds of millions of dollars each for big PC makers that use Windows. The treble damages in private antitrust cases would cover every PC a company sold over four years, the statute of limitations in such cases.
"Microsoft could find itself in a very tight pincer here, since these companies could regard it as being in their fiduciary interest to file private suits," said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school.
Sun Microsystems, lawyers say, is probably the most likely to file a private suit against Microsoft. It is a bitter direct competitor and has little to lose. For all the others, the calculation would be more complicated because they rely in one way or another on Microsoft's cooperation.
Most of the companies named in Judge Jackson's ruling declined to comment yesterday on the possibility of private antitrust suits against Microsoft. Still, an executive at one of the companies said, "It is clearly something we will consider, but there has been no substantive internal discussion of that yet."
And the companies may decide against suing Microsoft for other reasons. First, parts of Judge Jackson's legal conclusions -- though not his findings of fact -- could be reversed on appeal. And second, the companies may not see it as in their long-term interest to bring suit against Microsoft, even if they do not fear retaliation from Microsoft.
RealNetworks, which makes software for playing multimedia programming on personal computers, was mentioned by Judge Jackson as among the targets of Microsoft's tactics. Yet Rob Glaser, chairman of RealNetworks, said yesterday that he had no plans to sue.
"While I think Microsoft has behaved unethically at times and this judge found that it broke the law, my focus is going to be on doing everything I can to make sure RealNetworks remains ahead of Microsoft in our business," Mr. Glaser said. "The government was absolutely right to prosecute Microsoft. But it doesn't make sense for us."
But companies are not the only potential litigants. More than 100 class-action suits have already been filed against Microsoft in two dozen states, nearly all in the aftermath of Judge Jackson's powerfully worded findings of fact last November. Those suits, legal experts say, were the early starters as plaintiffs' lawyers maneuvered for leadership positions in what are likely to become a broader class-action assault.
More consumer class-action suits are expected, and lawyers involved in the early cases said Judge Jackson's rule was a significant victory.
"We're very pleased with the way the government case came out," said Leonard B. Simon, a partner at Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach in San Diego, whose firm has brought many prominent class-action cases. "This is very good news for the consumer class-action cases."
But while the ruling in the government case makes things easier for private antitrust plaintiffs, it by no means ensures that they will win in court. The consumer class-action suits mainly contend that Microsoft, as a monopoly, was able to overcharge for its industry-standard Windows operating system, which runs the basic operations of nearly 90 percent of all PC's sold today.
Judge Jackson ruled that Microsoft had the ability to "price substantially above the competitive level." And in his November findings, he noted an internal Microsoft pricing study that said the company could have charged $49 for a retail upgrade from Windows 95 to Windows 98 but that the company chose to charge $89 instead because it was the "revenue-maximizing price."
Microsoft replies that the numbers cited in the study were arbitrary numbers, and that it could have also charged far more for the Windows upgrade.
In the class-action confrontation, Microsoft says it has the money and the patience to withstand what it regards as an opportunistic assault on a deep-pocketed corporate target. In addition, the company's executives express confidence in their legal position.
"These class-action cases are just piling on," William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said in an interview over the weekend. "There is no economic theory to show that ours was not the aggressive price for Windows."
Indeed, while Judge Jackson's ruling places Microsoft's liability firmly into the legal record, the class-action suits must still prove damages -- that is, what impact Microsoft's abuse of its market power had on consumers. And even the class-action advocates recognize that.
"The ruling in the government case simplifies our job, but it does not make it easy," said Terry Gross, a lawyer in San Francisco. "We're up against one of the most powerful defendants in the world."
The private litigation promises to be a marathon effort. A group of seven federal judges, called the Multi-District Litigation Panel, held a hearing last week in Palm Springs, Calif., on where to combine all the federal class-action suits. That initial decision is expected soon. But it is only a starting point.
California is the leader among the states in class-action cases. The more than two dozen cases filed to date have been consolidated in the San Francisco Superior Court.

HEADLINE: WATER POLO;
From the Ruins of Sarajevo to Stardom at Princeton

BYLINE: By SOPHIA HOLLANDER 

 BODY:
Goga Vukmirovic heard a strange noise. It was a Monday morning, April 6, 1992, the day of a dreaded biology test that the Sarajevo seventh grader had spent the entire weekend studying for furiously.
She heard voices from outside her room, which made her pause, because her parents were normally at work by the time she crawled out of bed. 
 Trodding tentatively into the living room, she saw her parents gathered on the couch with her older sister Maja, watching scenes on CNN -- scenes they had seen for weeks in Croatia, other places. Not in Sarajevo. She sat on the couch and saw the war blowing apart in her city.
"Your first instinct is hey, no school today!" Ogjenka Vukmirovic said ruefully, sitting in her dorm room at Princeton University where she is a senior, captain of the nationally ranked women's water polo team and known to everyone as Goga. "But it hits you pretty quick when the bombs start exploding that it may not be such a good bargain."
Vukmirovic, now 21, never went back to school in Bosnia, never went back to seventh grade, or eighth grade for that matter. After fleeing from the war with her mother and sister, she enrolled as a high school student in Venezuela. The next year she was at a Connecticut boarding school to finish high school, where she was introduced to the sport of water polo.
Now she lives in a neat, white-walled room with typical college decorations: post cards on the wall, shelves of academic books, a poster of the music group U2. But the books on the shelves are mostly on the war in Bosnia, research for one of two senior theses she is writing. She will point out the postcards that picture places bombed and destroyed in the war, use her mouse to diagram shelling trajectories on her screen saver of the mountains outside of Sarajevo. Next to a box of computer disks sits a small clear glass container, filled with bullets that she picked up from the floor of her room in Sarajevo.
"Is that strange?" she asked, smiling. "It keeps you motivated to write your thesis, I'll tell you that."
It doesn't seem as if Vukmirovic needs motivation. A founding member of Princeton's varsity water polo team, which is 18-3 this season, she was the 1999 Ivy League and Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference most valuable player, and a 1999 all-America goalie. She is the only senior in the four-year-old program and was the most valuable player in the E.C.A.C. championships which Princeton won last weekend. The nationals are May 5-7 in Bloomington, Ind.
Women's water polo is an emerging collegiate sport. Thanks to Vukmirovic's efforts, Princeton was ranked in the top 10 for the first time in its history earlier this season and remains, after traditional West Coast powers, a national contender.
"She's kind of a legendary kid here," said Bill Berghoff, her high school coach at Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, Conn. "She'll come to visit a practice and she'll walk on the deck and all these little high school girls will collect around her. She's very embarrassed by it."
At Choate, there is the "Goga defense," where the goalie glides out of the goal into the center of the pool to help defend, the "Goga save" -- anything spectacular -- and the "Goga cap," which she wore at Choate and is now ratty and falling apart.
She does not talk with teammates about her experiences unless somebody asks, but it is always there. In the mornings at Choate, she would rush to check her e-mail messages, the only way she could communicate with her parents. When an e-mail message wasn't there, she wondered why, and would check compulsively until it came.
"It was actually my lifeline which helped me a lot in this period of separation," Vukmirovic's mother, Svjetlana, said recently in an e-mail message from Sarajevo, to which she returned after her daughters came to the United States. "The situation in Sarajevo was so difficult in that time, that we were actually happy not to have them with us in that hell."
It has been a series of missions for Vukmirovic, some seemingly impossible. Lead a normal life without being able to hear or see your parents for years, learn water polo, a sport she had never seen until she started to play it. In Venezuela, where she lived with her mother's family for 18 months, she attended school where everything that was taught was in English and all she knew were basic phrases. The first book she was assigned was "Great Expectations" by Charles Dickens.
But there was something to make her feel at home.
"Right as we went to Venezuela, they had a coup," she said. "You saw all these people who are shocked that there are airplanes flying over their homes and we were like, 'oh, been there, done that.' It's a sink-or-swim situation."
So she swam and followed her older sister to the United States when a Choate representative visited her school. "The progress as a water polo player through her senior year was because she made it a priority to learn," Berghoff said. "When she commits to something, she's just a hard driver. She does what she intends to do. And she does it well."
After spending three years at Choate, Vukmirovic was accepted into Harvard, Princeton, Yale and M.I.T. She chose Princeton because she was offered an opportunity to work in a lab her freshman year even though Princeton offered only a club water polo team.
"She's the backbone of our team because you can always count on the big save," Coach Luis Nicolao said. "She has a very good perspective on life, her priorities and the way she carries herself. She's beyond her years."
"When you're not given a choice, you deal with things much better because you can't second-guess yourself," she said. "You can roll up and die and be depressed and sit in your room all day, or you can figure out a way to go and deal with it. A lot of my papers and a lot of the work that I've done relates to Bosnia. My thesis right now kind of brings a closure to scattered years of thinking about some of these issues."
At first, Vukmirovic hoped that it would do more than provide a personal closing. She considered returning to Bosnia after graduation to try to implement her ideas for a truth commission to promote ethnic reconciliation. She has since abandoned that idea, stunned at the lack of support among her people, hurt that some now view her as an international, someone too removed from the problem to understand its solution.
"I'm a typical Bosnian; I thought that I was," she said (her father is Serbian, her mother Muslim). "Even at Choate, I thought my views on reconcilliation were something that 99 percent of the Bosnian population would agree with, but they're absolutely not. I'm a huge minority view, which was completely discouraging and disheartening."
So instead, Vukmirovic will live in New York, and work at the private-equity group J. H. Whitney in Stamford, Conn.
"I have no econ background," she said, grinning. "But I'm very excited. It will be a challenge to me to learn it, to fit in. This is going to be a sink or swim."
Been there. Done that.

HEADLINE: Budgeting for New York State

 BODY:
With unexpected speed, Gov. George Pataki and the New York State Legislature have agreed on a framework for a new $77 billion budget. Producing a framework does not mean the Legislature has actually produced a budget on time -- a feat that has not been achieved in Albany for the last 16 years. This budget was officially late last Saturday. But the agreement on a budget outline is definitely a sign of progress for legislators prodded by an election this fall and the loss of their paychecks until the budget is officially finished. Last year the Legislature reached this point in its budget negotiations in mid-July.
At press conferences in Albany, state leaders promised an enticing list of possibilities like reduction of school class sizes and low-cost prescription drugs for the elderly. Still, this general agreement must be greeted cautiously until the details emerge in the coming weeks. Despite the surge in state revenues, primarily from taxes on Wall Street profits, the governor, the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver must be careful not to endorse either tax cuts or obligations that would expand the deficit later. 
 The leaders have identified an additional $1.4 billion available for spending since the governor announced his budget, and want to apply some of this to $1.2 billion in new tax cuts phased in over the next five years. Some of the newly identified money is expected to be used to cut the gross receipts tax on energy, which falls heaviest on struggling upstate businesses, especially as energy costs increase. There are also promises of earned-income tax credits, an important way to help the working poor.
The centerpiece of a separate agreement on transportation is a proposed $3.8 billion bond issue for next November, half going for highways and the other half for mass transit. The bond issue has been seized upon by state leaders as their part of the capital plan of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, particularly a $3 billion proposal to build a full Second Avenue subway and a link between the Long Island Rail Road and Grand Central Terminal.
Bond issues have been a tough sell in recent years, and voters in November may well be concentrating more on Senate and presidential races than on increasing the state's debt. They will certainly be skeptical of authorizing more borrowing by the state without a full explanation of how the money will be spent and when these projects will be finished. Meanwhile, serious questions remain about where the M.T.A. will get the remaining funds -- whether from city or state coffers, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey or perhaps even an unpopular fare increase.
This fat-year budget wisely offers at least some cushion against leaner times, adding a reserve fund of $750 million as a hedge against an economic downturn. Such measures will help shore up New York's budget status even more than this sudden surge of timeliness.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
NASDAQ RECOVERS AFTER A FREE FALL IN A WARY MARKET

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
There was sound. There was fury. But what stock market investors wanted to know after yesterday's frightening bungee jump in share prices was, what does it signify?
Midway through one of the weirdest and wildest days in stock market history, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index had plunged 574.57 points from its close the day before, shearing 13.6 percent off its value. Had it ended there, it would have been the worst one-day decline in Nasdaq history. But a flood of buying rescued the index, propelling it up almost 500 points, to close with a loss of only 1.77 percent on the day. In one trading session, the index traveled on extraordinary 1,074 points. 
 As the Nasdaq plummeted, the more established gauges fell alongside it. About 1:15 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen 4.5 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had lost 5.9 percent. But these gauges bounced back as well, with the Dow closing the day down 0.51 percent and the S.& P. 500 ending with a loss of 0.75 percent. Page C1.
Even though the markets recovered by the end of the day, traders and investors were shellshocked by the extraordinary moves. Trading ranges of 10 and 15 points were commonplace among even established companies like American Express, Intel, General Electric and Cisco Systems.
The selling seemed to represent the first serious threat to the all-technology-all-the-time market investors have come to love. Technology stocks have dominated investors' psyches in recent years and have been responsible for titanic gains among those buyers willing to suspend their disbelief about what the future may hold for these companies. As a result, investors bid up the prices of both untested companies with no sign of profits and established companies with enviable earnings growth to levels that were never seen before.
"These stocks are trading on psychology, and ultimately markets are efficient," said Edward Kerschner, chief market strategist at PaineWebber. "Our view is that part of the excesses have been corrected, but not all of them." Mr. Kerschner thinks that the 20 most popular technology stocks with no earnings, like Amazon.com and Juniper Networks, have to go down another 40 percent before they can begin to be considered for purchase.
Many strategists think yesterday's mood shift among investors has staying power. "Panic is setting in among people who have big gains," said David Eidelman, money manager with Eidelman, Finger & Harris in St. Louis. "At first, when stocks go down, you have complacency among investors. Then people start to wonder, 'Can I lose everything I've made?' In a lot of these stocks" with high price-to-earnings ratios, "you don't really have a comfortable feeling for where the bottom is."
The upheaval in the market yesterday acted to level out some of the peaks and valleys seen in the main market gauges this year. The Nasdaq, which had been up 28 percent at its March 10 peak, is now up 1.96 percent on the year after closing yesterday at 4,148.89, down 74.79 points. The Dow, which had lost 14.8 percent in early March, is now down only 2.89 percent this year.
Brokers said that yesterday's selloff accelerated when calls for additional money went out from brokerage firms to their customers who had borrowed to buy shares.
One employee at a large online brokerage firm who declined to be identified said the firm made a record number of margin calls yesterday, four times what is typical. Almost none of the customers put up the additional money, this person said, and were therefore forced to sell some or all of their holdings. This accelerated the declines in already weak stocks.
Seeking cover from the carnage in stocks, investors fled to the traditional safe haven of United States bonds, driving their prices up. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction from it price, fell as low as 5.65 percent from 5.81 percent on Monday before finishing at 5.77 percent.
Over the last two sessions, the Nasdaq composite index has lost 9.3 percent. While it remains up 1.96 percent on the year, it is down 17.8 percent from its March 10 peak. Volume was heavy. More than 1.5 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the biggest day ever. It was also the busiest day on the Nasdaq market.
While the rout in the Nasdaq started early in the day, the Dow and S.& P. 500 held up until late morning. Then, traders said, large investors began to experience trouble getting out of their Nasdaq shares and started selling the stocks they could. This meant many of the big stocks that make up the Dow and the S.& P. 500.
"The institutions we deal with are extremely calm, but they're frustrated because there is a ton of volume, but no natural liquidity," said Bill Schneider, head position trader at Warburg Dillon Read. "To some extent we have seen some buyers. But buyers who have bought the dip are a little more cautious this time, particularly in Nasdaq."
One reason for the lack of liquidity in Nasdaq stocks is that the traders acting as market makers in these shares are only required to buy or sell 100 shares at their specified price. In the 1980's, market makers had to buy or sell 1,000 shares at their quoted prices. A market maker acts as an intermediary, easing the buying and selling of stocks between investors and stepping in when others are unwilling to buy and sell.
As a result, traders said that many dealers yesterday bought 100 shares from a customer, as they were obligated to do, and then posted their next price so far below the prevailing market that few investors would be interested. This essentially guaranteed that dealers would not be stuck buying shares in a falling stock. Traders also said that the differences between what dealers were willing to pay for a stock and what they were willing to sell it for -- called the spread -- widened significantly as the Nasdaq plummeted, driving away all but the most desperate investors.
While yesterday's gyrations in the Nasdaq broke records, they are a continuation of extreme swings seen in that market for months.
"In January and February, 70 percent of the trading days qualified as high volatility moves of 1 percent or more, day to day," said Steven Leuthold of Leuthold Weeden Research in Minneapolis. "In March, we probably kicked this up to 75 percent of trading days, the highest we've seen in the history of the Nasdaq index." As for the broader market averages that have been around longer, volatility is higher than it has been since the 1930's.
Mr. Leuthold said that in addition to breaking records, the swings were scary. "High volatility normally indicates a market in transition" he said, in this case further toward a bear market. "I wouldn't be surprised if that is the message we're getting right now."
Unfortunately, the increasingly volatile Nasdaq is where many investors have placed their bets. According to AMG Data Services, more than half of the $113 billion investors have put into mutual funds this year has gone into those that specialize in technology stocks and higher-risk shares. "This is the most focused the flows have ever been," said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services. "The point is technology and all bets are pressed."
In addition, technology stocks have become much more popular among hedge funds, investment vehicles for wealthy individuals. According to the Hennessee Hedge Fund Advisory Group, new capital earmarked for technology funds this year is four times the capital going into the average hedge fund.
Peter Schwab, director of shareholder communications at Strong Funds in Milwaukee, reported that investors who called into the fund's headquarters were concerned but not panicked. Those who did sell shares shed technology funds and went into safer, but less lucrative, money market funds, he said.
One trader said that when Nasdaq had given up all of its gains for the year yesterday, the selling seemed to increase, reflecting the desire of investors to keep the market's rout from cutting into 1999 gains. Further selling pressure in Nasdaq stocks probably came from executives of companies that recently went public, eager to nail down some of their gains. Because these executives typically agree to hold off selling months after an offering, selling pressure does not emerge for a while.
Now, however, many of these so-called lockup periods are expiring and stock is coming on to the market. Indeed, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a research firm in New York, over the last two weeks stocks with coming lockup expirations are down more than 24 percent, almost three times the overall Nasdaq's decline.
The good news in yesterday's decline, some strategists said, is that it could ease some of the Federal Reserve's worries about increasing demand for goods driven by an overheated stock market. "We think this decline in the stock market, if it persists, could change the Fed's thought process radically," said Richard Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities. "The plunge today is serious enough that any thought of wealth driving the economy is going to be tempered at a minimum, and unless there's a reversal right away, the Fed is more inclined to be more mild with their actions."
Jeremy Siegel, professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and author of "Stocks for the Long Run," argued that yesterday's move was healthy because it took some of the speculative fever out of Nasdaq stocks.
"This should surprise no one," he said. "There's no way you can make these valuations reasonable. When you have that sort of market, when it finally falls you get tremendous gaps."
Some investors who have watched the technology craze from the sidelines see a return to sanity among investors.
"We sense some sort of balance may be coming back into the market," said Anthony M. Maramarco, portfolio manager for the Babson Value Fund in Cambridge, Mass. "Gradually, people will come to their senses and realize that there's more out there than just technology."
"The market is fundamentally strong," Professor Siegel said. "But I think there's going to be a lot of unfulfilled hopes and expectations among people who thought they were entering the new world and are now finding it's a pretty harsh reality."

HEADLINE: Microsoft Decision: In Whose Interest?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Microsoft makes for an inviting target. But lost amid the glee over the prospect of bringing the giant to its knees is a careful consideration of the wisdom of doing so. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, at the government's behest, is seeking to reverse a remarkable American success story. 
 Your April 4 editorial notes that "the government has failed to produce decisive evidence that Microsoft's tactics have harmed consumers." Yet it must be said that Microsoft's growth has paralleled a growth in the American technology sector, in the American economy and in the computing power of PC's everywhere.

HEADLINE: On College Basketball;
Michigan State Adds Symmetry to the Chaos

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, April 4

 BODY:
Magic Johnson watched from the floor, barely a one-handed bounce pass away, as Mateen Cleaves stood on a stepladder and snipped down the nets. There they were, two Michigan State point guards separated by 21 years, but connected by a common accomplishment: they took national championships to East Lansing, Mich.
It is a tenuous line, but about the best you can do in trying to link this National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament with those of the past. Johnson, after all, cut down his souvenir as a sophomore in 1979, headed to the National Basketball Association draft as the overall No. 1 draft pick and then changed the professional game forever. 
 Cleaves is a senior. He will be drafted somewhere in the first round, but odds-on it will be behind some high-school player no one but hoops newsletter writers, scouts, agents and their surrogates ever heard of. Still, at least for 40 minutes on Monday, Cleaves and two senior and two junior teammates made sense of a tournament, of a college basketball season, that did not make much sense at all.
The Spartans were more experienced, played better defense and thoroughly handled a young Florida team, 89-76, at the RCA Dome. They were the lone No. 1-seeded team standing in the field of 64 -- two others, Arizona and Stanford, did not make it out of the first weekend.
Michigan State had won an ugly contest, 53-41, in the semifinals Saturday against a Wisconsin team that transported basketball aficionados back in time -- to 1941 when the Badgers' deliberate style sedated Washington State and, you have to believe, anyone who was watching, 39-34.
Wisconsin was the biggest surprise in a tournament full of them. Its coach, Dick Bennett, wears a red sweater vest and has earned a reputation as a genius among his peers after 35 years of taking players who would be hard pressed to make an All Ivy team of any year and turning them into giant killers. To borrow a term from the business world, this "old economy" team may not have been fun to watch on the basketball ticker, but Wisconsin earned its way here.
Michigan State earned the national championship in much the same fashion. It was more talented than Wisconsin, but nearly as short of marquee names. After Cleaves, who scored 18 points to go with 4 assists in the championship game, the Spartans were carried by two other seniors: Morris Peterson, whose 15 second-half points buried the Gators, and A. J. Granger, who had an unobtrusive 19 points and 9 rebounds.
Still, Florida, the "new economy" team, managed to generate all the buzz before and, to some extent, after the Spartans made them 2000's N.C.A.A. runners-up. Their 34-year-old coach, Billy Donovan, lured a collection of seven blue-chip freshmen and sophomores first to Gainesville, Fla., a football stronghold, and then to the title game.
They pressed full court, they bombed from 3-point territory and one of them, Udonis Haslem, banged inside for a career-high 27 points on 10-of-12 shooting.
Next week Florida's sophomore forward Mike Miller will decide whether he will return to school or turn professional. On the eve of the Final Four, Miller confirmed what documents reviewed by The New York Times had shown, that he had spoken extensively with a sports agent who was unregistered in Florida and who did not inform university officials of the conversations, as the state's strict agent law requires. The N.C.A.A. said the player had done nothing wrong, but the agent, Andy Miller, is now under investigation by Florida law-enforcement authorities.
It was yet another strange twist in a strange season that, unfortunately, perhaps upstaged Michigan State's title run. In the weeks leading up to the tournament, a series of N.C.A.A. investigations and player suspensions for everything from who paid prep school tuition to improper contact with agents, prompted some of the biggest names in college coaching to call college sports' governing body names.
In New York, such disparate people and institutions as a basketball enthusiast implicated in a recruiting scandal at Syracuse nearly decade ago, a Manhattan lawyer, a church with a distinguished history earned in the civil-rights era and a famed modeling agency have all been mentioned in connection with Erick Barkley and a continuing investigation of St. John's basketball team.
That is only one part of the tattered mosaic of college basketball that turned the N.C.A.A. president's state-of-the-game address here into a bitter call for change. The president, Cedric Dempsey, barely concealed his disdain for "the culture" of college basketball and vowed to "wipe it out."
So what should have been a celebration of coaches in sweater vests with overachieving players and a senior-laden team persevering to achieve a goal, or even a young, exciting troop full of possibilities, was broken up before it got started.
Magic the person might have been on the court when Cleaves and his Michigan State teammates cut down the nets, but little was magical throughout the final months of college basketball season.

HEADLINE: ALBANY'S LEADERS REACH AGREEMENT ON SPENDING PLAN

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 4

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki and leaders of the Legislature agreed today on the outlines of a roughly $77 billion spending plan that generously finances education, health care, transportation and tax cuts, clearing the way for one of the earliest budgets in a decade.
With the state running a large surplus, the accord sets the boundaries for a budget that is all but certain to include an array of programs that the governor did not call for in his original budget proposal -- from expansion of prekindergarten classes and reductions in class size to low-cost prescription drugs for the elderly. And state leaders also agreed to let voters decide in November whether to spend money on a host of transportation projects, including a new Second Avenue subway line. 
 The deal calls for spending $1.4 billion more than the governor proposed in January. It propels the budget talks further along than they have been at this date in most recent years, and it places Mr. Pataki and the Legislature on a course to enact a final budget by the end of the month.
The deal also calls for $1.2 billion in new tax cuts. But the cuts are not expected to have a significant impact on this year's final budget because they will be structured to take effect in future budget years, legislative aides said.
The agreement frees Governor Pataki from dealing with business in Albany and allows him to turn his attention to campaigning for Gov. George W. Bush and in the process possibly secure a place in a Bush administration for himself.
The budget was due on April 1, but for the 16th consecutive year, the governor and the Legislature failed to meet that deadline. Last year's budget was adopted on Aug. 4 -- 126 days overdue. With today's agreement, the action shifts to the Legislature, where rank-and-file members of both houses will have to negotiate the final details publicly in conference committees.
The swiftness of the budget negotiations this year has been propelled by the legislators' desire to get home early to campaign for re-election, and by a continued surge in tax revenue that allows lawmakers to avoid having to make many of the hard choices of the past. It has also helped that Medicaid spending, traditionally one of the most contentious areas of the budget, was determined in a separate agreement in December.
Lawmakers and their leaders faced another incentive for a timely budget: a one-year-old law that withholds their pay for as long as the budget is late.
Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the Senate, predicted today that the budget, the main business of Albany, would be completed in slightly over a week. "Today we have come together and resolved the differences that have separated us these last few weeks on a budget that will ultimately provide investments in education, transportation and other essential needs," he said in a statement.
The accord announced today calls for $1.2 billion in new tax cuts to be phased in over the next five years, including tax credits for low-wage New Yorkers, as well as a reduction of a tax that adds several dollars a month to the average utility bill.
Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders also agreed to place a $3.8 billion bond act on the November ballot that would help, among other things, to pay for a new Second Avenue subway line -- demanded by the Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver -- as well as repairs to highways and bridges upstate and in the New York City suburbs, a demand made in turn by Mr. Bruno and his Republican colleagues.
The agreement also adds $750 million in a reserve fund to hedge against an economic downturn and to make up for revenue lost to future tax cuts that the governor and the Legislature had enacted in previous years. Mr. Pataki had insisted that the money be placed in reserve.
In the past, agreement on how much to spend above the governor's proposal has been the most difficult part of the budget negotiations. But with tax revenue streaming in, it was hard for Mr. Pataki to resist the Legislature's call for more spending. Mr. Pataki had proposed spending $76.8 billion in the budget he released earlier this year. But lawmakers said he had overestimated the cost of some programs, so that the $1.4 billion of new spending in the budget accord would actually raise total spending by a lesser amount.
As part of the deal, Mr. Pataki has promised that he will not attempt the sort of widespread vetoes he made in 1998, when he cut more than $1 billion in programs, mostly Democratic, from the budget lawmakers sent him. But Mr. Pataki has privately warned Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver that he will abide by the deal only if they do not spend any more than the $1.4 billion that they agreed to add to his original budget proposal.
The deal reached today by Mr. Pataki, Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver settles the main issue that had held up negotiations for weeks: an overall spending figure that all sides could accept. But aides to Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders cautioned that some details still had to be worked out before the budget was completed and then submitted to lawmakers for approval. Conference committee hearings to consider the budget will start as early as Wednesday.
The additional spending that Mr. Pataki, a Republican, and the leaders agreed upon for the 2000-2001 fiscal year will largely finance programs that both houses of the Legislature have been seeking in recent months. In that respect, the deal allows all sides to claim victory.
The governor and legislative leaders tentatively agreed that some of the new money would finance a program that Democrats who control the Assembly had sought: expanding prekindergarten classes statewide and reducing classroom size over the next few years.
The deal also calls for setting aside part of the additional money for a program that is strongly supported by the Republicans who control the Senate: expanding a state subsidy of prescription drug purchases for elderly New Yorkers, along with expanded tuition assistance for college students and their families.
While the deal calls for spending significantly more than Mr. Pataki had proposed, it allows him to achieve one of his main objectives this year: saving $750 million to help balance the budget in future years, particularly if the economy slows.
Mr. Pataki and the leaders agreed to set aside roughly $950 million for several tax cuts that rank-and-file members will specify. But aides to the governor and legislative leaders said that much of that money would be used to scale back the so-called gross receipts tax, which adds several dollars a month on average to New Yorkers' utility bills.
Mr. Pataki and the leaders also agreed to earmark $125 million to expand the earned-income tax credit, a break to the working poor. The deal also calls for setting aside at least $120 million to provide tax credits to businesses with high utility costs, according to aides to the three leaders. But Republicans said they would also push for a plan to make college education fully deductible as part of a final agreement.
The deal to provide $3.8 billion for transportation projects will not have an impact on this year's budget either. That is because leaders plan to ask voters in November to let the state borrow the money by issuing bonds. The last time such a measure went before voters was in 1997, when state leaders put a $2.4 billion school construction bond act on the ballot. The measure was defeated.
One crucial part of the budget that has not been decided is how much will be spent on school aid. But legislative aides say they expect that the budget will increase overall aid to school districts by at least $1 billion, which would be largest annual increase ever for education spending.
 
HIGHLIGHTS
Proposed State Budget: Few Sacrifices
Legislative leaders in Albany have agreed to spend $1.4 billion more than what was proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki, though that is offset somewhat by reducing the governor's estimates of what some programs will cost. In all, they estimate that the final budget will be $77 billion to $78 billion, an increase of 5 to 6 percent over last year.
 
EDUCATION -- Legislative leaders said the state would increase school aid $900 million to $1.2 billion over last year, with the exact figure to be negotiated in conference committees. The state would continue the planned expansion of its program to provide prekindergarten classes to all 4-year-olds, and to reduce class sizes in the early grades, at a cost of $190 million.
 
TAXES -- Officials agreed to tax cuts that, when fully enacted in a few years, would be worth more than $1 billion -- the exact figure has not been decided -- but would most likely be worth a small fraction of that in the first year. Most elements of the tax cut package still must be negotiated, but the lawmakers have agreed to expand the earned income tax credit for the working poor by $125 million a year, matching the increase enacted last year. One issue still undecided is whether to reduce or eliminate what amounts to an income tax on electrical utilities, one that raises power rates. The budget also reflects $2.3 billion worth of tax cuts enacted in past years that will take effect this year.
 
HEALTH CARE -- State leaders remain undecided about two contentious items sought by the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno. Mr. Bruno wants to expand the program that subsidizes prescription drugs for the elderly poor, and to have the state pay for all of a new effort to provide health coverage for the uninsured, rather than pass on part of the cost to local governments. Officials say the lawmakers are likely to accept the prescription drug subsidy, but insist on passing on some new costs to cities and counties.
 
TRANSPORTATION -- The lawmakers agreed that apart from the budget, they would approve two $17 billion capital plans, one for mass transit and one for highways and bridges, with a $3.8 billion bond act going before the voters in November to help pay for them. As part of that deal, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will plan for a Second Avenue subway line the full length of Manhattan, rather than from 125th Street to 63rd Street, as the M.T.A. had proposed in its capital plan.

Port Traffic Sets Records

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

 BODY:
The robust economy propelled record levels of passenger and cargo traffic into the metropolitan region by air and sea last year, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reported yesterday.
The 89.1 million passengers who flew in and out of Newark, La Guardia and Kennedy Airports in 1999 was a record, the agency said. And increases in exports and regional demand produced a record shipping volume of 17.9 million tons at the Port of New York and New Jersey. Traffic on the agency's six bridges and tunnels increased by 2.2 million trips, or 1.8 percent, to 126 million. PATH ridership rose 3.5 percent. 
 The agency said the high volumes, plus reduced staff levels, helped it achieve a record surplus of $191 million last year, up from $166 million in 1998. STEVE STRUNSKY

Bursting Bubbles: Web Tales of Speculation

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POLLAK 

 BODY:
FOR some, the bubble was the great uranium land rush of the 1950's. When it burst, most Colorado desert turned out to be Colorado desert. For others, it was the great coin craze of the 1960's, when new Lincoln pennies were sold for dollars as great investments. Guess what they ended up being worth? Those who plunged into wine futures in the 1970's drowned their sorrows in style.
Financial bubbles, those dangerous combinations of crowd psychology and alluring, wispy investment offers, have a long and painful past. Today's dot-com investors may get an education from three of history's hottest deals: tulipmania, the South Sea bubble and the Mississippi scheme.
All three are in an 1841 classic that is as current as today's stock quotes: Charles Mackay's "Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds." It is online at www .bibliomania.com, and at sailor .gutenberg.org. 
 Mackay traces the tulip from Turkey to its introduction into the Netherlands in the mid-16th century. "In 1634, the rage among the Dutch to possess them was so great that the ordinary industry of the country was neglected, and the population, even to its lowest dregs, embarked in the tulip trade." One would-be buyer offered 12 acres of land for a rare bulb. A single example of the Viceroy variety fetched 4 fat oxen, 8 fat swine, 12 fat sheep, a bed, a suit of clothes, a silver drinking cup and large quantities of wheat, rye, wine, beer, butter and cheese.
One common thread in these accounts is that when the bubble bursts, it bursts quickly.
"The cry of distress sounded everywhere, and each man accused his neighbor." Alas, Mackay wrote, the courts refused to interfere, ruling that tulipmania debts were gambling debts, and unenforceable.
A shorter account that focuses more on the tulips themselves, "A Rambling Romp Through Tulip History," can be found at www.bulb .com/historymyth/romp.html.
The South Sea Bubble, which caused the first great British stock market crash in 1720, began in 1711 with a plan for a private group of merchants to enrich the public treasury by trading British goods to the Spanish colonies in America. All they needed was an exclusive trading right and a large loan from issuing stock, according to Mackay's account.
"Everybody had heard of the gold and silver mines of Peru and Mexico; every one believed them to be inexhaustible and it was only necessary to send the manufactures of England to the coast to be repaid a hundredfold," Mackay wrote. Never mind that Philip V of Spain had no intention of allowing the English free trade with Spanish America -- the rumors were irresistible. "Visions of ingots danced before their eyes," and warnings in Parliament were drowned out.
Perhaps the oddest and most instructive outgrowths of the South Sea Bubble were the unrelated stocks that were issued just to take advantage of the frenzy. Mackay lists four pages of them: for insuring horses, for rebuilding parsonages, for a perpetual motion machine, for trading in hair, and the piece de resistance: "for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is."
There is a well-illustrated account of the South Sea Bubble in an online Harvard Magazine reprint at www.harvard-magazine.com/issues /mj99/damnd.html.
The Mississippi Bubble, which occurred in France about the same time, owed its origin to a Scotsman with the magnificently inappropriate name of John Law. A mathematical genius and bon vivant, according to Mackay, he developed a winning gambling system that got him kicked out of a number of countries until he ingratiated himself with the Duke of Orleans, who became regent to Louis XV. Law issued notes based on the profits to be made from the gold and silver of the Mississippi and the Louisiana Territory. (Gold? Mississippi? Hey, it sounded good in 1718.)
Speculation in Mississippi bonds was so great that space on Law's street in Paris was rented for a fortune to traders. "The story goes that a humpbacked man who stood in the street gained considerable sums by lending his hump as a writing desk to the eager speculators."
Law was not entirely to blame, Mackay wrote: "He did not count on the avaricious frenzy of a whole nation; he did not see that confidence, like mistrust, could be increased almost ad infinitum and that hope was as extravagant as fear."
In his epitaph for Law, Mackay compares the bubbler to the first unsuspecting canoeist down the Niagara River: "He was dashed to pieces with his bark, but the waters, maddened and turned to foam by the rough descent, only boiled and bubbled for a time, and then flowed on again as smoothly as ever."

HEADLINE: Hispanics Are Narrowing the Digital Divide

BYLINE: By KATIE HAFNER 

 BODY:
OF all the attention paid to the so-called digital divide lately, little of it has been devoted to the topic of Hispanics in the United States and their computer and Internet usage.
A 150-page report released today by Cheskin Research, a market research firm in Redwood Shores, Calif., says that the gap is narrowing for Hispanics and that the rate at which Hispanics in this country are buying computers far outstrips that of the general population. 
 The Cheskin study, titled "The Digital World of the U.S. Hispanic," was based on a telephone survey of 2,017 Hispanic households in February. The survey found that 42 percent of the nation's 9.3 million Hispanic households had a computer. That represents a 68 percent increase over 1998, compared with a 43 percent increase in computer ownership for the general population.
Economics still plays a large role. The median income for Hispanic households is $28,300, compared with $38,900 for the general population, said Felipe Korzenny, a principal at Cheskin Research and the main author of the study.
According to the Cheskin study, 25 percent of Hispanic households with annual incomes between $10,000 and $20,000 have a computer. Another recent study of the gap between the computer haves and have-nots, conducted by National Public Radio, the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, showed that in the general population where household income is less than $20,000, 31 percent of households had computers.
"Considering that gap in income, the degree to which the Hispanics are adopting the technology is beyond expectations," Mr. Korzenny said.
Part of the reason for the large increase in computer purchases among Hispanics, Mr. Korzenny said, is "a very strong motivation of not being left behind."
Mr. Korzenny said that although the perception of high cost was still a strong barrier to computer ownership, lack of information about technology was an impediment that loomed just as large.
"The kids get it," said Rochelle Newman, president of Enlace Communications, an advertising firm in Los Angeles that focuses on the Hispanic market. "They see that it will get them to the next level. The kids are the ambassadors for the technology experience."
Ms. Newman said that in all the years she had been marketing to Hispanics, she had not seen anything as strong as Hispanic consumers' interest in being online. In focus groups she has conducted on the topic of health care, she said, "the respondents still don't know what an H.M.O. is, but they do know the Internet could help them find out what an H.M.O. is."
Another problem in the past, Mr. Korzenny said, has been the dearth of Hispanic-oriented Web sites. But now, sites like quepasa.com, Latino.com and Yupi, to name a few, are beginning to appear on the Web.
"It's been interesting watching it develop from a very small group of Hispanic-oriented sites to all the new sites like quepasa.com and Espanol.com," said Ernest Bromley, president of Bromley Communications, an advertising firm in San Antonio that focuses on the Hispanic market. "Plus there are all the companies coming in from Latin America launching their portals. It's just going crazy."
Surprisingly, however, Mr. Korzenny said, most Hispanic Internet users prefer the Spanish-language versions of Yahoo and America Online to the Hispanic-specific sites. One possible explanation, Mr. Korzenny said, is that the Hispanic sites do not do enough to distinguish themselves from the AOL's of the world. "These sites, though they're very nice, look like replicas of Yahoo, AOL and Netscape Navigator," he said. "The point of differentiation might not be strong enough. My guess is that the Spanish sites have focused on being sophisticated portals without customizing themselves to the culture or the needs of the culture."
Whatever the reason for the greater popularity of the mainstream portals' Hispanic versions, the situation could soon change because Quepasa.com recently began offering free, advertising-supported Internet access through NetZero.
Ms. Newman said the next big challenge was to get computers into more Hispanic households. "There is still the economic divide," she said.
Mr. Korzenny said that one way he saw to increase computer ownership among Hispanics was with innovative sales methods. He pointed to retailers like La Curacao, in Southern California, that have succeeded by going door to door, offering credit to low-income Hispanics with no credit history.
"These are people with relatively low income but they would pay," he said.
"I tell computer executives that if they would partner with these companies and sell computers that way," he added, "they could sell hundreds per day."

HEADLINE: Tommaso Buscetta, 71, Dies; First Italian Mafia Informer

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: ROME, April 5

 BODY:
Tommaso Buscetta, the first important Italian mob leader to break the Mafia oath of silence and whose testimony helped convict hundreds of Mafia leaders in Italy and the United States, died of cancer on Sunday, his Italian lawyer, Luigi Liggotti, said. He was 71 and lived at an undisclosed location under the American witness protection program.
Italy's best known "pentito," the Italian word for a penitent is now used to describe Mafia informers, Mr. Buscetta was an early, ruthless pioneer in the Sicilian Mafia's turn to drug trafficking. His decision in 1984 to cooperate with Italian and, later, American prosecutors changed the course of a dark chapter of modern Italian history. 
Mr. Buscetta's testimony about heroin smuggling in the "pizza connection" case in the mid-1980's won him American citizenship, a place in the witness protection program and the gratitude of Italian and American officials. Notoriety gave him a forum for disingenuous expiation.
"Over the years, I have seen our organization change from within," Mr. Buscetta, speaking behind a screen, told senators at a hearing on organized crime in 1988. "I have seen money, drugs and greed corrupt and destroy the cosa nostra code of honor and loyalty to the families."
His career as a mobster-turned-state's witness spanned the highs and lows of Italy's long bloody battle against organized crime. The government's reliance on pentiti culminated in 1993 with the arrest of Salvatore Riina, whom Mr. Buscetta identified as the head Sicilian Mafia.
But it reached its nadir in August 1995, when Mr. Buscetta, under Italian government protection to testify against former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, was photographed by a journalist on a Mediterranean cruise ship, sunbathing and mamboing in the ship's ballroom.
Mr. Andreotti was found not guilty of colluding with Mafia chieftains in two trials last year, partly because the testimony of Mr. Buscetta, who mentioned Mr. Andreotti's reported intimacy with mob leaders eight years after he had entered witness protection was hearsay.
Mr. Andreotti, seven times prime minister and one of Italy's most powerful postwar politicians, noted Mr. Buscetta's passing with his customary dryness.
"I was pleased the state helped him try all the cures," he told reporters on Tuesday. "It would have been very serious if his illness had stopped him from attending my trials."
Mr. Buscetta, a son of a Sicilian glazier, began his criminal career in the black market after World War II, moved to Argentina in 1948 and then back to Sicily to join the Mafia in 1957. He fled mob turf wars and local law enforcement in 1962 and was on the lam for 10 years, until he was arrested in Rio de Janeiro on international drug-trafficking charges and extradited to Sicily, where he served eight years in jail.
His release coincided with a fierce power struggle between his clan and Mr. Riina's mob, a bloodbath that cost him many relatives, including two sons. Mr. Buscetta again fled to Brazil, where he was arrested in 1983. Learning that he was about to be extradited back to Italy, Mr. Buscetta made an unsuccessful suicide attempt by swallowing strychnine.
In 1984, three days after his plane had landed here, he told a top Mafia prosecutor, Giovanni Falcone, words that quickly became famous: "I am a mafioso." He began talking and did not stop for 45 days.
Mr. Buscetta, a self-described "man of honor" in the Mafia hierarchy, did not provide investigators just names and dates. He painted an intimate portrait of the means and mores of the cosa nostra, explaining the sometimes complex, often feudal rituals, codes and castes below the surface of organized crime.
Two years later, Mr. Falcone and a fellow prosecutor, Paolo Borsellino, won the first "maxitrial" in Sicily, putting hundreds of mobsters behind bars. But that victory unleashed a decade of unbridled violence, as the Mafia brazenly challenged the state, killing judges, prosecutors and local officials. Mr. Falcone and Mr. Borsellino, two highly most respected magistrates, were assassinated within two months of each other in 1992.
In 1996, Mr. Riina was convicted of conspiring in the murder of Mr. Borsellino and five bodyguards, and the next year he was convicted of ordering the assassination of Mr. Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards.
Mr. Buscetta, who had three wives in three countries and seven children, was so famous here that he earned a certain cachet. In 1994, the design house Dolce e Gabbana brought out a men's spring collection inspired by the mobster. It featured black pinstripe suits, shiny pointed shoes and black sunglasses.
When his death became known on Tuesday, Mr. Buscetta was mourned by prosecutors and other officials as a hero of the war against organized crime, jarring accolades for a man who once described the "liberating" feeling that comes with pulling the trigger and watching an opponent fall.
On the meaner streets of Palermo, however, the word "buscetta" has become a slang insult in the same the way "sbirro" is a pejorative term for a cop.
"I am not a pentito," Mr. Buscetta once told Enzo Biagi, one of the best-known journalists in Italy. "I am a man who had to defend himself, and to do so had to tell the truth."

HEADLINE: Stock Trades In London Are Disrupted

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, April 5

 BODY:
Unsettled by Wall Street's wild swings, European stocks fell today, pulled down by some of the technology shares that had been leading the market higher. But for British investors the real news was that they could not trade for much of the day because of an unexplained technical problem that crippled the London Stock Exchange.
The suspension of trading until late afternoon could hardly have come at a worse time. Today was the last day of the British fiscal year for individuals, when investors usually scramble to reduce tax exposure using a strategy known in the business as "bed and breakfast" -- selling stocks today with an arrangement to buy them back tomorrow. 
 "You had all these private-client brokers coming in today to arrange these deals, finding the stock exchange closed and going ballistic," one broker said.
Moreover, the breakdown coincided with reports that the London exchange was in early merger talks with the Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt, and its negotiating position was clearly undermined by such a technical debacle. Brokers showed no hesitation in venting.
"I think it's diabolical," said David Donnelly, chief investment officer at Gordon House Asset Management. "If you think that in today's technological world, the London Stock Exchange can't open, it's incredible, farcical that there's no backup facility to keep it running."
When trading did open at 3.45 p.m. -- the close was extended to 8 p.m. -- the London market followed the rest of Europe down.
Europe's retreat affected just about every index, with new-economy stocks taking the brunt of the selling, which analysts attributed to fears among investors that the risks of owning technology and Internet stocks had risen because of the huge swings on Tuesday on Wall Street.
"The trans-Atlantic correlation between the two markets is very high," said Paul Horne, a European equity market economist with Salomon Smith Barney in London. But, he said, the fall in European technology stocks was part of a process that had been going on for about a month, driven by expectations of higher interest rates in the United States, Britain and the 11-nation euro-zone.
"The markets are taking profits out of these overvalued and under-earning shares," he said. "There's a lot of hope, but not much earning."
He forecast that volatility would continue on Thursday, as investors bought their way back into old-sector stocks with the potential to benefit from newer technologies.
The Dow Jones Stoxx 50 Price Index of European companies fell 2.8 percent, its sharpest drop since Jan. 4. The Euro.NM index of computer-related shares fell 4.7 percent, extending declines that have stripped 35 percent of its value since its record set on March 10.
And in Helsinki, dominated by new- economy stocks, the General Index slumped 7.7 percent, dragged down by a sharp fall in Nokia, the mobile phone company, which partly recovered before the close.
In Paris, the CAC-40 index closed off 3 percent, and Xetra DAX in Frankfurt fell 2.6 percent. Among individual stocks, the sharpest losses were among technology and computer-related companies with high valuations based on assumptions of booming future profits.
Sonera, Finland's biggest telephone company, fell 8.6 percent; Canal Plus, the Continent's largest pay-TV company, fell 11.4 percent; and Cap Gemini, Europe's biggest computer-services group, fell 9.6 percent. The gloom disrupted plans by some companies for initial share sales. Newconomy, for instance, which aims to provide support for Internet-related businesses, postponed plans for a $96 million flotation. Analysts forecast that the number of such offerings would be sharply reduced.
Despite the misery elsewhere, there was one beneficiary of the day's upheavals in London. Tradepoint Financial Networks, which operates an electronic rival to the London exchange, recorded seven times the trades as usual. "This is a great day for us," a spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Reagan vs. the Great Government Whale: Or the triumph of legend over history.

BYLINE: By J. Bradford DeLong; This column appears here every Thursday. J. Bradford DeLong is a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley and co-editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. Four economic analysts -- Professor DeLong, Jeff Madrick, Virginia Postrel and Alan B. Krueger -- rotate as contributors.

 BODY:
TWO decades ago Ronald Reagan campaigned for president promising to shrink the size of the federal government. And in America's political mythology Mr. Reagan's victory started the rollback of the social insurance state. Mr. Reagan pushed his huge supply-side tax cut through Congress and so starved and shrank the leviathan that was the government.
This is the mythology. But it is not the economic history. In the current budget year -- in fiscal 2000 -- the share of the nation's economic output, or gross domestic product, collected by the federal government as taxes will amount to more than 20 percent, up from an average of 18.7 percent the last five pre-Reagan-administration years, 1976 through 1980. How did this come to pass? What happened to the supply-side line in the sand drawn by Mr. Reagan? 
 The story of how the 1981 tax-cut shift in America's political economy was eroded to nothing has three parts: the 1980's deficits, the early 1990's forecasts and the late 1990's boom.
President Reagan's 1981 tax cut came without significant spending cuts. Nineteen eighty-one was the year of tax cuts. But 1982 and the years following were the years of deficits. Even before the ink of Mr. Reagan's signature was dry, his senior policy makers began loudly and angrily blaming each other for the deficit.
David Stockman, the budget director, and his aides blamed the rest of the administration's unwillingness to think about serious budget cuts. Martin Anderson, who was the White House domestic policy adviser early in Mr. Reagan's first term, disagreed, blaming a Congress that "time and time again" rebuffed presidential plans to cut spending. But Democratic House leaders and Republican Senate leaders accurately pointed out that nine-tenths of the deficit would have remained had Congress accepted every one of Mr. Reagan's spending proposals.
Perhaps the most interesting attribution of blame came late, in the mid-1990's, from Irving Kristol, the conservative intellectual, whose magazine, The Public Interest, had helped start the supply-side boom. Mr. Kristol contended the mistake was in carrying out the campaign promises of 1980, for supply-side doctrine was a political platform, not a public policy, and had a "rather cavalier attitude toward the budget deficit and other monetary or fiscal problems."
The point, he added, was to create a "Republican majority -- so political effectiveness was the priority, not the accounting deficiencies of government."
No matter whose finger-pointing you agree with -- Mr. Stockman's, Mr. Anderson's, the Senate Republican leader Bob Dole's or Irving Kristol's -- the fact of the deficits of the 1980's created slow but inexorable pressure to raise taxes to close the deficit. Indeed, the process of taking back some of the revenue given away by the government in 1981 began as early as 1982 with a tax bill pushed through Congress largely by Mr. Dole.
The pressure to raise taxes was amplified by another consequence of the deficit: slower economic growth. The deficit meant reduced money for investment, which meant lower income growth, which meant lower revenue growth. As a result, the long-term forecasts of the administration's Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office kept turning out to be substantially more optimistic than what actually happened. So by the early 1990's, both the O.M.B. and the C.B.O., anxious not to overestimate federal revenue yet again, began -- perhaps unconsciously -- to low-ball their forecasts. In the early 1990's, as the economy weakened and government revenue slowed as well, they produced increasingly pessimistic and horrifying deficit forecasts.
All this further increased the pressure for tax increases. Both George Bush, a Republican, and Bill Clinton, a Democrat, proposed tax increases explicitly aimed at reversing the widening deficits. And by 1994-95, federal revenues as a share of G.D.P. were as high as they had been in Jimmy Carter's term.
Then came the late 1990's boom. Lowered interest rates driven in part by the shrinking of annual budget deficits, coupled with the flourishing of the information technology sector -- partly made possible by extra money no longer going to cover the government deficit that fueled high-investment expansion -- fostered a boom in asset prices.
And as the paper wealth of rich Americans grew beyond their previous dreams, the well-off began to cash in some of their gains. Such increases in the stock of wealth from higher asset prices are not part of G.D.P., which measures the flow of goods and services newly produced, and has no place for changes in the value of assets that already exist. But the Internal Revenue Service collects extra taxes when the affluent sell assets and realize capital gains. Thus the magnitude of the late 1990's boom in production and the value of wealth has pushed federal revenue relative to G.D.P. to their current high level.
In retrospect the people who worked hard in the late 1970's to elect a president to cut federal spending and roll back the social insurance state saw their work go for naught. They had succeeded, or thought they did, with the election of Mr. Reagan. They were elated, and their social democratic adversaries disheartened. But today the level of federal taxes shows no sign of their work.
Perhaps there is a moral here. Perhaps if you are in politics to change actual policy -- rather than to provide jobs for your friends -- it is important to make sure that those you vote and work for do not take political effectiveness and media splash as their sole compass.

HEADLINE: Solomon Barkin, 92, Economist In Labor Movement and Teacher

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Solomon Barkin, a retired labor economist and professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts who wrote prodigiously about working people, died on March 29 at his home in Leverett, Mass. He was 92.
Professor Barkin spent 25 years in the labor movement, from 1937 to 1963, as director of research for the Textile Workers Union, now part of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. For the next five years, he was a manpower specialist and head of the social-affairs division of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. 
 He taught economics at Amherst from 1968 to 1978, when he was given emeritus status. Then he was a visiting professor of economics at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and a senior Fulbright professor at Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand.
A native New Yorker, Professor Barkin graduated from City College in 1928 and received an M.A. degree at Columbia University in 1929. After stints as a City College instructor and assistant director of the State Commission on Old Age Security in Albany, he served on the labor advisory board of the National Recovery Administration and as a specialist in industrial economics in the Department of Commerce.
His published work started in 1930 with a study of old-age security and extended into the 1980's when he sat on the editorial boards of the Journal of Economic Issues and the French-language edition of Relations Industrielles, where he continued until 1991. He also helped edit periodicals like Technical Change and Manpower Planning, Arbitration Journal and International Labor.
His experiences were reflected in the book "The Decline of the Labor Movement and What Can Be Done About It" (1961), in which he argued that unions were getting bogged down in administering contracts to the detriment of their role as instruments of change.
His other books included "Worker Militancy and its Consequences, 1965-75" (1975). An updated edition, subtitled "The Changing Climate of Western and Industrial Relations," appeared in 1983.
Mr. Barkin is survived by his wife of 59 years, Elaine Rappaport Barkin; two sons, David, of Mexico, and Dr. Roger Barkin of Denver; a daughter, Amy Barkin of Bethesda, Md., and three grandsons.

HEADLINE: Iran Says It Seized Ship Smuggling Iraqi Oil

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 5

 BODY:
Two weeks after the United States warned that increased oil smuggling from Iraq could not be stopped without Iran's help, the Iranian government said today that it had seized a tanker illegally exporting Iraqi oil as it passed through Iranian waters.
The Iranian national news agency said that revolutionary guards boarded an Iraqi ship flying under a Honduran flag on Saturday. The ship was reported to be carrying 2,500 tons of smuggled oil. The Iranian agency said the ship and its captain and crew were in Iranian custody. 
 "If the reports are true, we are pleased to see that Iran is taking measures against this illegal traffic," a spokesman for the State Department, James P. Rubin, said.
"In the past, Iran has taken measures to halt smuggling along its coast, and we hope this is an indication they intend to do so vigorously again," he said.
Mr. Rubin said the United States had not confirmed the arrest, which follows more than 18 months during which Iran allowed what American officials say is significant growth in the illegal coastal trade.
On March 23, Vice Adm. Charles Moore, the American coordinator of an international fleet that patrols the Persian Gulf off Iraq and intercepts illegal shipments, told the Security Council sanctions committee on Iraq that oil smuggling had increased significantly since the fall, with much of the trade beginning in Iranian coastal waters.
Admiral Moore told the committee that a diplomatic or political overture to Iraq was needed and that the smuggled Iraqi oil -- most of it gas oil, similar to diesel fuel -- went to a variety of countries including Iran, as well as to Pakistan and India. Recently, two Thais and a Singaporean were charged in California with trying to buy Iraqi oil, apparently for shipment to Southeast Asia.
Pentagon officials told the sanctions panel that with high oil prices, Iraq could earn more than $1 billion in illegal sales this year.
Under Security Council sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait, President Saddam Hussein's government is not only prohibited from selling oil without United Nations supervision, but it is also barred from refining oil, as it has to do to produce gas oil.
Since December, Iraq has been allowed to sell as much crude oil as it wants, with profits going to a United Nations escrow account to pay for food, medicines and equipment for a range of public services. A third of the money goes to compensate victims of the Kuwait invasion.
In another sanctions dispute, American officials considered today how to respond to an illegal flight into Baghdad by an Italian plane that was taking anti-sanctions campaigners to Iraq. All flights to Iraq have to seek approval from the sanctions committee.
The pilot of the small Italian passenger plane left Jordan yesterday saying that he was going to Syria and then turned and flew at a very low altitude into Iraq.
On board were, in addition to the pilot, an Italian businessman, identified by the Jordanians as Nicola Grauso; a member of the European Parliament, Vittori Sgarbi; and a French priest, the Rev. Jean-Marie Benjamin. When the plane returned to Jordan today, it was intercepted, forced to land and impounded.
The businessmen were allowed to leave Amman by commercial flights, but the pilot was detained. The priest, who had campaigned against sanctions, remained in Baghdad, the Jordanians said.
In Baghdad, the group said the flight had been deliberately planned to break the air embargo. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz called the flight a "noble and courageous initiative."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Asian Technology Stocks Fall, Echoing Nasdaq Dive

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 5

 BODY:
In Asia, as in the United States, the bloom is off the rose for technology shares. But here, it has withered more rapidly.
Many stock markets from Tokyo to Singapore declined today as investors followed the gyrating Nasdaq in the United States by dumping shares in technology, Internet and telecommunications companies. The rout was severe in Hong Kong, where the benchmark Hang Seng index plunged 3.4 percent and popular companies like China Telecom and Pacific Century CyberWorks led the retreat. 
 The sell-off has particularly troubling implications for Pacific Century, which is using its stock as currency to finance a takeover of Hong Kong's dominant telephone company, Cable and Wireless HKT. Pacific Century's shares fell 11 percent, to 14.95 Hong Kong dollars, or $1.92. The shares have declined 32 percent since the agreement was announced late in February.
"We're certainly in the danger zone for this deal," said David Webb, editor of Webb-site.com, an Internet service for investors. "The institutional investors who own Cable and Wireless stock are sensible people. There is a point at which they will reject the transaction."
The Pacific Century deal is something of a bellwether because it symbolizes the rise of Internet companies in Asia. The company, controlled by a 32-year-old entrepreneur, Richard Li, has few assets aside from a clutch of investments in Internet start-ups. Yet it has become one of the most highly valued stocks in Hong Kong, rivaling the property empire of Mr. Li's father, Li Ka-shing.
To win Cable and Wireless HKT, the younger Mr. Li vanquished Singapore Telecommunications, a much larger company controlled by the Singapore government. He was able to do so because the board of Cable and Wireless P.L.C., the London-based parent of Cable and Wireless HKT, concluded that selling to an Internet company was more attractive than to another phone company.
But while Cable and Wireless owns 54 percent of HKT, Mr. Li still needs the approval of other shareholders, including China Telecom and the Hong Kong government. He is offering two options for their shares: all-stock or stock and cash. The value of the all-stock offer has dropped to $25.8 billion from $38.1 billion, while the stock and cash offer has dropped to $28 billion from $35.9 billion.
Mr. Webb said the erosion in Pacific Century CyberWorks' shares all but guaranteed that investors would opt for the stock-and-cash offer. That would leave HKT's majority owner, Cable and Wireless, with less cash and a larger stake in Pacific Century. Cable and Wireless has pledged to sell a chunk of that stake soon after the deal is completed, which will put further pressure on Pacific Century shares.
Some experts said they were baffled by the open-ended nature of the deal. "Cable and Wireless didn't negotiate a collar on the stock, they didn't negotiate a walk-away price, and the breakup fee is minimal," said Henry Lee, managing director of Hendale Ventures, an asset management firm in Hong Kong.
But other analysts pointed out that Pacific Century will not make a formal offer to shareholders until May 18. Given the wild swings in technology shares, its stock price could well rebound by then. Despite the steady erosion in the company's shares, there have been no public indications of concern, either from Cable and Wireless or from other HKT shareholders.
A spokesman for Pacific Century declined to comment today, noting only that the terms of the deal would not be modified.
Pacific Century was far from the only technology stock punished in Hong Kong today. Three of the hottest local Internet start-ups -- Tom.com, Hongkong.com and Sunevision -- plunged 16.6 percent, 16.8 percent, and 12.2 percent respectively. After soaring, these companies are now trading below the prices at which they went public a few weeks ago.
Nor was the bad news limited to Hong Kong. In Tokyo, two of the most prominent new-economy stocks continued to languish. Softbank, which owns a portfolio of Internet investments, fell by the Nikkei index's daily trading limit of 5,000 yen, or $47.77, to close at 76,500 yen, or $730.94.
Trading in the shares of Hikari Tsushin, which sells cellular phones and has a joint venture with Pacific Century CyberWorks, was halted for a fourth consecutive session, as orders to sell stock swamped orders to buy. The company recently warned of much-larger-than-expected losses in the six-month period that ended in February.
Despite all the anxiety, many analysts said this was a much-needed correction for Asian markets that had become dangerously overheated.
"The tech bubble is finally bursting," said Marc Faber, the head of his own investment firm here. "In order to burst a bubble, people have to lose money. Now, people are losing money."

A Call to Put Social Issues on Corporate Agendas

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, April 5

 BODY:
A multinational corporation prepares for a major investment in a troubled part of the world. The pickings, from oil or mining or cheap labor, stand to be enormous. But the local government is corrupt. Its security forces are brutal. What does the company do?
Increasingly, according to a report released here tonight by Amnesty International, the answer is fraught with a new kind of corporate risk, not just for the company's operations but its global reputation, retention of quality employees and ultimately its shareholders. 
 In the modern wired world, the company's activities will not simply fall under the microscopic scrutiny of advocacy groups, the report says, those same groups will spread their assertions and criticism around the world within seconds on the Internet.
Far more than in the past, the report argues, a multinational company's stance on human rights will be considered part of its performance. And, it says, companies must be prepared to confront the governments that play host to them about issues ranging from political repression to child labor.
"There is no hiding place," said Sir Geoffrey Chandler of Amnesty International, the London-based human rights monitoring group that wrote the report along with the Prince of Wales Business Leaders Forum, an advocacy organization supported by Prince Charles of Britain to promote socially responsible business practices.
"To go without a policy on human rights is to go naked into a dangerous world," Sir Geoffrey said in an interview.
The report, titled "Human Rights -- Is It Any of Your Business?," signals the beginning of a new campaign by advocacy groups to hold corporate behavior to standards that many multinational corporations had once sought to dismiss.
It cites, for instance, the experience of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group in the Niger Delta of Nigeria in the mid-1990's, when the company's activities were caught between a repressive military regime and the protests of Nigeria's Ogoni people, who demanded that Shell compensate them for extracting oil from their land. The conflict led to the execution of nine Ogoni activists in 1995 -- and, immediately afterward, demands for a boycott of Shell products. As a result, the report says, Shell revised its business principles to commit itself to upholding human rights.
The report's insistence that other corporations should follow the lead of companies like Shell, BP Amoco P.L.C., Reebok International and Levi Strauss & Company reflects how advocacy groups have increasingly challenged businesses over their practices.
In Britain, consumer advocacy groups have succeeded in virtually driving genetically modified foods off supermarket shelves. Corporations are expected to routinely report on their environmental record. Pressure from United States and British groups in the 1990's forced new scrutiny of the way child labor was used in the Asian sporting goods industry, from footwear to soccer balls.
But the newest campaign takes aim not so much at consumers as at the boardrooms of big international companies, urging the most senior managers to consider the hazards of ignoring issues like labor rights, local land rights, the use of security forces to protect foreign installations and the dilemmas of operating under corrupt regimes or in war zones. All those factors, it argues, have become more relevant as multinational corporations play an increasingly dominant role in economic development.
"Companies have a direct self-interest in using their legitimate influence to protect and promote the human rights of their employees and of the communities within which they are investing and/or operating," the report says. "The increasing scrutiny of corporate behavior by the media, consumer groups, community organizations, local and international nongovernmental organizations, and the immediacy of global communication leave companies with little, if any, hiding place."
The report urges that companies incorporate explicit commitments to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in their central strategies and operating procedures and accept outside scrutiny of their performance. "There can be no neutrality," Sir Geoffrey said in the interview. "If you are silent, you are going to be seen as complicit."
It was not clear tonight how the report would be received in business circles. However, a survey by the Ashridge business school in Britain released tonight in conjunction with the report suggested that human rights issues were finding their way onto corporate agendas.
The survey of Fortune 500 companies said 36 percent of respondents "have decided not to proceed with a proposed investment project because of concerns over human rights issues" while 19 percent "have disinvested from a particular country because of concerns" about the same issues. It also found that less than half -- 44 percent -- of companies with a code of ethics or business principles "make explicit reference to human rights."

HEADLINE: Settlement Reported in Bond-Pricing Case

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
More than a dozen Wall Street securities firms, led by the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup, have agreed to pay more than $120 million to end long-running federal investigations into whether state and local governments nationwide were overcharged for Treasury securities they bought, according to people close to the parties in the agreement.
With the settlement, expected to be announced today, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service are wrapping up their investigations into a practice known as yield burning. 
 In several lawsuits filed against investment banks in the 1990's, regulators and municipal officials contended that the banks charged artificially high prices for Treasury securities, which lowered, or "burned down," the yield, or rate of interest, those securities paid. Yield moves in the opposite direction from the price.
The settlement will result in the dismissal of some of the suits, including one filed in United States District Court in Manhattan by Michael R. Lissack, who had been an investment banker at the former Smith Barney. It will also extinguish fears that some investors could face tax liabilities for buying bonds that had been promoted as tax exempt.
The I.R.S. had been studying whether to take away the tax-exempt status of some bonds issued by municipalities. But lawyers involved in the negotiations said they had been told that the I.R.S. would not do that.
A spokesman for PaineWebber Group, the big brokerage firm, said: "We are pleased with this industrywide settlement. It covers municipal reinvestment transactions done throughout the industry from 1990 through 1994 and resolves any uncertainty regarding tax liability for the affected municipal bond issuers and bondholders."
As part of the settlement, PaineWebber is paying about $26 million to the United States Treasury and to clients that issued municipal bonds, people close to the parties said. That amount ranks PaineWebber second only to Salomon Smith Barney, which is paying about $40 million, these people said.
Most of the parties to the settlement, including Salomon Smith Barney, the I.R.S. and the United States attorney's office, would not comment on the agreement before it was announced.
The amount each firm is paying is based on the number and pricing of underwritings they managed that regulators contend involved illegal markups. Some of the biggest firms on Wall Street are paying as little as $2 million, while some smaller competitors are paying much more. Dain Rauscher, a smaller brokerage firm based in Minneapolis, is paying about $10 million, while the Prudential Securities unit of the Prudential Insurance Company of America is paying about $6 million, these people said.
As the one who blew the whistle on yield burning, Mr. Lissack, who no longer works on Wall Street, stands to reap a reward of $20 million or more. John Phillips, a lawyer for Mr. Lissack, said his client intended to keep only about $4 million and give the rest to charity and to his alma mater, Williams College.
"Any global resolution involving all the firms will put to rest the issue of yield burning," said Mr. Phillips, a partner in Phillips & Cohen in Washington. "The big benefit is this lawsuit has totally cleaned up this industry."
Mr. Lissack became a pariah in the municipal bond business after he went public with his allegations that investment banks were overcharging for the Treasuries that municipal governments used to refinance their debt. After Smith Barney fired him, he filed suit against a group of investment banks under the federal False Claims Act. That law provides for whistle-blowers to receive 15 percent to 25 percent of amounts recovered from defendants.
Micah S. Green, chief operating officer of the Bond Market Association, an industry trade group, welcomed word of an impending settlement. "In a sense this is everyone standing up and saying, 'Let's put this issue behind us and hold investors harmless and preserve the safety and soundness of the municipal bond market, which is so important to state and local governments.'

HEADLINE: Conference on the New Economy Gives Clinton a Chance to Glow

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
There was plenty of talk about hard-core economic issues like productivity, technology and stock market valuations today at the White House as President Clinton served as the host to a daylong conference on the new economy and what it means for the nation's future.
On that level, it broke no new ground. But it was the kind of day Mr. Clinton loves and excels at, rich in policy debate and statistics. 
 "Even though the participation of women in the labor force is the highest it has ever been, the unemployment rate among women is the lowest in 40 years," the president asserted this morning, from memory, during a freewheeling panel discussion entitled, "Is the New Economy Rewriting Rules on Productivity and the Business Cycle?"
But just beneath the surface, there was politics at work.
Given that the nation is enjoying the longest economic expansion in its history, with unemployment just above 4 percent and inflation nearly dormant, the administration was happy to have the economy take center stage for the day.
On no other issue does the president have as clear a claim to a legacy, notwithstanding Republican claims that the nation is enjoying not the Clinton boom but a continuation of the Reagan boom.
For the most part, the conference steered clear of overtly partisan messages.
There were even a few Republicans present, including John B. Taylor, an economist from Stanford University who is an adviser to the presidential campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. And much of the informal conversation was about the stock market, with one of the day's biggest draws being Abby Joseph Cohen, the market prognosticator from Goldman Sachs, who reassured the audience that she was still enthusiastic about the outlook for stocks in the United States.
But there were plenty of opportunities for the administration to make points on particular issues. In several instances, Mr. Clinton promoted his free-trade policies, and in particular his top goal at the moment: convincing Congress to approve a trade deal with China.
"It will lead to an opening of the society and a rise in freedom and personal choice," the president said of the trade pact, which Republican leaders intend to bring up in the House near the end of May. "We're talking about the new economy. Two years ago there were two million Internet users in China. Last year there were nine million. I think this year there will be somewhere between 20 million and 25 million."
Administration officials also took advantage of the opportunity to jab at Mr. Bush and Republicans in Congress over fiscal policy, suggesting that the big tax cuts that Republicans are proposing would undermine one of the foundations of the current prosperity, the large and growing federal budget surplus.
What administration officials refer to as Republican tax "schemes" were high on the list of what many participants said were the risks to keeping the expansion going.
When Henry J. Aaron, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a liberal- leaning research group, asked at a session attended by about 30 people how many of them would support a big tax cut, only two -- Mr. Taylor and John Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group -- raised their hands.

HEADLINE: Groups Question $1.6 Million State Grant To Company Tied to Whitman's Husband

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 5

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's husband, John Whitman, was a major shareholder and director of an Internet company that was approved for a $1.6 million grant from the state last November, according to records from the New Jersey Department of Commerce and Economic Development.
Mr. Whitman, a venture capitalist, was on the board of directors of the e-mail company Mail.com last fall when the company applied for and won a state tax incentive grant to move its offices from Manhattan to Jersey City, creating hundreds of jobs in New Jersey, according to company officials. Through Mr. Whitman's family investments and those of his firm, Sycamore Ventures, he owned about 10 percent of the company at the time of the grant application, state officials said today. 
 Although state officials said that neither Governor Whitman nor her husband were involved in the application or approval of the grant, government watchdog groups said Mr. Whitman's role in a company that received state money raised questions of a conflict of interest.
"While there's no evidence of any legal wrongdoing, this certainly gives the impression of a possible impropriety to members of the public," said Pamela Garfield of Common Cause of New Jersey. "We need to be looking at ways to strengthen the laws governing spousal business interests so that members of the public don't have to worry about whether people are given special treatment."
Governor Whitman's spokesman, Pete McDonough, insisted that Mail.com received no preferential treatment and that Mr. Whitman had not been aware that the company was seeking a state grant until after the application had been submitted.
"I would applaud John Whitman for bringing 500 high-paying, high-tech jobs to New Jersey," Mr. McDonough said. "The company took advantage of the benefits New Jersey has to offer any high-tech company and it would be to our detriment if they didn't, because those jobs would still be in New York."
Mr. Whitman joined the board of Mail.com in July 1998 and left several days after the company won the grant. By partaking in a series of stock issues and I.P.O.'s, Mr. Whitman, his investment firm and the charitable trusts he controls have bought more than two million shares in the company. Its stock closed at 12.93 today, making Mr. Whitman's shares worth at least $26 million.
Mail.com officials said their decision to seek a grant from New Jersey's Business Employment Incentive Program was made without the board's knowledge and was suggested by an outside consulting firm that was hired to compare tax incentive packages of various communities. Holly Lehr, a spokeswoman for the company, said Mr. Whitman was not involved in preparing the grant application before it was submitted. Mr. Whitman was not listed on the grant application because only those who own 15 percent or more of the company are required to be listed.
"As far as we know, he wasn't even aware of it," Ms. Lehr said.
Mr. Whitman did not return calls seeking comment. But Mr. McDonough said that once Mr. Whitman learned that the company had applied for the tax incentive, he called Gualberto Medina, the State Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development, to ask whether he should disclose his role in the company.
Mr. Medina's spokeswoman, Lisa Kruse, said he told Mr. Whitman there was no need to report his role in the company because he owned less than 15 percent.
Some Democratic elected officials said that Mr. Whitman should have reported his ownership stake in Mail.com to the state's Executive Commission on Ethical Standards before the company applied for a grant.
"If he's an investor in a company, they have a right to apply, but he should have cleared it ahead of time and he never should have had a conversation with Medina," said State Senator Richard Codey, the minority leader.
But Caren S. Franzini, executive director of New Jersey Economic Development Authority, said Mail.com's application was treated no differently than any other. The program, which gives employers as much as 80 percent of the income tax paid by its workers, awarded 62 grants worth a total of $96.8 million last year. Those tax incentives are expected to create 14,300 jobs and spur $1.1 billion in investments by companies in New Jersey, according to state officials.
Ms. Franzini said her staff discovered Mr. Whitman's involvement in Mail.com during routine research of the company's background. But Ms. Franzini said she did not to mention Mr. Whitman's ownership stake to the development agency's board members, who ultimately voted on the application. She did not do so, she said, because the company met the standards for a grant, and she thought it should be judged solely on its merits.
"We're here to treat every company equally," Ms. Franzini said. "To tell you the truth, I think that you'd be raising an ethical issue if we brought up the fact that it was the governor's husband. That would be treating him differently."
The public scrutiny of Mr. Whitman's involvement with Mail.com has rekindled another issue for the governor, the state's troubled new auto emissions inspection system. One director who sat on the Mail.com board with Mr. Whitman is also on the board of the Parsons Corporation, the contractor that unveiled a $400 million auto emissions system last December that has been plagued by computer breakdowns, equipment failures and long lines of angry motorists.
There is no evidence that either Mr. Whitman or the other board member, Jack Kuehler, played any role in the awarding of the auto emissions contract. But the mere connection between Mr. Whitman and Parsons, however tangential, has led leaders of the state workers union to call for a federal investigation of the Parsons contract. Attempts to reach Mr. Kuehler late this afternoon were unsuccessful.
"The deeper you dig, the worse it gets," said Hetty Rosenstein, executive vice president of Communications Workers of America Local 1037, which lost 300 jobs when the auto emissions inspection system was privatized. "We have hundreds of people being laid off, terrible service to the public and a lot of well-connected Republicans making a lot of money."
Mr. McDonough said that neither Mr. Whitman nor his business associates were involved in the state's handling of the auto inspection contract.
"What you're starting to get into here is the six degrees of John Whitman," Mr. McDonough said. "Jack Kuehler is the former vice chairman of I.B.M.; he's probably on a hundred different corporate boards. John Whitman has neither a formal nor an informal role in the operation of state government and had nothing to do with the Parson's contract. So this is just completely irrelevant."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Treads Softly After Market's Gyrations

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
A day after Wall Street endured one of its most unnerving rides, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, offered soothing words to investors today, saying as explicitly as he ever has that the central bank's interest rate increases are not intended to drive down stock prices.
But as he has now for months, Mr. Greenspan continued to identify the wealth being generated by rising stock prices as the primary cause of imbalances in the economy that could potentially lead to inflation. 
 Mr. Greenspan seemed intent on drawing a distinction between raising or lowering interest rates based on movements in the stock market -- a strategy he said would be ineffective and perhaps inappropriate for the Fed to attempt -- and acknowledging that Wall Street's effects on the rest of the economy are so powerful that they have to be taken into account in monetary policy.
The distinction was subtle if not meaningless to some analysts and investors. In their view, Mr. Greenspan wants to have it both ways, putting pressure on the markets without taking heat for it, and suggested that the Fed chairman did not mind sowing a bit of uncertainty to keep the markets in check even as he reassures them.
"Each time he denies that he's targeting asset prices, he highlights the fact that equity prices are central to monetary policy at the moment," said Rory Robertson, an economist at Macquarie Bank in New York. "Removing equity market strength is going to be part and parcel of removing economic imbalances, whether or not you say that you're targeting equity prices."
Speaking at a White House conference on technology and the economy, Mr. Greenspan was much clearer that he was sticking for now to his strategy of raising rates in small steps until he is sure that the economy is on an even keel. He said the central bank would not go "far wrong if we maintain a consistent, vigilant, noninflationary monetary policy."
The Fed chairman peppered his speech with admiring phrases about the ways in which information technology has reshaped the economy in recent years, calling current conditions "profoundly different" and "without precedent." And he said that the pickup over the last few years in the growth rate of productivity -- potentially the most fundamentally beneficial change of this era in economic history -- showed no signs of slowing.
But Mr. Greenspan warned that the positive developments could be put at risk if the Fed allowed inflation to infect the economy. The risk of that happening, he said, stemmed from the most basic of misalignments in the economy, between demand, which is rising sharply, and supply, which cannot keep pace.
In Mr. Greenspan's view, growth in demand is exceeding the corresponding increase in supply because it stems not from an increase in the nation's capacity to produce but from wealth created by rising prices for stocks, homes and other assets, the gyrations of the last few weeks on Wall Street notwithstanding.
"The rise in stock prices, as well as in the capital gains on homes, has created a marked increase in purchasing power without providing an equivalent and immediate expansion in the supply of goods and services," he said.
Economists, analysts and investors have taken Mr. Greenspan to mean that the most direct way to bring supply and demand into balance is to choke off the wealth effect. But today, Mr. Greenspan moved closer to the more traditional central bank view that the remedy is as simple and as complex as slowing the entire economy, halting the gradual drop in unemployment and arresting the growth in the trade deficit.
"The persuasive evidence that the wealth effect is contributing to the risk of imbalances in our economy, however, does not imply that the most straightforward way to restore balance in financial and product markets is for monetary policy to target asset price levels," Mr. Greenspan said.
"Leaving aside the deeper question of whether asset-price targeting is an appropriate government function," he continued, "there is little if any evidence that monetary policy aimed at achieving that goal would be successful."
He went on to stress that the focus of monetary policy should be the broader economy and any potential imbalances within it.
"Should changes in asset prices foster economic imbalances, as they appear to have done in recent years, it is the latter we need to address, not asset prices," he said.
Mr. Greenspan has long given off somewhat conflicting signals about the market and its influence on policy -- in part because he genuinely seems to be struggling with how the financial markets interact with the real economy, and how central banks should react to sharp moves.
His famous remark more than three years ago about "irrational exuberance" was not a statement of fact but rather a question about how policy makers should recognize when asset price swings are getting out of hand.
Yet he is well aware of the power that the Fed has to influence the markets, and over his nearly 13-year tenure at the Fed has spoken at various times during closed-door meetings of his fear that markets have entered speculative territory.
In early 1994, as the Fed embarked on a series of interest rate increases, Mr. Greenspan was at first worried about giving too big a jolt to the markets but then happy to see stock and bond prices tumble, according to recently released transcripts of Federal Open Market Committee meetings from that year.
"I think we partially broke the back of an emerging speculation in equities," Mr. Greenspan said in a telephone conference call with members of the policy committee on Feb. 28, 1994. "We also have created a degree of uncertainty. If we were looking at the emergence of speculative forces, which clearly were evident in very early stages, then I think we had a desirable effect."
In his only direct comment today on valuations in the market, Mr. Greenspan noted that securities analysts had projected that earnings growth for technology companies would be double that for the other companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
"To the extent that there is an element of prescience in these expectations, it would reinforce the notion that technology synergies are still expanding and that expectations of productivity growth are still rising," Mr. Greenspan said. "There are many who argue, of course, that it is not prescience but wishful thinking. History will judge."

 BODY:
Investors stepped back to assess damage from Tuesday's steep swings in stock prices, with the Nasdaq edging up and the Dow ending slightly down. Traders said that the United States markets have become bigger, more volatile and more uncontrollable than ever before. 
 Meanwhile, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said the central bank was not intent on driving down stock prices. But he continued to identify the wealth being generated by rising stock prices as a potential contributor to inflation.

Re "Elian Waits Inside as Tension Grows Outside" (news article, April 5): There are two Cuban dictatorships. The one in Havana dictates conduct in Cuba. The one in Miami largely dictates United States policy toward Cuba. The dictatorships are in a tug of war. A little boy is the rope. He has lost his mother. The Miami dictatorship is keeping him from his father.

HEADLINE: Gates Keeps Washington Dates;
Scheduled Sessions Rarely Touch on Microsoft Troubles

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
William H. Gates had business before all three branches of government today.
In the morning, Mr. Gates -- the founder of the Microsoft Corporation and still considered the world's richest man despite the battering his company's stock has taken lately -- met with lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol, where he expressed confidence his company would overturn a federal judge's stinging ruling this week that Microsoft had violated antitrust laws. 
 In the afternoon, at a White House conference on the new economy, he sat side by side with President Clinton, whose administration had taken him to court. He stuck to the president's agenda -- how to spread technology to the poor -- and studiously avoided any mention of the court case.
 "If you're invited to a forum on global warming, you don't talk about saving the Social Security trust fund," explained Ginny Terzano, a Microsoft spokeswoman, who used to work at the White House. "It would have been inappropriate."
 Mr. Gates also had some business between the White House and the Capitol, at Washington's federal courthouse, but it wasn't on his itinerary. Microsoft's lawyers appeared before Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who ruled against Microsoft on Monday. Judge Jackson set a May 24 hearing on sanctions against the software giant.
 Mr. Gates's visit to Washington showed the many sides of the man.
In court documents filed by the Justice Department, he is portrayed as a ruthless monopolist who built his own wealth at the expense of the marketplace. Mr. Clinton, however, invited him to the White House to highlight his philanthropic efforts through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Lawmakers, meanwhile, were aware of his growing political influence. Microsoft topped the list of computer industry contributors to political campaigns last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, with $1.2 million going almost equally to Democrats and Republicans.
 Microsoft has long preferred to focus on Washington State, where the company is based, rather than on Washington D.C. But the company has clearly come to realize the need to operate on both coasts.
Today's version of "Mr. Gates Goes to Washington" began about 9:15 a.m. In four back-to-back meetings with House and Senate Democrats and Republicans, Mr. Gates was treated neither as a victim nor a villain, but as a national treasure whose fate in the courts has yet to play out.
"He was treated like an icon of the new economy," said Representative Norman Dicks, a Washington Democrat who set up Mr. Gates's meeting with about 50 House Democrats. "People are willing to wait and see how the lawsuit plays out. The sentiment was that members would like this to settle."
Mr. Gates has plenty of detractors, of course, especially in the Silicon Valley districts that are home to Microsoft's chief competitors. But the naysayers were nowhere to be found today.
"We were very upset and disappointed by the court decision," said Representative Jennifer Dunn, a Washington Republican who arranged Mr. Gates's meeting with about 60 House Republicans. "He was encouraged by our members to hang in there and never, never give up. He said he believes he'll win on appeal."
In a wide-ranging discussion with about a dozen Senate Democrats, Mr. Gates covered subjects from education to health care to the global economy, and the roles industry and Congress play.
 Next stop was an hour with House Republicans, where Mr. Gates, after brief introductory remarks that did not touch on the court decision, forecast a technological future in which even technology-shy lawmakers would carry their daily schedules in a tablet device, and the Internet would be a staple of work and personal lives.
An hour later, before House Democrats who are trying to burnish their image with the high-technology community, Mr. Gates fielded questions about the so-called digital divide between those enjoying the wealth and advantages that flow from access to computers and the Internet versus those who may be left behind in the race to improve their lives. He also put in a plug for high-technology industries' need for more H-1B visas for software specialists and other technical workers, a measure that is now pending in both the House and Senate.
When one Democrat groused that the booming economy had bypassed his district, leaving some highly qualified engineers unemployed, Mr. Gates insisted the legislator send him their resumes.
Instead of tapping into Mr. Gates's software expertise, White House officials invited him to the conference because of his philanthropic efforts. He participated in a panel discussion on how best to bring health, education and technology to poor people the world over.
"The work he's doing around the world, we have admiration for," said a senior White House official. "As far as the company and its practices, we had a problem with that."
Mr. Gates was able to make a similar distinction. His aides say he considers the Justice Department to be the entity pushing the suit against his company, not the White House. He also keeps in mind, they said, that the federal government is one of Microsoft's largest clients.
But there was clearly a bit of angst on both sides before Mr. Gates arrived at the White House.
After the court ruling this week, John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, checked with Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, to determine whether Mr. Gates's participation in the White House was appropriate. No objection was made.
Aides to Mr. Gates also called the White House after the ruling to determine whether Mr. Gates's invitation, which was issued a month ago, was still valid. It was.
"It didn't appear to be awkward in any way," Trevor Neilson, a spokesman for the Gates Foundation, said of his boss's White House visit.
And despite Mr. Gates's dire warnings about what effect government meddling would have on his company, he sounded positive about the future, sanctions or no sanctions.
"We're at the beginning of what the computer can do to change our lives," he said at the White House. "The best is yet to come."

HEADLINE: Poaching Adds New Hurdle To Police Recruiting Efforts

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS 

 BODY:
For two years, New York City has been struggling to attract potential recruits to take the Police Department's admissions test, battling a downward trend that saw the number of applicants plummet from 31,000 in 1996 to fewer than half that number last year.
And yesterday, despite last year's $10 million recruiting campaign aimed at city residents, police officials learned that the number had dropped sharply again: only 6,000 people have expressed interest in the latest exam, forcing the city to extend the application deadline for a second time, to April 20. 
 Police officials, union leaders and critics of the department have described a list of factors that hinder local recruiting: the relatively low pay for rookies, the sizzling private-sector economy, the strained relations with minority residents and the shootings of unarmed men that have prompted public outcry.
Now add this: poaching. Even as the city struggles to lure residents -- particularly blacks and Hispanics -- to its own department, police recruiters from Los Angeles have come to New York's turf, offering promises of warmer climes, higher starting salaries and openings at the academy as soon as this summer. And they are having surprising success.
"We're probably fielding 300 or 400 phone calls a day just from people in New York City asking for information about the test," said Officer Jose A. Ferreira of the Los Angeles police, who is recruiting this week at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. "With our salaries, and with living in L.A. being what it is -- the beaches, the weather -- we're finding a lot of people who are attracted to this work."
No one claims that out-of-town recruiting has caused the steep drop in police applications in New York. But the visit by the Los Angeles recruiters, their first in nearly 20 years, is remarkable for its scale -- and its timing. Not only have they arrived as fewer people are applying to be officers in New York, but they are also competing directly for minority applicants. The Los Angeles department has run advertisements on minority radio stations, inviting all New Yorkers -- not just John Jay students -- to take the test. It is part of a national recruitment effort by the department, which seeks to add 1,000 officers, Officer Ferreira said.
In New York, 34 percent of the department's 40,000 officers are black, Hispanic or Asian. The Los Angeles Police Department, with 9,600 sworn officers, has a minority representation of 50 percent.
"I think that the possibility that Los Angeles police recruiting would be successful in New York underscores the serious problem that N.Y.P.D. has in recruiting minorities," said Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. "You can get African-Americans, Latinos and Asians interested in applying for your police department, if you send out the message that you want them to apply."
Police Commissioner Howard Safir said criticism of the department's recruiting was "made of whole cloth." He said that the department had a list of 41,000 people who passed the test during the 1990's and that he expected only 3,000 to 6,000 openings at the academy in the next two years.
The list, however, includes applicants going back to the mid-1990's, and no one can say how many people on it are still available to be hired.
The number probably includes people who have taken other jobs or have decided not to pursue the next level of testing, including a physical and a background check. And by extending the deadline yesterday, the department made it clear that it still seeks fresh talent.
Nonetheless, the issue of declining applications, Mr. Safir said, had little to do with the department's ability to fill its ranks. He said the drop in applications was a natural extension of the booming economy and what he described as negative news coverage. "Right now, based on the media attention and the way the department has been portrayed in the media," he said, "it is not surprising to me that the people are not applying in the numbers they applied in the past."
Mr. Safir also said Los Angeles was forced on the road to recruit because it could not find enough applicants in its own region. New York recruiters have not had to travel, he said, except for trips to military bases to recruit veterans.
Still, Jerome H. Skolnick, a professor at New York University School of Law who teaches a seminar in police practices, said the recent decline was reason for serious concern. "I think this is really a crisis now -- the small number of potential recruits," Professor Skolnick said. "There is the danger that you may have so few applicants that you cannot get the quality you desire."
Like police officials, Professor Skolnick said the prosperous economy had caused the decline. But he also said the cases of Abner Louima, who was tortured in a Brooklyn police station, and Amadou Diallo, who was killed by the police on the doorstep of his apartment house, have raised awareness of racial tension between the department and city residents, discouraging some applicants from even considering the test.
"Among blacks, it is likely that there is a stigma to saying, 'I am going to be a New York cop,' " Professor Skolnick said.
Patrick J. Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, agreed that the reputation of the department had suffered in recent years. But he said New York City's drop in applications, and Los Angeles's prediction of success in New York, could be attributed to a simple factor: pay. Police salaries in Los Angeles start at $41,000 each year; in New York, salaries start at $34,000.
Mr. Lynch said the gap was particularly irritating because New York's recruits are required to have completed 60 college credits or two years of military service for admission to the academy. In Los Angeles, cadets are admitted to the academy with only high school diplomas.
"I think it's fairly obvious that the New York Police Department is not paying a livable wage," Mr. Lynch said. "Our rookie officers are taking home $700 every two weeks. That's not enough to put food on the table, much less pay the rent.
"We have young officers living in the basements of their parents' homes, while I think Los Angeles is an example of a department that is paying its officers a livable wage, which allows people to follow their passions."
The Los Angeles police hope to take advantage of this gap today. At 8 a.m., at John Jay College, Officer Ferreira will reach into one of 19 sealed boxes, remove bundles of standardized tests and distribute them to rows of potential recruits.
And by Saturday evening, when the last would-be rookie has taken the test, Officer Ferreira and his six colleagues expect to have screened as many as 4,000 applicants, an accomplishment in three days that would rival New York's recruiting effort so far this year.
On the campus yesterday, students who met with the Los Angeles recruiting team had money on their minds. Ato Gordon, 22, a senior from Canarsie, Brooklyn, met with the officers near the cafeteria. He and his peers asked questions about police-community relations and the Los Angeles crime rate, but they also asked about the cost of renting an apartment. Mr. Gordon studied the salary figures on the Los Angeles department's literature.
"I could be in Beverly Hills right now driving around," he said.
Professor Skolnick also described another phenomenon. The New York department is not alone in receiving harsh criticism, he noted, even as crime has declined.
Los Angeles has been roiled by its share of police scandals during the last decade, from the beating of Rodney G. King to the decision last month to disband an antigang unit that had been at the heart of a corruption and brutality scandal.
But none of the students who were interviewed yesterday seemed to know any substantive details about recent controversies in Los Angeles. Many were in their preteen years when Mr. King was beaten by officers in 1991 and riots erupted in 1992. Professor Skolnick said that perhaps when a department recruits away from home, it enjoys a less-biased view among applicants.
"I think some of the reason for the Los Angeles police coming to New York is that they don't have the local stigma in New York," he said. "Knowing this, maybe New York ought to go to Los Angeles to recruit."

HEADLINE: The Suits Loosen Up, In an Uneasy Way;
As Dress Codes Are Rewritten, the World Of Button-Downs Puzzles Over Wardrobes

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Walking into the Four Seasons restaurant for lunch on a recent Tuesday, Jim Finn, a senior vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank, suddenly learned what it means to be in the vanguard of a trend: He was the only man there without a tie.
"I had to go boldly and confidently into the room," Mr. Finn said. "I wondered if everyone was whispering, 'Is that a guy with a dot-com and a hundred-million-dollar portfolio?' " 
 No, Mr. Finn is a point man in the newest assault on the business suit that is sweeping through the city's investment banks, consulting firms and law firms, toppling a century of dress codes and pushing some traditional tailors into uncharted waters.
Originally a concession to summer's scorching heat, Casual Friday has given way to Casual Every Day. Conventions are crumbling as old-economy companies find themselves competing for scarce labor against new-media enterprises run by people who take their fashion cues from Silicon Valley, not Saville Row.
From J. P. Morgan to Morgan Stanley to Chase Manhattan Bank and the law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, members of the professional and business elite are being encouraged to trade in their pinstripes for Polo wear and their wingtips for Weejuns. Some employers are sponsoring fashion shows, seminars and even shopping excursions.
Perhaps with good reason. Business casual, as the new standard is called, does not come easy to everyone.
Employers have made it clear that jeans, sweatshirts and T-shirts that are permitted on Saturdays and Sundays will not pass muster Monday through Friday. At the law firm Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts, the chairman, John F. Pritchard, said the dress policy could be summed up in a simple rule: "If you have to ask if the clothing is appropriate, chances are, it's not."
It seems that while many professionals have closets stocked with pleated chinos, Shetland sweaters and blazers that conform to the new standards, others do not. "Some guys only have two kinds of clothes -- suits and slob clothes," said Ann Shipley, a partner at the law firm Battle Fowler. "I've seen guys come in here on casual Fridays, and they look awful. They look like they've just cleaned out the garage."
Not surprisingly, retailers that were once perceived as a source solely of leisure wear are only too eager to guide customers through the sartorial transition, which, by most accounts, has placed more of a burden on men than women. Ever since they abandoned the power suits of the 1980's, women have been accorded more leeway in how they dress.
"People have a lot of questions," said Trudy F. Sullivan, the president of J. Crew, which offered discounts to employees of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter when that investment firm went casual last month. "They want to make sure that what they're going to buy is going to be appropriate. We're happy to help."
Seizing on the trend, Brooks Brothers is setting up mannequins in office conference rooms to illustrate different casual looks. On Tuesday, the Polo Ralph Lauren on Madison Avenue staged a fashion show, with lawyers as models, for Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, which is thought to be the first large Wall Street law firm to go all casual all the time. The fashion show demonstrated "ways to distinguish yourself in casual wear," said Scott Omelianuk, the executive editor of Esquire magazine, a sponsor of the event.
Bloomingdale's is inviting its salespeople to seminars with major designers so they can instruct customers on dressing casually and looking good at the same time. "A lot of men don't know how to do that," said Kal Ruttenstein, the store's fashion director.
About a dozen New York companies are organizing trips to Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Central Valley, N.Y., where corporate shoppers receive discount coupons. Joining the excursion arranged by his employer, Prudential Securities, on a recent Saturday Andrew Kloch, a 23-year-old investment banker, wore black cotton pants from Banana Republic. He described the pants as his "going-out clothes," a category distinct from business casual.
"I don't mind wearing suits at all," said Mr. Kloch, who owns seven of them. "It was easy just to get up and throw a suit on. Now it's a bit more of a pain because I have no business casual clothes."
As with most fashion trends, however, there is no unanimity about the wisdom of business casual.
Many professionals say that dispensing with suits has made them more comfortable and hence more productive. In a March 13 memo announcing the new dress policy, William B. Harrison Jr., the chairman of Chase, the city's largest private employer, said, "A more casual work environment mirrors the more flexible, informal organization that we need to become."
But others say they have no intention of changing lifelong habits. "I'm not going to dress casual," said Richard Beattie, the chairman of the law firm Simpson Thatcher & Bartlett. "And I don't expect I'll see Bill Harrison dressed in chinos at a meeting, either." Like other law firms, Simpson Thatcher has been slower to adopt the trend; it will allow casual dress this summer for the first time.
Mr. Beattie shops at Paul Stuart, the fashionable Madison Avenue store that is not making concessions to the current trend. "These companies are shooting themselves in the foot by letting down their standards," said Clifford Grodd, the store's president and chief executive. "There's no way we're going to do it -- not while I'm calling the shots. Everyone recognizes that we stand for something."
Nearby merchants that also cater to the carriage trade are similarly resistant. "The people in the big firms that we take care of," said John O'D. Kennedy, the executive vice president of J. Press, "they're not dressing down."
Dressing down requires the type of planning that men are not often called upon to make. Under the rules at most companies and firms, old-economy clothes are still mandatory for meetings with old-economy clients. When Mitchell Sonkin, a partner at Cadwalader, was summoned at short notice to a meeting in Philadelphia, he was relieved that he had a suit in his office to change into. "I felt like Clark Kent," he said.
Returning to his office the next day, he had to remember to replace the suit, along with a fresh shirt, tie and shoes to go with it. But he is an enthusiastic proponent of the relaxed dress code. "It has a very positive impact on morale," he said.
Whatever its virtues, business casual has complicated the lives of men who once thought they were immune to fashion gaffes.
"I find the suit easier," concedes Chase's Mr. Finn, who is in his late 30's and buys many of his suits in Paris.
Take heart, Mr. Finn. The tie may be gone forever, but there are indications that yet another change may be in the wind -- a kind of dressing up with softer lines.
"The suit," Mr. Omelianuk of Esquire explained, "is actually starting to make a comeback."

HEADLINE: Agreement Reached to Build a Downtown Sports Arena for Newark

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, April 5

 BODY:
Paving the way for one of the largest development projects here in decades, the YankeeNets and a major landowner have struck a deal for a new downtown sports arena that officials hope will spark the rejuvenation of one of the state's poorest cities.
The agreement, reached on Tuesday, removes the most serious obstacle to the project, settling a dispute over whether the arena -- a new home for the New Jersey Nets and the Devils -- will be built in the heart of downtown Newark, near the intersection of Broad and Market Streets, or 600 feet to the southeast, next to the city's public transportation hub, Pennsylvania Station. 
 In the end, the YankeeNets, which owns the two teams, succeeded in moving the arena closer to the station, easing its concerns that sports fans arriving by train would be loath to walk through the center of a city that has long been associated with urban blight. Under the new plan, those attending basketball or hockey games will be able to proceed directly from Pennsylvania Station to the arena through an elevated passageway, eliminating the need to walk on the street.
Many urban planners have criticized that plan, saying it would keep visitors bottled up near the station rather than getting them into the historic center of Newark.
As part of Tuesday's deal, Jerome Gottesman, whose company, Edison Parking, owns a critical chunk of the 40-acre redevelopment district, agreed to let the YankeeNets build its $295 million arena on part of his property across Market Street from the station. In exchange, Mr. Gottesman will be given the right to build garages and three office buildings in the arena district, a desolate landscape of parking lots and vacant buildings that officials are hoping will one day buzz with sports bars, shops, nightclubs and restaurants.
The new plan, however, eliminates a soccer stadium for the New York-New Jersey MetroStars that had been proposed in earlier plans and replaces it with a mixed-use development that includes television studios, high-tech office space and space for educational institutions.
Mayor Sharpe James, who supported the YankeeNets plan, hailed the settlement today and predicted that the 18,500-seat arena would be finished within four years.
"This undertaking will create thousands of new jobs for city residents, new opportunities for local families and tax ratables for Newark," he said. "It's a win-win situation for all parties."
The completion of the arena would be an astonishing feat for a city that not long ago was being written off. After decades of calling itself "America's Renaissance City" with few solid signs of rebirth, Newark is finally enjoying the fruits of the nation's economic boom. A performing arts center opened here three years ago to nearly unanimous praise, aging office buildings are being renovated for dot-com upstarts, and city officials have plans for a downtown arts and entertainment district.
Although the redevelopment plan, including the condemnation of about 100 homes and 50 businesses, still requires approval by the City Council and the Planning Board, Newark officials agreed that Tuesday's deal had defused a threat by the YankeeNets to build an arena somewhere else.
City officials are holding public hearings on the proposal this week, although the first session, on Tuesday night, drew scant opposition.
A group of residents initially sued the city to stop the condemnation process, but continuing negotiations between the residents and the YankeeNets have won over even the most stubborn opponents.
Hal Laessig, the leader of a group that has been fighting the project, said the developers seemed committed to rebuilding his neighborhood a few blocks to the south. "It's not what we wanted to see happen, but at this point it looks like a done deal," Mr. Laessig said. "We just hope they replace the houses, galleries and artist studios that will be destroyed."
The settlement ends 18 months of uncertainty over whether the project would ever get off the ground. It moved closer to reality last month, when the YankeeNets announced its purchase of the Devils from John J. McMullen, who had been planning to build his own stadium in Hoboken. The promise of two teams in Newark heightened the project's prospects, especially since Gov. Christine Todd Whitman had made it clear that the state would not help finance more than one sports arena.
Pete McDonough, a spokesman for the governor, said today that the state might contribute $75 million to $100 million toward a stadium project, which would be paid for through a combination of private and public financing. Mayor James has said the city would contribute to the cost of the arena as well.
Harvey Schiller, the YankeeNets chairman, said he could not provide details of the project until Newark officials had approved the redevelopment plan.
In the meantime, the MetroStars are continuing their own pursuit of an outdoor soccer stadium in Newark. The stadium, which would cost from $40 million to $60 million, was originally part of a plan for the arena district, but that plan fell apart last week, when the YankeeNets failed to reach a deal to buy half of the MetroStars from the team's owners.
Nick Sakiewicz, the team's general manager, said he was hoping to build a new stadium near the city's Ironbound section, with its large population of Portuguese and Brazilians. "We really want to be there," he said. "That's where our fans are." Like the Nets and the Devils, the MetroStars now play at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford.
Augusto Amador, who represents the Ironbound area in the City Council, said that local residents strongly supported a stadium and that he was looking for potential sites. "If we build a stadium here, they will come," he said.
Although most everyone seemed pleased that the proposed arena was moving forward, some urban planners said the decision to link it to Penn Station was a missed opportunity. James W. Hughes, dean of Rutgers University's Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, said the plan would prevent some spectators from ever treading on Newark's sidewalks.
"There are advantages to having the arena directly accessible from the station," he said. "But the downside of that is you lose the spinoff effect. Foot traffic that might otherwise help outside businesses ends up staying indoors."

HEADLINE: DIAMOND WARS: A special report.;
Africa's Gems: Warfare's Best Friend

 BODY:
The rough stone emerges from the African soil at fortresslike mines in the war zones of Angola or straight from the muck of a dammed-up river in Congo. After journeying across continents and oceans, after being graded, cut, polished and set in gold along the way, a diamond lands in a display window in Manhattan, transformed into a pricey symbol of eternal love and beckoning to brides-to-be.
The journey can take months or even years. To enforce the myth that diamonds are rare and valuable, most of the world's rough stones are hoarded in London and then carefully fed back into the world market. 
 De Beers, the South African conglomerate that controls two-thirds of the world's rough diamonds, decides how many will be sold, when, to whom and at what price.
Where they are mined responsibly, as in Botswana, South Africa or Namibia, diamonds can contribute to development and stability. But where governments are corrupt, rebels are pitiless and borders are porous, as in Angola, Congo or Sierra Leone, the glittering stones have become agents of slave labor, murder, dismemberment, mass homelessness and wholesale economic collapse.
While market manipulation guarantees the price in world markets, the portability and anonymity of diamonds -- millions of dollars' worth can be smuggled in a sock, and identifying where they came out of the ground is often impossible -- have made them the currency of choice for predators with guns in modern Africa.
"You can't wage war without money, and diamonds are money," said Willy Kingombe Idi, who buys diamonds from diggers in Congo. "People are fighting for money. Everything that happens, it's about money."
De Beers estimates that only 3 percent of global rough diamonds now come from conflict areas in Africa, according to Andrew Lamont, a company spokesman who repeatedly said it was difficult to define a conflict area.
But Christine Gordon, a London-based journalist and independent diamond expert who has been critical of De Beers, said that as recently as the mid-1990's, diamonds from African war zones accounted for 10 to 15 percent of world supply.
In any case, violent goings-on in diamond-rich Africa have done nothing, thus far, to change the consuming habits of Americans, who buy more than half the world's diamond jewelry. Sales jumped about 11 percent last year. Diamond sales are also booming around the world, with De Beers showing record sales last year of more than $5 billion.
 
Digging in the Mud
At the bottom rung of the international diamond trade, the need to scrape up enough money to eat sends Africans like Mati Balemo clawing through the mud of a Congolese stream bed. Mr. Balemo is a digger.
On a recent morning, he and six other diggers set off from Kisangani, in north-central Congo, traveling first by bicycle taxi and then on foot. Along the way, a soldier armed with a stubby machine gun demanded to come along. But he hired another bicycle taxi, which took a spill on a hill, pleasing the diggers.
They arrived after three hours at a small stream where the thick canopy of bamboo and vines made the early afternoon as dark as twilight. The diggers had been working this site for a month and had found only a few diamonds. They used shovels to dam off small sections of the stream. Then they heaped mounds of mud onto the bank. They picked out big rocks from the mud and sifted through what was left with metal screens nailed to wooden frames.
Diggers like Mr. Balemo are driven by the dream of one stone that will change their lives. For weeks or months they work bent over in shallow rivers or in pits. In three years as a digger, the biggest diamond Mr. Balemo ever found was a stone of 2.16 carats worth $800. That diamond, if it were of flawless color and clarity, could retail for as much as $10,000 in New York, experts say. Mr. Balemo split his $800 with five fellow diggers.
Miki Galedem, 30, another digger who started when he was 16, once found a monstrous stone of nine carats. He was paid $4,800. But he was young then, in 1993, and the money disappeared, he said, on "beer and women."
Standing in a pool of water stilled by mounds of mud, the diggers professed not to think much about their business -- where the diamonds go, who wears them and at what price. "Diamonds are beautiful," Mr. Balemo said. "Everyone wants to be beautiful. That is normal."
He was knee-deep in the stream, and had been sifting mud -- a brown stew with pebbles and quartz -- for an hour. Suddenly, he found a diamond. He popped it in his mouth to clean it and then showed off a shiny white stone half the size of a raisin. His friends clapped, and one digger guessed that traders back in Kisangani would pay $20 at most for the stone.
"I'm very glad," Mr. Balemo said, not smiling much, for this was the first diamond in nearly a week. "It's not much money for all that work."
The soldier with the stubby machine gun, who had been watching closely from the river bank, then came over and took the diamond. He folded it into a scrap of paper backed with gold foil and stuffed the packet into his chest pocket.
By the rules of Congo, the guy with the gun got the diamond. Even when the stones are taken from the ground using the most sophisticated equipment, the game is roughly the same.
 
Financing the Arms
In northeast Angola, the Catoca diamond mine -- one of a half dozen such sites in that Texas-sized country -- is an island of modernity in a sea of civil war. Huge earthmovers gouge out the diamond-bearing earth and feed it into a sorting plant, where water, electric vibrators and X-rays separate out about $8 million worth of diamonds a month, an amount expected to quadruple as the mine expands.
The diamonds are stored in a high-security sorting room before they are flown to Europe. As technicians grade the uncut stones, Israeli-trained security guards watch from every angle to make sure that no one slips a rock into his pocket. The mine has satellite TV and 24-hour Internet access, but the only way in or out is by air. To protect employees from attack, they are locked inside the mine's gates every night by guards with automatic weapons.
Until four years ago, the men with guns were rebel soldiers working for Unita, the Angolan rebel group led by Jonas Savimbi. Delfi Rui, a 39-year-old digger, recalled seeing rebels whip an elderly man who refused to dig. He said they had threatened to shoot those who would not give them at least half the diamonds they found.
The Angolan military took Catoca from Unita in 1996, and within two years modern mining began atop one of the planet's largest veins of diamonds. The mine now employs 1,100 Angolans and has the potential to anchor an economic revival in a part of the country where there are no other industries, no money for war reconstruction and no government services. Jobs at the mine are expected to last for at least four decades.
But the persistence of fighting in the area means that men with guns still find ways to milk the diamond business. A private security force controlled by the chief of staff of the Angolan Army, Gen. Joao de Matos, protects Catoca. About 300 armed guards, most of them former Angolan soldiers, have staked out a fortified perimeter around the mine. They charge $500,000 a month to protect the mine from Unita.
Since they were chased away from the mine, Unita soldiers have stayed in the area and terrorized the local citizenry with hit-and-run guerrilla raids. They have forced about 56,000 nearby civilians from their homes. Most are destitute. Land mines have maimed many. Without international food aid, they would starve.
Unita's behavior led the United Nations to impose a diamond embargo on the group in 1998, making it the only African rebel force subjected to such action.
For years, the United States and the white government of South Africa supported Unita, an acronym in Portuguese for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, as a counter to the Moscow-backed government in Luanda. But with the end of the cold war and of apartheid, Unita lost its military patrons. International isolation deepened when Mr. Savimbi, its leader, lost an election in Angola 1992.
Rather than accept a vote foreign observers judged free and fair, Mr. Savimbi returned to the bush and resumed war against the Angolan government. His fighters seized control of the Cuango River valley, Angola's richest diamond territory, and began a major mining operation that more than compensated for the lost cold-war aid, and made them the richest rebels in Africa.
Diamond money paid for Unita offensives that in the 1990's elevated Angola's civil war to a new plateau of savagery. Highland cities like Cuito and Huambo were all but flattened by artillery shells. More than half a million Angolans were killed. Land mines maimed about 90,000. Fighting displaced 4 million Angolans, and about 1 million continue to depend on foreign food aid. The United Nations Children's Fund now ranks Angola as the worst place on earth to be a child.
At Andulo, Unita's headquarters in the central highlands of Angola, Mr. Savimbi personally haggled with arms merchants and diamond traders who flew in from Europe. The rebel boss bargained using small bags of diamonds, each of which contained several million dollars' worth of gems, according to Robert R. Fowler, the Canadian ambassador to the United Nations and chairman of a committee that investigated violations of the embargo against Unita.
"If the price was $22 million, Savimbi would reach down for four of those bags and two of those," Mr. Fowler said. "The arms dealers had their diamond experts, and Savimbi had his, and they would inspect the diamonds to see if they really were worth $22 million. And then they haggled some more and somebody would throw in an extra bag of diamonds, and off the arms dealers flew."
Mr. Savimbi became a major buyer on the international arms scene. Giant Russian-made Il-76 cargo planes made as many as 22 deliveries a night at Andulo, said Mr. Fowler. The primary source for most of the arms was Bulgaria, the report said, although Bulgarian officials deny it.
The United Nations waited nearly six years before imposing an embargo on Unita diamonds, even though there was never any doubt what Mr. Savimbi was doing with his little bags. With an estimated $3 billion in legal diamond sales, he built Unita into a highly mobile war machine with 35,000 well-armed troops. By the early summer of last year, Unita seemed on the verge of toppling the government in Angola.
The rebels were turned back only because the government went on a $500-million weapons-buying spree of its own, financed by Western oil companies that paid the government more than $900 million for rights to new offshore oil finds.
Although Unita's diamond sales are down sharply from the mid-1990's, the United Nations report said gems continued to play a "uniquely important role" for the rebels.
There is no United Nations embargo on diamonds from Congo or Sierra Leone.
Hunger for looted diamonds is a major reason why six other countries have sent soldiers into Congo. Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe have sent troops to protect the government of Laurent Kabila, while Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda have sent soldiers to assist rebels trying to overthrow him.
Altogether, they have succeeded in shattering much of the economy of eastern Congo, transforming Kisangani, the major city of eastern Congo, into a gaudy and ghostly ruin.
The streets of Kisangani are nearly empty of cars. The textile plant is closed, and the once-thriving port on the Congo River is quiet. Apart from spotty electricity from a hydroelectric dam, there are hardly any public services left. Public salaries go unpaid. Prices have soared.
The only businesses that seem alive are those buying diamonds from diggers coming in from the dense forest that encircles Kisangani. To catch their eye, storefronts have been dressed in garish paint that shouts the names of diamond buyers like Mr. Cash, Jihad the King of Diamonds and Jehovah Ire, run by one Papa Samuel, "in connection with Jesus Christ." One store is painted with an image of Rambo, his machine gun replaced with a shovel.
Inside the diamond shops it is possible to see hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of stones. Shop owners say the diamonds are often flown out of Congo to Rwanda or Uganda, as commanders from those countries reward themselves for their revolutionary efforts.
"What do you think is the reason for this war?" asked a diamond buyer named Papa Ben, who plies his trade in Kisangani. "It's only about the riches of this country."
Only about a third of Congo's annual diamond production is being sold through the country's official market, according to diamond experts in Antwerp. They say the rest is being smuggled away for sale in bordering countries.
By far the biggest diamond prize in the Congo is more than 1,000 miles to the southwest of Kisangani, near the city of Mbuji Mayi. Diamond experts say President Kabila has allocated a substantial percentage of that huge diamond complex to Zimbabwe, which has sent 11,000 troops to prop up Mr. Kabila's wobbly government.
So Zimbabwe has recently become a major diamond exporter, although it has a negligible local industry.
With their eyes on the prize at Mbuji Mayi, large numbers of Congolese rebels and supporting troops from Rwanda began massing about a year ago to the north and east of the city. If they take the diamond mines there, many military experts believe, Zimbabwe would lose its will to fight and Mr. Kabila's government would probably fall.
 
Allying With Smugglers
In Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, the surgeons were frantic. Scores of men, women and children, their hands partly chopped off by machetes, had flooded the main hospital. Amputating as quickly as they could, doctors tossed severed hands into a communal bucket.
The Revolutionary United Front, a rebel outfit that barters diamonds for weapons, was trying early last year to conquer Freetown. Chopping off limbs was their trademark strategy, as it greatly simplified conquest in the diamond fields of eastern Sierra Leone. When word got out that rebels were moving in, tens of thousands of terrified people would take off. The rebels chased half the country's population of 4.5 million out of their homes in the 1990's. Half a million people fled the country.
One day during last year's carnage in Freetown, a diamond trader approached a reporter at the Cape Sierra Hotel. He stuck out his tongue and from beneath it plucked out a stone, which he offered to sell. When the sale did not happen, the trader popped the diamond back in his mouth and moved on.
In fact, most of Sierra Leone's diamonds were -- and still are -- smuggled into neighboring Liberia for sale, according to several human rights groups and diamond industry experts.
The leader of the Sierra Leone rebels, Foday Sankoh, has established a lucrative partnership with his longtime Liberian friend, Charles Taylor, the rebel-boss-turned-president. Both had training in Libya, both their rebellions began in the late 1980's, and their armies have helped each other fight.
Mr. Sankoh's access to the world's diamond bourses and to arms was secured when Mr. Taylor was elected president of Liberia in 1997. The Liberian government denies this trade, as does Mr. Sankoh.
But a number of diplomats, international relief officials and mining experts say there is persuasive evidence. Liberia was a marginal exporter of diamonds until the mid-1990's. Since then it has it exported some 31 million carats -- more than 200 years' worth of its own national capacity, according to trading records in Antwerp.
After Mr. Sankoh failed to take Freetown last year, he signed a peace deal granting his rebels amnesty for war crimes. The deal, which was brokered by the United Nations, also gave him a government job -- chairman of the Strategic Minerals Commission, which controls diamond mining.
 
Making Diamonds Work
Diamonds need not lead to horror. Botswana, the world's largest diamond producer, is one of the most stable and prosperous countries in Africa. The diamond industry there employs nearly a fourth of the country's 1.5 million people and accounts for two-thirds of government income.
De Beers and the government control the industry in a 50-50 partnership, but there is far more to the country's success than corporate paternalism. For starters, the borders of Botswana, unlike the borders of so many countries in Africa, make sense. Inside the borders, there is ethnic and linguistic unity. There is also a long history of democratic decision-making.
Traditional chiefs rarely take action without first consulting ordinary villagers, who are invited to speak freely. It also helped that Botswana gained independence peacefully. The country was so poor that the British decided it was not worth fighting for, so it was never inundated with guns or soldiers.
When De Beers discovered diamonds in Botswana in 1969, the government had been independent for three years, and the men running it were traditional chiefs who owned cattle. They came from a desert culture where people have to scrimp and save to survive the long, dry season.
During three decades, Botswana's leaders have carefully guided what became the world's fastest-growing economy. They invested in roads, schools and clinics. In stark contrast to the rulers of Angola and Congo, they created an African nation devoted to improving the lives of its people. In 1965, only about half of primary school-aged children attended school. Today, 90 percent of that group is enrolled. Life expectancy, which was less than 50 at independence, is now near 70.
Phones work in Botswana, potholes get repaired, garbage gets picked up, and a lively press pokes fun at the government without fear. At $3,600 per year, the gross national product per capita is seven times higher than the average for sub-Saharan Africa. The standard of living is higher than in South Africa, Turkey or Thailand.
"Diamonds are not devils," said Terry Lynn Karl, professor of political science at Stanford and author of "The Paradox of Plenty," (University of California Press, 1997), a book about the poisonous mix of natural resources, big money and thieving elites in developing countries. "What matters is that there be a tradition of good government and compromise in place prior to the exploitation of these resources."
 
Exploiting a Continent
The miseries of modern Africa are, in many ways, a legacy of its history.
In the case of both Angola and Congo, colonialism obliterated whatever political culture may have predated the arrival of Europeans. It invented huge, largely fictive nations -- Angola is the size of Texas, Congo of the United States east of the Mississippi -- roping together people who regarded one other as foreigners. To make their nation-building pay, colonialists used force to haul off everything from ivory to rubber to human beings.
In Congo, the Belgian colonial state was famously greedy and cruel. Its agents set impossible quotas for production of rubber and ivory, killing or chopping off the hands of villagers who failed to meet them. The novelist Joseph Conrad called it "the vilest scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human conscience."
In Angola, the Portuguese were less brutal, but no less toxic. At independence in 1975, several hundred thousand Portuguese residents, virtually the entire educated population, abandoned the country. Some took even their doorknobs with them. They left behind a place where almost no Angolans had any training in statecraft, business or agriculture.
Then for the better part of the last 50 years, the cold war and the white-minority governments of southern Africa injected cash and arms into regional wars.
The Central Intelligence Agency, for instance, supported Unita in the early 1970's and again in the late 1980's. The Marxist government of Angola received military assistance from the Soviet Union and up to 50,000 troops from Cuba. When the C.I.A. was not helping Unita, the rebels got military backup from white-ruled South Africa.
Sierra Leone, a small country in West Africa, had a more benign colonial history under British rule. But since the 1940's, predators who smuggle diamonds have warped every aspect of the nation's economic and political life.
The meddling of colonialists, superpowers and white governments all but stopped at the beginning of the 1990's, leaving diamonds, oil and other natural resources as the primary forage for rebels and governments alike.
In those countries where there was nothing to trade for weapons -- as in Mozambique, where post-apartheid South Africa stopped financing rebellion and post-Communist Eastern Europe stopped financing the government -- war simply fizzled out.
But Angola, Congo and Sierra Leone had plenty of diamonds left over to excite greed, fuel war and to buy favors. The United Nations report on the embargo against Unita described how Mr. Savimbi gave a "passport sized" packet of diamonds to the president of Togo, Gnassingbe Eyadema, as payment for allowing his children to live in Togo and go to school there. Togo has denied it.
Mr. Savimbi "sealed" his friendship with the president of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore, by giving him a number of envelopes full of diamonds, as well as contributing to his political campaign and helping his government pay debts, according to the report. In return, it said, Burkina Faso sent Mr. Savimbi three flights of diesel fuel. The government of Burkina Faso denies that.
"Oh, the diamonds, diamonds, diamonds," said a character in Graham Greene's "The Heart of the Matter," a 1948 novel set in Sierra Leone. "You cannot understand how many bribes are necessary."
 
Manipulating Scarcity
De Beers created its cartel 110 years ago when the company's founder, Cecil Rhodes, realized that the sheer abundance of diamonds in southern Africa would make them virtually worthless. By carefully manipulating scarcity, De Beers prospered as perhaps the most powerful cartel in the annals of modern commerce.
In the process, however, De Beers has run afoul of antitrust laws in the United States. The company's senior executives dare not enter this country because of an outstanding antitrust indictment that charges De Beers with fixing the prices of industrial diamonds.
The company's grip on the diamond market has slipped a bit from near-total dominance at mid-century, but it has continued to keep the price of gem-quality diamonds high by being both aggressive and flexible. Through the years, it has sponged up periodic floods of diamonds from Russia, Australia and, until recently, across parts of war-ravaged Africa where it does not own all the mines.
Together with the artificial perception of rarity, what makes diamonds profitable to more than 2.5 million miners, traders, cutters and wholesalers around the world -- and what energizes the $50-billion-a-year retail diamond jewelry industry -- is romance.
That, for the most part, is also an invention of De Beers. In 1938, De Beers hired a New York advertising company to convince millions of couples that the larger the diamond on an engagement ring, the greater their love. In the 1960's, a similar campaign in Japan created a diamond engagement ring "tradition."
Diamonds spilling out of Angola's war zone have had a destabilizing effect on the cartel, first by increasing the supply of gem-quality stones and then by tarring the reputation of De Beers as a company that trafficked in blood-stained goods.
To maintain world prices, De Beers bought up a sizable amount of what Unita was selling -- although the company insists that it bought the diamonds on the open market without any direct dealings with the rebels, and that it stopped all buying when the embargo was imposed in 1998.
Global Witness, a London-based human rights group, embarrassed De Beers in October of 1998 with a report that showed -- citing the company's own annual reports -- how the cartel had pumped large amounts of money into the coffers of the rebels as the war escalated.
A year later, De Beers took decisive action. The company declared last October that it would not buy any diamonds that originate in Angola, except from one government-controlled mine.
Some diamond experts said De Beers' announcement, while laudable, came late -- after Unita, having exhausted the easy pickings in Angola's alluvial mines and having lost considerable territory to Angolan government forces, could no longer roil the world market with high-quality stones.
De Beers moved again last month to sanitize the image of the diamonds it sells. As of March 26, the company says it can guarantee that none of its diamonds originate with African rebels, but come instead from its own mines in South African, Botswana or Namibia, or are bought from mines in Russia or Australia.
Human rights organizations have welcomed De Beers' moves and praise the company for taking steps they say the entire diamond industry should follow. Rebel-mined diamonds, though, can still find their way out of Africa. About a third of diamonds imported into the United States are purchased from traders who are not employed by De Beers and are not bound by its new rules.
 
Tracing the Stones
Near Antwerp's train station, police barricades seal off three narrow streets. In warren-like rooms above the streets, men hunch over precision turntables, grinding rough diamonds to coax forth shapes and colors that lure wholesaler jewelers to Belgium from around the globe.
Eight out of 10 of the world's rough diamonds -- about 125 million carats a year -- pass through Antwerp's Diamond Center. But exactly which of those stones come from war zones in Africa is something Antwerp's experts say they find hard to tell.
Michael Vaughan, managing director of the Diamantkring, one of the four exchanges in Antwerp, said that his business depended on trust, and that if diamonds have been smuggled by African rebels and re-packaged elsewhere, "we don't know about it."
Many diamond traders in Antwerp do not particularly want to know where the stones come from. A recent United Nations report complained of "extremely lax regulations" at the world's largest diamond bourse in Antwerp. A Canadian human rights group, Partnership Africa Canada, calls Antwerp "a diamond smuggler's dream."
Belgium has objected, saying the report ignores major moves in January to set up tougher customs inspections and a new certification system with Angola.
But it is not just Belgium. According to the United Nations report, Antwerp is flooded with diamonds exported from countries passing off smuggled diamonds as their own, complete with false, but official, certificates of origin. The experts say those countries include Liberia, Uganda, Rwanda and Zimbabwe.
One way to keep rebel-mined diamonds off the world market would be to impose a diamond embargo on African countries known to be exporting smuggled stones. Thus far, though, there is little enthusiasm in the United Nations for such a move. "It is tough enough in Angola, believe me," Mr. Fowler said.
Human rights groups and some members of Congress are also calling for a mandatory diamond-labeling system. One proposal calls for a worldwide ban on sales unless diamonds have verifiable documents proving country of origin. A bill introduced in Congress last year would require similar documentation for diamonds sold in the United States.
Representative Tony P. Hall, an Ohio Democrat, and Representative Frank R. Wolf, a Virginia Republican, introduced the bill after seeing the horrors of war in Sierra Leone. "The world looked the other way in Angola for most of the 1990's, while revenues from diamond sales were used to butcher innocent civilians," he said. "We should not stand by as the same thing happens in Sierra Leone and Congo. We should do whatever it takes to cut off the flow of money."
The diamond industry in the United States objects to the proposals.
"There is no way to tell where a diamond comes from," said Eli Haas, president of the Diamond Dealers Club of New York. "Diamonds don't have identifying marks and probably never will. You just can't look at a diamond and say, yes, it comes from Sierra Leone."
That may be changing. De Beers says that it is "actively pursuing" a diamond fingerprinting technology being developed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at a forensic laboratory in Ottawa.

A Ford Vice President Has a European Touch

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich.

 BODY:
FORD'S old advertising slogan may need some updating, to wit: Have you driven a Parry-Jones lately?
You have if you've been at the wheel of the Ford Focus or the Lincoln LS in North America or the Ford Puma or Ka in Europe.
 These cars bear the stamp of a single engineer -- Richard Parry-Jones, the Ford Motor Company's group vice president in charge of product development and quality -- as few modern models do. Nowadays, vehicle-development decisions are generally made in committee and executed by teams. 
 Mr. Parry-Jones's involvement goes far deeper, and he may come to be identified with particular models in the way that Lee A. Iacocca is known as the father of the Mustang; as Harley Earl, the legendary General Motors designer, is associated with the flamboyant, big-finned 1959 Cadillac; and as John Z. DeLorean gained fame for creating the Pontiac GTO.
Mr. Parry-Jones is Ford's guru of driving dynamics -- generally considered the way a car feels on the road, plus the feedback it sends back to the driver. While not as eye-catching as tailfins, his signature touch is immediately evident upon taking the driver's seat. Mr. Parry-Jones, a 49-year-old Welshman, has made it his mission to develop a distinctive trademark for the driving experience of each Ford, from the tiny Ka city car to elegant Jaguars -- and now, even to rugged yet luxurious off-road vehicles from Land Rover, which Ford has agreed to buy.
"The refined driving experience is not the thing in the showroom that's going to get people to buy the car," Mr. Parry-Jones said as he steered a 2000-model Focus around the company's test track in Dearborn. "But it's the thing that the customer will discover on the test drive or after the purchase that confirms the purchase decision. It's what bonds the driver to the car after they buy it."
Mr. Parry-Jones oversees Ford's three global vehicle-development centers: the large and luxury car group, which includes Aston Martin, Jaguar, Lincoln and Volvo automobiles; the truck group; and the small and medium group. Mr. Parry-Jones headed the small and medium group, based in England, before he was promoted to his current position in January 1998. That group helped develop the tiny Ka and the Puma, a small, sporty car with racecar-quick steering, for Europe, and the Ford Focus for international markets, including the United States.
 When Mr. Parry-Jones arrived for his new job at Ford's world headquarters here, he immediately jumped into the product development program for the S-Type, a new, smaller Jaguar, and the LS, a midsize sedan that was intended to be Lincoln's first true competitor against Germany's BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
Mr. Parry-Jones, dissatisfied with the driving dynamics of the two cars, sent engineers back to work for fine-tuning that ultimately delayed the introduction of the LS slightly.
"The lessons we learned in Europe with small cars helped me bring those vehicles into sharper focus," Mr. Parry-Jones said.
The LS went on sale last spring and received rave reviews, with particular note of its European driving characteristics -- a marked contrast to the soft and floaty Lincolns of recent years. It received a number of automotive awards, including Motor Trend's 2000 Car of the Year. It has sold briskly, as has the Jaguar S-Type, with which it shares its underbody, its engines and many other mechanical components.
Even more surprising to many automotive enthusiasts, however, has been the performance of the much smaller and far less expensive Ford Focus, which starts at $12,280. In a market segment where manufacturers have historically treated their small cars as appliances, providing bare-bones transportation from Point A to Point B, the Focus stands alone in offering responsive handling and steering that rivals that of many larger, pricier cars.
Automotive journalists have voted the Focus car of the year for both Europe and North America. And, most recently, it won a similar recognition in Canada, making it the first car ever to win that triple crown. Buyers seem to agree: Sales of the Focus are soaring.
"A car's got to feel alive, responsive, quick to react to your desires and inputs," said Mr. Parry-Jones. "These qualities do not just appeal to enthusiasts. They make driving more fun for everyone."
Mr. Parry-Jones contends that a refined driving experience also improves the vehicle's ride comfort, stability and safety. But that doesn't mean every Ford will feel the same.
Instead, the driving dynamics of each car or truck must fit with the character of the brand. A Jaguar is tuned to deliver a velvety ride, silky-smooth power and steady steering, whereas the tiny race-car like Puma "changes direction at the blink of an eye."
Creating that driving experience is a blend of art and science, he explained as he wheeled the Focus around the test track, first at about 25 miles per hour, a speed at which he says he can read everything about the car, then gradually accelerating.
Mr. Parry-Jones spends a large chunk of his time behind the wheel; he logs about 30,000 miles a year evaluating vehicles in the United States, Europe and Japan. A former rally driver, he attended his first race at age 10 and honed his driving skills thrashing a Mini 850 on the roads of his homeland, before joining Ford as an apprentice at age 18. The legendary race car driver Jackie Stewart, who is a consultant for Ford, has been Mr. Parry-Jones's most important mentor.
"My rallying days really gave me an intuitive sense as to how a vehicle performs," said Mr. Parry-Jones. "Rallying teaches you how a car responds when you turn the wheel and how it responds when you push the accelerator."
Before he slides behind the wheel, however, Mr. Parry-Jones pores over piles of statistical information that shows how each car and truck under development is meeting its targets for driving performance, targets that are as stringent for a Jaguar as they are for a Focus, but specific to the brand the vehicle represents.
Then he hops into the car and takes a spin around the test track to see if the scientific data match what he feels. His goal is to build a library of knowledge that can be passed on from one generation of engineers and vehicles to the next.
"Imagine if you could deliver a vehicle that is reliable and refined but also is fun to drive and has a soul," he said. "What's wrong with that?"

Buttressing an Old City With New Artistic Girders

BYLINE: By PAULA DEITZ 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
Like the fantasy pleasure dome of Xanadu, the term movie palace conjures up a magical image: a romantic time when the film world was bursting with technological advances, complemented by live entertainment. In downtown Pittsburgh alone, there were once eight such extravaganzas within a few blocks' radius, and in their heyday, the 1920's and 30's, people flocked to the cinema and to vaudeville acts in an atmosphere that dripped with gilded plaster and crystal chandeliers.
Fast forward 30 years. Pittsburgh was in a financial slump. But the Pittsburgh Symphony, thriving nonetheless, required a new home beyond the Syria Mosque. Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill was hired to design a new home, but, to the city's eventual good fortune, the effort stalled. Then in 1967 Henry John Heinz II, who had recently retired as chairman of the H. J. Heinz Company, made a momentous visit to the once-lavish Loews Penn Theater, accompanied by the president of the symphony. With a grant from the Howard Heinz Endowment, the symphony bought the property and the rest is legend: Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts opened in 1971, with its plush three-story-high domed lobby and an arcade of Corinthian columns with gilded capitals. 
 This became the turning point and the gold standard for an imaginative urban renaissance based on Heinz's theory that the arts lead the way to economic development. Rather than destroying an old neighborhood to build a congested performing arts center, Pittsburgh opted to create a performing arts district: many of its cultural institutions are housed in the restored regal surroundings of its surviving movie palaces, scattered through a 14-square-block area that had been a red-light district. It is now called the Pittsburgh Cultural District and is overseen by the 16-year-old Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.
On a recent rain-slicked Saturday night at curtain time, the streets were bustling with theatergoers coming from parking lots dispersed sensibly through the area or from neighborhood restaurants. The thrill is enhanced by the great marquee of the Benedum Center for the Performing Arts, the former Stanley Theater, where the chaser lights are miraculously intact.
On a side facade of the center, flashing lights still announce "Stanley's Photoplays." Inside, the immense barrel-vaulted lobby and performance hall have been restored to their original palette of Etruscan colors, with decorative plasterwork burnished with aluminum-foil gilt. Relighted with chandeliers, the entire space glows with a festive air that inspires the audience to dress up for the occasion, on this evening a performance of Massenet's opera "Werther" by the Pittsburgh Opera under the artistic direction of Tito Capobianco.
The cultural district here, which includes new public squares and parkland on the Allegheny River, reflects a general mood in Pittsburgh. As the largest inland port in America (the Delta Queen calls about twice a year), it is a true early gateway to the West. At the majestic confluence of the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio Rivers, the city encompasses 40 miles of riverfront and more than 2,000 bridges, representing almost every style of engineering.
While this city boasts old, established cultural institutions like the Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History and obligatory skyscrapers like the 1984 neo-Gothic spires in reflective glass for PPG Place by Philip Johnson and John Burgee, there is a new vivacity that accompanies the emerging biomedical and computer science industries spurred by the research units of its major universities.
 
New Life for Old Buildings
One could say that Pittsburgh's fighting spirit in the face of its loss of the steel industry comes from its namesake, William Pitt, who as prime minister of Britain in the 1750's gave the colonists the wherewithal to do proper battle against the French. After his forces captured Fort Duquesne in 1758, one of Gen. John Forbes's last acts was to name their conquest after Pitt, whose spirit had made them, he said, "masters of the place." This story is inscribed on a plaque outside H. H. Richardson's celebrated Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail, two massive turreted piles of rusticated stone linked across a city street by a Bridge of Sighs providing secure passage for prisoners.
Though Pittsburgh's steel industry died, none of its other important elements did; the city survived, unlike others caught up in a similar economic downturn. To prove it, three department stores still do a thriving business downtown. But there is a lot of vacant real estate, and the trick has been to renovate and incorporate the empty structures there into the texture of urban life in a "practical, affordable, useful and beautiful" way, said Teresa Heinz, who has carried on the family's philanthropic interests since the death of her husband Senator John Heinz III.
The cultural trust's consortium, for example, includes two other theaters in addition to Heinz Hall and the Benedum, with at least 1,200 events a year taking place in the district. The opera shares the Benedum with the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, the Civic Light Opera, visiting dance companies and touring Broadway shows. Now in its 61st season, the opera company has been staging four operas a year. Next year, a fifth, "Therese Raquin," by the American composer Tobias Picker and commissioned in a joint production with the Dallas and Montreal Operas, will be staged at the nearby 1,329-seat Byham Theater, a renovated vaudeville hall the size of smaller European opera houses.
For a site down the street from the Benedum, on the footprint of a vaudeville house demolished after sustaining damage in a 1936 flood, the cultural trust commissioned Michael Graves to design the only new theater in the district. The O'Reilly Theater, now the home of the Pittsburgh Public Theater, has all the charm of Mr. Graves's own drawings of squat classical stone pavilions in rustic landscapes.
 
A Bright Night Life
There is also a whiff of Alvar Aalto in the side view of red brick and blue tile walls. The theater's porous semicircular glass facade is an inviting presence on the streetscape, making it an easy stop for buying tickets. At night the second-level foyer, capped by a barrel-vaulted roof, offers lively views of theater crowds. Behind the foyer's long bar hangs one of Mr. Graves's murals of pavilions in the Italian countryside. Playing at the O'Reilly on a recent weekend was Conor McPherson's peripatetic play "The Weir," with some Irish cast members who lent authenticity to the mystery. The O'Reilly's thrust stage, though close to the audience, is always an island of space unto itself, thus maintaining the theatrical illusion.
The show does not stop in Pittsburgh when the performances end, as a walk in the neighborhood proves. At the central intersection of Penn Avenue and Seventh Street, two squares face each other with public sculptures that exert an especially powerful force after dark. In a fresh interpretation of the civic fountain, the artist Louise Bourgeois fashioned for the Agnes R. Katz Plaza a 25-foot-high spiral mountain of bronze with water rushing down its troughs, which are illuminated fiber-optically with a bluish light.
Seen against the lights of Pittsburgh's skyline, this glowing mound has become a strong nocturnal image, particularly in its park setting of clipped linden trees designed by Dan Kiley. By collaborating, the sculptor and landscape architect have produced a winning urban plaza.
Across the street, the Russian artist Aleksandr Brodsky constructed a different sort of mound, a vast pyramid of Beaux-Arts terra-cotta ornaments from buildings that had been demolished in the district. Long buried in a ditch, the pieces were retrieved and inventoried before the artist carefully piled the cornices, columns and rosettes into a kind of memorial to vanished architecture. "Palazzo Nudo" he calls it.
Set behind a chain-link fence and a cage of metal scaffolding with hanging industrial lights, this elegant scrap pile glistens with new life on a rainy night. While many buildings were destroyed, the streets are now lined with others that were once marred by false fronts but now reveal their original facades intact.
Night lighting is a major ingredient in animating the cultural district and is the basis of another ingenious collaboration, this one between the artist-designer Robert Wilson and the architect Richard Gluckman. In addition to the main avenues and cross streets, the district is filled with back alleys and blank walls next to empty lots where buildings once stood. Lightwalls for beauty and safety were the answer rather than ugly, income-producing billboards.
"Light will be an object and light will be space" and "light will be static and light will be dynamic" are how the team describes a phenomenon that it expects will enliven the neighborhood and in time, no doubt, cities everywhere. While reviving the movie palaces builds on the past, the lightwalls will be one of the trust's contributions to the future.
The first one has been installed on a wall next to a parking lot near the Benedum: an eerie wash of pale light with a horizontal band of the faintest mauve moving slowly down the side of the building. It transforms a drab wall into a theater set.
True to form, people are beginning to move into this loft district (along with one dry cleaner and a florist), and its seven art galleries are a draw during the day, as are the exhibitions at the trust's own Wood Street Galleries. And the adjoining neighborhood, called the Strip and home to Pittsburgh's wholesale food markets, is a lively mecca of shops and restaurants, particularly on Saturday mornings.
Embracing the Rivers
As part of its city planning, the cultural trust has also taken the lead in opening up the adjacent riverfront area: Pittsburgh, like many major river cities, had turned its back on its greatest resource. A 1911 Olmsted Brothers' concept for a narrow collar of parks along the Allegheny and Monongahela that joined where the two met the Ohio at Point State Park had lain dormant until it served as inspiration to another team commissioned by the trust, this time to design Allegheny Riverfront Park at the edge of the cultural district.
A match was made between the landscape artist Michael Van Valkenburgh and the artist Ann Hamilton, who represented the United States last year at the Venice Biennale. A 4,000-foot-long, 35-foot-wide esplanade runs under the three Sister Bridges; it is approached from the street by long ramps with an undulating bronze handrail that connotes thin tree trunks with the smoothness of an arm. High vine screens for Virginia creeper create a vertical wall from the street above, where a second phase of the park will eventually be planted with plane trees.
To border the promenade below Mr. Van Valkenburgh has planted a crush of native flood plain trees and rugged plants, expecting that they will not all survive the periodic flooding and winter ice floes, and interspersed among them boulders collected from the area that give the plantings a Japanese quality and also serve as convenient seating.
When the cement was poured for the walkway along the water, Ms. Hamilton devised a method to lay dry reeds into the wet cement so that the promenade has a bulrush pattern that looks like a fossil from the original shoreline. The rough surface favors walkers over in-line skaters and skateboarders.
Across the Allegheny on Pittsburgh's North Side, art is also acatalyst for redevelopment, as is already well known from the museum dedicated to Pittsburgh's native son Andy Warhol. The story of the sculptor Barbara Luderowski and the founding of the Mattress Factory in 1977 as a museum of installation art on Sampsonia Way is another example of the city's cultural draw.
When Ms. Luderowski stopped in Pittsburgh in the early 1970's, on the way to show her work in New York, she was driven around the narrow streets of town houses on the North Side and fell in love with the neighborhood. She never got to New York. Instead she returned to Michigan, sold her house there and moved to Pittsburgh, where she eventually purchased the old mattress factory that is an ideal architectural framework for conveying the imaginary worlds of installation art. Later she bought a house and a storefront on adjoining streets to expand the museum.
A Community of Artists
The title of the current exhibition, "Installations by Asian Artists in Residence," also explains the museum's method, devised by Ms. Luderowski as the artistic director and by the curator, Michael Olijnyk. The artists live at the Mattress Factory as a community while they build their art.
In constructing his phantom house of cast paraffin wax that fills an entire gallery, the Japanese artist Goro Hirata based his design on a traditional Japanese house with shoji screens. Because the material is translucent, natural light from the windows glows through the walls and shifts during the day. Sora Kim, from Seoul, South Korea, filled another gallery with a product called D-Gravitzer, along with its marketing campaign that proves how being relieved of gravity allows the user to clean ceilings and difficult corners.
Two of James Turrell's disquieting room installations dealing with the perception of light are among the permanent exhibits, as is Jene Highstein's "Bed-Sitting Rooms for Artist in Residence," in which two beds slide back and forth between slots in the wall, depending on the number of occupants in a room.
Even the garden, designed by Winifred Lutz, is installation art. In a brilliant stroke, she created an archaeological site by excavating the basement of a burned-out factory next door, uncovering several levels reached by steps with twisted iron handrails. Planted with grasses and wildflowers, it could be a site from ancient Rome.

Treasuries Drop in Price As Equities Draw Money

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices declined yesterday as some investors took advantage of rebounding stocks to shift back out of the fixed-income market. 
 The price of the 30-year bond declined 3/32, to 106 19/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 5.79 percent from 5.78 percent on Wednesday. The two-year note, which has experienced a plunge in yield recently as investors moved away from volatile stocks, fell 5/32 in price, to 100 7/32. Its yield rose to 6.38 percent from 6.30 percent, still giving the highest return among various Treasuries.
William McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, said in a speech to the New York State Banker's Association that inflation was all but dormant in the face of strong economic growth but that the very prosperity that growth generates could expose the economy to risks. Traders said his comments had little effect ahead of the important employment report due today.
The nonfarm payroll data for March is expected to confirm that the the labor market is very tight, possibly reignitinge investor fears that the Fed could become more aggressive in raising short-term rates to keep inflation under control.
Economists polled by Reuters are forecasting that payrolls grew 376,000 and that hourly earnings increased 0.3 percent. The tightness in the labor market is likely to be underscored by a decline in the unemployment rate to 4 percent, from 4.1 percent in February.
Rick MacDonald, an economist with Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, thinks the focus will be on wages and unemployment because the payroll number will probably have two distortions for March: a lift from hiring for government census workers and an extra week because of the leap year. So the data for five weeks is condensed into a month normally reporting four weeks.

Advances in Biotechnology And Retail Sales Spur Rally

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, buoyed in part by news that March store sales at some major retailers were on the high end of expectations.
The rally was also fueled by a jump in biotechnology stocks after the Celera Genomics Group said it completed sequencing the genes of one person. 
 Additionally, investor confidence was upbeat after Alcoa, the aluminum producer, posted earnings that beat Wall Street's estimates.
"For the first time in a week we have solid bids in the market in the growth sectors," said Barry Hyman of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 80.35 points, or 0.73 percent, to 11,114.27, while the Nasdaq composite index jumped 98.34 points, or 2.36 percent, to 4,267.56. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.97 points, to 1,501.34.
Wal-Mart Stores said sales in stores opened at least a year rose 3.6 percent in March, surpassing analysts' expectations. Its shares gained 2 3/4, to 61 1/8, while those of Home Depot added 3 3/16, to 66 1/4.
Alcoa, whose first-quarter earnings of 95 cents a share beat consensus estimates by 4 cents, gained 1 3/4, to 70 15/16.
The Nasdaq biotechnology index, which includes over 200 United States and European companies, rose 4.89 percent after Celera's announcement of its advance, which could eventually transform medicine and biology. Celera rose 27, to 140.
The next step for Celera is to assemble the sequenced fragments into their proper order to create a genetic map, the basic blueprint of life. With this map, scientists can learn more about genes involved in disease, how medicines work and the workings of basic human biology.
The gain for the biotech index comes on top of a 6.31 percent rise on Wednesday after President Clinton reassured the industry that gene discoveries could be patented.
Other advancing biotechnology stocks included Millennium Pharmaceuticals, which was up 30 17/64, to 173 5/8, and Incyte Pharmaceuticals, up 13 7/8, to 108 1/2.
During the day, the market's gains were pared as investors turned their focus to the United States employment data due out today, which could give hints of the extent of future interest rate increases.
"We're just running out of gas, and with the uncertainty ahead of tomorrow's numbers, I think people are just evening out their blotters and taking home some profits," said Bryan Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential Securities.
The government will release March jobs data today at 8:30 a.m. Economists in a Reuters survey estimated payrolls rose by 376,000 in March after a softer-than-expected 43,000 in February.
But investors were generally encouraged by the market's early glimpse of first-quarter earnings, analysts said.
"As we get further into earnings, we'll see the fundamentals remain powerful and that will calm unsettled investor nerves," said Thomas Galvin of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reduces Forecast For Gasoline Prices

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: DALLAS, April 6

 BODY:
The Energy Department said today that gasoline would cost a good deal less this summer than what had been forecast just a month ago, though the typical household was still expected to spend $170 more to fuel up the family car than last summer.
Prices should peak this month at $1.52 a gallon for regular unleaded gasoline, roughly what it averaged in March, before falling to $1.39 by September. The average for the summer should be $1.46, according to the Energy Information Administration, the statistical agency for the department. 
 That may offer little relief to drivers, who can still expect to pay about 25 percent more this summer than last year. But the outlook is far better than last month's, when forecasters predicted average prices of $1.56 for the summer, with peak months reaching $1.80.
The new forecast, though, carries an important caveat; the agency said that to meet the projection, the nation's refineries would have to operate at close to capacity.
Any major disruptions, which might include hurricanes, explosions and extended maintenance shutdowns, could cause prices to spike above the new predictions. The agency noted that refinery problems early last year in California contributed to a spring jump in gasoline prices there at a time when oil prices were far lower than they are now.
The agency also predicted that the price of imported crude oil delivered to domestic refiners, which averaged $26.75 a barrel in February and March, would drop to $23.50 by the end of this year, and to $21.50 by the end of 2001.
The lowered forecast may take some steam out of efforts in Congress to suspend 4.3 cents of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon federal gasoline tax. That proposal, by Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, has not come to a vote. But in a nonbinding resolution today, senators signaled in a 66-to-34 vote that they lean against lowering the tax.
The government's sharply revised forecast was attributable to the decision last week by OPEC member nations to raise their oil output, said Dave Costello, an economist at the agency, and to the market's surprisingly strong reaction to the increase.
The cartel's production increase "wasn't that much different from what we had kind of been assuming," Mr. Costello said. But crude prices fell by perhaps $1 a barrel more than what had been anticipated.
The new forecast "doesn't mean that all concerns are out the window or anything like that," he said. "It means the situation has brightened up a little bit."
Gasoline supplies have been helped, Mr. Costello added, because with falling oil prices, refiners have enjoyed a wider spread between what they pay for oil and the price they can sell gasoline, in contrast to thin margins earlier this year.
Also, he said, wholesale gasoline prices have dropped lately, in part because of recent upward revisions in estimates of the nation's gasoline inventories.
The revised estimates suggest that stocks of gasoline, while still quite low, have not fallen to the severe levels previously anticipated.
Kevin J. Lindemer, a senior director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Cambridge, Mass., said that the government's assumption that domestic refineries can run at 96.8 percent of capacity this summer is attainable, barring major disruptions.
He also attributed part of the recent decline in prices, and the hope for further declines, to psychological factors. "We've taken the heat out of the market," Mr. Lindemer said.
Although the new forecast still predicts the highest summer gasoline prices ever, the agency noted that the situation is not as severe when inflation-adjusted numbers are used. The average 1981 summer price of $1.35 per gallon, for example, translates to $2.52 today.
That is not much solace, though, to motorists paying extra to fuel their car. Lauren Merritt, a senior at Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Dallas, said she spends at least $30 a week on gasoline commuting from Kaufman County, Tex.
If they materialize, Ms. Merritt said, lower prices will help a bit. But prices will remain high, crimping her efforts to save for college. "I can't spend as much as I want to on other things because I have to budget for gas," she said.

HEADLINE: Most Nations Fail to Supply Safe Blood, W.H.O. Finds

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 6

 BODY:
More than two-thirds of the world's nations are failing to supply safe blood to their populations, according to the World Health Organization. Their failure adds significantly to the spread of the virus that causes AIDS, as well as potentially deadly forms of hepatitis and other diseases.
The countries where people are most at risk are the poorest and often are those where diseases are spreading fastest, the group found in a survey. These countries contain 80 percent of the world's population, or about 4.8 billion people. 
 On Friday, the World Health Organization, in cooperation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, begins a campaign to improve the safety of blood around the world.
Poor countries face obvious cost problems in making the blood supply safe. But that is not the only cause of the failure, experts say.
Poor social policies with a low priority on public health programs contribute to the problem, as does inadequate testing. Hospital equipment may be contaminated and sometimes reused, and blood may be stored improperly.
Most important may be the ubiquitous third world practice of buying blood. "Paid donors, it has been demonstrated many, many times, are at much higher risk of being infected," said Dr. David Brandling-Bennett, deputy director of the Pan American Health Organization in Washington. "That, of course, means that even if you do good testing, you have a higher risk of missing somebody."
Dr. Brandling-Bennett said in an interview that travelers who visit developing countries on business usually do not need to fear blood contamination if they avoid risky behavior and, in emergencies, go only to hospitals approved by American embassies or consulates. In the United States, immigrant populations need to have explained to them the importance of full disclosure when people give blood, he said. Blood is no longer bought in the United States.
The Western Hemisphere, said Dr. Jose Ramiro Cruz, the Pan American Health Organization's adviser on laboratory and blood safety, is the world's safest in the handling of blood. "Data collected in the last five years from every single country in Latin America and the Caribbean shows that the position has improved dramatically," he said in an interview. Other regions are not so lucky, the World Heath Organization says. It estimates that tens of thousands of people pick up the virus that causes AIDS and millions are infected annually with hepatitis B and C, which can lead to liver failure or liver cancer. South Asia, particularly India, and Africa are special concerns.
Dr. Kevin Cahill, an expert on tropical diseases in New York, and the president of the independent Center for International Health and Cooperation, said that economics and attitudes both play a part.
"When you deal with many countries where the total health expenditure per capita is in the range of $15 a year, as in some African countries, the thought that you can spend that amount typing and cross-matching blood -- it's a fantasy," he said.
"Not just blood-banking is a low priority; health is a low priority in most developing countries," Dr. Cahill said. "Health and humanitarian issues should be central in foreign policies, not peripheral issues."
Women of childbearing age are among the most vulnerable people in the developing world, experts say. Corinne Whitaker, senior program officer for Africa at the International Women's Health Coalition in New York, said this was especially true in societies where women bear children young and often. They are frequently anemic and their small size makes them prone to injuries in childbirth.
"Getting access to any blood is a challenge in much of Africa," Ms. Whitaker said in an interview. "That's further complicated by the issue of screening for safe blood."
Problems with the blood supply have not been limited to developing nations. Over the last decade court cases have demonstrated to what extent early warnings about the virus that causes AIDS were ignored in the United States, France, Germany, Switzerland and other countries, with the result that thousands of hemophiliacs and others in need of blood may have been infected.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Apr. 6

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company announced today that it would begin selling a small sport utility vehicle in 2003 using both gasoline and electric propulsion for better gas mileage. General Motors and DaimlerChrysler are working on similar sport utilities.
The Ford Escape, which is a little smaller than a Ford Explorer and a little larger than a Honda CR-V, will go on sale this autumn with only gasoline engines available. The optional hybrid engine will be offered on Escapes built three years later at a slightly higher price, Ford said. 
 Because the Escape has a carlike underbody, instead of the heavy, pickup-truck-like underbody of Ford's other sport utilities, it gets 23 miles to the gallon in the city and 28 miles to the gallon on the highway with a four-cylinder gasoline engine. Ford said that equipping the vehicle with the hybrid engine would increase its fuel efficiency to almost 40 miles a gallon in the city and on the highway.
In the hybrid models, the gasoline engine and the vehicle's own braking will charge the electric motor, which will not require separate charging. In the Escape and other hybrid automobiles, the gasoline engine shuts off when the vehicle stops; once the driver touches the accelerator, an electric motor powered by batteries gets the vehicle moving again while the gasoline engine turns back on.
Honda has just started selling the Honda Insight, a tiny coupe with a gasoline-electric engine that gets up to 70 miles per gallon on the highway. This summer Toyota will start selling its Prius, a hybrid that is similar to a Toyota Corolla but which gets about 50 miles per gallon.
Ford officials said that they had been working on hybrid technology for years and that their timetable had not been affected by the Japanese offerings or the recent rise in gasoline prices.
DaimlerChrysler introduced a prototype of a hybrid Dodge Durango last autumn that would, the company said, get an average of 18.6 miles per gallon in city and highway driving, compared with 15.5 miles per gallon for the current model with a gasoline-only engine. G.M. has been collaborating with Toyota to develop a car-based sport utility vehicle the size of a Subaru Forester that would also carry a hybrid engine. G.M. and DaimlerChrysler have not yet announced plans for mass production.
Top executives from G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler joined Vice President Al Gore at a news conference in Washington last week on improving fuel economy. William Powers, Ford's vice president for research, said in an interview that the company did not mention its plans in Washington because "we had agreed months ago with our partners we wouldn't upstage each other." A Gore aide said that was true.
Mr. Gore has long sought tighter fuel-economy regulations. The industry supports President Clinton's recent proposal for a $3,000 tax credit for electric and hybrid propulsion automobiles, which would roughly offset for consumers the extra cost of the hybrid engine.
The hybrid Ford Escape will be built on the same assembly line in Claycomo, Mo., that will build the regular Ford Escape, Ford said. The hybrid will use many components from Visteon Automotive Systems, a giant auto parts subsidiary that Ford's board is expected to spin off at its board meeting next Thursday, probably by ordering that Visteon shares be distributed to Ford shareholders.

HEADLINE: Goliath of the Hog World;
Fast Rise of Smithfield Foods Makes Regulators Wary

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: TAR HEEL, N.C.

 BODY:
In the coastal plains here, where tobacco once ruled, sit hundreds of corporate hog farms, punctuated by giant lagoons filled with manure. And just off Route 87, not far from the Cape Fear River, is the world's largest meatpacking plant, a structure so colossal that its waste-water treatment plant could serve a midsize city.
The farms and the plant, which can kill seven million hogs a year, belong to Smithfield Foods, the world's largest hog producer and pork processor -- and the company at the center of a fierce debate over the rise of big agriculture. 
 By aggressively acquiring its larger rivals over the last two years and using precision genetics, huge hog farms and giant meatpacking plants to control every stage of production, Smithfield has ballooned into a $5 billion company that accounts for more than a fifth of the nation's pork.
But in doing so, it has come under intense scrutiny from regulators who say that agricultural giants may wield too much control over the food supply.
After Smithfield announced in September that it would acquire Murphy Family Farms, the giant hog producer, the Agriculture Department called the company "absurdly big," and asked the Justice Department's antitrust division to review the deal. More recently, the attorney general in Iowa, a big pork producing state, challenged the merger in state court, arguing that Smithfield is trying to skirt a state law that forbids a meatpacking company to operate hog farms.
There are also growing concerns that the company's hog waste could pose dangers to local water supplies, and that giant hog operations could cripple small farmers.
"All of a sudden we have this 800-pound gorilla in the pork industry," said Betsy Freese, the livestock editor at Successful Farming magazine in Des Moines. "The troubling part for a lot of farmers is if the packer owns production, where are you going to sell your pigs?"
For their part, Smithfield executives say the company has been unfairly maligned and has been a pioneer in developing a more systematic approach and healthier meat.
"What we did in the pork industry is what Perdue and Tyson did in the poultry business," said Joseph W. Luter III, chairman and chief executive of Smithfield, which is based in Smithfield, Va. "Vertical integration gives you high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics. And the only way to do that is to control the process from the farm to the packing plant."
Smithfield is also adapting to a trend that began in the Southeast -- creating factory-size hog farms by using contract farmers, who put up the capital to build special barns and provide the labor to raise pigs to company specifications.
No longer is the market scattered among thousands of small Midwestern farmers, who raise hogs and sell them to meatpackers. Four companies now account for nearly 20 percent of the nation's hog supply, and four big meatpackers slaughter about 60 percent of the nation's pork.
Agriculture, some experts say, is merely mimicking the larger economy. "This is what has evolved out of the marketplace," said John Lawrence, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University in Ames.
In Smithfield's "birth to bacon" approach, everything is calculated: genetics, artificial insemination, barns with automated feeding systems and computers that monitor temperature and ventilation. A special feed, executives say, creates pork as lean as chicken in a brand the company is taking national: Smithfield's Lean Generation Pork.
Smithfield's giant meatpacking factory, a 973,000-square-foot plant here in Tar Heel, about 20 miles southeast of Fayetteville, relies on a "disassembly line," which has its roots in the 19th century, although the system is aided by new technologies, like laser-equipped cutting machines.
In many ways, the Tar Heel plant -- which can process up to 32,000 hogs a day -- is an efficient killing machine. Squealing hogs funnel into an area where they are electrocuted, stabbed in the jugular, then tied, lifted and carried on a winding journey through the plant. They are dunked in scalding water, their hair is removed, they are run through a fiery furnace (to burn off residual hair), then disemboweled and sliced by an army of young, often immigrant, laborers.
On the other side of the plant, which is chilled, teams of workers cut hog meat into smaller pieces. Wearing frocks, rubber boots and earplugs, they stand shoulder to shoulder, dipping knives in hot water and then making quick cuts in meat passing rapidly on a conveyor belt.
Together, Smithfield's five plants can handle up to 19 million hogs a year, turning out more than five billion pounds of pork.
Mr. Luter, a tart-tongued 60-year-old Virginian who runs the company from his Park Avenue apartment in New York City and his home in Aspen, Colo., took over a small meatpacking company his father founded in 1936 and made it into one of the world's largest food companies.
Believing that the big profits were in raising and processing hogs, Smithfield joined forces with three North Carolina producers to form Circle Four Farms. The four companies, which pioneered the use of giant confinement barns that can hold up to 2,600 pigs, agreed to use similar genetics and feed and send all hogs to Smithfield packing plants.
The alliance has moved into Western states but has had less impact in the Midwest because of laws opposing corporate farming. As a result, hog production has boomed in the South and West but is in sharp decline in the Midwest. Chicago is no longer "hog butcher to the world." And Iowa, despite its plentiful grain, is about to lose to North Carolina its title as the biggest hog state.
"Most of our farmers are doing pigs because they were looking for an alternative to tobacco," said Walter Cherry, executive director of the North Carolina Pork Council, in Raleigh. "Twenty-five years ago, we just didn't have pigs. Now, we're doing $2 billion in pigs."
In recent years, Smithfield has acquired most of its Circle Four partners, including the nation's two largest hog producers, Carroll's Foods and Murphy Family Farms. It also bought Schneider, Canada's largest processor, and North Side Foods, maker of McDonald's breakfast sausages. And Smithfield said in March that it would acquire a big Iowa processing plant from Farmland Industries, a huge cooperative.
Ranked as the nation's No. 7 pork producer in 1997, Smithfield is now No. 1; it is also the biggest hog raiser. It sells a large array of branded products like Gwaltney's.
Though Smithfield's share price has fallen recently, Mr. Luter says the company, which made a profit of $94 million on its $3.7 billion in sales last year, will produce stronger and less volatile growth. Smithfield's stock closed unchanged on Thursday, at $22.75, up from its 52-week low of $14.875 in February, but well below its 52-week high of $34.0625 last summer.
Several analysts agree that the outlook for Smithfield is bright. "I'm a big believer," said David C. Nelson at Credit Suisse First Boston, who insists the shares are undervalued, despite a large amount of debt. "They generated the best return of any food company in the last decade."
The company's drive, however, could be upset by a thicket of legal and political challenges. Regulators are considering new measures to cover corporate hog farms. Battles have broken out in Colorado, Missouri and Iowa. In North Carolina, there is a moratorium on building new corporate hog farms.
Putrid smells and contaminated waste water have led to federal fines and a public relations fiasco.
In 1996, The News and Observer of Raleigh won a Pulitzer Prize for a series detailing hog waste problems tied to Murphy Family Farms.
That same year, the Environmental Protection Agency fined Smithfield $12.6 million after its processing plants in Virginia violated the Clean Water Act by discharging pollutants into the Pagan River. The pollutants eventually reached the Chesapeake Bay.
In an interview at his Park Avenue apartment, Mr. Luter acknowledged some lapses, but blamed politicians and environmentalists for distorting the company's environmental record and ignoring the benefits of big agriculture. He said the company was spending millions of dollars on food safety and the environment.
The E.P.A. unjustly fined the company, Mr. Luter said, and ignored its efforts to comply with state laws. "I'm still outraged," he said of the fines. "Much of it came from agricultural runoff. Did it have any major impact on the river? No."
Mr. Luter also scoffs at the idea of dangerous industry concentration. The poultry and beef industries are much more concentrated, he said, pointing to a different culprit in recent low hog prices.
"It's not concentration; it's too many hogs," he said. "It was just too profitable for too long."
With low prices pinching farmers in the Midwest, Congress has responded by trying to put limits on big mergers and restraints on companies like Smithfield.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said he was outraged when Mr. Luter issued a press release saying Smithfield would keep consolidating. "There's always been some consolidation," Mr. Grassley said in an interview. "But the aggressive pursuit of megacorporate agriculture that Smithfield is making will ruin the family farm."
The Agriculture Department is also concerned that consolidation could give meatpackers too much power over prices. "Farmers don't like the fact that they're selling to so few buyers," said Keith Collins, the agency's chief economist.
In Iowa, Attorney General Thomas J. Miller filed suit against Smithfield in January, trying to block its merger with Murphy. Because Smithfield has a meatpacking plant in Sioux City, Mr. Miller said the acquisition of Murphy, which raises hogs in Iowa, violated the state's corporate farming laws, which forbid a company to control farm production and processing.
The state also accused Smithfield of engaging in a sham transaction after it agreed to sell Murphy's hog farms to Randall D. Stoecker, a Murphy employee, for $79 million. Mr. Stoecker borrowed the $79 million from Murphy to create Stoecker Farms, which the state says Smithfield effectively controls.
Last month, a state judge appointed a special investigator to study the case. Mr. Luter said he expected a settlement soon.
With domestic opposition growing, Smithfield has acquired big companies in Canada, France and Poland. "The current hostility from interest groups in this country has made other parts of the world look good to us," Mr. Luter said.
At home, many small farmers are fighting back against the perceived Goliath by joining cooperatives. Many are offering fatter, better-tasting meat that appeals to fine restaurants and other niche markets. They are raising hogs that are free of antibiotics and selling organic pork, at a premium. And legislators are standing behind them. But Mr. Luter insists American agriculture is forever changed, and global markets, not legislators, are charting the course.
"The bottom line is the small farmers have been disappearing for 100 years," Mr. Luter said. "If you want to protect the small farmer, you are going to do it on the back of the American consumer."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: Next Year Never Comes;
Grumbling Escalates Among Baseball's Have-Nots

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 6

 BODY:
For baseball fans, hope is supposed to spring eternal each year as the groundskeepers groom the outfield grass and comb the basepaths for the home opener. But here in Kansas City, as in Pittsburgh, Montreal, Minneapolis and many other smaller cities with major league teams, that once-perennial optimism has withered over the last decade in the face of a growing gap between rich and poor franchises.
As Kansas City prepares for its first home game on Friday, most fans here no longer even dream that the once-mighty Royals will make it to the World Series. Expectations have sunk so low that even die-hard optimists say they would be happy if the Royals win as many games as they lose this season. Last year, the team won 64 games and lost 97. 
 "There is no way we can be competitive," said Joe O'Keefe, 34, a lifelong Royals fan, who was watching the season opener on television at Tanners Sports Bar in a Kansas City suburb earlier this week. "They are more of a circus act than a baseball team. You go out there for the carnival atmosphere. You don't go out there to watch competitive baseball."
The cynicism of fans like O'Keefe does not bode well for baseball. There is a growing consensus among team owners, fans and experts on the game that the disparity between high-revenue teams and those in small markets threatens the sport's future popularity. Last year, all eight teams that made the playoffs ranked among the top 10 payrolls in the game. Some owners are asking how baseball can sustain the interest of fans if only a handful of lucrative teams can afford enough stars to have a realistic chance to make the playoffs.
"For teams like Kansas City, we need to change the economic landscape of the game," said Bud Selig, the commissioner of baseball, who once owned another small-market team, the Milwaukee Brewers. "The evidence is very clear that we do have a disparity problem. We are going to crack it, because it's essential to the growth of the game."
In January, the owners voted unanimously to give Selig broader powers to redistribute the leagues' wealth to less affluent teams; he has appointed a panel to explore ways to do that, but so far has not offered concrete proposals.
Baseball officials say the limited revenue-sharing schemes, including a luxury tax on high-payroll teams, put in place in 1995 have so far failed to provide enough extra money to make low-revenue teams more competitive.
There have always been haves and have-nots in baseball. Teams in big cities have always had a natural advantage, because they have a greater population from which to draw people to games and because their local television and radio broadcasting rights are more valuable. In recent years, medium-sized cities like Cleveland and Baltimore have built new ballparks with luxury amenities that have given their teams an economic advantage.
But the gap between rich and poor franchises has grown significantly since the strike of 1994 as players' salaries have skyrocketed, and it has become harder for small-market teams to hold on to their stars, baseball experts said.
"The problem is no one really knows what level of inequality is acceptable," said Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College economics professor who writes about sports. "You do want the Yankees and the Dodgers to win a little more. But you have to have a threshold of happiness all around. You don't want to have year after year domination by high-revenue teams."
The root of the problem is that baseball teams do not share local broadcast revenues, which vary widely from city to city. In 1998, for instance, the Yankees, with a market of more than 6.8 million households with televisions, received more than $53 million for local broadcast rights. There are about 802,000 households with televisions in the Kansas City metropolitan area, and the Royals received only $7 million in broadcast revenues in 1999.
In the National Football League, by contrast, teams share equally from the league's national broadcast contracts.
 
Financial Gap Just Gets Wider
 Baseball players' salaries have risen dramatically. In 1990, the average team payroll was $17 million and the highest payroll was about three times larger than the smallest. Last year, the average payroll had increased to $48 million, and the highest payroll was six times the size of the smallest. The Yankees spent $88 million on players' salaries last year, or more than five times the $16 million the Royals spent.
"Two players on the Yankees are the whole Royals payroll," said Mark J. Davis, a season-ticket holder. "What does that tell you?"
Standing in line outside Kauffman Stadium today to buy advance tickets, several fans said they still come to the ballpark for the sunshine or to teach their children about the game, but the idea of going to the playoffs seems remote.
"I come here just to show my son what baseball is like, for something to do, to learn the game and to see the other team's stars," said Jason Stahl, a 29-year-old salesman.
Some in Kansas City say the team's problems flow from bad trades and poor management. The Royals have not had an owner since Ewing Kauffman died in 1993, and some critics say the charitable trust Kauffman set up to oversee the team and search for a new owner has been rudderless.
But most Royals fans blame the changing economics of baseball. "We come out of spring training, we know that we are not going to be there in the end," said Charles Graham, a 30-year-old fan. "We don't have the money and the players to be there in the end."
That frustration boiled up in a protest last May, when more than 5,200 fans, organized by Kevin Kietzman, a sports talk-show host, walked out of a Royals-Yankees game in a noisy protest. They wore T-shirts saying "Share the Wealth" and Yankees caps with dollar bills pasted to them.
"It's becoming plain to everyone in Kansas City that the economics have changed," said David Judy, a season-ticket holder. "Now someone would have to be able to lose $50 million a year to be a competitive team."
Teams like Kansas City, which will spend about $25 million on players this year, can afford top athletes only early in their careers, before their salaries go out of reach. Players are eligible to go to an arbitrator in salary disputes after three years in the majors, and they can become free agents after six. Since arbitrators peg salaries to those of the highest-paid players, big-market teams set the price for top players. After three years, the salaries of talented young players often jump dramatically, and after six they are usually snapped up by the richer teams.
"The biggest challenge in Kansas City, quite candidly, is to keep the players we have now, because their salaries just mushroom, they explode," said Herk Robinson, the Royals' general manager.
The best chance a low-revenue team has of winning a pennant is to somehow cobble together a group of immensely talented rookies and make it to the playoffs before they become too expensive. John Schuerholz, a former Royals general manager who now holds the same position with the Atlanta Braves, said even that trick is nearly impossible under the current salary system.
"They might get one year where they can compete and even get the division or a wild-card spot, but to sustain that is impossible," he said.
Once in a while lightning does strike for small-market teams; in recent years, the San Diego Padres and the Florida Marlins reached the World Series. But in each case, the teams' owners sold off many of their high-priced players the following year because they were unwilling to sustain the huge losses necessary to remain competitive.
All this has had a demoralizing effect on fans. Although the Royals have a core of good young hitters in Johnny Damon, Jermaine Dye and Carlos Beltran, it is unclear how long the team can retain them. Last year, only four Royals made more than $1 million. This year, eight players will cross that threshold. With total revenues of about $50 million, the Royals would have to consider letting some of the young stars go if there was another jump in salaries, team officials said.
"Pretty much everyone in Kansas City is saying that as soon as these young kids get a little experience, they will be gone, they won't be here," said Steve Brentano, a fan and the owner of a string of sports bars. "This is like a training camp."
Gabe Duff, a 23-year-old sheet-metal worker, said the revolving door of players wears on fan loyalty. "We have a lot of good talent come through here," Duff said. "I got tired of players coming in and going off to the big-time teams and you would hear about them in the playoffs."
 
Prospective Owner Generates Some Hope
Still, Royals fans are more excited this year than they have been in a while. Friday's home opener is sold out, and many people are hopeful that David Glass, a former Wal-Mart chief executive who is on the verge of acquiring the Royals, will be able to lead a charge among low-revenue teams to somehow level the playing field. Glass's $96 million bid for the Royals has been accepted by the team's board and is expected to be ratified by the owners later this month.
Glass is no stranger to the team, having served as the chairman of the board that has managed the Royals since Kauffman's death. Glass has been a strong proponent of sharing revenue among major league teams, and Royals fans believe he has a powerful ally in Selig.
For his part, Glass said he is confident Selig will do something to redistribute the wealth. "Baseball in general has recognized that the competitive balance has been eroded over the last few years, and I think there is a consensus among the owners that it needs to be restored," he said.
Without more revenue-sharing, Glass said, teams like the Royals risk becoming permanent losers, little more than sparring partners for big-market juggernauts. "If nothing changes, we will have a caste system," he said.
The Royals' second-class status is a bitter pill for older fans who remember the team's glory days in the late 1970's and early to mid-1980's. Those Royals, led by George Brett, the Hall of Fame third baseman, were annual contenders and often fought the Yankees down to the last out. The Royals won the American League pennant in 1980 and the World Series in 1985.
But Kauffman, a billionaire drug manufacturer who looked on the team as a civic duty, was willing to absorb a financial loss to win a pennant. "We will never have an owner like Mr. Kauffman," said Lee Bussinger, a longtime fan and member of Royal Lancers, a booster group. "His pockets were deep enough to bring the players in."
Even if Kauffman were alive, it is doubtful he would be able to contribute the large sums necessary to make the Royals competitive. "In the days when Kauffman was alive, he could chip in $2 or $3 million and put our payroll on a par with the best," said Robinson, the general manager. "When you have clubs with payrolls at $80 million or $90 million, it doesn't make a bit of difference."
 
Another League Offers a Model
Many Royals fans point to the N.F.L. and ask why baseball cannot adopt a similar revenue-sharing strategy. In the N.F.L., the network television contracts are huge, worth more than $2.2 billion a year, with each team getting an equal amount: $59 million a year. Since the league also has a salary cap, even small markets like Green Bay, Nashville and Jacksonville can field successful franchises.
The Kansas City Chiefs have been playoff contenders for decades. They led the N.F.L. in attendance last year at Arrowhead Stadium, a few hundred yards from Kauffman Stadium, where the beleaguered Royals struggled to attract 1.5 million fans last year. In the 1980's, the Royals regularly attracted at least 2.2 million fans a year.
"The disparity in the league is outrageous and the owners have to come along and realize they have to go to something like the N.F.L. has," Jim Bayliff, a 25-year-old watchmaker, said as he watched the Blue Jays trounce the Royals on television earlier this week. "I believe the small-market teams are going to be butchered up and gone."

Brazil Planning Early Payments to International Lenders

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, April 6

 BODY:
In perhaps the strongest sign yet that the Brazilian economy is recovering from last year's currency crisis, the country's central bank will repay early a large part of a $41.5 billion emergency loan package provided by the International Monetary Fund and other lenders.
The move, announced late Wednesday, would redeem $10.3 billion of loans due in October to the I.M.F., the Japanese central bank and the Bank of International Settlements. Of the $32 billion offered by these institutions, Brazil had drawn $20 billion. 
 After April, Brazil will owe $1.8 billion to the I.M.F. and about $9.5 billion to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. These loans, which are considered nonemergency funds, have lower interest rates and longer maturities.
"This measure shows that there is no crisis lurking around the corner for which these funds could have been allocated," said Octavio de Barros, the chief economist here for Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria. "Brazil's risk exposure has simply, and drastically, been reduced."
Confounding most analysts' expectations, the economy of Brazil, Latin America's largest, displayed surprising resilience after currency devaluation in January 1999. Helped by strong farm production and a record $30 billion in foreign direct investment, the economy eked out nearly a percentage point of growth in 1999.
Yet it is only recently that data has begun to suggest that Brazil is on its strongest economic footing in years. Industrial production and automobile output are soaring while unemployment is falling. And inflation has been kept in check by an austere interest-rate policy.
These indicators, combined with the success of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's government in raising taxes and cutting spending, have again made Brazil an attractive destination for foreign capital.
Brazil is following the example of Mexico, Latin America's second-largest economy, in repaying funds provided by the United States Treasury to ease the peso crisis of 1994-95.
"The improved scenario has allowed the financial team to pay off its obligations early, which is just prudent financial management," said Paul Bydalek, president of Atlantic Rating, a Brazilian bank-rating company. "What remains to be seen is whether this effort pays off as it did for Mexico."

HEADLINE: Big Board Suggests Ending Links Among Exchanges

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
The torturous process of reorganizing United States securities markets took another turn yesterday when the New York Stock Exchange called for ending the aging system that provides rudimentary links between the Big Board, regional exchanges and the Nasdaq stock market.
The exchange also declared its opposition to creating a national "limit-order book" that would closely link markets nationwide. 
 The Big Board proposes scrapping the two-decade-old "Intermarket Trading System," which it says has become unworkably complex and is obsolete thanks to proprietary systems that brokers use to find the best prices across markets.
The exchange's stance was foreshadowed in February when the Big Board chairman, Richard Grasso, told a Senate Banking Committee hearing that he was wary of linking to a broader system.
But by so firmly coming out against a central limit-order book, the exchange appears to be at odds with Goldman, Sachs and other big securities firms, which have called for the Big Board to work more closely with new electronic networks that match buyers and sellers directly. A limit-order book is a single system that would fill orders at the best price, no matter which market is offering that price.
The existing system is meant to find the lowest price at any exchange that trades New York Stock Exchange listings, but Mr. Grasso and other Wall Street executives agree that it frequently fails to work.
Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has said that unless the government requires close links between the new networks and existing exchanges, trading is likely to fragment across different markets, and investors will never know whether they are getting the best prices.
In response to the exchange's announcement yesterday, Goldman said only that "we are supportive of the New York Stock Exchange's reinvention initiative."
"However, we remain strong advocates of a level playing field that allows every exchange and qualified trading venue to compete for best execution through a system of linkages."
Other large securities companies did not return calls for comment.
In a speech yesterday to the Economic Club of Washington, Mr. Levitt also appeared to take a view that differed from that of the Big Board.
"Upstart electronic markets are leveraging technology to challenge traditional exchanges, using computers rather than humans to match buyers and sellers," he said. "A fast-expanding web of connections between customers, brokers, and markets seems destined to weave our many and diverse markets into a true National Market System."
In that environment, Mr. Levitt said, "it would be a profound mistake -- not to mention a dereliction of our statutory duty -- to permit the isolation of any significant market from the rest of our National Market System."

HEADLINE: Low Response To Long Form Causes Worry About Census

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
In the wake of concerns raised by some Republican leaders over the intrusiveness of some census questions, Census Bureau officials have become alarmed that a smaller percentage of households are mailing back their census long forms than did so in 1990.
Census Bureau officials said this week that 48 percent of households had filled out and returned the long form, compared with 58 percent of those who had mailed back the short form. At a comparable time in 1990, the response rate for the long form was 6 percentage points behind that of the short form. 
 Ten years ago, census takers interviewing people in households that did not mail back the long form were able to close the gap to 4.5 percentage points. But officials are fearful that unless there is a significant upturn in the number of households sending in the long form, the gap will not be significantly reduced.
"I don't think it can be," said William Barron, deputy director of the Census Bureau. "I don't think it's going to be."
Information from the long form is considered critical, used as the base for items like the consumer expenditure survey, a key component of the consumer price index; the monthly unemployment figures issued by the Labor Department; and the National Crime Victimization Survey by the Justice Department.
The long form is a 53-question version that is mailed to one in six households nationwide. It asks people to provide personal data on things like income, the amount of time it takes to commute to work, the amount paid for utilities and what kind of plumbing facilities are in their homes.
The short form has eight questions and only seeks information about things like name, age, sex, race and ethnicity.
In some ways this year's long form is less intrusive than in years past. In 1990, the long form had 58 questions; in 1980 it had 65. And this year's form pales in comparison with the long form of 1940, which had 83 questions.
In recent weeks the Census Bureau has received numerous complaints from the public that many of the questions on the long form were too nosy. Census Bureau officials said the level of complaints from the public is not significantly different from what it was in 1980 and 1990.
Several Republican leaders, responding to the complaints, suggested last week that people fill out the form and simply skip questions they find objectionable. Campaigning in Milwaukee last week, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said people should mail back their form and "if they're worried about the government intruding into their personal lives, they ought to think about it."
A survey conducted for the Census Bureau found that in the first two weeks after the forms were mailed out, 10 percent of those polled said they believed the census was too intrusive, Kenneth Prewitt, the director of the Census Bureau, said. In the third week, as news accounts appeared detailing concerns of some Republicans over the questions, the number of people who said the census was too intrusive jumped to 17 percent.
Democrats in the House have criticized the actions of these Republican, noting that the Census Bureau had sent copies of potential questions to Congress in 1997 and 1998 and asked for comments. They received none.
"In 1997 and 1998 not one of these sanctimonious census reformers said one thing when they received books on their desks that said 'this is what we're going to ask,' " said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of Manhattan, who is the ranking Democrat on the House Subcommittee on the Census.
In recent days Republican leaders have been scrambling to not be seen as trying to undermine the census. Today House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, of Illinois; Representative J. C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, head of the House Republican Conference; and Representative Dan Miller of Florida, chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Census, held a joint news conference to urge people to complete their forms, though they still left open the possibility for people to skip some questions.
"I think every American ought to fill it out to the best of their ability," Mr. Hastert said. "If they have reservations about their phone number or some things that they think are private, I think that's a condition that they ought to be able to make their own decision on."
Even as the Republican leaders sought to be seen as friends of the census, some business groups that rely heavily on census data said that the 2000 Census may already be irreparably damaged.
"The cow's out of the barn," said David Crowe, staff vice president of the National Association of Home Builders. "We've had some very negative statements from some influential politicians. I don't know how you counteract that."

HEADLINE: Swings in Markets Push Some Margin Buyers Out on a Limb

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
A year ago, Aaron Talsky was doing so well in the stock market that he gave up his Beverly Hills law practice to spend his days buying and selling stocks of the new economy from his home near Laguna Beach, Calif.
When the frenzy for Internet and biotechnology stocks continued into this year, Mr. Talsky, 35, worked out a strategy for even fatter profits. He bought shares on margin, borrowing against the stock he already owned to purchase even more in what seemed to him a one-way street to bull market riches. 
 But the technology selloff that culminated Tuesday brought the first blush of fear to the young investor. Faced with the prospect of having to put up more money in his brokerage accounts to meet margin calls -- a brokerage firm requirement when the value of stocks falls too far -- Mr. Talsky sold shares into the market downturn.
"I saw my money just dripping away," Mr. Talsky said in a telephone interview Wednesday, noting that it was the first time he had suffered huge losses. "I saw balances moving in the wrong direction, and the speed with which it was happening was staggering."
Tuesday's selloff, in which the Nasdaq composite plummeted nearly 14 percent in just hours, has served as an unwelcome reminder of the perils of such borrowing, particularly when brokerage firms tell investors to come up with additional cash. Mr. Talsky, at least, is now vowing to ease up on credit.
But many in the market point to the rise in such borrowing and worry that Americans have gone to troubling lengths to reap bigger and bigger rewards in a bull market that seems to have an infinite number of legs.
"If you look at history, leverage is often a toppler of robust markets; it magnifies the upside and the downside," said Steven Galbraith, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. "That's why the investment community is very concerned about this."
And as the stock market has climbed in recent years, so has margin debt, to a record $265 billion in February, from about $152 billion at the end of 1998, according to the New York Stock Exchange. Margin debt now accounts for more than 1.5 percent of the Big Board's total market value, also a record.
In years past, borrowing was a high-risk practice left to professional money managers. Much of the borrowing now, though, is being done by a new breed of investors who are addicted to the market and who have learned to manage their own money and trade online through the likes of E*Trade and Charles Schwab & Company, according to industry professionals.
"We have seen a significant increase in customers using margin, and we think it's indicative of the entire market," said Heather Fondo, a spokeswoman at E*Trade, one of the largest online brokerage firms.
Schwab said that margin calls on Tuesday ran to three times their usual level. Datek Online, another online firm, said Tuesday was one of the five heaviest days there for margin calls. The well-established Wall Street firms, meanwhile, said they did not see a significant increase.
Many brokerage firms have tightened their lending policies. Though the Federal Reserve sets margin requirements -- initially an investor can borrow no more than 50 percent of a stock's purchase price -- the firms may set more stringent rules, even creating lists of technology stocks for higher requirements. The New York Stock Exchange, which also sets rules for its members, has asked securities firms for more information about their lending.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, has pushed for an increase in the initial amount required of investors for margin buying. Though he has expressed reluctance to raise the requirement, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, has said he will consider it.
Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School, says that though margin calls were a factor in Tuesday's rout, they were probably not the primary cause because institutions were heavy sellers. But he said the explosion of online investing and the decline in commissions had exacerbated market swings.
"The biggest factor is the collapse of trading costs," he said. "That's why people are in and out, in and out."
Investors find buying on margin so irresistible because the stock market has been a clear path to riches in the last decade. And in the last year or two, a craving for technology stocks has created multibillion-dollar companies almost overnight, giving rise to the dot-com mania.
Statistics are lacking, but anecdotal evidence suggests that a growing number of people are devoting more time to playing the stock market. Everyone seems to have a story about a friend, neighbor, cousin or former colleague who is trading stocks from his or her bedroom, retired at 48, glued to the Web, researching stocks and talking about price-to-earnings ratios.
"It's become incredibly prevalent," said Charles Pradilla, the chief investment strategist at SG Cowen in New York. "I live in Brooklyn Heights, and my butcher is playing the stock market. He stopped cutting veal chops and started day trading."
In a market of such high expectations and hefty returns, it is only natural that people would begin borrowing to buy into the frenzy. Though this week's action was unnerving, it is too early to conclude that such borrowing will fade.
Arnold Silverman, a 74-year-old retired stereo salesman in Boca Raton, Fla., said his portfolio value jumped early this year and then crashed early this week, nearly forcing him into a margin call on the $300,000 he has borrowed to buy stock. But the market picked up, averting the dreaded request for additional money in his account.
"I got very nervous," Mr. Silverman said. "I got to the edge."
Since he began actively trading a year ago, he said, "If I'm not on the golf course, I'm playing the market."
Some of his activity is with what he calls his fun money. "I'm not that worried," he said, "because I've got a lot of income coming from commercial real estate."
Having noticed that every selloff in the last few years has been followed by a fast bounce back, investors may see little reason to step aside. Michael Stummer, a day trader in suburban Chicago, said he was watching intently when the market turned down -- "for the bottom."
After the Nasdaq composite had dropped 574 points and had begun to recover Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Stummer says he jumped into the market. "I bought a stock at $71 and sold it at $87 an hour later," he said. "I was screaming and yelling."
Mr. Stummer says he made $50,000 in just hours, his best day ever, though he says his partners did not fare as well, largely because they had money tied up in losing stocks and could not muster cash to jump in on the rally.
Day traders often borrow to buy stocks, but most of them close out their positions daily. The real leaders in the long-term borrowing game appear to be active online investors, people like Aaron Talsky.
After 10 years as a lawyer, Mr. Talsky, who also taught corporate finance at the University of California at Irvine, was drawn to the boom on Wall Street. He had heard stories about people trading their own accounts full time, and was reading daily about Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. He decided he simply had to be a part of it.
"There will probably never be a time when things are this good," he said. "Not only is there a historic opportunity that wasn't available five years ago, but I can sit on the beach, I can sit in my bedroom and have the same access as the investment banks."
Though he has no boss, all is not easy. "I probably work three times as hard now," he said. "There's always more information than you can handle. I get up at 6 a.m. and read market briefing, commentaries, look at upgrades, downgrades, and then turn on CNBC."
Since becoming serious about trading, he has bought biotechnology stocks like Maxygen and Protein Design Labs along with Internet stocks like Ariba. He watched them climb and climb and climb until about two weeks ago, when his portfolio faltered. He recalls sitting in an Indian restaurant in Mission Viejo after the market closed one day and sensing an impending disaster. Still, he did not sell. But in the next few days, the market buckled.
Mr. Talsky says he is still doing extremely well after huge run-ups last year, but the psychological impact of seeing giant gains disappear in an instant is jarring. One stock fell to $70 from $300 a share, he said. "But how can you complain when the stock was at $20 three months ago?"
Now, he says he will temper his borrowing, but not give up on the market. This week's sell-off is just a reminder of what he has known all along: the more risk you take, the crueler the market can become.
"In this market," he said, "if you're going to run with the bulls, you're going to get trampled every once in a while."

HEADLINE: Social Combustion in China

 BODY:
Reports are only now reaching the United States of serious unrest in the northeast Chinese mining city of Yangjiazhangzi almost six weeks ago. An account in The Washington Post this week described three days of violent rioting over job cuts and corruption that overwhelmed local police forces and continued until regular army troops arrived. This is just the kind of social upheaval that terrifies the leadership in Beijing, who well know that protests by disenchanted citizens could someday escalate again into a serious threat to Communist rule. Hundreds of economic protests, some of them violent, have erupted across China in recent years, rarely, if ever, reported in the Chinese news media.
The Yangjiazhangzi events were unusually unruly, but worker and peasant protests have become increasingly frequent. Market reforms like the privatization of large state companies produce unemployment and social dislocation. When this takes place in an atmosphere of pervasive government corruption, popular anger is understandable. Unless Beijing enforces higher ethical standards on local officials, unrest could soon become even more widespread. State companies are scheduled to lay off more than 10 million workers before the end of this year. 
 Anger over alleged corruption seems to have played a major role in Yangjiazhangzi. Miners, a formidable protest group in many societies, were already aggrieved over economic issues. A large state-owned molybdenum mine there stopped issuing paychecks early last year. Last November, most of the mine was shut down, but some of its facilities and equipment were apparently transferred to new private owners alleged to be friends of local officials.
What detonated the violence was the belated announcement of an extremely modest severance package for the laid-off workers. The contrast between what looked like an undeserved windfall for the well connected and the shabby treatment of longtime employees became even more of an affront when mine authorities refused to show up at a peaceful protest meeting.
For several years now, Communist leaders in Beijing have seemed haunted by fears of explosive social unrest. Their answer has generally been repression, along with strident nationalist campaigns designed to distract the country's attention from economic grievances. Instead, Beijing should crack down on the corruption that has grown worse with the progress of economic reform. Show trials of a few spectacularly corrupt individuals have not been enough to discourage others on the take.
Market reforms have benefited China and brightened economic prospects for many of its workers and peasants. But the current phase of selling off state factories and mines is creating hardships for many longtime employees. When they see local party officials drawing illicit profits from their sacrifices, they are sure to protest. Beijing should heed the message from Yangjiazhangzi.

HEADLINE: Whitman Defends Grant To Company Tied to Spouse

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 6

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman defended today the state's decision to award a $1.6 million grant to an Internet firm in which her husband was a director and major shareholder, and insisted that the company, Mail.com, had not received any preferential treatment from New Jersey officials.
But the governor acknowledged that interaction between a government agency and an elected official's spouse could create a troubling appearance, and suggested that it might be time to update state ethics guidelines, many of which were written decades ago, when two-career families were rare. 
 Governor Whitman said that existing regulations did not fully address the issues that can confront a political figure whose husband has business dealings with government agencies.
"It certainly raises an issue that I think we're going to have to come to grips with," she said. "I have a husband who has a business, who's very successful at that business, and more and more now across the country, whether the elected officeholder is male or female, they have spouses that have independent incomes and businesses. And to the extent that the public is at all troubled by that, they need to take a look at it."
The State Economic Development Authority's grant to Mail.com was approved last November under a program that allows employers who create jobs in New Jersey to keep up to 80 percent of the state income taxes paid by workers.
Mail.com, one of the world's biggest e-mail providers, was looking to expand to Jersey City last year, bringing hundreds of new jobs to the state. Company officials said a consulting firm told them they might be eligible for a grant under New Jersey's Business Employment Incentive Program and recommended that they apply.
Although Governor Whitman's husband, John, was a member of Mail.com's board of directors and had bought at least 2 million shares of the company's stock, he was not informed of the grant application, said a company spokeswoman, Holly Lehr. When the grant application was filed on Oct. 15, 1999, Mr. Whitman's ownership stake was not disclosed because the state asks only for the names of shareholders who own 15 percent or more of a company, said the governor's spokesman, Peter McDonough.
Mr. Whitman later became aware of the application and told Gualberto Medina, New Jersey's commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development, of his involvement with Mail.com, Mr. McDonough said. But Mr. Medina told Mr. Whitman there was no need for him to file any disclosure forms, said Mr. Medina's spokeswoman, Lisa Kruse.
Members of the Economic Development Authority, which evaluates the applications, had learned of Mr. Whitman's involvement in the firm independently, said the agency's executive director, Caren S. Franzini. But Ms. Franzini said she did not disclose Mr. Whitman's role in the company to the board members who ultimately approved the application because he did not own a controlling interest in the company and Mail.com clearly met the qualifications for a grant. Governor Whitman was never involved in the state's decision-making about the grant.
Mr. Whitman resigned from the board on Nov. 18, nine days after the grant was approved. He has not returned calls requesting comment.
Some Democrats, state union officials and government watchdog groups say it was improper for Mr. Whitman to contact Mr. Medina during the grant application process. Richard Codey, the State Senate minority leader, said Mr. Whitman should have asked the state's Executive Commission on Ethical Standards to rule on the matter.
But Governor Whitman brushed aside his criticism as political gamesmanship. She stopped short of proposing any concrete steps to revise the ethics rules or calling for a commission to study the guidelines. But she said it might be unwise to forbid the spouses of elected officials from partaking in tax breaks and other business incentives.
"There certainly should be some constraints as far as doing direct business with state contracts, that kind of thing," she said. "But as long as things are aboveboard, as long as there is no special treatment, I don't know that we should try to stop the spouses of officials from participating in the economy."

HEADLINE: Venezuelan Calls Tune In OPEC's Price Tactics

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, April 6

 BODY:
For helping to engineer the spectacular rise in oil prices over the last year, fellow members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have rewarded him with the group's presidency.
Now Ali Rodriguez Araque, Venezuela's minister of energy, faces the daunting task of stabilizing prices at a level that both producers and consumers will find acceptable. 
 Mr. Rodriguez's sudden emergence as OPEC's public face is just one sign of the higher profile in international energy affairs that Venezuela is vigorously seeking. Since President Hugo Chavez took office 14 months ago, this nation of 23 million people, the largest exporter of oil outside the Middle East and the leading supplier to the United States in recent years, has gone from lamb to lion on oil matters.
"Under this government, Venezuela has been tremendously assertive, showing that we have our own identity and our own way of doing things," said Alan J. Viergutz, a former president of the Venezuelan Oil Chamber, the main industry group here. "That stands in complete contrast to the previous government, which if not anti-OPEC did not believe in OPEC solidarity."
The creation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 40 years ago was in large part the work of Venezuela's oil minister at the time, Juan Pablo Perez Alfonso. But throughout most of the last decade Venezuela's image within the cartel was that of a quota buster whose lack of discipline contributed to low prices for producers and earned the resentment of OPEC's other, mainly Middle Eastern, members.
"In 1997 and 1998, Venezuela's relationship with other members of OPEC was one of invective, of insults," Hector Ciavaldini, president of the state oil company P.D.V.S.A., which also owns the American-based Citgo oil company, recalled in an interview with the Venezuelan newsmagazine Primicia. "It had ruptured."
A month after being sworn in, Mr. Chavez, a populist former army colonel who led an unsuccessful coup attempt here in 1992, castigated Venezuela's previous policy as one of "indundating the market with no respect for production quotas, without giving any importance to the price of a barrel." He promised "a profound transformation," and was as good as his word, immediately cutting production by 625,000 barrels to 2.7 million barrels a day.
That set off grumbling here that Mr. Chavez was favoring his OPEC partners over domestic producers, since the cutbacks led to a recession that is still afflicting the local industry and is likely to inhibit its ability to increase production now. But the price of Venezuelan oil has nearly quadrupled, to $28 a barrel at its peak last month, giving Mr. Chavez an economic and political bonanza he has been quick to exploit both here and abroad.
At Mr. Chavez's behest, Mr. Rodriguez played a key role in getting non-OPEC producers like Mexico to adhere to the production cuts that originally sent the price of oil skyrocketing. Then, at their meeting in Vienna last week, OPEC oil ministers adopted a Venezuelan proposal intended to reduce future turmoil in the market by allowing the price of oil to fluctuate only in a "band" between $22 and $28 a barrel.
In the past, the OPEC presidency has often been seen as a post of much prestige but little practical power. Mr. Rodriguez returned from Vienna, however, saying that his fellow oil ministers had granted him the authority to enforce the price band by decreeing production increases or decreases as he saw fit, without convening a meeting of the whole group.
"If prices fall below $22, we will cut production by 500,000 barrels a day" to push prices back up, Mr. Rodriguez, who did not respond to requests for an interview, explained in a television appearance here this week. "When prices are above $28 a barrel, we will increase production."
The mechanism Mr. Rodriguez proposed has yet to be tested, and in the same television appearance he said that he thought "it will be necessary to have an additional increase in oil production this year" because "prices went down, but less than expected" after the Vienna meeting. There are also many skeptics who believe that the international oil market is simply too unruly for a price band ever to function effectively.
"It is going to be very difficult, if not impossible, to micromanage the market," said Eduardo Lopez, a Latin American oil specialist at Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington-based consulting concern. "OPEC is not a central bank, and though it has found a new strength, you still have all these countries with a different agenda, and on top of that you have cheating."
At first glance, Mr. Rodriguez may seem an odd choice to be overseeing the calibration of supply and demand for a commodity that is essential to modern global capitalism. He was active in a Cuban-inspired guerrilla group in the 1960's and is still a member of a party that is on the far left fringe of Mr. Chavez's coalition.
Eventually, though, he abandoned armed revolutionary struggle and, equipped with a law degree earned in 1961, entered conventional politics. It was after being elected to the lower house of the Venezuelan Congress in 1983 that his interest in oil policy blossomed. He gradually rose to chairman of that body's energy committee and became a member of the National Energy Council.
"Ali is entirely the contrary of the image or stereotype you would have of a guerrilla fighter," said Dr. Viergutz, who is president of an oil investment company and helped develop the oil band concept. "He is a very flexible, prudent and open-minded person, and though he may have been a Communist, he has come to see there are other economic systems besides the state-oriented model."
Legislation has been introduced in the United States Congress to punish oil producers for driving up gasoline prices, a move interpreted here as specifically aimed at Venezuela. OPEC's decision in Vienna to increase output by 1.7 million barrels a day appears to have headed off an immediate showdown, but even so there are other areas in which conflict between the United States and Venezuela may be looming.
As part of the higher profile in world energy policy it has been seeking, the Chavez government has sought and been granted an OPEC heads of state meeting, scheduled to be held here in September. Mr. Chavez has a tour of the Mideast scheduled for June, and he is expected to personally invite two of Washington's most bitter enemies, the Libyan leader, Muammar el-Qaddafi, and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, to attend the conference.
In addition, the state oil company, acting on Mr. Chavez's orders, has expressed interest in investing in the Cuban oil industry. If it does, oil analysts here have pointed out, it will almost certainly run afoul of United States legislation that calls for sanctions against foreign companies that make use of American assets nationalized in Cuba without compensation.
"Venezuela has always been a major oil producer and exporter," a foreign oil analyst here said. "What has changed is that this government is now prepared to use that weight to become a major player on the international scene."

HEADLINE: School Board Considers Deal To Swap Ads for Computers

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
A task force of New York school officials and executives of several big computer companies is proposing to distribute laptop computers to city schoolchildren and to create a school Web site that would give the companies advertising space in exchange for services and equipment.
The plan, to be considered at next Wednesday's board meeting, comes two months after the board approved a proposal to allow corporate donors to have their names attached to school classrooms, libraries or athletic fields in recognition of donations to pay for the facilities. 
 Board members say the plans, which they acknowledged were unusual for a publicly financed school system, are a way of attracting dollars for programs that could not be paid for with taxes.
Irving S. Hamer, a board member who oversees the task force that has explored the idea for nine months, said he thought the laptop distribution and Internet proposal would be approved by the full board. "This is a major shift in the ways we think about teaching and learning and how we fund these activities," he said.
But critics argued that the two initiatives put the Board of Education well down the road toward being a revenue-generating, advertising-driven entity.
"We have a great deal of concern about the negative potential of using children to promote commercial concerns and using class time for things that could be considered as advertisements," said Vicki Rafel, the vice president for legislation at the National PTA.
The board hopes to expand the use of the Internet in the classroom by creating a central site, known as a portal, through which students could receive homework assignments from teachers, who could swap lesson plans and communicate with parents and school administrators.
William C. Thompson Jr., president of the Board of Education, said he, too, thought that the full board would approve the Web site plan. "It is creative and shows a way that we can move the school system into the 21st century," he said.
Building a Web site that offers advertising to corporate partners is the only way to get their assistance in building and maintaining the system, Mr. Thompson said. Representatives of I.B.M., Cisco Systems and Toshiba America are members of the task force.
Beginning in fall 2001, laptop computers would be distributed each year to all 85,000 fourth graders at greatly reduced cost to parents. Students would be able to click on commercial logos on the school Web site to buy products. Part of each sale would go to the board.
The plan is thought to be the first of its kind by a public school system in the United States. But by embracing commercial enterprise in a way that is anathema to many publicly financed institutions, the Board of Education's plan is a reminder of previous efforts to provide advertising-supported information to schools for use in the classroom. Some of those programs, like the Channel One television network, attracted fierce opposition from educational leaders and parents, who said that such commercial-laden programs wasted classroom time and tax dollars.
Some education groups say that in a world where further tax increases are unlikely, partnerships between school systems and private enterprises are the only way to raise money for new technology programs. "In a new economy, looking for new opportunities to raise capital is just a survival mechanism," said Cheryl S. Williams, the director of educational technology programs for the National School Boards Association.
Moreover, supporters say, the primary beneficiaries of such a program would be children from poorer families, who are less likely to have computers and who have little exposure to new technology.
"If somebody came to me out of the blue and said there should be an advertising-based portal for New York City schools, I would have said that is not the way to go," said Robbie McClintock, co-director of the Institute for Learning Technology at Teachers College at Columbia University and a member of the Board of Education's task force that explored the proposal.
"But as a way of contending with the issue of limited resources and getting well-developed educational programs, it is something you can make a much better case for," Mr. McClintock said. "It is being voiced as a means of bridging the digital divide."
Dr. Hamer said the computers would very likely be leased to students at a discount, perhaps with the cost scaled in some way to a family's income. The plan is to offer updated technology to older students until, after nine years, all students in grades 4 through 12 would be using their own computer in school. The computers would be replaced or updated every few years.
Many of the plan's details remain to be worked out. Some of the proposals will require an open, public bidding process, for example, while others can be enacted under powers already granted to the board and the chancellor's office.
Aware of the potential opposition to financing the computers through the sale of advertising, the task force has been careful to avoid the use of that word, instead using more neutral words of the Internet industry, like co-branding and sponsorship.
In addition, Dr. Hamer emphasized that commercial aspects of the system would be strictly separated from material for classroom use.
He compared the program to the corporate sponsorship of public television programs, where a company's name and logo are featured but no specific products are mentioned.
"It will offer us the opportunity to say to General Electric, 'Please don't advertise your products here, but do some co-branding with us, tell your education story and provide some content,' " Dr. Hamer said.
Dr. Hamer said the Web site would also try to sell fixed spots to companies like Barnes & Noble, and if a user clicked on the company's logo and bought a book, the board would receive a portion of revenue.
That way of generating revenue, known as an affiliate program, is common in the Internet world and is used by growing numbers of schools, Little Leagues and other community organizations trying to raise money.
The difference between those programs and the Board of Education's proposal is that the board thinks companies will pay it to secure a dedicated spot on its portal, because the 1.3 million pupils, teachers and administrators in the school system are a large, captive audience.
The attraction of that captive audience was also behind the board's earlier proposal, passed in February, to name parts of schools after corporate or individual donors.
David Klasfeld, deputy chancellor for operations, said the proposal came about after the board was approached by a private civic group called Take the Field, which is seeking to raise money to rebuild city-owned athletic fields.
The establishment and naming of whole schools is reserved for the Board of Education and is not affected by the naming policy. But sports fields, libraries, cafeterias or classrooms can be named by the chancellor's office in recognition of donors, Mr. Klasfeld said.
"We do have a significant need for the rehabilitation of a lot of these facilities," Mr. Klasfeld said.
Mr. Thompson, the Board of Education president, said he also thought that the naming resolution was a way for the board to be creative in raising money.
"Is it more of a commercialization?" he asked. "A little bit. But we're also being realistic and attempting to do things that generate additional revenues that go directly to students and give them opportunities that more affluent school districts have access to."

HEADLINE: Tribe Wins Federal Approval for Casino in the Borscht Belt

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The federal Interior Department approved plans yesterday for a $500 million casino to be operated by the St. Regis Mohawk Indian tribe in the Catskills, where local officials, hotel owners and many residents have long hoped that gambling might bring an economic revival to the depressed resort area once known as the borscht belt.
Under the proposal, 30 acres of land next to the Monticello Raceway in Sullivan County would be put in trust for the Mohawks for a casino complex. 
 The plan must be approved by Gov. George E. Pataki, but after 30 years of efforts to reverse the fortunes of a rural county where many hotels are shuttered and one-third of the families earn less than $26,000 a year, proponents said the federal letter of approval was a huge step forward.
The 1.8-million-square-foot casino complex, which would be 90 miles from New York City, is expected to draw more than nine million visitors a year, fueling jobs and businesses in Sullivan County. Analysts predict that it will hobble the growth of the casino market in Atlantic City.
"The governor has said he's supportive of Indian casinos in traditional resort areas like the Catskills," said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki. "But we want to give ourselves a chance to look over the letter."
Over the last six months, Governor Pataki has come under sharp attack from anti-gambling forces in New York, as well as from Donald J. Trump and other casino operators in Atlantic City. Union activists have also been critical, because the Indian casino would not be bound by labor or civil rights laws.
"The fun starts now," said Rusty Pomeroy, chairman of the Sullivan County Legislature. "We're going to make a final push on this deal. All the anti-casino activists and Donald Trumps will come out of the woodwork. Albany will be a battleground. If it's approved, it will spur development the likes of which have never been seen in Sullivan County before."
It is unconstitutional to operate a casino in New York State, except on the sovereign land of Indians; the Turning Stone casino, for example, is operated by the Oneida Nation 30 miles east of Syracuse.
More than four years ago, a group of investors and local business people in Monticello offered to donate 30 acres to the Mohawks for a casino project.
The Mohawks, in turn, asked the Interior Department to take the land in trust for the tribe under a seldom-used provision of federal law. The trust would establish a tax-free sovereign Indian territory where one did not previously exist. The Mohawks already have a small money-losing casino at their tribal home on the Canadian border near Hogansburg, N.Y.
Yesterday, Kevin Gover, the assistant secretary for Indian affairs, sent a letter to Governor Pataki saying that he had determined that a casino "would be in the best interest of the tribe and its members, and would not be detrimental to the surrounding community."
"We have always believed that the merits of the project would lead to its approval," said Robert A. Berman, a financier and local resident who leads the group that plans to build the casino. "After close examination of the application and years of review, it's not surprising that the federal government came to a positive determination. We hope that Governor Pataki will agree."
Under the terms of the agreement with the Mohawks, Mr. Berman's group would build and operate the casino under a seven-year management contract giving the tribe 65 percent of the revenue. That percentage may change as the contract is reviewed by the National Indian Gaming Commission. The tribe, in turn, would contribute about $5 million a year to the county.
Mr. Berman's partners include Ralph and Joseph Bernstein, developers based in New York, and Alpha Hospitality, a casino operator.
Governor Pataki has long said that Indian casinos could be a boon for faded upstate resorts like the Catskills and Niagara Falls. But only a few days after a judge threw out two lawsuits challenging the governor's right to approve gambling projects on Indian land, Mr. Pataki filed a bill that would require the State Legislature to approve Indian gambling initiatives. The move caused confusion: opponents of gambling hailed the decision, while proponents of the Monticello casino pointed out that the Mohawks already had a compact with the state allowing gambling.
"For the first time in years there's a buzz in Sullivan County," said United States Senator Charles E. Schumer, who had lobbied the Interior Department on behalf of the casino project. "I'm going to try to persuade the governor that the state should stand aside and let it happen. This is the kind of shot in the arm this area needs."
The prospect of a casino in Monticello last year touched off a land rush, in which politically connected developers spent more than $40 million snapping up woodland, dilapidated hotels and golf courses. But little construction followed.
David Flaum, a developer from Rochester who has contributed tens of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party, bought the 336-acre Shawanga Lodge property last year. And Louis R. Cappelli, a Westchester developer and another heavy Republican contributor, bought the Concord and Grossingers hotels, two of the most fabled resorts in the Catskills, where thousands of Jewish vacationers were entertained by Danny Kaye, Milton Berle and Eddie Fisher.
Last month, Mr. Cappelli announced that he would build a $500 million resort on the Concord property that he hoped would become a year-round attraction.
Most analysts say that a casino in Monticello would become an immediate attraction, because of its rural setting and proximity to New York City, Westchester and Rockland Counties and northern New Jersey.
"There is a reasonably strong latent demand that would nicely feed Monticello," said Steve Rittvo, president of Urban Systems/Innovation Group, a gambling and leisure consulting firm. "Monticello will be able to scoop up a good portion of the bus market."
For that reason, casino operators in Atlantic City like Mr. Trump have lobbied against the Mohawk venture and provided money for gambling opponents in New York.
Casino revenues in Atlantic City have grown only modestly in recent years, in part because of competition from race tracks in Delaware and large Indian casinos in Connecticut. A Monticello casino would almost certainly restrict any growth in the Atlantic City market, but analysts said it was unlikely to actually cause a drop in revenues.
"There's no question it takes away potential customers and everybody would prefer it not be there," said Jason Ader, an analyst with Bear Stearns. "But I don't see Atlantic City revenues going down because of a Monticello casino."

HEADLINE: Long March Ends in South Carolina, But Little Time Is Left to Lower Flag

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., April 6

 BODY:
By his own estimate, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. of Charleston had walked nearly 275,000 steps when he turned the corner onto Main Street this morning and finally saw the Confederate battle flag that he and hundreds of others had been marching since Sunday to remove.
Since setting out from Charleston, 120 miles away, he had endured death threats, roadside obscenities, wet clothes and blisters so painful that they needed medical attention. And for all that, there was only a slim hope that the state Legislature would vote to remove the flag from atop the Statehouse dome before the end of the year's session. 
 But the mayor seemed energized by the sight of the object of his derision, and there was a new force in his steps as he finished the last few blocks of his protest march and stood under the dome to speak to a crowd that had grown to nearly 2,000, about two-thirds of it white.
"Every religious denomination, every business organization, every civil rights organization, college boards of trustees and presidents and athletic directors, and average citizens, rank and file, have said, remove the Confederate battle flag," Mr. Riley told the crowd. "And our Legislature, with only a few more days left in the legislative session, hasn't even begun to debate the bill. They are out of step with the people of South Carolina."
Mr. Riley, a Democrat, chose the long march, with its evocation of civil rights struggle and Gandhian protest, to demonstrate the widespread frustration with the presence of the flag in a position of sovereignty. The mayor, a South Carolina institution who has been popular since taking office in 1975, had hoped to draw attention by marching with civic leaders and well-known football coaches. He attracted nearly 600 marchers on the first day and close to 1,000 on the last leg today.
But the difficulty faced by his cause seemed to be illustrated by the 300 or so counter-demonstrators who waved large Confederate banners on the north steps of the Capitol while Mr. Riley, Gov. Jim Hodges, and others spoke on the south steps. Some of the pro-flag speakers called their opponents "scalawags" and urged them to leave the state. The legislative supporters of the flag have blocked most efforts at a compromise, like moving it to a statue of a Confederate general near the rear of the Capitol, or putting it in a glass case on the Statehouse grounds.
As a result, the deadline for new legislation will pass at the end of this month without even a vote on moving the flag. The Legislature raised the banner in 1962 during the centennial of the Civil War and kept it up as a gesture of defiance to the civil rights movement; now only the Legislature can remove it. But several strongly pro-flag legislators have used every parliamentary procedure at their disposal to block the compromise bills, and now there are only nine working days left in this year's session to get a bill onto the floor.
The Senate did make some progress on the issue today, voting to put a compromise bill at the top of the agenda, meaning it could be debated and voted upon next week, then sent to the House. But legislators said they did not know if there were enough votes to stop a filibuster, should one of the opponents of compromise begin one.
If the issue is not resolved this session, the statewide tourism boycott imposed by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in January could continue for another year, with potentially serious economic consequences. Tourism officials told the governor on Wednesday that the state was losing hundreds of conventions and countless vacation trips because of the N.A.A.C.P. boycott and the growing image of the state as intolerant. Business leaders, who have been in the forefront of the anti-flag effort, have said another year of the boycott could be ruinous. Even the Columbia police chief, Charles Austin, said today that he hoped a compromise would be reached soon, because he was worried about public safety in the city if the marches continued.
Mr. Hodges, a Democrat who favors a compromise, has not said whether he would call a special session if the Legislature does not act. But he accepted the palmetto-tree state flag that Mr. Riley carried with him from Charleston, and said he hoped that the passionate feelings demonstrated by the march would change a few votes inside. "Anytime a legislator looks out the window and sees this kind of crowd, it has the potential to change their mind," he said in an interview.
In his speech today, before he took off his cracked sneakers and prepared for a rest, Mr. Riley, 57, listed what he said were the hateful uses of the Confederate battle flag over the years, like its use as a symbol of the Dixiecrat Party that split from the Democrats in 1948 over civil rights. (A statue of the Dixiecrat leader, Senator Strom Thurmond, stood near the Capitol with its back toward the rally.)
But the matter was more immediate to Gail Jones, a black woman who walked every step of the march alongside the mayor. As the manager of a Circle K convenience store a few blocks from the Statehouse on Main Street, she has to see the Confederate battle flag every day.
"I'm tired of having to lower my eyes every time I go to work," Ms. Jones said. "I just don't want to see it anymore, and that's why I marched."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 8, 2000, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about efforts to have the Confederate battle flag removed from the South Carolina Statehouse referred incorrectly to the remaining possibility of a Legislature vote this year. Efforts by supporters of the flag may prevent a vote before the deadline for new legislation, at the end of the month. But it is not certain that they will succeed.

HEADLINE: An African Tragedy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
An April 1 editorial describes the dynamics that have led to tragic reprisals against environmental activists. It is even more tragic that the next such crisis could be financed by the World Bank.
The State Department's 1999 human rights report had a litany of human rights abuses by Chad and Cameroon, including extrajudicial killings, "disappearances" and female genital mutilation. Yet the World Bank is poised to lend $300 million to them and to the Exxon Mobil Corporation and the Chevron Corporation to develop oil fields in Chad and build a pipeline to Cameroon. 
 Political corruption in the two countries makes it unlikely that any pipeline revenue will pay for programs for the poor, which the World Bank touts as its primary mission. More likely are loss of land, environmental degradation and worsening repression.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
China's No. 1 Oil Company Goes Public With Whimper

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 7

 BODY:
Stalked by protestors, spurned by investors, and star-crossed by a fickle market, China's flagship oil company, PetroChina Ltd., plodded through its first day of trading in Asia, closing 5 percent below its offering price on a day when the Hong Kong market rose.
The company's shares fell today on the New York Stock Exchange after closing unchanged in their first trading session on Thursday. PetroChina's American depository shares closed today at $15.1875, down $1.25. 
 PetroChina has been singed by a political firestorm surrounding its initial public offering in the United States. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. led a patchwork alliance of labor unions, Republican lawmakers and Tibetan monks who accused the company of human-rights abuses and of planning sweeping layoffs in China.
But in Hong Kong, where the protests were a sideshow, analysts said PetroChina was handicapped by the market's indifference to companies that deliver their product through steel pipes rather than digital ones.
"Investors are focusing on high-tech dreams," said Andrew Look, a director at Prudential Portfolio Managers (Asia) Ltd. "This is an old-economy animal. For investors looking for action, they are going to look elsewhere."
PetroChina's chilly reception bodes ill for other Chinese state-owned companies that plan to issue shares later this year. Among them are two other old-style companies, Sinopec, the second-largest oil producer, and the China National Overseas Oil Company, the No. 1 offshore oil company. Only China Unicom, the second-largest telecommunications company, may catch the wave of technology investing.
Some fund managers said they expected that the offerings of Sinopec and China National Overseas Oil would be delayed. Moreover, they warned that the protests coordinated by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. could be mounted against other Chinese companies with close ties to the government.
"At this point, it is more of a nuisance than a threat," said T. L. Tsim, an independent analyst. "But if the Nasdaq and the Dow were to drop 1,000 points, the unions will feel they are fighting for the lives of their workers. It could turn ugly all of a sudden."
Trading in its home country did little to help PetroChina. Its performance here was actually worse than on the New York Stock Exchange, where the company's American depository shares closed at $16.4375 on the first day of trading Thursday. That was the price at which they were offered last week.
In Hong Kong, PetroChina's stock closed at 1.21 Hong Kong dollars, or 15 cents, a share, in brisk trading. That is 5 percent less than the offering price of 1.28 Hong Kong dollars, or 16 cents.
Goldman Sachs & Company, PetroChina's principal underwriter, bought shares in both markets to prop up the price. But its intervention did little more than cushion the losses in Hong Kong. Goldman had already scaled back the size of the offering from $7 billion and set the share price at the low end of its predicted range.
It also had to drum up support from investors like BP Amoco, which bought 20 percent of the shares for $578 million, and three Hong Kong property developers, who together invested $350 million. In the United States, a coalition of human-rights groups and groups concerned about Tibetan issues said they would organize a boycott of BP Amoco's gas stations to protest the investment.
Still, executives close to PetroChina are looking on the bright side. Two weeks ago, the company was fending off charges that its parent, China National Petroleum, was plundering the environment in Tibet and aiding an outlaw regime in Sudan. Now the company has raised roughly $3 billion -- in a week when both the New York and Hong Kong markets were seesawing wildly.
In that respect, PetroChina's initial public offering is reminiscent of another Goldman-led offering, for China Telecom. That company, China's largest telecommunications provider, began trading a few days after the Asian currency crisis tore through Hong Kong's market in October 1997. After a nail-biting debut, China Telecom traded solidly and raised $4.2 billion.
PetroChina also fared better than China National Overseas Oil, which was forced to cancel its $2.5 billion offering at the last minute in October because of anemic investor response. Analysts said the underwriter, Salomon Smith Barney, priced the shares too high. Goldman, they said, learned from that example.
"This stock was priced very cheaply," Mr. Look of Prudential Portfolio Managers said. "A lot of its performance will depend on oil prices. But eventually, it will be a benchmark stock and every asset manager will have to have it in his portfolio."

HEADLINE: New Premier Predicts a 'Rebirth of Japan'

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 7

 BODY:
In his first policy speech before Parliament, Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori vowed today to continue and expand the economic and other reforms started by his ailing predecessor, Keizo Obuchi, who is in a coma after suffering a stroke on Sunday.
"In the wake of Mr. Obuchi's illness, I was unexpectedly appointed as prime minister," Mr. Mori said. "I believe it is divine intervention that I succeed Obuchi, and I will carry forward his policy aspirations and strive to develop them further." 
 Mr. Mori, who took the reins of government on Wednesday, described a variety of broad policies that he said would bring about a "rebirth of Japan," which is struggling to overcome a stubborn recession, record unemployment and widespread corruption.
He said he was willing to undertake necessary reforms, some of them painful, to revive the economy and create new jobs. "I intend to do my utmost to place the economy firmly on the path to real recovery," he said. "I am ready to share the pain with the Japanese people."
Mr. Mori promised to improve social welfare, carry out regulatory reform and promote information technology as a catalyst for growth.
He also pledged to strengthen ties with the United States and Asia and to work hard to ensure the success of the eight-nation economic summit meeting in Okinawa in July.
But most of Mr. Mori's 15-minute address this afternoon simply duplicated Mr. Obuchi's policy agenda, and the new prime minister offered no specific programs or initiatives to lift the country out of its worst economic slump since World War II.
Under Mr. Obuchi the government began slowly opening its markets to foreign competition, companies began downsizing their payrolls and Parliament approved a huge economic stimulus program.
The economy has shown some signs of improvement, although unemployment reached a record high of 4.9 percent in February and growth has been weak.
Mr. Mori, who reappointed all of Mr. Obuchi's cabinet members, is widely considered a caretaker prime minister until new elections, which must be held by October.
In his speech today, Mr. Mori gave no indication of when he planned to call elections. The opposition wants them held soon, but leaders of the governing Liberal Democratic Party have said they would prefer to wait until the Okinawa conference is over.
Some political analysts, and legislators from both sides, criticized Mr. Mori's parliamentary debut, saying it lacked substance.
"It was a very hollow speech, empty and irresponsible," said Minoru Morita, an author and political commentator. "In the past, prime ministers always tried to show their own flavor or individuality, even if they inherited their predecessor's cabinet. Mr. Mori didn't try to show any color of his own."
Hiroshi Hase, a governing party lawmaker and former professional wrestler who like Mr. Mori is from Ishikawa Prefecture in central Japan, said the speech left him disappointed. "The prime minister only talked generally about economic structural reforms, but I wanted him to elaborate and go into more detail," Mr. Hase said.
Some government officials and members of Mr. Mori's party acknowledged that the prime minister's speech lacked originality but said it would be gratuitous for Mr. Mori to propose major new policy initiatives so soon after taking office.
Moreover, major changes to the budget for 2000 are virtually impossible now that the spending package has been put in place, the officials and lawmakers said.
Mr. Mori said it was important for his party to maintain its coalition with two others, New Komeito and the new Conservative Party, which was formed after the Liberal Party fled the alliance last week. Mr. Mori, who is known to be a shrewd dealmaker, is credited with keeping the large coalition intact despite the parties' widely varying policies and agendas.
Expressing regret about a recent series of corruption scandals in the police and public security forces, Mr. Mori called on public servants to improve their ethics and discipline. A former education minister, Mr. Mori also promised to undertake educational reforms.

BRITAIN: LORD ARCHER ARRESTED
The millionaire novelist and peer Jeffrey Archer was arrested and released on bail in connection with a sexual scandal that forced him to resign last fall as the Tory candidate in next month's London mayoral election. Lord Archer, 59, stepped down when it emerged that he had persuaded a friend to lie in court in his $800,000 libel case in 1987 against The Daily Star. The paper, which said he had sex with a prostitute, wants its money back. Warren Hoge (NYT) 

AUSTRIA: CITIZENSHIP BOOM
Austrian citizenship was given to about 25,000 foreigners in 1999, up 38.7 percent from 1998, Austria's statistics agency said in a report. Nearly half were of Turkish origin, and some 27 percent were from the former Yugoslavia. Applications for citizenship can be made after four years' residence. The new government has pledged to limit the annual number of immigrants to 8,000. Victor Homola (NYT)

Home Minister L. K. Advani said the government is ready for talks with the All Parties Freedom Conference, an association of groups opposed to Indian rule of Kashmir, but conference leaders say they will take part only if Pakistan is included, which India has ruled out. The conference and Pakistan maintain that Kashmiris have the right to vote on whether to join India or Pakistan. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)

Security forces say they killed five foreign militants who were involved in the massacre of 36 Sikhs in Kashmir, but local residents said two of the exhumed bodies were actually those of missing relatives. The police have been accused of firing into a crowd of Kashmiris protesting the killings, leaving eight demonstrators dead. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)
 
NORTH KOREA, JAPAN: TALKS END
Talks between the two countries on setting up diplomatic relations ended as a dispute lingered over whether Japan should compensate Korea for its colonial domination. After the talks, the first between the two nations on the topic in eight years, North Korea said Japan had agreed to apologize and pay compensation. Japan immediately disputed the claim. The two sides did, however, agree to meet again in Tokyo next month. (AP)

HEADLINE: Ethnic Loyalties at Stake in Bosnian Elections

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, April 7

 BODY:
Bosnian voters choosing municipal officials on Saturday must decide whether to stick with ethnic parties that led them to war eight years ago or heed international appeals and make a change.
In the four previous elections, municipal and national, since the Dayton peace accord was signed in 1995, voters have not significantly weakened the ethnic Serbian, Muslim and Croatian parties that steered the region into war. 
 The United States and its European partners -- which under the Dayton agreement virtually transformed Bosnia into an international protectorate -- are reducing peacekeeping forces and trying to determine whether the expensive effort to rebuild Bosnia is paying off.
"I'm not interested in recommending to my bosses in Washington that they put any money into areas where you have people who are doing all they can to obstruct Dayton implementation," said Thomas Miller, the American ambassador.
"But if we can show some achievement this year, we have the decent chance to convince the American people and leaders to continue the assistance."
Some 3,308 local council and mayoral posts are at stake in the test of strength between ethnic-oriented parties and parties committed to the goal of the Dayton agreement.
International officials hope Bosnia will follow the example of Croatia, where voters rejected the nationalist Croatian Democratic Union of former President Franjo Tudjman in January after nine years, electing a reformist government.
But political analysts like James Lyon of the Independent Crisis Group believe international appeals have little resonance among Muslims, Serbs and Croats radicalized by the war.
"They say to themselves: 'I'm more afraid of the other nationality than of my own crooks,' " Mr. Lyon said. He predicted that except in Muslim-dominated Sarajevo and Tuzla, Bosnians would vote along ethnic lines.
Such voting patterns have long obstructed reconstruction efforts, despite American and European investment of more than $5.1 billion since the Dayton agreement.
Muslim, Croatian and Serbian politicians who remained in power after the war transformed Bosnia into a series of fiefs, monopolizing resources, driving away foreign investors and discouraging refugees from returning to areas controlled by rival ethnic groups. Bosnia's unemployment rate is over 60 percent; corruption is rampant, and more than a million people have been unable to return home.
Nevertheless, the hard-liners' grip on power is strong. Although Mr. Tudjman's party was beaten in Croatia, the Bosnian branch is expected to win most of the races in Croatian areas.
In Bosnian Serb areas, the Serbian Radical Party remains strong, even though international officials have banned it from standing for office. The radicals have called for a boycott, and their newspaper, Greater Serbia, urged supporters to "smash the boxes, destroy the ballots."

HEADLINE: Educators See Merit In Web Site With Ads

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
Eleven years ago, an entrepreneur began Channel One, a television news program that was broadcast to schools and included commercial advertising. The State Board of Regents banned the program as exploitative of classroom time, making New York the only state in the country to shun Channel One.
Yesterday, however, the chancellor of the Board of Regents took a far different position on another proposal that could bring commercials to the classroom. He said that a proposal by the New York City Board of Education to build an Internet site that accepts corporate advertising, in exchange for computer equipment and services, deserves serious consideration as a means of introducing students from low-income families to the new technologies sweeping the country. Such a site could also help address the state's serious teacher shortage by allowing classes to be transmitted over the Internet. 
 The Board of Education's proposal "may require a higher degree of flexibility on our part" than the Regents exhibited regarding Channel One, said Carl T. Hayden, who as chancellor heads the board that sets state education policy.
"In New York City in particular, the teaching shortage is so severe that one of the most crucial ways of dealing with it might be through the use of technology," Mr. Hayden said. "So there may be a compelling need for something like this. But there would have to be ironclad safeguards in place to make sure that children are not exploited."
Mr. Hayden's comments echoed those of teachers and parents of schoolchildren from across New York City, who expressed some misgivings about the commercial aspects of the board's plan but embraced its educational objectives, particularly the idea of offering reduced-price computers to children who otherwise might not be able to afford them.
Reginald T. Brown, a dance teacher at Public School 305 in Brooklyn who also has taught computer classes at the school, said advertisements on the Web site would not bother him.
"The Internet can give students a broader understanding of learning," Mr. Brown said. "It teaches them that learning is not linear, that you can go from way over here to over there in one step. If you have a Web site with commercials on it and the Board of Ed benefits from it and children are benefiting from it, by all means do it. And the technology exists to turn off the advertisements during class time."
But Donald Czajkowski, a former teacher from Staten Island who now works in training programs for the teachers' union, said he thought computers and a Board of Education Web site should be paid for in some way other than by exposing children to advertisements.
"The city's got a lot of money, and New York State has got a lot of money," Mr. Czajkowski said. "These computer companies could afford to take a little bit of a loss and donate the computers. That would be a way for them to invest in their future employees and their future customers."
The proposal, developed over the last nine months by a task force that included Board of Education officials and representatives from technology companies, including I.B.M., Cisco Systems and Toshiba America, will be formally presented to the full Board of Education on Wednesday. The plan anticipates offering laptop computers at a discounted price to all 85,000 fourth-grade students each year.
The cost of the computers, plus e-mail accounts for all 1.3 million students, teachers and administrators, and the design and maintenance of the Web site, known as a portal, would be met through the barter of advertising space on the Web site. In addition, the board would sell advertising space to retailers offering their products for sale to the system's users.
Advertising and commercial interests have encroached ever further into classrooms around the country in the 11 years since Channel One fostered a nationwide debate about commercialism in public schools.
In 1989 and again in 1993, the Board of Regents prohibited the use of commercially sponsored television programs in the state's public schools.
Since then, schools in many other states have adopted the offerings of companies like ZapMe, which gives free computers to schools but requires that the computers accept advertisements of corporate sponsors in the screen margins.
Even in New York, the door has been opened slightly. The State Legislature recently gave schools the ability to sign contracts with soft-drink companies allowing the companies to pay schools for exclusive rights to sell soda in school buildings.
"I didn't like that one either," Mr. Hayden said. "But keeping a perfectly pristine position on this might be impracticable."
Irving S. Hamer, the Board of Education member who oversees the task force that developed the plan, said that any advertisements on its Web site would be separated from the educational content, a factor that Mr. Hayden said would be significant in how the Regents view the proposal.
In addition, he said, parents would be given the ability to opt out if they did not want their children to receive e-mail messages, and there would probably be some sort of filters made available to parents to keep children away from pornography that is available to anyone with Web access.
That gives some reassurance to Maria Torres, whose child is in the first grade at Public School 75 in the Bronx. "I know that in school they are starting to teach kids things about how to make it in the business world, and they should be learning about using computers and the resources there," she said. "But a fourth grader needs to learn how to go to a library or a bookstore and look things up, not how to buy a book online."
Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said the proposal represented a difficult choice for teachers. "I don't like the commercial part of this and exposing kids to it when they are a captive audience," she said. "But do we then deny kids what they absolutely need in order to be competitive in a global economy?"

HEADLINE: Old-Style Protesters Seize on a New Fervor;
Graybeards of the Radical Movement Use Police Brutality Rallies as a Forum

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO 

 BODY:
These days, when New York's streets beckon and protesters gather, Joel Meyers arrives with a 9-foot-wide crimson banner demanding freedom for a death-row inmate who killed a Philadelphia police officer. Bill Davis, 57, an avowed Communist, appears to circulate the party's newspaper, The People's Weekly World.
And then there's Gary Phaneuf, 44, who at 6 feet 6 inches towers over fellow protesters and attends demonstrations with one thought in mind. "We're out here to make socialist revolution," said Mr. Phaneuf, a disciple of Trotsky who was arrested on assault charges at one recent demonstration. "We don't beat around the bush." 
 Fervent about their causes and determined to make their point whenever and wherever they can, these protesters and others from a divergent cross section of the city's radical organizations have long trudged out to demonstrate on myriad issues, more often than not in the face of lagging passions and dwindling interest. But now, with the city in the midst of a series of loud, large protests against police brutality, they are hitting the streets again, energized and looking for opportunity.
"They have their finger in the wind, and they know what's happening on the activist front," said Jeff Goodwin, a sociology professor at New York University who studies the city's social movements. "They know where the big demo is going to be. They show up with their newspapers, try to sell it and get their point across. And if they're really lucky, they'll find someone who will come to their meetings and, who knows, join up with the group."
The radicals -- many of them white men in their 40's and 50's who cut their teeth in the heyday of protests, the 1960's -- remain a distinct minority among the young black and Hispanic New Yorkers protesting over the acquittal of four officers who fatally shot Amadou Diallo and subsequent shootings in which undercover officers killed unarmed black men, Malcolm Ferguson and Patrick M. Dorismond.
But the protests, which are attracting hundreds of passionate young people outraged about police tactics and looking for solutions, have provided a forum for radicals to draw a link between police brutality and what they see as the failings of American society. And for some, the hope is that the demonstrations will amount to something more.
"We're always looking for one issue that can spark something, that can sustain on ongoing movement," said Scott Scheffer, 45, a bookkeeper and member of the International Action Center, a liberal organization founed by former Attorney General Ramsey Clark. "It could be that this is the thing that does it. It's exhilarating to see so many people out there. That's the fun part for me. People are angry and they're emotional and they want to do something."
At a rally on Wednesday in Union Square Park organized and attended mostly by college and high school students, Mr. Davis worked the crowds, passing out the Communist Party's paper and sidestepping other radicals handing out their literature. "People's Weekly World," he announced, a bundle of papers under his arm. "Pages 4 and 14. Giuliani is out of control. That's about police attack at the Dorismond funeral."
Mr. Davis, a member of the Communist Party for 29 years, has a snow-white beard and red suspenders that put him in sharp contrast to the youthful crowd, who listened as hip-hop artists and fiery poets railed against the police. But many took his newspaper, thanking him and making small talk that left him beaming.
"I know you don't get a lot of discussion when you're handing out the paper," he said. "But some of the people look at the paper and come back and call up and then you have discussions. This is really to attract their attention."
Whether the effort is having lasting effect, though, is another story.
"These folks are part of the landscape; I don't see them as a significant part of the landscape," said Gregory Tewksbury, a professor at the New School for Social Research, who is working on a book about education and social movements. "I think that for a lot of people they tend to sort of not make a lot of sense and, hence, not make a lot of impact."
Richie Perez, a founder and one of the leaders of People's Justice 2000, the grass-roots group that has organized Manhattan protests that attracted hundreds after the Diallo verdict, said that some of the older radicals had seemed out of place at some of the demonstrations. At a Bronx rally, he said, two radicals shouted about the evils of capitalism.
"At that moment, Wall Street and capitalism were far from what people were thinking of," said Mr. Perez, 55, a former member of the Young Lords, a militant Puerto Rican group of the 1960's. "They were outsiders in this community, and they didn't understand this and respect the sentiments of the people."
The visibility of the veteran protesters has also brought hostile words from City Hall.
After demonstrators and the police clashed in Brooklyn at the funeral of Mr. Dorismond, the Haitian-American security guard shot in a tussle with a plainclothes officer, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said "demagogues" with "political and divisive purposes" in mind had touched off a melee in which 23 police officers were hurt and 25 arrests were made. The police said a variety of traditional leftist groups, as well as some newer grass-roots organizations, had instigated the violence.
One of those arrested was Mr. Phaneuf, who was captured on a police video hovering over an officer who had been pummeled to the ground, according to a law enforcement official who viewed the tape. Though he denied hitting the officer, Mr. Phaneuf has remained strident. In an interview, he said that taking chances was a part of protesting. "Maybe you'll get arrested and maybe you'll get beat up and maybe you'll get killed, but it goes with the territory."
Many of the older radicals scoff at the mayor's accusations, saying that they disavow violence and that the police are at fault.
"The mayor has been seeing reds all over for several months now," Mr. Davis said.
Mr. Davis said he hoped to link the problem of police brutality to economics, and to suggest that socialism could end inequality and racism in America. "We want to bring that idea to the people that this oppression by the police is related to the economics of the country," he said.
Dr. Goodwin said such views did not mean that the old-time leftists were not sincere about the latest cause, fighting police brutality. "I think it would be wrong to see them as simply as parasites or opportunists who don't care a whit for the particular issues that are being protested," he said. "They are serious people. I don't think it's incompatible to say that they are truly opposed to police brutality and they also have ulterior motives."
Robert Lederman, 49, a street artist who has protested for years against Mayor Giuliani's policies, often arrives with dozens of placards caricaturing the mayor as Hitler, complete with the Fuhrer's mustache. Ron Painter, coordinator of the Workers Committee for Self-Defense, comes armed with a newsletter, "Fighting Words," which calls for mass labor disruptions. And Mr. Meyers, 56, the demonstrator with the crimson banner, is steadfast in his belief that Mumia Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther, is unjustly on Pennsylvania's death row.
The veteran protesters are an eclectic mix. Hillel Cohen, 50, of the well-organized International Action Center is a researcher at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Another, Bill Doares, 45, of the Workers World Party, is a copy editor for a magazine. Greg Dunkel, 59, who calls himself a "Marxist radical" interested in Haitian issues, is a data processor.
What sets them apart is that free time is spent in meetings with like-minded radicals, perhaps not plotting the overthrow of the country but still looking to shake things up. They devour newspapers and political tracts and keep an ear tuned to stations like WBAI, which has a large black audience and adheres to leftist political causes. "I really do feel that that my mission in life is what I do after work," said Mr. Scheffer, who said he came to New York in 1987 because it was a hotbed of activism.
Mr. Davis, a father and homeowner from Queens, said he had loads of time to spare since retiring as a social worker. He prefers spending it at Communist Party headquarters on 23rd Street or participating in protests, he said.
"It's a lot more fun than spending 50 hours a week selling aluminum siding," he said. "And when my wife says I'm spending too much time doing this, I give her a list of all the bad habits I don't have. I don't gamble. I don't drink to excess. I don't run around with other women."

HEADLINE: A Cartel for Doctors

 BODY:
The House is preparing to vote on a bill that would permit independent physicians to bargain collectively with health plans -- in effect to form a union -- even though they do not work for a common employer or work together in any other way. This is a terrible idea. The bill would invite doctors to form cartels, jack up prices, boycott health plans and exploit consumers in ways that are permitted to no other independent businessmen in the economy. The legislation may induce physicians to pour contributions into the campaign chests of politicians during an election year, but patients would suffer the nasty consequences. That is why the Consumer Federation of America, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and many leading antitrust authorities oppose the measure.
The legislation, proposed by Tom Campbell, Republican of California, has already sailed through the Judiciary Committee. It would permit independent doctors to bargain collectively to negotiate fees and working conditions with health plans. The purpose of the bill, says Mr. Campbell, is to put doctors in a better position to negotiate better deals when they go up against huge health insurers. 
 But doctors do not need the artificial help. Individual health plans rarely dominate regional markets. In urban areas, a single health plan typically accounts for less than 10 percent of patients. Doctors can avoid doing business with a plan they do not like.
Salaried physicians are already allowed to form unions, and tens of thousands have already done so. What is new, and dangerous, about the Campbell bill is that it would extend this right to independent doctors. That would give doctors the ability to conspire to fix prices and engage in other types of anti-competitive behavior, such as collectively refusing to provide services to a health plan that tries to drive a hard bargain. That could force the health plan to succumb and guarantee that patients would pay substantially higher prices for medical services.
The obvious consequence will be to raise insurance premiums. Physician unions could also be used to stymie health plans that try to weed out doctors who practice bad medicine.
Current laws already permit physicians to act cooperatively when it benefits patients. Doctors can, for example, coordinate efforts to raise standards of medical care and form networks to improve care. By contrast, the cartels envisioned by Mr. Campbell would victimize consumers.

HEADLINE: Methane Boom in Wyoming Proves to Be Mixed Blessing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: GILLETTE, Wyo.

 BODY:
An energy boom is roaring through the Powder River Basin here in northeast Wyoming. Methane Madness, some locals call it. Others compare it to the Gold Rush. It is a race to some of the richest methane gas deposits in North America, in a place industry executives call "the Saudi Arabia of coal."
In varying degrees, the boom is affecting 25 other methane-producing states as the nation's demand for cleaner, cheaper fuels intensifies. But nowhere is the impact more pronounced than in Wyoming, where low taxes and a shrinking population are causing a bleak fiscal outlook for the state government. 
 Here, the scramble to extract methane is viewed as crucial to the state's ability to prop up its budget and so maintain services. At the same time, however, it is markedly changing the face of 25,000 square miles of rugged prairie where livestock and wildlife far outnumber people.
In so doing, it is touching nerves already frayed by long battles between the owners of land and the owners of minerals below it. They are often different people, and that means mining can frequently proceed even if the owners of the surface land object.
Now the methane rush is driving a wedge between those who applaud the economic benefits of mining and those who say it is not only damaging the land but also squandering the region's most precious resource, clean water.
Methane, the chief component of natural gas, is mined here in a process that entails flushing millions of gallons of water out of coal seams along with the methane itself. That displacement, some scientists fear, will destroy ancient aquifers and surface ecosystems and dry up water sources that ranchers and their livestock depend on.
Ten years ago, there were fewer than 50 methane wells in the Powder River Basin. Now, with cheaper drilling technology and a growing demand for cleaner-burning fuels, Wyoming has issued permits for nearly 11,000 wells, almost half of which are in production. Industry officials predict that the number could reach 50,000 in a decade, a growth rate higher than those forecast for the 25 other methane states, including Colorado, Texas and Alabama, which boast high-production sites.
"It's terrible what they're doing," said Mary Brannaman, pointing to gas pumps and new gravel roads lining the 500-acre ranch near the town of Sheridan where she and her husband, Buck, train horses. "We didn't want any of this. It was absolutely beautiful back here. They can't just come in here and rob the earth. My maternal instinct tells me that it's not good."
Even lawmakers who concede that Wyoming needs every tax dollar the energy companies generate say the development may be too rapid.
"We depend on the minerals, but we haven't addressed the problems of water," said State Senator John Schiffer, a Republican whose district includes the western side of the basin. "We need to do hydrology studies, but I'm afraid we're a year, maybe two years, behind the curve on this."
In Montana, where the basin juts into a small slice of the state's southeast, officials are reaching the same conclusion. The Montana Board of Oil and Gas has agreed to stop issuing any new permits until a state court hears arguments on an environmental group's request to conduct a study of the mining's impact on the area. The ruling does not affect production on 260 permits already granted.
Here in Wyoming, Mr. Schiffer said, state officials are watching water issues closely. But any legislation that would slow production is not expected. As more localities and industries around the country convert from coal-burning plants to natural gas, methane is playing a larger role. Experts say the use of methane is expected to double within a decade or so, and reserves from the Powder River Basin could last 30 years.
For the state -- the most sparsely populated in the country and one of the few with no personal income tax -- the taxes from gas production, as well as the royalties that the state gets for the mining of that small part of the underground gas that it owns, are generating an increasing amount of revenue: more than $231 million in 1998, 13.6 percent of the budget, from $187.7 million four years before.
And many of the state's residents benefit more directly, although they frequently have no choice, lacking the right to refuse development unless they own not only the land above the methane but also the mineral rights themselves.
Robert Sorenson, whose family owns a 5,000-acre ranch outside Gillette that is being mined for methane, said they would receive $35,000 from the company building a pipeline across the ranch, in addition to royalties paid to people who own the mineral rights on their properties.
The Sorensons, whose ranch has been in the family since 1908, are relatively lucky. The majority of property owners in the basin do not own rights to all the minerals below, a common Western circumstance that dates from homesteading days, when the federal government retained mineral rights as a condition of land transfer. Over the years, mineral rights below many properties have been sold separately from the sale of surface land, creating what isknown as "split estates."
In the Powder River Basin, the federal government still owns about 58 percent of the rights, individuals about 36 percent, and the state the remaining 6 percent. And if a property owner who has no mineral rights refuses to sign an agreement with the company that has leased them, the company can post a bond with the federal or state government to begin development.
Sometimes, as in the case of the Sorenson ranch, rights to minerals beneath a given stretch of land are held by a variety of people. Mr. Sorenson said he and his family shared mineral rights to 800 acres with people they did not know. That means that even if the Sorensons had refused the deal their partners signed with Pennaco Energy, the Denver company that is mining the gas, production would have proceeded.
"You really have no choice," Mr. Sorenson said.
Many people in the basin contend that no amount of money is worth the impact that methane mining is having on their lives and land, even with assurances by drilling companies that the land will be restored when gas supplies are exhausted. They resent that their rolling hills are now dotted with gas drills, heavy trucks, bulldozers, new roads, piles of pipes, ditches to accommodate them, and reservoirs freshly dug to hold some of the water pumped out in the mining process.
By far, however, the greatest concerns involve water. At current methane production levels, gas companies are routinely pumping out 500,000 barrels -- 21 million gallons -- of water a day, much of it potable. Some is piped into new reservoirs. Some is sent into nearby creeks and streams. Some is added to existing ponds. Some is siphoned off to seek its own level, creating bogs and swamp. Some finds its own release point: when methane drilling started miles away from Forest Dunning's home, water began shooting up a venting pipe that was installed on his property years ago to monitor gas movement from coal mining.
Wherever the water goes, said Walter R. Merschat, a geologist from Casper who has studied the hydrological impact of methane drilling, scientists do not yet know the long-term consequences of its displacement from underground havens where it has remained for tens of thousands of years, or how long it takes to build up there again.
"We're just beginning to feel the effects of all this," Mr. Merschat said. "But from what I've seen, it's not the right thing to do for good water."
With greater frequency, state and industry officials are being made aware of citizen concerns through environmental organizations, like the Powder River Basin Resource Council, which are beginning to organize protests. One occurred in late March in Denver, where demonstrators disrupted a symposium on methane production to demand that energy companies mine fewer wells in the basin and stop dumping ground water onto the surface.
Some state mining restrictions already address water issues, and after a protester interrupted a speech by Paul M. Rady, president and chief executive of Pennaco, on production in the Powder River Basin, he assured the audience that energy companies were operating responsibly. "There are laws and regulations in place," Mr. Rady said. "We and other industry players abide by them."
For the state, the balancing act remains a fragile one, the concerns of the basin's residents weighed against the needs of an industry that is contributing mightily to Wyoming's economic growth at a time when legislators are resisting new taxes.
"The development has been faster than we probably prepared for," said Gary Beach, administrator of water quality for the state. "As a result, the last couple of years have been a learning curve for us. We feel we have taken giant steps to reach a balance with the right level of protection. But at the same time, we don't want to impose unreasonable burdens on the industry."

HEADLINE: Bush, in Reversal, to Meet With a Gay Republican Group

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 7

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush said today that he had invited a small group of gay Republicans to talk with him at the governor's mansion in Austin, Tex., next week, a development that stood in contrast to his longstanding refusal to meet formally with the Log Cabin Republicans, a leading gay political organization.
The gay Republicans who are scheduled to visit the Texas governor are not representatives of the organization. In fact, a spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans complained today that Mr. Bush would be sitting down with a hand-picked group of gay supporters as a way of avoiding the kind of substantive policy discussion that officials with the organization would like to have. 
 But the simple fact of the planned meeting, which came only after Mr. Bush wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination, hints at the governor's desire to project a more moderate image in the general election than he did in the primaries. Mr. Bush's remarks on the topic today suggested the same interest.
"This is a different time," he said at a campaign stop here this morning, explaining why he was now willing to meet with gays but had previously avoided such an encounter.
"The campaign is over," Mr. Bush added, referring to the primaries. "It's important for me to unify our party. And I welcome the gay Americans who support me, some of whom are members of the Log Cabin Republican club."
The comments by Mr. Bush, who allied himself strongly with social conservatives in the primaries, are part of a pattern of statements, symbols and gestures by which he seems to be trying to inch back toward the center of the political spectrum.
In the last month or so, Mr. Bush has indicated an incrementally greater receptiveness to gun-control legislation and has publicly chastised the National Rifle Association for harsh comments it made about President Clinton. The governor also announced several new education proposals that underscored a federal role in the nation's public schools and more federal spending. And he repeatedly staged or appeared at events that prominently featured minorities.
Early next week, in Cleveland, Mr. Bush plans to make a series of proposals that aides say are intended to help lower-middle-income Americans climb a few rungs higher on the economic ladder.
One of Mr. Bush's aides said the multi-faceted plan that the candidate intends to announce on Tuesday would include ways to help these Americans buy health insurance, an issue that has been conspicuously absent in the governor's series of policy proposals since he began his presidential campaign bid last June.
Mr. Bush's comments today about gay Republicans came at a news conference after a speech he delivered to the National Hispanic Women's Conference in downtown Los Angeles. During his speech, Mr. Bush repeatedly cast himself as a sensitive Republican eager to reach out to all kinds of voters.
He repeatedly dropped Spanish sentences and phrases into the speech. "I want the American dream -- el sueno Americano -- to be available for every willing heart," Mr. Bush told more than 300 Hispanic women. "This great country belongs to you as much as anybody else."
In his news conference, Mr. Bush expressed concern about news reports that a Texas official he appointed to oversee law-enforcement training in the state had made racially insensitive comments in a 1998 legal deposition. The Associated Press reported on Thursday that the official, Charles W. Williams, had said in the deposition that terms like "porch monkey" were not racial slurs.
Mr. Bush said he had not heard about the deposition until late Thursday and wanted to learn more about it before saying what he thought should happen to Mr. Williams. But he added: "From what I know about the story, they are very troubling comments. I don't accept racism in any shape or form. And, at the very minimum, he ought to apologize."
Mr. Bush did not go into much detail about his planned meeting with gay Republicans, which was largely set up by Charles Francis, a gay public relations consultant in Washington who is the brother of James B. Francis Jr., chairman of the Texas Department of Public Safety. Jim Francis has been a fund-raiser for Mr. Bush for many years.
Charles Francis said in a telephone interview that he would be among a dozen gay Republicans visiting the governor's mansion, and that the group included Mayor Jim Stewart of Plattsburgh, N.Y., and former Representative Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin.
The group also includes some officials with state chapters of the Log Cabin Republicans, Mr. Francis said.
He said Mr. Bush had long wanted to meet with gay supporters and seemed more eager now that the primaries were over.
"George and I were talking awhile back," Mr. Francis said in the interview, "and he said, 'Why don't I hear more from gay conservatives?' I said, 'I really look forward to making that happen.' "
Mr. Bush has repeatedly declined to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans, who have expressed eagerness to press him on issues like gay marriage and his willingness to appoint gay people to posts in his administration. The governor has indicated an adamant opposition to gay marriage and has given hazy and sometimes contradictory answers when asked about appointing gay people.
Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans in Washington, said that next week's meeting was an easy way out for Mr. Bush. "He gets to say he's met with gay Republicans," Mr. Ivers said, "but he also picks and chooses people who he knows are eager supporters."

HEADLINE: Job Growth Sets 4-Year Peak Despite HigherInterest Rates

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
Despite five interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve in less than a year and the promise of more to come, the economy continued to barrel along in March, generating more new jobs than it has in any month for more than four years, the government reported today.
The economy added 416,000 nonfarm jobs during the month, the Labor Department said, more than most economists had anticipated and the biggest surge since February 1996, when the number of jobs increased by 454,000. 
 The unemployment rate fell just slightly, but after rounding was reported unchanged at 4.1 percent.
Workers continued to benefit from the tight labor market as employers paid more to attract and keep workers, with average hourly earnings increasing by 5 cents, or 0.4 percent for the month. The rise in wages, while not enough to set off major warning signals about inflation, suggested that some inflationary pressures might be starting to build.
The report somewhat overstated the economy's strength. A good chunk of the new jobs in March -- about 117,000 -- were temporary positions created by the Census Bureau as it set out to count the population. Other technical factors also swelled the count somewhat.
But the numbers did nothing to alter the assumption among investors and economists that the Fed would raise rates again at its next meeting, on May 16, in an effort to slow the economy to a pace that would reduce the risks of inflation.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has repeatedly expressed concern that the declining pool of available workers will eventually set off a spiral of rising wages and prices, endangering an expansion that last month entered its 10th year.
Since there is little evidence of inflation so far, and given that wage increases have not accelerated sharply, most analysts are projecting that the Fed will hold its rate increase in May to a quarter of a percentage point. The central bank's benchmark federal funds target rate currently stands at 6 percent, up 1.25 percentage points since June.
Higher interest rates take at least six months and perhaps as much as a year to have an effect on the economy, and there is little evidence that tighter monetary policy has slowed growth to within the Fed's non-inflationary speed limit of 3.5 percent to 4 percent. The economy grew at a 7.3 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter of 1999, and analysts are predicting that growth in the first quarter may have been as much as 5 percent.
"Taking into account all the special factors that went into the March employment situation, plus the fact that the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1 percent, this latest glimpse at the economy suggests that the Fed will continue its policy of incrementalism," said Kenneth Mayland of ClearView Economics, a consulting firm.
In a speech today, Mr. Greenspan emphasized his growing conviction that an acceleration in the growth rate of productivity -- which among other things is a powerful force in helping keep inflation contained even as wages rise -- is not a temporary fluke.
Continuing huge investments in technology by American businesses "support a distinct possibility that total productivity growth rates will remain high or even increase further," Mr. Greenspan said in a speech that was broadcast via a videoconference from Washington to a group of technology executives in St. Louis.
Mr. Greenspan also repeated his assertion that the Fed has had little choice but to raise rates at a time when the longer term rates set in the credit markets have been rising. To keep its own short term rates down while long term rates are rising, Mr. Greenspan said, would require the Fed to inject money into the economy, a step that would almost certainly fuel inflation.
Mr. Greenspan did not mention today's employment report.
To some economists, the most striking element of the report was its suggestion that the intense demand for workers is drawing more people into the labor force, allowing the labor force to expand at a pace above the growth in the working age population. To the degree that the labor pool is expanding, it would diminish concerns that a lack of workers will inevitably lead to an inflationary surge in employment costs.
Despite the robust pace of job creation, the number of potential workers has actually increased over the last two months, using a measurement often studied by Fed officials in tracking the labor market. The number of people who are unemployed, plus the number of people who are not actively seeking a job but would like one, increased by 124,000 in March after rising by 237,000 in February, according to a calculation by James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.
Noting that the unemployment rate has fallen by 1.5 percentage points over the last four years, economists at Salomon Smith Barney said in a report today that the rate would have fallen much more sharply had it not been for the tremendous influx of new people into the work force.
"By our calculations, if the participation rate had not risen during the past four years, the sharp rise in employment would have cut the unemployment rate to less than 3 percent," the report said. "This suggests that, without the pickup in labor force growth, either employment growth would have slowed or inflation pressures would have intensified."

HEADLINE: SENATE SETS STAGE FOR A MAJOR FIGHT WITH BUDGET PLAN

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
The Senate approved today a $1.8 trillion budget plan for next year that seeks to restrain the growth of government and throws into sharp relief the bruising political battles between Congress and President Clinton in this election season.
The Senate voted, 51 to 45, largely along party lines, to endorse a Republican-written budget blueprint that is nonbinding but is politically significant because it provides a framework for specific spending and tax bills for the fiscal year 2001, which begins Oct. 1. 
 The measure calls for increases in spending on the military and education; cuts or freezes in many other domestic programs; a reduction in taxes by at least $150 billion over the next five years; a new $40 billion prescription drug benefit as a part of Medicare, and paying down publicly held debt with the surplus generated by Social Security.
The Senate measure must now be reconciled with a similar bill the House passed on March 24. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois has expressed optimism that Congressional negotiators can finish their work next week, before lawmakers leave for spring recess.
The emerging bipartisan consensus to wall off the Social Security surplus complicates the goals of both presidential aspirants. It hampers the ability of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to carry out his plan to cut taxes by $483 billion over five years, and constrains Vice President Al Gore's ability to increase social spending.
"There will not be big swings in expenditures in our government and there will not be big swings in tax cuts," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, who heads the Budget Committee.
As the House was forced to do last month, Senate Republicans were put in the awkward position of backing a smaller tax cut than their party's presidential nominee. Mr. Domenici suggested there was no disagreement with Mr. Bush over the size of the tax cuts, and if the governor is elected, a Republican Congress would warmly embrace his plan and try to find more money to bridge the gap between their two plans.
Democrats, however, attacked the budget resolution as a missed opportunity to put the nation's fiscal house in order and address the needs of the most vulnerable Americans. Two Republicans, Lincoln D. Chafee of Rhode Island and George V. Voinovich of Ohio, joined 43 Democrats in opposing the budget bill.
"The Republican leaders turned their backs on a great opportunity to prepare for the future," said Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat. "The American people want us to pass a good budget that helps our families, our seniors, our children and our economy."
President Clinton said in a statement, "This new Republican budget combines bad fiscal policy and a flawed economic strategy."
A few major differences in the Senate and House bills could hinder a quick settlement. House Republicans want the Senate to agree on a strategy to send Mr. Clinton as many as four tax-cutting bills throughout the summer. But Senate Republicans want to limit the number of bills on the Senate floor for fear that Democrats will use them to force votes on issues that could embarrass Republicans.
Indeed, in a week of spirited debate, senators cast symbolic but politically important votes on gun control, the minimum wage, the federal gas tax and military spending.
The way for today's vote was cleared when senators agreed on Thursday to increase the Pentagon's allocation by $4 billion next year, to $311 billion. The agreement resolved an impasse between two Republican military hawks, Ted Stevens of Alaska and John W. Warner of Virginia, and a fiscal conservative party member, Phil Gramm of Texas, who has sought to restrict spending.
Democrats scored political points on several amendments. The Senate approved, by a vote of 53 to 47, a nonbinding resolution calling on Congress to adopt wide-ranging gun control measures by April 20, the anniversary of the fatal shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado.
Senators also approved a measure urging the minimum wage be increased by $1 to $6.15 an hour over two years. In another Democratic victory, lawmakers voted 51 to 49 to break $2.7 billion out of the Republicans' $150 billion tax cut to use for Pell Grants for low-income college students.
In a defeat for the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, senators went on record against reducing the federal gasoline by 4.3 cents a gallon.
In a test vote, senators agreed, 66 to 34, that the budget should not assume that the 18.4-cents-a-gallon federal gasoline tax would be reduced by that amount. Mr. Lott has championed a proposal to suspend that part of the tax, approved in 1993 on a tie-breaking vote by Mr. Gore.
Despite the setback, Mr. Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, said the senator would press ahead with a vote on the measure next week.
Earlier, senators voted, 51 to 49, against dropping a provision from the budget resolution that assumes the government will reap $1.2 billion by 2005 for allowing oil drilling in Alaska's environmentally sensitive Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
On Thursday, lawmakers spent much of the day skirmishing over rival proposals whose main purpose was to embarrass the two parties' presidential nominees.

HEADLINE: Despite Approval, Fate of Catskills Casino Is Murky

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki sits in the eye of a gambling hurricane now that the federal government has given its approval to a long-proposed Indian casino in Monticello.
For decades, the issue of casino gambling has periodically generated fierce debates across the state. But the looming possibility that the St. Regis Mohawks will be allowed to build a $500 million casino next to the Monticello Raceway in Sullivan County has galvanized a broad array of forces, from real estate developers to competing casino operators and antigambling groups. The issue has also split Democrats and Republicans from New York City to Albany. 
 They are now all training their gaze on the governor like a pack of wolves circling a campfire. Mr. Pataki, who has long been supportive of a Monticello casino, has maintained that he has the executive power to approve the casino. But in a move that confounded both sides, he submitted a bill in March that would require the consent of the State Legislature, where, proponents fear, the proposal would very likely die. Mr. Pataki's bill also mandated a local referendum once the proposal was passed by the Legislature.
"This'll be a raging battle in Albany," said Richard Fields, an investment banker active in Indian gambling projects. "The political dynamics will give even the most seasoned lobbyists a migraine."
On Thursday, the Interior Department approved plans for the casino, which would be operated by the Mohawks on a 30-acre parcel put in trust for the tribe, whose ancestral home is on the Canadian border. Only 90 miles from New York City, the complex is expected to employ 3,000 people and draw 9 million visitors.
The proposal now has to be approved by Governor Pataki. But no one is sure what he will do next. "We're going to need some time to go through all this," said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the governor.
The role of the Legislature, however, is up in the air. Lobbyists and politicians in Albany are unsure whether the governor will push for his legislation, or approve the Monticello casino after the Legislature leaves Albany for the summer. Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker and a Democrat who generally supports casinos in depressed areas, said he was unsure whether the governor could act unilaterally and would not comment further.
The Republican majority leader of the Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, who has been opposed to gambling, is against the governor's bill for constitutional reasons. He contends that the State Constitution forbids slot machines, though it is not clear whether that applies to gambling on Indian land.
But Donald J. Trump and other casino operators in Atlantic City have already dispatched lobbyists to Albany to fight the project, while politically connected real estate developers who recently bought land in the Catskills for hotels, conference centers and resorts are counting on the casino.
"I'm one of the biggest property owners in New York, and I think it's going to drain a lot of money out of the city," Mr. Trump said yesterday.
Mr. Trump conceded that he was also concerned about how a casino in Monticello would affect his casinos in Atlantic City. "I don't know what the impact would be," he said, "but I can't imagine it would be positive."
Senator Charles H. Schumer supports the Mohawk casino, saying it would be a "shot in the arm" for the Catskills resort area, while a fellow Democrat, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, has called for a moratorium on casino gambling until the cost and benefits can be assessed.
Niagara Falls, Buffalo and Lake George want the same kind of economic boost that Monticello expects, and other Native American tribes in the state want a chance at casino revenues. The Pataki administration, in turn, has used the possibility of new casinos as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the Mohawks, Oneidas and other tribes who claim ownership of thousands of acres in central New York.
"This decision will reshape the global relationships between the administration and other Indian nations," Mr. Fields said. "It will also be watched carefully by the other resort communities pressing for gambling as an economic catalyst."
Gambling opponents who criticized the governor in newspaper advertisements for what they described as his pro-gambling stance are warily waiting for what happens next.
Governor Pataki has long said that Indian casinos could provide a real boost for resort areas like the Catskills, Niagara Falls and Lake George. He has also maintained that he has the power to approve an Indian casino, without going to the Legislature. But only days after a judge threw out two lawsuits challenging his position, the governor submitted the bill requiring legislative approval and local referendums. Mr. Pataki said at the time that the bill would speed up the approval process by avoiding lengthy legal challenges.
But whether the bill applies to the Monticello project and the Mohawks, who already have a gambling compact with the state, is murky enough that both sides in the debate are claiming victory. The governor's office has refused to issue a definitive statement.
"We saw his legislation as a victory and applauded him for looking at this in the right way," said Tom Hunter, president of the New York Institute for Law and Society, a conservative antigambling group. Mr. Hunter's group has ceased publishing a series of newspaper advertisements attacking the governor and urging Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to reject Mr. Pataki as a potential vice-presidential running mate.
But Gus McDonald, the executive director of the St. Regis Mohawks in Hogansburg, said he was confident the governor would approve the casino without going to the Legislature. He pointed to the last line in the governor's bill, which states that it will apply only to gambling compacts entered into after the legislation takes effect.
"His people have indicated to me that he would have no problem signing the letter," Mr. McDonald said yesterday. "How fast he does it, I don't know."
In Monticello, Mayor Gary P. Sommers, a Republican, was buoyed by the Interior Department's decision this week and undeterred by the maneuvering in Albany.
"The governor needed to protect himself if he's being considered as a national candidate," he said. "I think it was meant to quell the opposition. But I think this will be signed off at the state level very shortly."

HEADLINE: Welfare Fliers Seek Workers To Cover Strike

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Welfare recipients in New York City who are required to work for their benefits received fliers this week inviting them to apply for a new job -- handling security at residential buildings in the event of a strike by doormen and other workers.
The flier, which says that 500 temporary positions are needed to cover a strike, was distributed as one of the notices for jobs in the private sector routinely circulated by the city's Human Resources Administration to welfare recipients doing workfare jobs like park cleanup and filing. 
 But the city said that recruitment for such jobs was against its policies because it would be a form of strikebreaking.
Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the Human Resources Administration, said the administration had been asked by Burns International Security Services to recruit welfare workers "to cover for potential strikers," but that the city had turned down the request. Ms. Sproles said she did not know how the flier could have gotten into the packets given to people in the city's Work Experience Program.
"We'd be very interested in how it happened because that's not our policy to recruit W.E.P. workers to break strikes," she said, adding in a prepared statement, "To our knowledge, the Burns recruitment flier was not placed in any official W.E.P. materials prepared by H.R.A."
The Burns flier, which showed up at city work sites bundled with workfare assignments and recruitment notices, promised potential earnings as high as $848 a week -- for those working 12-hour shifts, seven days a week. Applicants, it stressed, "must be able to handle crowd control, possible aggressive strikers, etc."
Jack Donohue, president of Burns's Northeast Business Unit, said the company had sent the fliers to Business Link, the unit of the city's Human Resources Administration that it has used in the past to recruit welfare-to-work employees, and to other places, including social service agencies dealing with the poor and unemployed.
The security service and landlords said the temporary workers would not be replacing doormen and other building workers whose union contract expires April 20, but rather monitoring who goes in and out of the buildings and keeping the buildings secure while the union workers are picketing.
But union leaders reacted with anger. "It certainly appears to us that this is for strikebreaking purposes," said Bill Meyerson, a spokesman for the union, Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union. "And the city should not be involved in recruiting for this kind of activity."
The applicants must pass a drug test and a background check for felony convictions going back five years and will get 16 hours of security guard training to meet state certification, the company said.
Yolanda Garrett, a Burns employee in charge of strike applicants at the company's recruitment center in Midtown Manhattan, said temporary guards might face protests. "People don't want you to take their jobs," Ms. Garrett said. "You've got to cross the picket line."
One of the applicants in the Burns waiting room yesterday afternoon, a workfare worker with the Parks Department, took that in stride.
"Right now I have no qualms," said the man, who would not give his name. "I have to work. Everyone has some situation, so do I."
Burns is competing with many other security agencies to fill contracts with buildings and property managers around the city. "It would take 500 officers working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to fulfill the temporary contracts I have," Mr. Donohue said, adding that the city's Business Link had provided good job candidates for regular security positions in the past. Business Link, which was set up by the Giuliani administration in 1995 to connect companies in need of workers with welfare recipients in need of jobs, came under criticism earlier this year for recruiting public assistance recipients as telephone psychics for the Psychic Network. After published reports, welfare officials abruptly dropped that effort, which had been going on for nine months.
Veteran workers in the city's more upscale buildings were particularly disturbed by the idea that the city had played a role in the security service recruitment for a strike.
"The city should keep out of it," Vincent Edwards, who has been the doorman at 370 Riverside Drive for 18 years, said when he was told about the recruitment flier. "That wouldn't be fair to the workers."
Outside another Riverside Drive building, Anthony Calnek, director of publications for the Guggenheim Museum, chuckled when he was told about the flier. "The city is recruiting people as scabs?" he said. "So this way, they put welfare people to work -- it sounds like a clever political scheme, but they're still scabs. That would be the bottom line for me."
But Mary Ann Rothman, a member of the realty advisory board who represents more than 2,000 cooperative associations and condominium buildings, said she found the idea of the security services drawing on welfare-to-work recruits "intriguing."
"It probably is not really good for the welfare recipients," she said, noting that the longest strike lasted only 17 days, "but it's a decent opportunity for the security service to meet their obligation."
Stanley Aronowitz, a labor expert, said the scene had been set for this potential use of welfare recipients when municipal unions allowed the city to put them to work in city jobs, undermining union wages and eroding the city's strong tradition of honoring pickets lines.
"For the city to allow this, it's a direct slap not only at this union but at all unions in the city," he said. "Giuliani needs no support from the unions. He basically burned his bridges."

HEADLINE: Essay;
American Beauty (Circa 1955)

BYLINE: By Richard Ford; Richard Ford is a novelist and short-story writer. This essay has been adapted from his introduction to a new edition of "Revolutionary Road," being published later this month by Vintage.

 BODY:
As "Revolutionary Road" approaches its 40th year in print, it seems odd to imagine readers opening it for the first time. So primary and forceful have been this novel's appeal and effects upon two generations of us that to not already know Richard Yates's great book seems incongruous, and handing it over cold feels clumsy, a bit like introducing a sage old friend to a precocious new friend: we almost would rather not, for all the crucial things that cannot be thought and said again. And yet of course we must, since great books, like great friends, are to be shared.
Suffice it to say that among readers of American fiction since the beginning of the 1960's, "Revolutionary Road," published to acclaim in 1961, has become a kind of cultish standard. And this is especially true among writers, who have kept its reputation burnished by praising it, teaching it, sometimes unwittingly emulating its apparent effortlessness, its complete accessibility, its luminous particularity, its deep seriousness toward us human beings -- about whom it conjures shocking insights and appraisals. We marvel at its consummate writerliness, its almost simple durability as a purely made thing of words that defeats all attempts at classification. Realism, naturalism, social satire -- the standard critical bracketry -- all go begging before this splendid book. "Revolutionary Road" is simply "Revolutionary Road," and to invoke it enacts a sort of cultural-literary secret handshake among its devotees. 
 Richard Yates was born in Yonkers, N.Y., in 1926, and died in 1992 in the Veterans Administration Hospital in Birmingham, Ala. He did not attend college after high school; served in the Army during World War II; was twice divorced and was the father of three daughters. For a time after the war he worked as a publicity writer for the Remington Rand Corporation, and for a brief period in the late 60's served as a speechwriter for Senator Robert Kennedy. But for the most part Yates was solely a writer, only occasionally supplementing his income by teaching and by writing for the movies. During his writing life he wrote seven novels (including "Revolutionary Road") and two books of short stories, many of which have been anthologized and are richly admired by readers as models of the form.
Yates -- who was both famously decorous and famously plain-spoken -- once remarked to an interviewer that he felt he had written too little in his life, and that his was the misfortune to have written his best book first. And although over his 30 years of public life as a writer Yates's reputation rose, then fell, then rose again, ultimately distinguishing him as that ambiguous thing, a "writer's writer," one who does not make it (as did his contemporaries Cheever, Updike, Walker Percy) into the permanent, big-money main arena of American literary fashion, it is also true that nothing he wrote came near the achievement and acclaim of "Revolutionary Road," which "lost" the 1961 National Book Award to Walker Percy's novel "The Moviegoer."
The story line of "Revolutionary Road" can be summarized succinctly:
In the spring and summer of 1955, in the western Connecticut bedroom community of Revolutionary Hill Estates, the lives of the young Wheeler family -- April, Frank and two minor children -- become essentially and violently unglued, never ever to be as they were.
To a casual passer-by, the Wheelers' lives might not seem so different from their neighbors' -- the pleasures and anxieties being the available, expectable ones: participation in the community theater group, tipsy, twilight dinners with other like-minded home-owners, easy shots to and from the commuter line, the comfort of being indistinguishably in the culture while staying solidly in command of life's fundamental choices; and -- less cheerily -- a wan inability to keep the frustrations of youth's passage precisely at bay, the fatigue of the workplace grind, the puzzlement of keeping life interesting and vigorous while maintaining the nuclear unit intact.
But into the Wheelers' lives comes much that is not good, even if no single visitation seems exceptional enough to render the whole unsurvivable. Frank and April regrettably harbor little affection for each other. Each dislikes the suburbs and talks about it too much. The children provide the standard trials. Frank's work in the city is, he admits, "the dullest job you can possibly imagine." And April, with too little to do, embarrassingly and publicly fails as a little-theater actress. On top of it all the Wheelers drink too much, are bored stiff by their neighbors, feel vaguely fearful of being cliches, and as a consequence view their future as indistinct but unpromising.
Still, April Wheeler proves resourceful and devises a romantic solution to her and Frank's growing malaise. They will sell their house and move to Paris. There Frank can "find" himself; she can join the secretarial pool at NATO, and the kids can learn French. After that, the future can take care of itself on the cheap, while they gain confidence that life is not being played out in cloying ways.
Only Frank Wheeler has already begun to supplement his unhappy married life by skulking into a tacky office affair with the uncharitably named Maureen Grube. In every way but the stated, he fears the change that April's Paris plans will bring. And for this reason, and contrary to his bitter expressions about his nothing job, Frank allows himself to be coaxed into the "better" job of writing motivational talks for the new sales arm of his company, Knox Business Machines, which is extending its old-fashioned product lines for the new 50's computer age.
Plans, however, proceed toward selling the house. Frank's office liaison begins, stops, then flares again. His reluctance about moving grows. The children not surprisingly become confused. Frank and April fall into arguments, endure loud, unwanted divulgences, suffer accusations and retractions, slaps to the face, fleeings, returnings, outrages, until their moving plans are abandoned, and with that decision the Wheelers' anchorage to some good life they'd chosen gradually, then swiftly, then suddenly, violently, tragically disappears. All of it seemingly gone in one balmy summer that might have ended well for some family other than the Wheelers.
"The Revolutionary Hill Estates had not been designed to accommodate a tragedy. Even at night, as if on purpose, the development held no looming shadows and no gaunt silhouettes. It was invincibly cheerful, a toyland of white and pastel houses whose bright, uncurtained windows winked blandly through a dappling of green and yellow leaves. . . . A man running down these streets in desperate grief was indecently out of place. Except for the whisk of his shoes on the asphalt and the rush of his own breath, it was so quiet that he could hear the sounds of television in the dozing rooms behind the leaves -- a blurred comedian's shout followed by dim, spastic waves of laughter and applause, and then the striking-up of a band."
In 1961, "Revolutionary Road" must have seemed an especially corrosive indictment of the postwar suburban "solution," and of the hopeful souls who followed its call out of the city in search of some acceptable balance between rough rural essentials and urban opportunity and buzz. Frank Wheeler, the novel's principal character, is 29, already a combat veteran and a Columbia graduate and outwardly a man on the way up. Yet Yates depicts him sarcastically as a compromised, self-important "suit" with "the kind of unemphatic good looks that an advertising photographer might use to portray the discerning consumer of well-made but inexpensive merchandise." In the novel's close notice Frank is a deluded, dissipated bore who imagines himself "as an intense, nicotine-stained Jean-Paul-Sartre sort of man," but is merely an adulterer spicing his talk with literary references while following work so stultifying and meaningless that he even laughs at himself.
April Wheeler is also a youthful 29, though unappreciated by her husband, who sees her as a "graceless, suffering creature whose existence he tried every day of his life to deny." Yates imagines April slightly more charitably -- as a slightly dazed, slightly spoiled, actress wannabe possessing no particular good will for her spouse, who still struggles to set a go-nowhere life onto new rails that will lead her family (or more particularly lead her) to Paris and a main chance at freedom. Yet April finally succumbs to a lack of vigor and becomes complicitous in being lied to, then tricked and demoralized, then driven crazy, and finally done in by circumstances she simply lacks the moral vigor to control.
Over the nearly four decades since the publication of "Revolutionary Road," commentators have almost always characterized Yates's novel as "bleak" and his vision of Americans and American life in the suburbs as, in the words of Joyce Carol Oates, people adrift in "a sad, gray, deathly world." Yates himself, never one to pull a punch, admitted to an interviewer in 1974 that he "meant the title to suggest that the revolutionary road of 1776 . . . our best and bravest revolutionary spirit had come to something very much like a dead end in the 50's."
And indeed, a citizenry's urge to break away and form a community based on clear ideas of who the citizens are, what they need and what they're up against is very much the model for correct deportment in Yates's view. Though in "Revolutionary Road" this is precisely the ideal that the suburbs -- monotonous, anesthetized buffer zones between the two more vital life experiences of the country and the city -- manage to trivialize and contaminate. Suburbanites themselves seem but hungry, aimless foragers in pursuit of not a better life but only an easier, less responsible one. None of the characters glimpsed in "Revolutionary Road" have much of a clue about who it is they are. They can't, in fact, admit it fast or often enough. All are walking paths laid out by forces and authorities other than their own personal senses of right and wrong: Convention. Habit. Disengagement. Mammon. Escape. "He couldn't even tell whether he was angry or contrite, whether it was forgiveness he wanted or the power to forgive," Yates's narrator remarks caustically about Frank Wheeler. And as her life is swept along toward the novel's withering climax, April Wheeler, in despair nearly unto death, peers at her neighbor, the feckless Shep Campbell, there in the gloom of a back seat where they've fallen upon each other in a drunken moment of befuddlement and sexual dismay: "Honestly," April says, stating no more than what's obvious. "It's just that I don't know who you are. . . . And even if I did . . . I'm afraid it wouldn't help, because you see I don't know who I am, either."
No one (except perhaps the children) really comes out looking very good in "Revolutionary Road." Even Yates's supporting cast of neighbors, venal business types, blustery bosses, nosy realtors and nut-house residents all seem deluded and discredited, each in her or his own way, disabled as doers of right, or incapable of the sort of affiliations that could weave a fabric of communal spirit strong enough to hold the weak should they falter, or console the despairing when they sound a plea.
Back in 1984, in a not particularly admiring essay about Yates's novels, Anatole Broyard of The New York Times noticed and then complained about what still seems to me a crucial fact about "Revolutionary Road" -- a feature with which I myself have no complaint. "The main question in Mr. Yates's work," Broyard wrote, "is whether we are being asked to see around, or beyond, the characters to some kind of symbolism -- or to take them literally. Are we supposed to forgive their shortcomings and their failures as God does, or are they being offered up as intrinsically interesting without extenuation? Is his perspective metaphysical or entomological?"
Broyard's is, indeed, an issue of particular importance for appreciating "Revolutionary Road." On the one hand Yates's consummate talent for devising and developing the particulars of life-as-lived, his willingness to put his imagination at the service of taking life seriously, his ability to invent plausible human emotion before we can experience it, and then put it to word -- all this would speak for a perspective of man-seen-as-literal-creature. And yet, there is so much in this novel that's sarcastic, comical, mischievous, hyperbolic, as to argue not for the literal but the emblematic -- Broyard's "metaphysical." All these extraliteral names: Mrs. Givings the ungiving realtor; Shep the bird-dogging neighbor; the improbable Oat Fields, Frank's father's Dickensian boss; the implicitly grubby Ms. Grube; even the reeling Wheelers themselves, spinning out of kilter and down the road to disaster. Plus all the archly amplified description that eventually brings everyone into the flattening light of derision and satire, as with the pathetic Mr. and Mrs. Givings, on the day they visit their son in the "home" where he's "resting" up for the travail that will be the poor rest of his life:
"In the outer waiting room of Ward Two A, after they had pressed the bell marked ring for attendant, Mr. and Mrs. Givings shyly joined a group of other visitors who were inspecting an exhibition of patients' artwork. The pictures included a faithfully rendered likeness of Donald Duck, in crayon, and an elaborate purple-and-brown crucifixion scene in which the sun, or moon, was done in the same crimson paint as the drops of blood that fell at precisely measured intervals from the wound in the Savior's ribs."
Moreover, just how bad can it literally be out there in the burbs where Frank Wheeler can dopily muse, "Economic circumstances might force you to live in this environment, but the important thing was to keep from being contaminated" -- and yet where almost nobody's character shows capacity to change, but only to suffer? How unhappy and morally compromised can the Wheelers make each other and stay credible as fellow humans? "He could be grateful in a sense that he had no particular area of interest," the narrator notes, airily sizing up Frank's life: "In avoiding specific goals he had avoided specific limitations. For the time being the world, life itself, could be his chosen field."
In Broyard's creaky terms, "Revolutionary Road" seems to want it both ways -- the "entomological" and the metaphysical; the literal and the symbolic. Broyard felt that in choosing both modes the novel did neither very well. But for my money, by allowing at least two strategies of representing reality to share time, Yates brought to life all the more remarkable a novel; brought us -- through art -- near enough to life's palpable details that we can recognize our own lives, yet preserved for us a distance from which we can exercise moral judgment and be relieved that the Wheelers aren't us.
To me, at 56, 1955 doesn't seem so far away now. And opened fresh today, "Revolutionary Road "manages to testify both to how much in American culture has shifted since the 50's, and how much from that odd time remains lively in our moral imaginations. Everyone in "Revolutionary Road" drinks way too much, and everyone smokes. Pregnant women do both with utter alacrity. Business lunches feature four martinis, and afternoons are sacrificed to trysts with your secretary, followed the next morning by the gentleman slinking in, making nice, but never calling again. Frank Wheeler smacks April around when he gets a little loaded, and April by and large lets it happen. Wives mostly stay near to home, don't earn a paycheck, do not attend consciousness-raising seminars. Business downtown is still Bartlebyesque with offices in big open rooms, "ablaze with fluorescent ceiling lights, that had been divided into a maze of aisles and cubicles by shoulder-high partitions." There are as yet no cell phones, no faxes, no call waiting, and salaries are insufficient for ski weekends in Sugarbush. There is no Sugarbush, no 10-K races, no Outward Bound.
And yet "Revolutionary Road" stands at the beginning of the new computer age, and chronicles its early fascination with empty communication, which has led us to self-absorption, narcissism, megalomania and unwanted e-mail. "It's a completely new kind of job, and we're going to have to develop a completely new kind of talent to do it," brays the bulbous Bart Pollock to the feckless and fearful Frank after knocking back one more big gin. Frank Wheeler is that new man, the heir apparent, "selling the electronic computer to the American businessman," and thus heralding "a whole new concept in business control."
And beyond dubious business ethics, the novel's denouement hangs upon the rather up-to-date dilemma of whether April Wheeler can raise her consciousness enough to nervily defy her husband, break ranks and terminate a pregnancy she fears will ruin her life. Although contemporary readers will shake their heads at the disastrous course April chooses for assuring her future, no one can argue the novel's clear-sightedness and perfect pitch in depicting a transition in modern moral life and in scrupulously calibrating the fearsome human cost attendant to great societal change.
Over the years, few even approving commentators have remarked on what a funny book "Revolutionary Road" is, its black-on-black grimness and serious moral mien perhaps overmatching most critics' comic sensitivity about an era we normally don't think of as chock-full of laughs. And certainly no one comes to the conclusion of "Revolutionary Road" in a state of rollicking high spirits. But comic are unquestionably this novel's means, start to almost finish: arch exaggeration of the smallest human pomposity and social ritual; fatal portraits of marriages gone absurdly bust; surgically accurate cameos of lesser players and unusually cruel assessments of ignorance posing as innocence. Here are the ill-starred Wheelers once again with their "friends" the clueless Campbells, convening another cozy neighborhood intime:
" 'Hi! They called to another.
" 'Hi! . . .' 'Hi!' . . .'
"This one glad syllable, borne up through the gathering twilight and redoubling back from the Wheelers' kitchen door, was the traditional herald of an evening's entertainment. Then came the handshakings, the stately puckered kissings, the sighs of amiable exhaustion --
'Ah-h-h'; 'Who-o-o' -- suggesting that miles of hot sand had been traveled for the finding of this oasis or that living breath itself had been held, painfully, against the promise of this release. In the living room, having sipped and grimaced at the first frosty brimming of their drinks, they pulled themselves together for a moment of mutual admiration; then they sank into various postures of controlled collapse."
There are moments in reading "Revolutionary Road" when I'm made to wonder exactly which human qualities its author would finally sponsor as both virtuous and practicable. What would prove adequate to hold the fabric together long enough to get through life in one acceptable piece? Clearly something more's required than the standard livelihood protocols -- the train, the office, advancement, collegiality -- since all lead to other postures of controlled collapse. Marriage qua marriage is also plainly not adequate. Likewise parenting. Paris -- the old, fragrant dream of freedom -- seems out of reach.
Clearly some more straitened form of life is required, one in which what we say strictly corresponds to what we mean. We also might not care to ask very much of others. And there might not be that much fun around. Indeed, Yates's dark humor seems calculated less to please us than, as with any satire, to soften us up for the sterner truths.
And there's no escaping stern truth here. But goodness knows there's so much along the way to like and admire that, stern truths or no, you're sorry when it's over -- sorry in more ways than one. Mostly "Revolutionary Road" is just so smart and keen and shockingly inventive about everything it turns its imagination to: about being young and blissfully rudderless in New York City before the responsibilities of marriage and family cloud the sky; about entertaining the awful neighbors; about long, long business lunches; about being 30 and feeling middle-aged; about fearing change when you know change is likely to save you; even about the pink light seen through a poor man's earlobe, palely summing up all of humanity's frailty and failure:
"Isn't there any cake?" inquires the recumbent Howard Givings of his dutiful realtor wife. "I thought we still had some of the coconut cake."
" 'Well yes, dear, but you see I thought we'd just have the plain tea today because we'll be having such an early dinner.' She explained all over again about her engagement with the Wheelers, only dimly aware of having told him before, and he nodded, only dimly aware of what she was saying. As she talked she stared in absent-minded fascination at the way the dying sun shone crimson through her husband's earlobe and made his dandruff into flakes of fire, but her thoughts were hurrying ahead to the evening."
If we finally see the Wheelers and their set as strange and remote "50's types" with their smoky Paris reveries, their gooney business pontifications, no-fuss sexual dalliances, their memories of youth and a just war fast receding, we should still, I would plead, let this novel have its way with us. Types always come to us from some fast truth somewhere. And by envisioning the change from one small, not-so-long-ago era to another -- to our very own era, in fact -- Revolutionary Road" looks straight at us with a knowing and admonitory eye, and invites us to pay attention, have a care, take heed, live life as if it mattered what we do, inasmuch as to do less risks it all.

HEADLINE: The Price of Desegregation

BYLINE: By Randal C. Archibold; Randal C. Archibold is a reporter for The Times who has covered education.

DATELINE: ITTA BENA, Miss.

 BODY:
Look for the future of black colleges not on the spartan campus of Mississippi Valley State University, a survivor of near-death experiences that desperately wants the world to know it is alive and has enlisted B.B. King, a native son, to sing its praises in television spots.
Instead, go 10 miles west to Greenwood, cruise down Grand Boulevard past the stately homes recalling plantation days and behold a brick strip mall just shy of downtown. There, amid an insurance office, hair salon and satellite office of motor vehicles, is an extension of Valley, as locals call it. 
 In its handful of classrooms are students like Gregory Wenger, a 42-year-old National Guard soldier, studying organizational behavior in Greenwood en route to a degree in business administration. There is little remarkable about his presence, except perhaps his race, white.
For Mississippi Valley -- like the state's two other historically black public universities, Jackson State and Alcorn State -- finds itself in a seeming paradox. It is celebrating, in a reserved sort of way, the enrollment of 103 white students, who make up 4.5 percent of the student body. In 1991 there were just 5 white students.
Mr. Wenger's presence speaks to the unintended consequences here in Delta Mississippi of a class-action lawsuit filed against the state by Jake Ayers, a black sharecropper, on behalf of his son, Jake Jr., and other minority students.
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the suit, which seeks equal financing and facilities for the state's three black universities. It has come to be known as higher education's Brown v. Board of Education. And like the Brown case, in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that "separate but equal" in public education was unconstitutional, Ayers eventually made its way to the High Court, in 1992.
That was nowhere near the end of it.
With the case dragging on, the governor of Mississippi last month pledged a new effort to resolve it. While in the eyes of the courts a settlement might finally put to rest the vestiges of segregation in Mississippi, the combatants think that, in a cruel twist, what was originally intended as an attempt at equity has in the end caused the black colleges to be shortchanged even more.
Top black students are being lured by predominantly white universities, and the three publicly financed black institutions, whose mission has long been to nurture African-American students, find themselves trying to figure out how to attract more white students.
A result of newly promised settlement talks is likely to influence similar cases that the Justice Department is overseeing in Alabama, Tennessee and Louisiana, which, like Mississippi, legally segregated higher educational institutions into the 1960's. There have been 19 desegregation cases since the flurry of litigation in the mid-1970's involving public education. Most have been in the South and most ended in agreements with the federal Department of Education. In mid-March, the department reached an agreement with the state of Kentucky that, among other things, will provide $13 million for academic and building improvements at historically black Kentucky State University. Negotiations continue with Maryland, Texas and Virginia.
The Ayers suit, filed in 1975, has roots in a 1969 federal directive to the state to draft a plan to eliminate segregation at Mississippi campuses. The state countered that its sole legal obligation was to ensure race-neutral admission standards in its plan. After winding its way through the courts, the case reached the Supreme Court, which ruled that race-neutral policies alone did not ensure the end of segregation. It sent the case back to federal district court, where a judge, Neal B. Biggers Jr., would oversee a more comprehensive plan.
The state, reasoning that a key vestige of segregation was the black colleges themselves, came up with a plan to consolidate the state's eight campuses into four. Mississippi Valley would close, merging with predominantly white Delta State University about 70 miles away. But after vociferous protests by black leaders, Judge Biggers rejected that plan. Instead, he set up "remedies" that included the adoption of uniform admission standards at the eight campuses, instituting new programs at the black universities intended to make them more competitive for white students and issuing "other-way scholarships" that would entice white students to enroll.
Since the decree went into effect in 1996, the state has allocated about $44 million to make improvements to its black colleges and universities, including $5.7 million this year.
It is not enough, says Alvin O. Chambliss Jr., a charismatic lawyer with a preacher's cadence. Mr. Ayers died in 1986; Mr. Chambliss, who was among the original lawyers on the case, powers the suit today. To settle, he wants the state to spend about $300 million and set up professional programs like a law school or nursing program at one or more campuses.
Mr. Chambliss is not alone in his dissatisfaction. The circuitous course the suit has taken and its fallout have left many perplexed.
"They took Brown v. Board of Education and turned it upside down," said Raymond C. Pierce, deputy assistant secretary for civil rights at the Department of Education. "That is a poor product of a supposed desegregation remedy. I don't think anybody would say that it is equity."
The state, says Jimmie Barnes, a social science professor at Mississippi Valley for 29 years, "was able to lose the game but still win the trophy."
Part of the fallout from the plan is that the standardization of admission criteria -- raising the bar at the black universities and lowering it at the white ones -- has led to a decline in the number of black freshmen at the eight campuses. It fell 17.3 percent between 1995 and 1999, to 2,753 black freshmen from 3,332. In the same period, white enrollment increased 2.9 percent, the vast majority at the predominantly white campuses.
Black freshman enrollment also fell at the black campuses. In 1999, 1,588 were enrolled, compared with 2,314 in 1995.
Henry Ponder, president and chief executive of the National Association for Equal Opportunity, a Silver Spring, Md., umbrella group that advocates for historically black colleges, said the results in Mississippi defied the special mission of the institutions.
"We have proven that we can take a child with low test scores and G.P.A.'s and make competent citizens out of them," Dr. Ponder said. "I don't mean high standards are not worthwhile. I just don't think all schools should force students into the same peg hole. We should have respect for individual missions."
Against the backdrop of heightened standards and competition for resources and students, the courts have often questioned the purpose of these colleges.
"They continue to be, I would say, at risk," said Janell Byrd, a lawyer with the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Education Fund who tracks higher education cases. "When state legislators or federal judges look at what to cut, for some reason instead of looking at the institutions as assets, the courts have looked most immediately to black colleges with the attitude like, Do we need these colleges anymore?"
Mississippi Valley State rose from a cotton field off Route 82, inspiring the boosterish title of its official history, "Up From a Cotton Patch," by J.H. White, the university's first president.
As Mississippi Vocational College, it opened in the fall of 1950 in the plantation town Itta Bena, whose name is Choctaw for "little house in the woods." The state acquired the 450 acres for $56,000, but it wasn't long before people began questioning the wisdom of the deal. The Advocate in nearby Jackson wrote that students would have to attend class in boots because the buildings were surrounded by water.
Pretty close. As the current president, Lester Newman, walks the grounds, he points out the flat roofs of the buildings that spring leaks in the Delta's merciless rains and, yes, boots come in handy when downpours turn parts of the campus into a pond.
The campus is virtually bereft of trees. There are no signs of the towering magnolias and lush landscaping at predominantly white showpieces like the University of Mississippi, the flagship campus at Oxford known as Ole Miss. The orange-brick, boxy architecture may have been considered ultramodern in its time but today gives much of the campus the feel of a sterile office park. Its one standout, a new administration building with elegant neo-Classical touches, sits unoccupied because it leaks, Dr. Newman said.
The threadbare landscaping and blandness nag at him. First impressions, after all, count, and prospective students often look for comfortable surroundings and amenities, he said. Mississippi Valley is not exactly brimming with them.
Dr. Newman nevertheless projects an upbeat air. He has vowed to change things. Already, the campus center has opened a few fast-food restaurants. More computers are on the way, to the dorms and library.
He seems on a crusade to banish the word "struggling." Mississippi Valley, in his view, will elude the fiscal grim reaper. Rather than rely on the whims of state legislators for economic stability, the school has embarked on a $25 million fund-raising drive, with B.B. King and the actor Morgan Freeman serving as honorary chairmen. Jerry Rice, the San Francisco 49ers wide receiver who is the university's most often-mentioned alumnus, made an appearance in late March for a ceremony renaming the stadium in his honor.
But Dr. Newman realizes that years of threatened closure have done damage. Overall enrollment -- 2,500 in fall 1999 -- remains well below its peak of 3,300 in 1976. Academic offerings are short on technology and science -- a cherished nursing program was moved to Delta State years ago -- and faculty salaries that average $36,000 to $40,000 are much lower than at the predominantly white campuses, making it difficult to find top-flight faculty.
To attract "other race" students, the euphemism used here to mean white students, the school opened the Greenwood center in 1996. Many of them are nontraditional students taking advantage of the new satellite classrooms to complete their degrees.
Dr. Newman is also completing a plan to address how to further increase diversity, including a program in bioinformatics, which combines computer science and biology, and a master's program in business administration. Dr. Newman also plans aggressive marketing to overcome perceptions that Valley is an inferior university just for blacks.
"Once people see what we have to offer, that will break down barriers," he said.
But Valley faces considerable challenges in attracting white students. It and Alcorn, in Claiborne County, are in isolated, rural areas that draw from heavily black surrounding counties. And although there is a general perception that race relations are on the mend -- Mississippi now has more black elected officials than any other state -- there is no disputing a past rife with killings in the name of segregation. In 1962, the enrollment of James Meredith, the first black student at the University of Mississippi, caused riots on campus that left two dead.
Whether funds will come through for Dr. Newman's ambitions also remains uncertain. He acknowledges that Valley and other black institutions have been shortchanged. "Because of past discrimination, some things are not in place," he said. "If we are to be held accountable, we need resources, and that will take money."
In Dr. Newman's mind, Mississippi Valley will always honor its status as a historically black institution, and it will always have a predominantly black enrollment. It is, primarily, a regional institution, serving students whose relatives or friends have attended. Many, like Carmen A. Wyms, a single mother raising three children, simply wanted a college close to home with a comfortable atmosphere.
"I feel Valley is more family-oriented," said Miss Wyms, a senior. "There is a one-on-one, student-teacher atmosphere."
When she toured Delta State, she said, "I did not feel students were reaching out. Here, there are student mentors."
Miss Wyms, whose mother attended Valley for a year, said she did not know much about its history or that of other historically black colleges. And neither she nor other students seemed to mind the idea of recruiting more white students, though the underlying reason makes some uneasy.
"Will we at some point lose the historic blackness of the colleges?" asked Conswella C. Bennett, a senior and editor of the school paper, The Delta Devils Gazette. "I'm not really sure."
Miss Bennett thinks that as long as black students continue enrolling, the history will be respected, but some wonder why dramatic improvements were ordered to diversify the enrollment.
"Most black students agree there is an underlying feeling we need to attract us as well," she said.
White students like Mr. Wenger said the history of the campus neither deterred nor influenced them. Being in the minority "has not bothered me at all," he said, adding that he works with many black soldiers. Mr. Wenger, who plans to graduate in May, said he was drawn to the university because of pragmatic considerations like convenience and the university's emphasis on class participation.
"It's a more open forum and everyone participates," he said.
Mr. Chambliss, a graduate of Jackson State University who now teaches at the historically black Texas Southern Law School, is ambivalent about the integration issue, always a delicate subject among the black institutions.
None want to move away from their special status and sense of history, but few would argue that they could survive with a solely black enrollment, now that there are so many other opportunities available to black students.
According to the Department of Education, enrollment in the country's 105 historically black colleges and universities rose 20.5 percent between 1976 and 1997 but lagged behind the 40 percent increase at other colleges. At the same time, the proportion of blacks attending these institutions dipped, from 18.4 percent of all black college students in 1976 to 14.5 percent in 1997. Total enrollment was 269,167 in 1997, including 74,500 in private black colleges.
At a time when their leaders seem resigned to the new day that the data point to, Mr. Chambliss is a firm believer in black institutions.
When the conversation veers to political support, his voice rises as if in a sermon: "White liberals always want to integrate us out and close black schools."
But when asked to clarify his legal position on integration, it is as if a lawyer has stepped into the pulpit. "I have said on the record that I was not an integrationist. I was not a segregationist. I was not a desegregationist. I was an educationalist. What works best for people who enter the doors of black colleges, and in the main they are black students, is what we need to do."
Ronnie Musgrove, a Democrat who took office as Mississippi governor in January, has called for a conference to discuss settlement terms. He explained his move through a spokeswoman: "Leadership is bringing all sides together to once and for all settle the Ayers case. That is why I am building a consensus among all parties involved in order to create a resolution."
Ending the case had not been a priority for Mr. Musgrove's predecessor, Kirk Fordice, who once vowed, jokingly he later told reporters, to call in the National Guard if the courts ordered higher spending to resolve the case. And an aide to Mr. Musgrove said the Ayers case fell behind other concerns, like raising teacher pay and stoking economic development in a state that perennially ranks last in per capita income.
Mr. Chambliss, who has petitioned the Supreme Court to review all lower-court decisions in the case, said he would attend whatever conference the governor convenes but would not cave in on obtaining additional financing and facilities.
Among those waiting for resolution are Lilly Ayers, Mr. Ayers's 71-year-old widow, who is a social worker in Glen Allan, Miss., for Head Start, the federally financed prekindergarten program. She has kept up with the case even after Mr. Ayers's death and after Jake Jr., who attended Jackson State, went off to the Air Force and then factory work in Tulsa, Okla.
She sums up the case succinctly: "It was for equalizing the schools proportionately in financing and educationally."
To get there, she said with a sigh: "I felt like it would be a long time but not 25 years. I don't think my husband would have felt it would take 25 years, either. It was so simple."

BYLINE: By Linda Amster 

 BODY:
The flamboyant Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde and the ascetic George Bernard Shaw were temperamental opposites, but the two Dublin-born writers shared gifts of wit, intellect and a command of language that helped shape the modern stage.

1. He who can does. He who cannot (teaches, despairs, relaxes).
2. Do you know what a pessimist is? A man who thinks everybody is as
(clever, nasty, opinionated) as himself, and hates them for it.
3. (Idleness, marriage, self-indulgence) is popular because it combines the maximum of temptation with the maximum of opportunity.

Answer the questions:
1. "Pygmalion" was written primarily as a vehicle for the great English actress Mrs. Patrick Campbell (photo, d.). She created the role of Eliza Doolittle in London in 1913, with Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree co-starring as Prof. Henry Higgins. Wendy Hiller and Leslie Howard (a.) starred in the 1938 film version of "Pygmalion." "My Fair Lady" on Broadway starred Julie Andrews and Rex Harrison (b.), opening in 1956, and the 1964 film featured Audrey Hepburn (c.) and Harrison.
2. Prostitution. The controversial play was shut down by the police at its first performance in New York in 1905 and was not produced in England until 1925. That was the peak of Shaw's career. He also won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1925.
3. The Salvation Army

7. "Arms and the Man," taken from "I sing of arms and the man"
8. "The Picture of Dorian Gray"
9. a. Gross indecency; the play, about Wilde's literal and figurative trials, was titled "Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde."

HEADLINE: Vieques, Mostly Mellow

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS; CLAUDIA DREIFUS writes frequently for Science Times.

 BODY:
WHEN our New York friends heard that my pal Andrew and I would be vacationing in Vieques, Puerto Rico, the consensus was: we'd lost our minds. Vieques (pronounced bee-AY-kase) is a 21-mile string bean of an island off Puerto Rico, two-thirds of which is used by the United States Navy for weapons storage and live-bomb training. "No doubt you'll be going to Bikini next," one friend suggested, referring to the Pacific atoll used for hydrogen bomb tests in the 1950's.
But we'd heard great things about Vieques -- which enjoys an underground reputation as one of the last untouched paradises in all the Caribbean. Beyond the obvious minus that part of the island was a bombing range, we'd heard that wild horses grazed near some 40 white sand beaches, that there were miles of nature trails for bird-watching and a clean coral reef for snorkeling. The island was unpretentious and affordable -- Puerto Rican families often spent the weekend there. 
 By logging onto the Web site www .vieques-island.com, I was able to find listings for most of the island's approximately 150 rental rooms. There was plenty of simple, affordable lodging -- for example, in the fishing village of Esperanza, a double at the Acacia apartments cost as little as $65.
We ended up picking a high-end choice, the 16-room Hacienda Tamarindo in Esperanza. For $160 a night -- plus 10 percent service charge and 9 percent tax -- we booked a luxury double with a private bath and two American breakfasts. An additional $7.50 each bought a picnic lunch packed for the beach. According to the Web site, the Hacienda's owners, Linda and Burr Vail, former Vermonters, decorated all the rooms with their own "collection of art, antiques and personal collectibles."
Getting to Vieques was easy: a nonstop flight from Newark to San Juan International Airport, where we changed for a Vieques Air Link puddle-jumper. At the Vieques Airport, we picked up a jitney cab for $5 apiece, and the driver gave us a mini-tour of the island while he delivered his other fares to local inns.
At first glance, Vieques seemed something out of a Henri Rousseau painting. There were animals everywhere -- goats, roosters, donkeys, iguanas and pale Brahman cattle who roamed free. The greenery was wild and overgrown and the sea a supernatural neon turquoise. The only jarring note were the banners hanging, seemingly on every other house and tree, with slogans like "NAVY, OUT," "NO MORE BOMBS" and "PEACE FOR VIEQUES!!!"
Andrew, a political scientist, looked at the signs and said, "You can't have paradise without a paradox, can you?"
The "paradox" here was Camp Garcia, the United States Navy training base that dominates the island; for part of every year since 1941, it had been the scene of ship-to-shore bombardments, amphibious landings and live bombing runs. Camp Garcia had retarded the island's development, kept it poor, natural and charming. It had also, some critics claimed, polluted the environment with heavy metals from the weapons testing.
But the future of Vieques and Camp Garcia -- as the graffiti attested -- was up for grabs. In April 1999, a Marine Corps jet fighter accidentally bombed an observation tower and killed a civilian security guard, David Sanos Rodriguez. Mr. Sanos's death rekindled long-simmering resentments against the Navy and sparked an illegal camp-in by Puerto Rican religious and political figures on the actual firing range. The demonstrators accused the Navy of decades of callousness -- with hindering economic development, polluting the land and water and driving the Viequense crazy with noise of the bomb concussions. In response, President Clinton ordered a temporary halt to live weapons testing and, as our driver cheerfully explained, "there are demonstrations here every weekend till the Navy goes."
But the Navy doesn't want to quit Vieques, which Adm. Jay L. Johnson, chief of naval operations, has characterized as the "crown jewel training experience for us." There are plans to restart the bombing with "inert weapons, " which do not explode. A deal to settle as much as $90 million on the island for environmental cleanup and infrastructure development has been endorsed by both President Clinton and Puerto Rico's governor, Pedro J. Rossello. There is also a plebiscite planned for next year when the Viequense will vote on the Navy's future. As a first step, President Clinton recently transferred 110 acres of Navy land to Puerto Rico, to enlarge the airport.
The Hacienda Tamarindo, perched on a hill high above the Caribbean, was mercifully several miles from the noise -- military and political -- of Camp Garcia. (And in any case, the target practice had been suspended.) And the inn seemed, from the very start, every bit as wonderful as its Web page had promised it would be. A sweet Amazon parrot named Shaboo greeted us by the door, with squawks of "Hullo, hullo . . . tickle, tickle."
The Vails, who had a long history in the restaurant business in New England, have anticipated the details that can make a visit memorable: a library filled with good books, an honor-bar stocked with Medalla beer, a gorgeous swimming pool with vistas of the Caribbean, folding chairs for the beach, umbrellas for the soft tropical rain. Olga Garcia, the Hacienda's personable manager, had even arranged for our rental car, a $40-a-day dented Jeep from Maritza Car Rentals, to be ready after our check-in.
As for our room, it was a large one on the second floor overlooking the Caribbean, with a small terrace and a good king-size bed, decorated in a pleasant blend of Spanish tile and North American antiques.
Aside from hunting for a decent dinner (more on that later), there wasn't all that much to do on the island -- though, as Andrew remarked, "doing nothing is why we're here." Most days, we loaded the Jeep and headed for Sun Bay, a state park that never seemed to have more than 12 people in it. There we'd pick a sheltering coconut palm, settle in with a book and sunscreen, and watch the nature show.
There was plenty to see: brown pelicans flying sentry up and down the bay, a herd of wild horses bathing in the shallows, seabirds fishing. Behind Sun Bay were miles of trails that lead to a succession of the purest white sand beaches. On days when Andrew was lost in a tome, I'd head for these back trails and pretend I was Rima the bird girl, tracking hummingbirds, egrets and something that sounded like a parakeet.
Of course, not all of this island's natural treasures are on land. On two different afternoons, we signed up for a snorkeling tour. For $30 a person, we were outfitted with mask, snorkel and flippers, taken on a boat to the Blue Tang reef not far from Camp Garcia and let loose to gawk at God's own tropical fish tank -- a psychedelic universe of parrotfish, sergeant majors and truly blue, blue tangs.
Vieques may still be a natural paradise, but it's definitely not yet a destination for gourmets. In fact, for most of the 10 days we were there, food was a problem. The Hacienda Tamarindo served an elegant breakfast. On some days, we'd order the Hacienda's picnic lunch -- a sandwich, fruit, chips and brownie -- and that was fine. But finding a decent dinner was a test of my skills as an investigative reporter.
OUR first try, La Campesina, rumored to be the best on the island, defied its reputation and all common sense by serving undercooked chicken and near-raw scallops. The food at the Amapola was virtually inedible. At the Trade Winds the food was fine, but our waitress so hostile, so slow, that she soured the evening. For some reason, few restaurants employ Puerto Rican waiters or waitresses. The sullen snowbirds they tend to hire don't hesitate to let you know they'd rather be at the beach.
If a Puerto Rican waiter is hard to find, so is a Puerto Rican meal -- though, to its credit, the Trade Winds offers some local dishes. On weekends, however, a visitor can find the real thing when local women offer homemade specialties along the road: rice and beans, fried plantains, spiced meat pies. We had several tasty lunches this way, for under $5.
The major exception to the disappointing restaurants is the luxurious Inn on the Blue Horizon, within walking distance of our hotel, where entrees run from $24 through $28. Four of us from the Hacienda hiked over there one night for a light supper of appetizers and desserts. Each dish, from the black-pepper-seared sea scallops ($12) to the goat cheese tart with tomato polenta crust ($9) was excellent.
Off-putting, however, was our being made to wait for seating even though the restaurant was nearly empty. When we asked for a waterfront table, we were archly informed it was "reserved." In the two hours we were there, no one arrived to claim it.
Despite the snootery, the Inn at the Blue Horizon is lovely. In addition to the restaurant, the inn rents nine rooms, seven of them waterfront and all decorated with fine antiques and exquisite taste. The hotel's co-owner, James Weis, says he is host to a glamorous clientele: "We don't mention names, but we get quite a few midcelebrities," he asserts.
Like so many of the North Americans we met, Mr. Weis has a great interest in real estate. The future of Camp Garcia and the price of acreage, two linked topics, were the top conversational subjects on the island. Mr. Weis and his partner, William Knight, hope to move forward with an expansion, even if the Navy does not leave Vieques. He said his guests can't hear the bombing, and added, "The fact that Rosewood thinks Vieques is a destination helps with the lenders."
The "Rosewood" Mr. Weis refers to is Rosewood Hotels and Resorts of Dallas. After spending somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million, Rosewood and partners plan to transform Vieques by opening the 25-acre Martineau Bay Resort on the Atlantic Ocean side of the island. (A large hunk of that development money came from a Puerto Rican bond issue, according to James Brown, Rosewood's president and chief operating officer.)
This 156-room walled-in complex, a mile and a half from that to-be-expanded airport, will initiate Vieques into the world of commercial tourism. When the hotel opens in December, it will instantly double the island's room capacity. Winter rates are expected to range from $475 for a double room to $3,000 a night for a three-bedroom villa. At those prices, a new brand of tourist is likely to come to Vieques. Goodbye, Birkenstock-bohos. Hello, Prada-people.
Rosewood, whose other properties include Little Dix Bay on Virgin Gorda and the Mansion at Turtle Creek in Dallas, is known for tasteful resorts with personal service and first-rate cuisine. The company's plans for Martineau Bay are very much within that tradition. To satisfy our curiousity, one morning we headed over to the bustling construction site at Martineau Bay and took a tour with Pierre Zreik, the hotel's managing director.
Mr. Zreik was full of excitement as he showed us the lavish kitchens for the two restaurants, one bar and 24-hour room service, the ditch that would be a free-form swimming pool, the tiled palace that was the health spa, and the hotel's first completed guest rooms. The designers had made a point of using the natural seascape as the focus of the decor. Every room had an ocean view.
The sample interiors were a cheerful mix of rattan, blue tile and wrought iron, and as a Web-site brochure (www.rosewood-hotels.com) promised: "All rooms will have air-conditioning, cable TV, three phones, fax line, data port connection, separate soaking tub and shower. One-bedroom suites will feature Jacuzzi tubs." The Rosewood people have not, as the singer Joni Mitchell once wrote, "paved paradise and put up a parking lot," but they have certainly tamed it.
Still, what Rosewood is creating is a gamble. After all, how many upscale travelers will want to stay on an island that might soon again be a bombing range and that is the heart of a fierce political conflict? In early February, 85,000 Puerto Rican citizens clogged the main highway of San Juan, protesting resumption of Naval testing.
James Brown, Rosewood's president, doesn't think he has a problem. "The testing range is 20 miles away," he said in a telephone interview from his office in Dallas.
As for all the demonstrations, he said: "I think it will bring continued focus on the island. More people will know where Vieques is." Noting that there are two more hotels in the the planning stages, he added, "The island will soon become a destination, in and of itself."

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Fort Lauderdale for Grown-Ups

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE 

 BODY:
I SPENT my college spring breaks hanging out in the library. And so when an air fare skirmish broke out in late February on the New York to Fort Lauderdale route, my frustrated inner 21-year-old unexpectedly emerged in a polka-dot bikini, hefting a surfboard on her shoulders.
Fort Lauderdale, I'd heard, had mellowed. In the 80's, the city authorities clamped down on the spring break hordes, who moved on to Padre Island, Daytona Beach and Cancun. Fort Lauderdale expanded its riverfront, added promenades and built up its downtown shopping and restaurant district, Las Olas Boulevard. It sounded as if it might be a place where a late-blooming spring breaker could spend a week having some grown-up fun. 
 The fare war was set off by JetBlue, the new discount airline based at Kennedy Airport that offers service from Buffalo to New York to Florida. The introductory fare on the JFK/FLL route was an incredible $160 round trip. The other carriers on the route, Continental, US Airways, Delta, American and T.W.A., had slashed their fares to compete with the upstart. But by the time I got online, about 10 days after I saw the offers, the most steeply discounted fares had sold out for the dates in mid-March that I wanted. Bummer.
I worked the various airline and travel Web sites on the Internet, an exercise that feels like playing one of those electronic slot machines. You plug in your travel dates, hit a button, and wait to see if your cherries come up in a row.
On the airline Web sites, they didn't. Continental Airlines offered a round trip for $418; the best I could do on Delta was $354. I went over to Cheap Tickets, one of the Web travel discounters -- still no luck. The best I could do was a round trip on T.W.A. for $388.
Finally, I logged into JetBlue (at www .jetblue.com). The site, with its cool Helvetica type, color blocks and clever icons, resembled a trendy home design magazine more than an airline Web site. JetBlue's round-trip fare for the dates I wanted came to $249, more than I'd hoped but still more than $100 below the best quote from the competition. I could have shaved that to $209 if I'd been willing to leave Lauderdale on a 6 a.m. flight. My inner 21-year-old was willing, but I wasn't.
JetBlue's terminal wasn't listed on the e-ticket, and the airline wasn't yet posted on the informational signboards along the access road at the airport, so I was glad I'd called ahead to find out that it shares Terminal 6 with United Airlines. The flight was completely full, but JetBlue's waiting area is spacious -- it even has a play area for kids, with two basketball hoops and a Barbie playhouse. My inner 10-year-old was tempted.
In Florida I picked up my wheels (a bright red Grand Am from Enterprise-Rent-a-Car, $204 a week) and drove straight into Sunday evening traffic. Crawling up Seabreeze Boulevard, I checked out the scene on the beach. There still appeared to be a reasonable amount of college-student action, especially around the corner of Seabreeze and Las Olas, where a beer smell mingled with the ocean breeze, and crowds crunched seven or eight deep around a bar called the Elbo Room. My motel, the Three Suns Inn, was about seven blocks north of this major intersection, a block and a half in from the beach.
The tourist geography of Fort Lauderdale is different from that of its neighbor to the south, Miami Beach. Lauderdale's beach area is a warren of small, courtyard-style motels of post-1960's vintage. They served as headquarters for the spring breakers who thronged here every year after the hit movie "Where the Boys Are" turned Lauderdale into a national phenomenon in 1960. When the city decided to crack down on the spring breakers in the 1980's, the small motels repositioned themselves as inexpensive beach vacation lodging for budget-minded tourists and families from Europe and Canada. Many of the hoteliers banded together in an organization called Superior Small Lodgings. The group conducts inspections of hotels, presents awards and maintains a Web site, which is how I found the Three Suns.
Claudio de Souza, a cheerful Brazilian economist turned hotelier, met me at the motel office. He informed me solemnly that he didn't have any more standard rooms available (which is what I'd reserved). Then he chuckled and said, "Well, I'll just have to upgrade you to an efficiency at the same price." And so, for $75 a night (including a 10 percent AAA discount, which offset the 11 percent Florida room tax), I moved into a huge room on the second floor with two double beds, a dining table and a kitchenette alcove with fridge, coffee maker, microwave, sink and dishes.
Charming it wasn't -- the room was out of the Motel 6 school of interior design -- but it was spotless and comfortable and I quickly settled in. My neighbors included a young German couple on their honeymoon, and a group of British 20-somethings on vacation. I could hear a little too much of their television at night, but otherwise, the noise level wasn't a problem. Brisk, chilly winds kept me from enjoying the motel pool during my three-day stay, and from doing any ocean swimming beyond sticking in a toe. South Florida weather is iffy in March. But the beach at Lauderdale is cleaner than South Beach Miami and less crowded, even when the kids are in town.
In the mornings I made coffee in my room, then jogged along the pleasantly curvy concrete-and-brick oceanfront promenade about a mile to the International Swimming Hall of Fame, a funny-looking building with a roof shaped like stylized rolling waves. At the exhibit ($3) I learned that Benjamin Franklin was one of America's first notable swimmers, and I saw life-size figures of Johnny Weissmuller in Tarzan get-up, Mark Spitz, and Duke Kahanamoku, the Hawaiian swimmer who is credited with having invented surfing.
When the wind permitted, I sat on the beach and read the paperbacks I'd packed for the trip -- Travis McGee noir potboilers by John D. MacDonald, all set in the Fort Lauderdale of 40 years ago. McGee's raffish milieu of strippers, party geezers and beach bums, I was pleased to note, wasn't so different from the scene in front of the Elbo Room today. But I doubt that McGee would have approved of the multilevel shopping mall across the street from the beach.
While I enjoyed the beach area, I grew frustrated with its lack of adult diversions -- there are no pleasant coffee bars, only touristy restaurants, and too many T-shirt and souvenir shops. I gravitated inland, away from the beach, to Las Olas Boulevard downtown for meals. To save money I ate big lunches, rather than dinners, at the fashionable new American cuisine restaurant Mark's Las Olas ($25), its upstart competitor, the Himmarshee Bar and Grill ($25), and the unusual Zan(Z)bar, which claims to be the first place in the United States to serve South African cuisine ($30).
By Day 3 I was ready to hang my hat closer to town. I left the Three Suns and the beach and moved into the "grown-up" Fort Lauderdale, the city of canals about a mile inland from the beach. The apartments and motels along the canals cater to boaters (most have docking facilities) and are somewhat higher priced than their beachside counterparts.
Of the places along the Isle of Venice boulevard, I decided to try the Banyan Marina Apartments. The two-story complex, which faced a pretty, boat-lined canal, had a pleasant swimming pool with deck chairs on a raised wooden deck, and a huge, twisted, leafy banyan tree in the courtyard. Apparently, others had found the place as inviting as I did, for all the $90 motel-sized rooms were taken.
The only apartment left was a one-bedroom with a full kitchen. It was expensive, at $140 a night (after Easter the price drops to $90), but quiet and homey, with a real furnished living room, queen bed, tiled bath and a big window overlooking the canal. It had a phone with a data port, so I could use my computer modem. I figured with the kitchen I'd save on restaurant expenses, which would offset the added cost, and so I took it for my remaining three nights.
There's much to be said for vacationing in a home-away-from-home, which I had not done for a long time. I enjoyed shopping at the local grocery, the Hyde Park, so much bigger and cleaner than the ones in New York City, and picking up gourmet treats like fresh mozzarella and smoked salmon at the Mediterranean Deli downtown. At the Gran Forno, a superb Italian bakery, I bought delicious focaccia for $3.50, loaves of ciabattini for 75 cents, and fresh chicken pesto sandwiches for $5.50.
The beach was still only a comfortable walk or jog away, but I mostly forgot about it and fell into a different tropical rhythm in the old-Florida atmosphere of downtown. At the Old Fort Lauderdale Museum of History ($3) I learned that the city had grown from a wild and woolly Indian trading post at the turn of the last century to become a real estate speculator's dream in the 1920's with the southward expansion of Henry Flagler's railroad. A 200-m.p.h. hurricane in 1926 blew Fort Lauderdale into a slumber from which it didn't awaken until the postwar boom -- and the invention of air-conditioning.
THOUGH glossy skyscrapers now rise along the New River banks, the railroad whistles still blow every 30 minutes or so, announcing the passage of freight trains from the Florida East Coast Railway. They rumble right in front of the museum, and also in front of the tiny yoga studio, the Yoga Warehouse, where I took a class one evening. The locomotive whistles jump-started my imagination, and when I visited the oldest building in Fort Lauderdale, the 1901 Stranahan House, I almost felt as if a party of Seminoles might come knocking on the door any minute.
This old Victorian house was originally a trading post and place of business for Frank Stranahan, an adventurer from Ohio who made his fortune trading with the Seminoles. One of his most popular items, according to the docent who led my tour, was alligator eggs, of which he sold 120,000 to New Yorkers in the 1890's -- wearing a just-hatched baby alligator on a neck chain was all the rage for a while. The alligators, of course, matured, finding their way into the New York sewers, and urban legend.
Walking along the winding pedestrian path that follows the New River, I longed for my own small boat to explore the network of canals that laces the city. I'd tried several times to connect with one of Fort Lauderdale's water taxis, which follow a set route and charge $7.50 a ride. But the taxis stopped infrequently and the schedule had just changed and was not available yet as a printed handout. Frustrated, I finally signed on for a tourist boat excursion on the Carrie B, a two-deck paddle wheeler that makes an hour and a half spin down the New River into the Intracoastal Waterway.
For $11.50, I got to see another side of Fort Lauderdale -- its "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous." Look on your left! See Paul Allen's yacht with attached helicopter! On your right, the luxurious mansion of H. Wayne Huizenga, founder of Blockbuster. Necks craned, passengers ooohed, and I reached for my sunscreen, for the weather had suddenly taken a turn toward sultry.
I went to the beach one last time, and passed a bar where twentyish students were gyrating to disco music on the tables. Across the street, police cut a wedge through a throng of onlookers to try to revive a man who'd passed out on the sidewalk. About 50 feet away from the commotion, a gray-haired woman sat under a beach umbrella, quietly reading. Nearby two toddlers were tossing sand at each other. On Fort Lauderdale's beach, spring break is for everybody.
 
The bottom line: beach motels and focaccia
I spent $123.64 a day on hotels, lodging and activities during seven days and six nights in Fort Lauderdale at the peak of high season. Hotel prices drop dramatically after spring break, usually around Easter. My trip could be done now for as low as $99.95 a day.
 
Travel
I spent $269, including taxes, on a round trip from Kennedy Airport to Fort Lauderdale on JetBlue Airways, (800) 538-2583 or www.jetblue
.com. At the end of March, JetBlue's round trip from New York to Fort Lauderdale had dropped to as low as $169.
I rented a Pontiac Grand Am for a week from Enterprise Rent-a-Car for $204; (954) 760-9888.
 
Hotel
In a neighborhood of inexpensive beach motels, the Three Suns Inn, 3016 Windemar Street, (954) 563-7926, fax (954) 563-7988, is a clean and comfortable no-frills lodging that attracts a clientele of European tourists. Its pleasant motel-type rooms surround a pretty swimming pool with a giant palm tree. I booked a standard hotel room at a price of $75 a night, and I was upgraded to an efficiency.
The Banyan Marina Apartments, 111 Isle of Venice, (954) 524-4430, fax (954) 764-4870, has a pleasant canal filled with sailboats in its backyard. The small furnished apartments are each decorated differently. My efficiency apartment had a bedroom with queen bed, sitting room, a fully equipped eat-in kitchen, and a tiled bath. There's a small pool and a deck. At $140 a night, it was a luxurious, peaceful retreat and a bit of a splurge. At $90 (the price of the room after Easter) it's a real deal.
 
Food
Fort Lauderdale has a few excellent restaurants, and they're affordable at lunch.
At Mark's Las Olas, (954) 463-1000, 1032 East Las Olas Boulevard, a well-reviewed and chic outpost of New American and Nuevo Latino cuisine, I had a delicious lunch of grilled fish with black bean salsa, and a glass of sauvignon blanc. Lunch, with tip, was $25.
Himmarshee Bar and Grill, 210 SW 2nd Street, (954) 524-1818, has a culinary approach similar to Mark's, but in more casual surroundings. Lunch with one glass of wine and coffee was $25.
Zan(Z)bar, 602 East Las Olas Boulevard, (954) 832-9090, serves unusual and tasty South African food -- I sampled bobotie, a vegetable curry that is presented in layers and comes surrounded by interesting fruit chutneys. Lunch with appetizers, wine and coffee came to $30. The restaurant closed on March 27 because the building is being demolished. The restaurateurs are looking for another space, and don't know when they will reopen.
The Gran Forno bakery, 1235 East Las Olas Boulevard, (954) 467-2244, sells marvelous home-baked Italian breads and focaccias. They also serve sandwiches for about $5.50 each.
The Mediterranean Market, 1021 East Las Olas Boulevard, (954) 463-1212, is a source for everything from sliced Nova to wine to gourmet salami and prosciutto.
 
Activities
The Old Fort Lauderdale Museum of History, 231 S.W. Second Avenue, (954) 463-4431, is in a historical building that was once the New River Inn, the city's first hotel. It has a an intriguing display of memorabilia and artifacts related to the city's past, including a display on the history of Spring Break. Admission is $4. It's open from Tuesday to Friday and Sunday, noon to 5 p.m., Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; closed Mondays.
The Historic Stranahan House, East Las Olas Boulevard and S.E. 6th Avenue, (954) 524-4736, is in a beautifully restored Victorian mansion. Only guided tours are permitted; they are conducted by docents well versed in the lore of the frontier settlement. Tours are given on the hour 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. on weekdays and Saturdays and from 1 to until 3 p.m. on Sundays through May; for summer hours call ahead.
The Yoga Warehouse, 508 S.W. Flagler Avenue, (954) 525-7726, offers daily hatha yoga classes in a converted warehouse by the railroad tracks that dates from the 1920's. The first class is free, subsequent classes are $10 each.
The International Swimming Hall of Fame, 1 Hall of Fame Drive, (954) 462-6536, has an exhibit of just about everything you'd ever want to know about swimming. Downstairs, the gift shop sells high-tech suits and swimming paraphernalia. Admission: $3. DAISANN McLANE

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Raleigh

BYLINE: By NANCY BEARDEN HENDERSON; NANCY BEARDEN HENDERSON writes frequently about the South.

 BODY:
Dubbed the City of Oaks soon after its founding in 1792, Raleigh in spring could just as easily be called the city of redbuds or crape myrtles or Yoshino cherries. This time of year, balmy temperatures coax into bloom a sea of tulips, azaleas and irises.
Thanks to a grid of one-way streets and pedestrian-friendly plazas, the numerous historic sites, shops and restaurants are easy to navigate. North Carolina's capital is a study in architectural contrast, with Gothic cathedrals next to massive Greek Revival banks, ornate Victorian mansions and modern high-rises. 
 A thriving economy and an explosion of high-paying research and development jobs in nearby Research Triangle Park have boosted Raleigh's population from approximately 200,000 to nearly 300,000 in less than a decade, and the city continues to grow in sophistication without losing its Southern charm.
The cultural star this spring is the Rodin exhibition at the North Carolina Museum of Art. The sculpture display is the centerpiece of a four-month celebration of all things French with lectures, concerts, festivals, dance, films, and a symposium on Paris at the end of the last century. And the new North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences recently opened with four floors of intriguing specimens, from rare whale skeletons to live animals like the Hercules beetle and the two-toed sloth.
 
Events
Casts of Rodin's "Kiss" and "Thinker," the latter welcoming patrons from atop a hill at the museum entrance, will be on display at the North Carolina Museum of Art, 2110 Blue Ridge Road, (919) 839-6262, April 16 to Aug. 13; so will lesser-known drawings and sculptures of the human body in bronze, marble, plaster and terra cotta -- about 130 pieces in all. Most works are on loan from the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor collection. The show is the most comprehensive in the United States for nearly 20 years. The museum also features a Judaica Gallery devoted to Jewish ceremonial art. Admission to the exhibition (the museum is free) is $7.50, $5.50 for seniors and students. Closed Monday.
Complementing the Rodin exhibition is "Focus on France," at Mordecai Historic Park, which encompasses President Andrew Johnson's birthplace, 1 Mimosa Street; (919) 834-4844. Through July 31, tour guides will show off perfume sets, glass chandeliers and other French decorative pieces. Year-round at Mordecai, visitors can experience life in 19th-century Raleigh along a village street flanked by antebellum buildings. Open Monday and Wednesday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Sunday from 1 to 4. Admission is $4, $2 ages 7 to 17.
The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences exhibition "In the Dark" runs until Sept. 10, focusing on nature's night shift, from star-nosed moles to glowing mushrooms to underground worlds. Admission to the museum, in Bicentennial Plaza, is free, but "In the Dark" costs $3 ($1 for those under 11 or over 60). The museum has just completed a transformation into the Southeast's largest natural history museum; the signature exhibit is the world's only display of the skeleton of an Acrocanthosaurus, a 40-foot, 110-million-year-old carnivore shown in a re-creation of a fierce dinosaur battle. Call (919) 733-7450.
On May 20 and 21, the Artsplosure spring arts festival, (919) 832-8699, will fill downtown with live jazz and blues in Moore Square, a street fair with 150 artists selling ceramics, folk art and other wares. It is all free.
Beginning June 12 is "One Voice: From the Pen of Anne Frank" at Exploris, a museum that opened in October at 201 East Hargett Street; (919) 834-4040. Designed to recall the attic Anne Frank hid in during the Holocaust, the exhibit will feature excerpts from her diary, voice-overs from readers who tell of the diary's impact on their lives, and period artifacts. It also has some chilling audio effects, like a soldier barking orders in a concentration camp. Elsewhere in Exploris, visitors can view live news broadcasts from 42 countries and see a four-ton segment of the Berlin Wall. Admission is $6.95, $5.95 for seniors, $4.95 ages 4 to 11. Open Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m.; closed Mondays in winter.
 
Sightseeing
Raleigh's main government buildings are within easy walking distance of one another. At the State Capitol, a handsome 1840 Greek Revival building at 1 East Edenton Street, the former legislative chambers, the state geologist's office and State Library room are open Monday to Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday 1 to 5 p.m., free; (919) 733-4994.
Nearby, at 200 North Blount Street, the Executive Mansion has served as home to North Carolina governors since it was built by prison labor in 1891. President Franklin D. Roosevelt is said to have praised the Queen Anne Cottage-style landmark as the most beautiful governor's residence in America for its elegant Corinthian columns, 16-foot ceilings, lavish gentlemen's and ladies' parlors, and ballroom filled with French gilded furniture. Free, but hours vary; call (919) 733-3456 for a tour.
Just south of Martin Street adjacent to Moore Square Park is City Market, a 1914 Spanish Mission-style hubbub of art galleries, blues clubs, restaurants and specialty shops, with the aroma of fresh-baked strombolis wafting through the original cobblestone streets. Information: (919) 828-4555.
At the 75-acre State Farmers Market, 1201 Agriculture Street, (919) 733-7417, huge warehouses are filled with jellies, just-baked cakes and fresh seafood and produce from 90 vendors. Open 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Saturday, from noon Sunday.
The J. C. Raulston Arboretum at North Carolina State University, 4301 Beryl Road, (919) 515-3132, features more than 5,000 varieties of plant from 55 countries, including an award-winning 450-foot-long perennial border; redbud, magnolia and conifer collections; a white garden modeled after Vita Sackville-West's Sissinghurst; and themed areas where you can learn to create fragrance, paradise and edible gardens. Shady paths and meditation areas offer a peaceful respite. Free, open daily 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
City maps are available at the Capital Area Visitor Center, 301 North Blount Street; (919) 733-3456, open Monday to Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday 1 to 5 p.m.
 
Where to Stay
Two blocks from North Carolina State University, the wrought-iron-and-brick, New Orleans-style Velvet Cloak Inn at 1505 Hillsborough Street, (919) 828-0333, fax (919) 832-6267, offers 172 larger-than-average rooms and 8 suites, many with pencil-post beds, for $69 to $107. Amenities include airport transfers, an indoor pool shrouded by trees, Continental breakfast and afternoon tea.
Just down the road, at 1707 Hillsborough Street, (919) 828-0811, fax (919) 834-0904, stands the eight-story Brownstone Hotel and Conference Center. With great views of the campus from the upper floors and rates from $69 to $99, it is a favorite for parents visiting their children at the university. All of the 190 rooms and 5 suites, in shades of rose and hunter green, have balconies.
Budget: Next to the Crabtree Valley Mall, the Fairfield Inn by Marriott-Crabtree, 2201 Summit Park Lane, (919) 881-9800, fax (919) 881-0221, offers 125 spacious green-and-pink rooms with outdoor pool, whirlpool, fitness center, desks and Continental breakfast. Doubles: $69 to $84.
Another affordable hotel near I-440 is the La Quinta Inn and Suites-Crabtree, 2211 Summit Park Lane. Decorated in rich woods and shades of emerald green, the 135 contemporary rooms have data ports, comfortable recliners and oversized desks. Other amenities include a heated pool, spa, fitness center and complimentary breakfast ($79-$89); (919) 785-0071, fax (919) 785-0081.
Luxury: Within walking distance of the Crabtree Valley Mall, at 3908 Arrow Drive, (919) 782-6868, fax (919) 881-9340, stands the Crabtree Summit Hotel, a European boutique-style hotel where twin carved lions and 100-year-old oak doors greetguests. Double rates of $109 to $200 include buffet breakfast, some whirlpool baths and a fitness room. Furnished with antique reproductions, its 83 recently renovated rooms and suites come with refrigerators, data ports and two-line telephones.
The Oakwood Inn, 411 North Bloodworth Street, (919) 832-9712, fax (919) 836-9263, is a pale lavender Victorian bed-and-breakfast in the historic Oakwood neighborhood. Breakfasts feature orange French toast and fried country grits. All six rooms offer private baths and working fireplaces; rates range from $85 to $135. Built in 1871 and restored in 1984, the inn features a porch, afternoon tea, and a yard filled with bearded irises and star magnolias. It's part of a neighborhood of Second Empire and Queen Anne residences.
 
Where to Eat
The Angus Barn, 9401 Glenwood Avenue near the airport, (919) 787-3505, has a wine list bigger than the airport's flight schedule: 82 pages with 1,100 selections. The menu -- including chateaubriand, oysters Rockefeller and fresh soft-shell crabs sauteed in brown butter sauce -- is a lot more formal than the decor, which features rough-hewn wood beams, red gingham tablecloths, and lanterns hanging in wagon wheels. Dinner for two with wine, about $75. A luxurious dining room in the cellar also serves a six-course, five-wine French Provencal meal for $140 a person.
Presentation is everything at Second Empire Restaurant and Tavern, 330 Hillsborough Street, (919) 829-3663. Here in this 19th-century mansion with high ceilings and stone sculptures, white-jacketed waiters serve crispy striped bass with braised lamb shank and eggplant gateau. Downstairs in the tavern the setting is more intimate and casual. Dinner for two with wine, $100.
The 42nd Street Oyster Bar, (919) 831-2811, is actually at 508 West Jones Street, so why the name? The story goes that in 1933 a group of Raleigh doctors returned from a convention in New York and began to refer to a grocery store that served oysters and beer on the side as the 42nd Street Oyster Bar. The business changed hands and over the years evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, where specialties include crab cakes, shrimp creole and fresh fish caught by the restaurant's own boats off the Carolina coast; each meal is preceded by a basket of slender, half-moon hush puppies. Dinner for two with wine, about $50.
Arthur Gordon's menus at the Irregardless Cafe, 901 West Morgan Street, (919) 833-8898, change daily. The restaurant is a favorite with vegetarians, serving up dishes like Oriental stir-fried vegetables, ratatouille and sweet potato ravioli, and appetizers ranging from grilled fennel to Persian carrot soup. Bright schools of hand-crafted fish dangle from the ceiling while two violinists often stroll among the tables. Dinner for two with wine, $60.
At Big Ed's, 220 Wolfe Street, (919) 836-9909, it's hard to keep your eyes on your plate with so many old gourds, bicycles and other nostalgic oddities hanging from the rafters. Country breakfasts feature grilled biscuits, blackstrap molasses and ham with red-eye gravy, lunches chicken and dumplings, barbecued catfish or country-style steak with fresh vegetables. Breakfast, lunch or dinner for two, under $20.

HEADLINE: The Triumph of Burbopolis

BYLINE: By Michael Pollan; Michael Pollan, a contributing writer for The Times Magazine, is the author of "Second Nature" and "A Place of My Own."

 BODY:
I grew up in a pretty nice subdivision on Long Island, but try as I might to kindle some spark of nostalgia for "the Gates of Woodbury," the gravitational pull of the place is almost nil. It has been nearly 30 years since I left, and at least until a couple of months ago, I could think of no reason to go back: no people to see (everybody I knew had also left), no curiosity to satisfy. In my imagination Juneau Boulevard is the same as it ever was, except maybe for the cars and the people, which I assume have been regularly updated. Isn't that the way it has always been in the burbs -- change without history? More of the same?
A lot more of the same, it's true: since I left Long Island in the 70's, resolving henceforth to live somewhere more in the middle of things, more real, the suburbs have quietly and steadily expanded. And then the day came, a few years ago, when I read in the paper that for the first time in history a majority of Americans now lived in the suburbs. America had officially become "a suburban nation" -- which sounded to me like one of those utterly weightless demographic truths, empirically verifiable, but without any real echo in experience. For wasn't this really just a change in quantity, not kind? The relative size of middle and fringe may have shifted, but surely not their relative weight. 
 At least this is what I assumed. It's only recently that I've felt any compulsion to go back to Woodbury to test my assumptions, and that was mostly because I needed a place to set this essay. What I found when I got there was a good bit more than that. What I found looks a lot like a whole new country -- or at least a place for which "suburb" is no longer quite the right word.
From the time I was 5 until I got out of high school I lived in the Gates near the corner of Juneau and Fairbanks Boulevards. In all that time, I never really noticed just how goofily dissonant those names are, with their improbable conjunction of Yukon pluck and Old World prissiness. Yet these place names, and the conflicting dreams they embody, tell you just about all you need to know about the place and the time.
The development went in on the site of an old North Shore estate that had been subdivided into acre lots during the Suburban Revolution; the developer decided to preserve the wrought-iron entrance gates to give a bit of aristocratic tone to his shiny middle-class development. As for the whole Yukon theme, ground was broken in 1960, soon after Alaska had become a state, and the Gates fashioned itself a forward-looking, even pioneerish kind of place. At the time Woodbury was on the suburban frontier, still mostly farm fields and forest, and the Gates aimed to distinguish itself from the cookie-cutter subdivisions then spreading out across Long Island.
In the same way the suburbs began as a reaction against city life, each new incarnation of suburbia has defined itself in opposition to some earlier, superseded ideal: middle-class utopias keeping one step ahead of history. In the beginning the suburban frontier stood in places like Brooklyn Heights, first made accessible by steam ferry in 1814, but the city quickly followed, folding Brooklyn's row houses into its expanding grid. To prevent that kind of thing from happening again, the next new place (epitomized by Llewellyn Park, built in New Jersey in 1853, and Riverside, built near Chicago in 1868) was carefully planned to keep the city permanently at bay. It would be an ungridded community of free-standing houses in a park, linked to the distant city by trolley or train. Then, beginning in the 1920's, the 19th-century railroad suburb was superseded by more far-flung subdivisions organized around the automobile and, after the war, the mass-production house pioneered by the Levitts.
By 1960, when my parents went house hunting on Long Island, Levittown was passe, and the next new place -- the un-Levittown -- promised to be the Gates of Woodbury, where the lots were generally a sprawling acre. Instead of identical houses lined up like sparrows on a wire, the developer offered three up-to-date models (ranch, split-level, and colonial), laid out his roads in sweeping, pointless curves and sited the houses so far back on their wooded acres that each appeared lost in a reverie of being a mansion. (Sometimes I think this is what is really meant by a "dream house": the recumbent ranches dreaming of California, the colonnaded white colonials dreaming of Tara.) But if the Alaska angle implied the pastless potential of the next great American place, what was with those prissy "boulevards" and "drives," all those "ways" and "terraces" and, for the cul-de- sacs, "courts"? Understand that in the suburbs a developer will go to heroic lengths not to call a street a street. Street says city, and city is precisely the last thing you want to say. Whereas boulevard said fancy, said sophisticated, and if this effeteness jangled alongside muscular Alaska, that evidently didn't bother the developer or his buyers.
Finding your way back to your suburban childhood home is harder than you might think. I didn't know anyone who still lived in the Gates -- my folks moved out in 1972, and most of their neighbors had headed down to Florida the minute the kids left for college, there to recreate a grayer, warmer Gates in Boca Raton. (One thing the burbs have done to America is to recast its geography along purely demographic lines.) To find out who lived in my old house, I had to send it a letter, addressed to "current resident." (In quotes, to make sure it didn't get tossed.) "Current resident" turned out to be Stephen and Jena Hall, and they graciously invited me to visit. Since I didn't know anybody to stay with, "going home" to Woodbury meant spending the night in a $79 room in the Executive Inn on Jericho Turnpike, the main commercial strip.
My first impression of Woodbury, after rolling off the expressway onto Jericho Turnpike, was disorientation. Every landmark on my mental map of the area had been stripped and replaced by a big-box retailer, such that it took me the better part of two days to locate my junior high school, its unmarked turn off Jericho having been swallowed up by superstores. I noticed that the brands were all high-end, the kind my mother had had to drive all the way to Manhattan for.
Actually the brands should have been my tip-off that this was not the same place I left, that it had a completely different relationship to Manhattan. But I didn't put that together until I turned onto Woodbury Road, passed a bunch of newer developments (including the Woodbury Estates and the almost completely flat Rolling Hills) and made the left onto Froehlich Farm Boulevard. Whenever "farm" (or "forest," or "fairground" or anything venerably rural) is honored in a suburban place name, you can bet the thing is history, and such was emphatically the case with the old Froehlich farm.
The pumpkin field to which Charlie DeSalvo and I used to drag our wagons each fall for the purpose of committing petty larceny had sprouted a half-dozen smoked-glass office buildings, blocky islands in a glittering sea of really nice cars. Gateways Executive Mall, the sign said (I half-expected to see "of Froehlich Farm"), and it listed a phalanx of law firms, insurance companies, medical practices, banks and high-tech firms. Each of those really nice cars represented at least one really good white-collar job, and there must have been a thousand of them right here, smack in the middle of the pumpkin field that backed up against Fairbanks Boulevard.
"The city": we led centripetal lives in those days, our heads bent toward Manhattan as if it were the sun. Which in some sense it was, the city being the source not only of all money but also of entertainment and information and -- what was especially important to us as teenagers -- authenticity. The suburbs, we believed, were fake; after all, we had watched them rise like stage sets on the farm fields, seen the instantaneous lawns rolled out over the raw dirt like new linoleum. This creation of a new life ex nihilo was of course exactly what our parents liked about the place, but what was to them a blank canvas was to us an existential void. Nothing was original except, well, except us and these childhoods we were having -- a thought disturbing enough to make us wonder if those were somehow fake, too, "sub" to something realer.
Like lots of other dads in the Gates, mine commuted to a job in the real world every day, leaving the house before I woke up and rarely getting home before the dinner dishes had been cleared. Only a few of the moms had jobs, but they'd dress up and drive in a couple of times a month, to shop, catch a matinee, meet the dads for a fancy dinner and a "first run" movie.
Even before kids were old enough to solo on the L.I.R.R., we looked to the city as the source of our styles and shows and news, an all-powerful broadcast antenna to whose frequency we always tried to stay tuned. Tuesday nights Cousin Brucie handed down the Top 40 from Midtown Manhattan, and by Wednesday morning the Sam Goody at the Walt Whitman Mall would have rearranged its shelves accordingly. Later on, the more time you spent in the city, the cooler you were, because you had personally bathed in coolness's headwaters, at the Fillmore East, say, or the Thalia, or the Eighth Street Bookshop.
It doesn't seem as though Long Island's cultural and economic antennas point west in quite the same way anymore. Oh, sure, the Long Island Expressway still creeps every morning, but often now it's creeping in both directions, and a lot of those cars are heading to places like the Gateways Executive Mall (Exit 45), rather than to Manhattan. The retail, which once helped light up the city in suburban eyes, is no longer any different: the Walt Whitman shopping area is now basically Lexington Avenue and 59th Street -- Gap, Banana Republic, Nine West, Barnes & Noble, J. Crew and Tower Records, all anchored by a Bloomingdale's. But whether this represents the colonization of the suburbs by the city or the opposite is a question.
Radio and network TV still originate in Manhattan, but the newer media have traded broadcasting's radiating waves for centerless webs of wire. Who can say where in the world cable TV comes from? (A lot of it from Long Island, actually: Cablevision's headquarters happen to be in Bethpage.) And the Internet? America Online, perhaps the first great suburban medium, originates somewhere in suburban Virginia, though like the rest of the Web it might as well be anywhere.
One way to tell the story of the American suburbs is as a story of new technologies recasting the relationship of city and countryside. Electric power, trains, automobiles and broadcast television propelled successive waves of decentralization, each along slightly different lines. Until now, however, the pattern those lines formed always resembled the spokes of a wheel, with the city firmly in the center. Radiating highways and radio waves used to reinforce the gravitational pull of cities. But cable and computer networks are forming different patterns now, ones that mirror and speed the emergence of the burbs as free-floating entities with their own overlapping gravitational fields.
Time has been kind to many of the suburbs, and Juneau Boulevard is much prettier than I remember it. The conehead evergreens and midget rhododendrons, the paper birches and forsythia -- all that dinky nursery stock plunked into backfill by landscapers -- have put down roots and grown up to reclaim half-forgotten woodland identities, picturesquely blurring the new developments' blunter edges. By now many of the trees have grown tall enough to cast interesting shadows. The American suburb was conceived in the 19th century by visionary designers like Frederick Law Olmsted, Calvert Vaux and Andrew Jackson Downing to offer Americans a kind of democratically subdivided park, and the nicer ones are actually beginning to look that way.
Modest by comparison to what's built today, the 60's ranches and split-levels in the Gates have mellowed into period pieces: this is the architecture of postwar dreams that, at least from the vantage of a new century, no longer seem grasping or pretentious so much as sweet, even poignant. For this they probably have the newer houses to thank: the fat, bombastic three-story mini-mansions that now dot the Gates, many of them rising from the foundations of tear-downs.
Happily, the ranch on Juneau Boulevard hasn't been a tear-down -- though I was astonished to find at the far end of the driveway a hulking two-story post-modern building, a design studio perched atop a three-car garage. Jena Hall is a successful home-furnishings designer, and she has employed as many as eight people at a time here. On the exact spot where Binker, my problematic English bulldog, snored her days away in a chain-link dog run, people now come to work.
Jena Hall's home business helped me see that the suburbs have proved to be rather more adaptable to changing lives and times than people once thought. The whole idea behind the suburbs was to draw bright lines and make separations: between city and country, obviously, but also between work and home, public and private. But it turns out we overestimated the power of architectural determinism. The suburbs have proved flexible enough to accommodate working mothers (though not without difficulty: Jena Hall's studio was usually crawling with toddlers, hers and her employees') as well as a great many different kinds of families and lifestyles. Since I left the Gates, its white nuclear families have been joined by singles and gays, Asians and African-Americans, people operating home businesses and empty-nesters. The houses themselves -- light, wood-frame -- turned out to be as easy to remodel as they had been to build. The world that built the postwar suburbs has passed away, and yet those suburbs still stand, remodeled by the press of history. What they haven't been is reimagined or renamed, at least not yet.
When I was growing up in the Gates, suburban legend had it that one of the big white colonials on Bering Court had served as the model for Ward and June Cleaver's house on TV. They showed the fa-->ade at the beginning of every episode, and it certainly looked right. Whether this was true or not (for all I know, every suburb in America nursed the same legend), we all wanted to believe it. Sometimes we regarded Hollywood's notice as flattery, since being on TV made the Gates seem more real and substantial (fiction will do that); other times the fame seemed like the grimmest of jokes, weekly proof of the empty pretensions of the place.
Cleaverism -- the sitcom image of suburbia -- loomed large in our suburban lives, though its meanings were always complex and unstable. The Cleavers, Ozzie and Harriet, Donna Reed and all the rest proposed a ideal of suburban life that everyone knew was unrealistic and silly; and yet even as we made fun of it, we allowed the stereotype to exert a kind of normative hold on us. Your own family might be hopelessly dysfunctional, but maybe the Grables next door were getting it right. TV was happy to promote the Cleaver ideal because TV (alone among the arts) loved the burbs, and was eager to flatter what was, naturally, its ideal audience. Here were people marooned at home for much of the day, affluent and consumerist by inclination (having already purchased a new lifestyle), and at least at the start, insecure enough about the conduct of their new lifestyles to welcome the guidance of advertisers.
But what's remarkable is how Cleaverism continues to organize so much of our thinking about suburbia. Now, though, it's the lie of Cleaverism -- call it Cheeverism -- that dominates the popular image, offering writers and moviemakers a cheap way to construct a gothic version of suburbia, to throw its dark side into sharp relief. Now behind every smiling lawn is a dysfunctional family: Donna Reed's sleeping with the woman next door and Eddie Haskell's got a gun.
Yet the fa-->ade remains the organizing principle; in defiance of everything we know, we can't seem to see the suburbs without it. Without the ghosts of the Cleavers hovering over them, the families in "American Beauty," say, or of any number of recent suburban-gothic productions, just don't make a whole lot of sense.
Before I left the Gates I drove into Bering Court to see if I could find the Beav's old place. If I had the right one, the house has had a complete face lift since the 60's. The stately white faux-colonial now has diagonal siding painted an unfortunate shade of puce, lots of opaque glass bricks and, out front, a berm thickly planted with shrubs to hide the facade. Very 80's, it seemed, but for the life of me I could not name the dream behind this house.
It's hard to spend time driving around Long Island today without a gathering sense of cognitive dissonance. So many of our generalizations about the burbs no longer stick, which almost seems a shame, since generalization was one of the things that we liked best about them. Is it even right to call a place like Woodbury -- no longer "sub" to any "urb" -- a "suburb" any more? "Urban sprawl" might be a better term. Certainly "sprawl" hints at the centerlessness of it, "urban" at the fact there's nothing in the city you can't find here. And maybe, as some have suggested, that is what I'm looking at but can't quite yet see: a new kind of city, one we still don't have the words or name for. "Edge City" is one proposal, though that still implies a center. "Technoburb," another, hints at the role technology has played in freeing these place from their urban orbits, but it's awfully cold. How about something more floppy-effervescent, like "burbopolis"?
Whatever it ultimately gets called, the horizontal city that is now Nassau County, Long Island, is fast acquiring a city's jangly diversity, though, being horizontal, it takes a car to really see it. Freeport has its African-American neighborhoods and Great Neck a community of Persians, and even in my very white elementary school you see Indian and Asian faces now. Street culture, of all things, has come to certain suburban lanes: in Glen Cove, Central American immigrants collect on corners and in front yards, talking and playing music as if they were still in Guatemala City. (The village issued a flier gently instructing them in suburban custom.) The new city has city problems too: housing shortages, crime waves, pollution; dilapidated "first ring" suburbs are said to be in the throes of a full-fledged "urban crisis."
Though even here the generalizations don't hold. Before I left Long Island I took a long walk through Levittown, where the suburban history of Long Island got its start half a century ago. A first-ring suburb built fast and on the cheap, Levittown by all rights should be crumbling by now. Yet the place I visited appeared to be doing just fine, in defiance of every stereotype that has been thrown at it. Held up as an example of conformity and monotony, Levittown's 17,000 identical capes have mutated into an exuberant architectural Babel: the sparrows on a wire have each grown their own distinctive plumage.
Yet this free-for-all of Home Depot fantasy is held together nicely by the steady setback line of the houses and the mature shade trees marching down the gridded streets. Even more surprising, though, was the sidewalk scene, which even in late winter was about as lively as a New Urbanist could wish for, the young mothers out with their strollers, the kids biking home from school, the gray-haired joggers doing the loop in slo-mo. By the time I got back in my car, I felt completely confused about where, exactly, it was I'd been.
The monolith that was supposed to be suburban America -- middle class, homogenous, white -- has become just one of a great many neighborhoods in a larger and more complicated mosaic. So why is this new suburbia so hard to see plain, without the filter of suburban cliche? Maybe it's because we've lost our old vantage point.
When my parents moved to the Gates in 1960, one-third of America was suburb, one-third city, one-third rural. Even those of us who lived in the first third tended to look at it from the perspective of the second. The city still held what amounted to a monopoly on descriptions and, for obvious reasons, the city didn't much like what it saw rising up around it.
Forty years later, the suburbs -- or whatever they are -- have grown up and taken over: more people now live in suburban American than rural and urban America combined. Suburbia is America, and not just demographically. Today our politics are ruled by the suburbs; suburbia's agenda -- that is, issues bearing on the well-being of families with children, around which the suburbs still revolve -- is now America's. (Even the erstwhile party of the city has moved to the burbs, with Bill Clinton doing the driving.) Suburbia's cultural power is harder to see, but that may be because it's everywhere, indistinguishable from the air we breathe.
On the drive back to the country, where I live now, or where at least I think I live, I thought about the various ways suburban qualities have seeped beyond the burbs themselves. I thought about the suburbanization of the city, manifest in freshly themed neighborhoods and malled retailing, and I thought about Silicon Valley, which in some ways represents the apotheosis of suburbia: the first time in history an important economic, technological and cultural revolution has its roots in a suburb.
I also thought about manners. Ever since Levittown was built America has become a progressively more informal place, one where social distinctions get played down, where even the rich and famous feel compelled at least to act like normal suburbanites, and where hierarchical distinctions like high and low-brow -- which are fundamentally urban distinctions -- come to seem quaint. Suburbia's too horizontal a place for all that.
I thought about clothes too. I usually wear a tie and sport jacket when I'm reporting, but not on this trip. Suburbanites dress up only to go to the city, a place where the presentation of self is far more serious business. That's probably because all you really have to present in the city is yourself in public, dressed this way or that. In the burbs you've got the house and the car and the lawn all working overtime to tell the world who you are, and this leaves you free to dress down. Nowadays everybody dresses down; on Fridays, even the starchiest urban offices go suburban.
I wondered too if what we used to think of as the fakeness of the suburbs hasn't also left its mark on the broader culture. To grow up on a "boulevard" conjured in a field is to be at home with the fa-->ade and the themed environment, with the quick-change and the quotation marks, not to mention the willing suspension of disbelief. It may be that ironic detachment is a mental habit we children of the burbs have come by naturally.
Anyway, these were my desultory highway thoughts, entertained on the long drive home from suburbia. The funny thing is, the closer to home I got, the more omnipresent the place I'd been began to feel. Suburbia, I realized, is no longer somewhere you go, or leave. Wherever we live now, it's where we live.

HEADLINE: Blundering In The Burbs;
That Sleek Suburban Political Machine

BYLINE: By Gail Collins; Gail Collins writes the Public Interests column for the Op-Ed page of The New York Times.

 BODY:
When it comes to government, city folks have always felt inferior to suburbanites. Rudy Giuliani notwithstanding, New Yorkers believe that theirs is a land of big-spending pols and inefficient public services. They also take it on faith that the suburbs have small, cost-conscious work forces monitored by diligent chief executives who came up through the ranks of the League of Women Voters.
It's all a fable. The real suburbs are usually a governmental mess -- overlapping fiefs with layers of ancient taxing districts and triple-tier services. Virtually crime-free hamlets are guarded by state, county and municipal cops. Dueling town and county plows are deployed every time an inch of snow falls. Fast-growing townships spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year under the leadership of a part-time chief executive and a couple of clerks with pocket calculators. 
 When it comes to bad government, nothing beats Nassau County, one of the oldest suburban enclaves in the nation, home to 1.3 million residents, many of whose parents fled across the Queens border after World War II to escape city life. On a resources-to-results basis, Nassau County, with more per capita wealth than Palm Beach County and a virtually nonexistent unemployment rate, is possibly the worst-run political institution in the country. Next to it, New York City looks like an administrative utopia, somewhere between Seattle and ancient Athens.
Like many suburbs that are less efficient than they might be, Nassau is such a hodgepodge of different governmental entities that even the most diligent private citizen would need a flow chart to figure it out. The county's books are a mess, and its credit rating is one level away from junk-bond status. Nassau has the highest sales tax rate in the nation and its taxes on commercial property are higher than New York City's. Nevertheless, its debt is $2.5 billion and rising, more than twice as much per capita as any other county in the state.
New York City updates its property assessments every year. In Nassau County, assessments are based on 1938 construction costs and 1964 land values. As a result, a house selling for $150,000 may be assessed for more than one selling for $500,000. Appealing property tax assessments is a local industry, and the county has to borrow the $100 million it pays in refunds every year.
"They're taxed up the wazoo, but the structure is completely out of whack and probably unconstitutional," says Michael Jacobson, a former Giuliani administration official Nassau brought in briefly last fall as a consultant. Jacobson was stunned to discover that the county had virtually no system for financial management. Each year's budget was put together as if it were the dawn of time. If an agency that spent $5 million one year asked for $10 million the next, the county executive might cut the request back to $6 million and proudly report he had achieved a $4 million saving.
Another institutional skill Nassau has failed to develop is labor negotiation. Most of the services are good -- but for what they're costing taxpayers, you wonder why a county employee doesn't appear at every homeowner's door in the morning with coffee and danish. Full-time faculty members at Nassau Community College get salaries of between $44,000 and $96,000 for two 15-week terms -- not much different than those at Ivy League universities.
At the county jail, more than 1,000 employees watch over 1,800 inmates -- while racking up a budget-busting $16 million in overtime last year. One man got four hours' overtime for making a 10-minute phone call, and a captain was paid overtime to watch the department dogs exercising. When asked what he planned to do about the overruns, the acting sheriff said he wanted among other things to hire more officers.
The base pay for a county police officer is almost $74,000 a year, compared with about $50,000 in New York City. Once the benefits package is thrown in, it costs about $120,000 a year to maintain a single Nassau cop, who works the equivalent of 39 weeks a year. The police management is unionized, too, and 80 percent of the 510 members of the Nassau County Superior Officers Association are eligible to retire right now, each with a lump-sum payment of between $200,000 and $300,000 for vacation time and other accumulated benefits. Neither layoffs nor hiring cheaper civilian workers is very likely, since staffing levels are written into the contract and various side agreements.
There are all sorts of explanations for how things got this bad. The most frightening is that, because of its age, Nassau has simply reached a crisis that a lot of other suburbs will get to in a decade or so. The political culture of Nassau is, in a weird way, still that of the small town -- the kind in which a few insiders run everything and scratch one another's backs. "It used to be a little candy store, then it exploded to a big multinational conglomerate, but it's still run like a little candy store," Jacobson says.
The county got into this fix for the same reason that New York City went into its budget meltdown in the 1970's: one-party rule. Nassau has been controlled for virtually all of its 100-year history by a Republican machine, which made up for what it lacked in administrative expertise with political finesse. When the Republican county executive Thomas S. Gulotta ran for re-election two years ago, his opponent noted that the police union was paying for TV commercials and billboards lauding Gulotta for being tough on crime. "Who are we kidding here?" asked Lewis J. Yevoli, a Democrat. "They gave $100,000 to his last campaign." Yevoli lost anyway.
The classic urban political machine came to power by giving dispossessed immigrants access -- or the illusion of access -- to City Hall. It made perfect sense for slum dwellers to give their votes to a ward captain who might produce a city job for an unemployed relative, or at least show up at the holidays bearing a free turkey. The strange thing about the Nassau machine is that it grew sleek and prosperous in a place where most of its residents already had their turkeys. The very fact that the Italian-American, Irish-American and Jewish families who moved into Nassau could afford the cars and mortgages and commuter rail tickets that were the entry price of suburban life should have made them indifferent to the normal seductions of machine politics.
Perhaps no suburban family ever gets planted in the American dream so securely that it runs out of relatives in need of better employment. But the real lure the Republicans offered the refugees from urban living was a chance to redefine themselves. "What's playing in the suburbs among the electorate is 'We're different from the city,' "says Bruce Katz, an expert on metropolitan politics with the Brookings Institution. If the cities were captive to the Democratic Party, the suburbs would insist on being captive to the Republicans.
One-party rule almost invariably leads to waste and corruption. The voters stand on the sidelines, reliably loyal, and the conflicts are played out among those who choose to be active players -- career politicians, public-employee unions, the real estate developers and other special interests whose businesses require governmental cooperation and the bottom-feeders looking for graft. The Republican machine flourished in Nassau and the Democratic organization withered, its members relegated to running hopeless races or occasionally winning office as part of a powerless minority. "If we'd all left and gone to California, nobody would have missed us," says Judy Jacobs, a Democrat and the head of the Legislature.
Inept government generally comes a cropper during times of economic distress, but Nassau County has been managed so badly for so long that it ran aground during the longest-running peacetime boom in American history. The budget shortfalls grew so large, the bond rating so lousy, that the Republican Legislature was compelled to raise taxes. A little earlier, questions had begun to be raised about the transfer of the county's health insurance contract to a politically connected company -- an economy move that led to $50 million in cost overruns.
The voters hit the same wall of frustration that caused Democratic voters in New York and Los Angeles to decide it was time to try a Republican mayor. In November, the Nassau voters rebelled -- sort of -- and elected a County Legislature with a one-vote Democratic majority under Jacobs's leadership. That majority disappeared in March, however, when one of the Democratic legislators died. A special election next month will decide which party wins control of a legislature that faces enormous economic problems, made worse by the fact that the lame-duck Republicans repealed a new tax in a fit of pique.
The winner gets to figure out how to bridge a huge budget gap, fix the assessment system, tackle that monster debt and introduce the concept of productivity to the work force. For this they left the city?

HEADLINE: Politics In The Burbs;
Soccer Mom 2000

BYLINE: By James Bennet; James Bennet is a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
For months now, Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster who studies Americans with the discipline and delight of Darwin in the Gal1/3pagos, has been conducting a focus group of just one. Every once in a while he calls up Ruth Cullison, a homemaker and former art teacher in the suburbs of Baltimore whom he has come to think of as the quintessential swing voter. Like a lot of Americans, Cullison is following the presidential campaign at a distance, with a keen sense of anticipatory disappointment.
"This is going to be like a retro election," she says. "Do I want an old Bush, or do I want an old Clinton?" Of George W. Bush, the potential retread of his father, she says, "If you're going to cast him for president in some movie, he might have the look, but I'm not sure he has anything else." Of Al Gore, the potential Bill Clinton retread, she says, "It looks like he gets lessons on being sincere -- and it doesn't work." 
 So-called soccer moms were all the rage in political circles in 1996. They symbolized the female suburban swing voters who supposedly held the key to victory in that year's presidential race. They didn't, but that's not the odd part; there is probably no profession more prone to snake oil and fads than politics. What's really strange is that this year, when the cliche has substance, soccer moms seem to have wandered off the political field.
Four years ago soccer moms were the same suburban women with demanding spawn, but they were not teetering between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole. The term "was just a good metaphor for middle-aged women who were going to support Clinton over Dole in any case," says Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. In the end, suburban women, and suburban mothers, favored Clinton by 53 to 39 -- even as suburban men voted for Dole.
But this year these independent-minded women are up for grabs. Bush, younger than Dole, warmer personally and far better positioned politically, may be able to peel suburban women away from Gore. Without a strong majority of them, Gore will almost surely lose.
Of course, no one voter is an archetype (Cullison's soccer-playing daughter is in college now), just as no one group swings like Tarzan from candidate to candidate. Yet some groups, including senior citizens and Catholics, have more ambivalent voters than others. Among the potential sources of swing voters, none are shaping up to be more powerful than suburban women, and that is significant for a couple of reasons. It points to the limits both of Gore's appeal and of Clinton's success at repositioning the Democrats as the mainstream party, the one most committed to helping children -- especially children whose parents happen to live in the suburbs.
These days, with Democrats dominating the cities and Republicans controlling the countryside, suburbanites pick presidents. "Everything that a strategist does -- everything that I do as a strategist -- is focused on suburban voters," says Doug Schoen, a Democratic pollster. "That's the story of American elections."
Suburban men are pretty reliable Republican voters, but suburban women -- whether wealthy or blue collar -- are fickle. Pollsters like to say they are "cross-pressured," torn between a desire for lower taxes and a yearning for government -- for anyone -- to help in caring for their aging parents and protecting their children from guns and dirty air. Cullison would love a whopping income-tax cut, but she suspects that the government would just turn around and raise some other taxes to pay for needed programs.
Bush entered the primary season with a commanding lead over Gore among suburban women, who have accounted for about a fifth of the vote in the last four presidential contests. In early November, when he was still Cullison's favorite, Bush was crushing Gore, 54 percent to 37 percent, among women in the suburbs, according to a New York Times/CBS news poll. But after the New Hampshire primary, once Gore had righted his campaign and Bush had begun rallying the faithful at Bob Jones University and other South Carolina hot spots, soccer moms started moving back to the Democrats. By mid-February, Gore and Bush were tied among suburban women, and remained so in late March.
Cullison, who grew to like John McCain, was turned off by the nasty tone of the Republican contest. Bush seemed to have shed the good-guy image she had found so appealing. So she started to give Gore a serious look. "But if he had just one ounce of charisma -- just one -- it would be nice," she says. "Just try to picture him being in the same mess Clinton was in and not being drummed out of the United States."
The visit to Bob Jones University, and the way Bush initially handled it, still stick in Cullison's craw. But while Bush's drive to the right in the primaries may have set him back, his campaign is still well positioned to bring in women. "The next 60 seconds are just for you, ladies," Bush's father declared in a commercial in 1966, as a candidate for Congress from Texas. George W. Bush's appeal is more sophisticated. His central campaign theme -- compassionate conservatism" -- is mostly for you, ladies.
Like previous Republican candidates, Bush envisions a limited role for the federal government. But unlike them, he emphasizes what it can do, rather than harping on what it can't. That message attracts suburban mothers. "Compassionate conservatism is geared straight to them," says Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. "They want a role for government."
Bush has used his imagery to support a message of tolerance, underscoring compassion ahead of conservatism. His schoolboy Spanish and appearances with blacks may not help him much with minority voters, but they go a long way toward reassuring suburban women that he is not another nasty Newt Gingrich Republican. For the same reason, women love to see him photographed with children. Among Republicans, Lake says, "they think of George W. Bush as their first modern candidate."
Cullison has the political essence of compassionate conservatism pretty much nailed. "I think he's trying to do like a spinoff -- and I can't imagine why -- on Clinton's I-feel-your-pain kind of stuff," she says. The slogan, she insists, doesn't work for her. Yet over and over, she cites Bush's "warmth" as his most appealing quality; she hopes he takes after his personable mother, Barbara, whom she prefers to his father.
Most suburban women, like Cullison, favor abortion rights. Even during the primaries, Bush did not overtly promise to appoint a running mate or judges who, like him, oppose such rights, using code to reassure conservatives. Cullison did not know Bush's position until I told her. But her reaction suggested that he could still win her support if he can soft-peddle the issue, since she hates blanket statements either way about abortion. "I guess it's like a mark against," she says, "but these are not big black marks, and I'm not chiseling them in stone at the moment."
As soon as he secured the nomination, Bush began edging to the center on gun control. He even defended Clinton against attacks by the National Rifle Association, shrewdly linking himself to the president on an issue on which the Democrats hold the high political ground.
Here again, Cullison has enough ambivalence to give Bush an opening. "You have Moses telling us that guns are great, and everyone else screaming up and down on the other side," she says, referring to Charlton Heston, the president of the N.R.A. "It's a ridiculous situation." She believes that there must be some compromise that does not bend the Second Amendment, and she is waiting for a candidate to propose it.
On policy grounds, Bush's chief appeal to suburban mothers, like Gore's, has been his emphasis on education, the issue that Cullison and her suburban sisters rank No. 1. His strategy is to turn the Democrats' traditional dominance on education against them. In addition to proposing his own literacy initiative, he is asserting that Democratic policy has hurt the people it was designed to help. "They own it," says Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist. "They own failure." Sound familiar? It worked for the Republicans during Gingrich's most visible social policy success, welfare reform.
For his part, Gore is trying to reveal compassionate conservatism as political sleight of hand concealing the same old Republican policy, a "risky tax scheme" that will prevent the government from addressing the schools' needs.
Cullison has yet to tangle with the details of either candidate's positions. She knows, however, that she doesn't like Bush's voucher proposal, because she thinks it abandons most poor students. But she is also skeptical of some of Gore's ideas for spreading high technology: "I don't think the answer is putting a computer in every classroom." By the time the computers are hooked up they are obsolete, she adds, and teachers don't know how to use them, anyway.
One topic that Cullison never mentions is suburban sprawl, which Gore tried early on to turn into a signature issue. As it turns out, pollsters have found that it bugs voters to think that their president might be spending his time unknotting the local traffic snarl.
Suburban women consistently rank "values" as their second-greatest concern after education, and here Bush starts with the advantage. "These suburban moms really think their kids derive role models from the presidency," Lake says. Clinton, who might have been Gore's strongest ally with these voters, has, not surprisingly, become a liability, a weakness that Bush has thoroughly exploited. "I think it's really important for moms and dads to be able to point to the White House and say, 'That person has brought honor and dignity to the office,"' he said in a commercial first broadcast in the fall.
Gore's response has been to present himself as Clinton without the wandering eye. But when it comes to values, Gore's problem is more complex than that. Earlier this winter, when Peter Hart asked his quintessential swing voter what one question she would put to Gore, Cullison replied: "Are you going to be the same person tomorrow, the same person all four years?' He seems like the ultimate politician, and Clinton jaded my view of politicians."
Months later that sense of slipperiness still gnaws. "I wish he looked a little more comfortable with himself," she says. "He seems too willing to reinvent himself and be whoever everyone wants him to be, and I don't get a sense of who he is -- unless that is who he is, and I don't want that in a leader." Bush's victory in the primaries came at a cost, but so did Gore's efforts to remold himself into a rowdy fighter in earth tones. By insinuating that Gore is a phony, the Bush camp is calling his honesty, not his fidelity, into question -- and slyly exploiting his greatest weakness among suburban women.
Apart from policy issues and their character, the candidates will also be looking to sway the soccer moms with their choice of running mate. Even people like Cullison, who do not take the vice presidency too seriously, will read deeply into the picks for signs of each candidate's judgment. "At least they're making a decision," she explains. "Then I can look at that person too."
The vice-presidential question also injects an element of drama into a race that badly needs it, at least in Cullison's view. Her interest was piqued when Colin Powell was floated as a possible running mate for Bush -- though she doesn't think Powell would take the job. And her ire was raised when her own lieutenant governor, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, was mentioned as a possible running mate for Gore. Standing quietly behind Maryland's governor, Parris N. Glendening, seemingly anticipating her own turn, Townsend reminds Cullison too much of Gore himself.
And so begins the general election campaign -- or, really, the specific election campaign for the suburbs, where the independent-minded have always wondered, Is this really all there is? In mid-March when Hart asked Cullison what she would do if she had to vote that day, she said: "I'm going to run screaming from the room. My situation is, that's when you start to consider going abroad." In the end, she says, if the economy stays strong she will probably vote for Gore, though she figures the only interesting thing about his State of the Union speeches will be to see who snores.
There's just no pleasing some people. Suburban women have two presidential candidates practically begging for their votes, and their response is to roll their eyes. Politicians had better get used to this high-handed reception. With party loyalty in steady decline, and with the suburbs looking demographically more like the rest of America, and vice versa, every person over 18 is becoming a potential swing voter.
That is all to the good. The more swing voters there are, the freer candidates are to move away from their bases toward the center -- in fact, the more compelled they are to move. Voters will probably complain even more that they see little difference between the candidates. But a debate over how to fix the public schools, rather than over whether to eliminate the Department of Education, could actually result in useful public policy. If it does, you will have Mom to thank.

HEADLINE: The Invisible Poor

 BODY:
When I saw the cover of your magazine, I looked forward to a discussion of poverty and inequality in this time of great affluence. However, I was disappointed. James Fallows gives a lengthy description of the rarefied life of today's high-tech elite. His discussion of poverty reads like an afterthought. I wish he had given equal space to the varied routes into poverty and the political, economic and cultural barriers to moving out of it.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION/RADIO;
A Radio Host Empowered to Follow His Whims

BYLINE: By VALERIE GLADSTONE; Valerie Gladstone's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about the choreographer Bob Fosse.

 BODY:
MOST radio shows are as predictable as sunrise. Dean Olsher has decided to surprise listeners by following his own fancy. Mr. Olsher, a former cultural correspondent for National Public Radio, will be the host of "The Next Big Thing," a one-hour weekend program that will go on the air this summer on WNYC. Over dinner in Manhattan, months before its debut, he said excitedly, "It will be about anything." Not about the next big thing? "No," he said, laughing, "the title is ironic."
To give listeners an idea of what he is up to, Mr. Olsher, who at 36 looks like a young college professor, has been presenting a series of specials to commemorate WNYC's 75th anniversary. The first, "This Is What I Live For," broadcast earlier in the year, will be rebroadcast today at 4 p.m. 
 As the show begins, Charles Mingus's mellow "II B.S" fades in the background. "Pop psychologists have started to tell us that it's a bad idea to equate who we are with what we do for a living," Mr. Olsher says. " 'Don't define yourself by your job,' they say." The Mingus returns before he continues. "It's such a downer when somebody says, 'That's why they call it work; otherwise they'd call it play.' Wouldn't it be great if that idea would be replaced with what Buddhists call 'right livelihood' -- the idea that what you do for a living should be a natural extension of your personality?"
The talk then turns to dream jobs, with Mr. Olsher confessing his own secret wish to play cello with the Guarneri Quartet. But is David Soyer, the cellist with the Guarneri Quartet, content? No, it turns out. When Mr. Soyer comes on the air, he fantasizes about being a tugboat captain, although not in choppy seas. What about the tugboat captain Buddy Cantrelle? The job is lonely, he reports. Running a Cajun restaurant might be cozier. And so it goes, until Mr. Olsher discovers, in his idiosyncratic survey, that nothing beats being paid for animal care.
How quirky can jobs get? Mr. Olsher visits the actress Sally Parrish backstage at the acclaimed play "Wit"; though pivotal to the drama, she has few moments onstage. The 85-year-old Dolly Gallo explains why she does not want to be paid for selling gifts at a South Street Seaport shop, interspersing gossip about her customers with salty memories of her childhood. Other unusual New Yorkers appear before the program closes with a dramatic reading by the actor Barnard Hughes of Herman Melville's melancholy short story, "Bartleby the Scrivener," whose protagonist stubbornly refuses to work. Artfully, Mr. Olsher comes full circle.
"I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about ideas for upcoming programs," Mr. Olsher said. One brainstorm led to a segment in February called "Every Day Is a New Thing to See" in which he accompanied the architectural historian Tony Hiss on a tour of Grand Central Terminal, chancing upon little-known glories. On the same program, the writer Paul Auster read from his stories about the physical space of New York. A March special on consumption, "How Can Anybody Explain the Success of a Product Like Jell-O," sparkled with segments by David Rakoff and Janeane Garofalo doing improv comedy in the style of Nichols and May.
It seems Mr. Olsher was destined to create a radio program. How many kids spend their youth, as he did in rural Hunterdon County, N.J., ignoring television and hooked on "The Bob and Ray Show" on WOR and Jonathan Schwartz on WNEW? "I always got attached to the people on the radio," he said. After college at Simon's Rock in Great Barrington, Mass., and graduate studies in musicology at the University of North Carolina, he signed on as the afternoon announcer at WUNC in Chapel Hill in 1985 and freelanced cultural reports for NPR before being hired as a correspondent in 1996.
Dean Cappello, director of programming at WNYC, was crucial in getting "The Next Big Thing" on the air. "Dean had been a standout on NPR," Mr. Cappello said. "I wanted to set him free." They had both been thinking about a New York-focused show with a magazine format that would do things differently. Fortunately, Laura Walker, president of WNYC, was already planning to expand the station's cultural programming. "I'd like to see the arts talked about with the same passion as sports and politics," she said. Later this year, the station will broadcast another cultural program, "Studio 360," with the journalist Kurt Andersen as host.
But even with WNYC's enthusiastic support, Mr. Olsher has a tough road ahead. While special series and shows devoted to music are mainstays of public radio, daily and weekly cultural programs have not had much luck. The few noteworthy exceptions include Garrison Keillor's "A Prairie Home Companion," from Minnesota Public Radio; Terry Gross's "Fresh Air," from WHYY in Philadelphia; Leonard Lopate's "New York & Company," from WNYC; and a relative newcomer, Ira Glass's "This American Life," from WBEZ in Chicago.
One reason for their scarcity is that ever since NPR became a major news source during the Persian Gulf war in 1990, news has increasingly dominated air time on public radio. "We spend five times more money on news than culture," said Kevin Klose, NPR's president, vowing a change. In fact, the network just hired Bill Davis, former general manager of WUNC in Chapel Hill, specifically to oversee that change.
Others in the field think it will take a minor revolution for public radio to regain its creativity. Partly out of frustration, Jay Kernis, who had produced popular news-oriented programs for NPR, left the network in 1987 to become a producer of "60 Minutes" on CBS-TV. For Mr. Kernis, the question is whether NPR and Public Radio International (PRI) are supplying the 600 public radio stations with the programming they should have. Radio, he said, echoing the CBS producer Don Hewitt, has a journalism part and a show business part, an Edward R. Murrow side and an Ed Sullivan side. "Right now," he said, "the Murrow side is more appreciated. We need storytellers. People are hungry for shows like 'A Prairie Home Companion,' 'Fresh Air' and 'This American Life.' "
These programs were not overnight hits. "A Prairie Home Companion" went on the air in 1974 and was only picked up by NPR in 1979. Ms. Gross, considered by her peers to be one of the best interviewers in the business, became the host of "Fresh Air" in 1975 and slowly built enough of a following to be distributed nationally by NPR in 1989. Mr. Glass's "This American Life," with its first-person stories, fiction and poetry, has been on the air since 1995 and is now one of the fastest growing programs in public radio, nationally distributed by PRI.
"I knew how to market myself," Mr. Glass said. "I hired a part-time publicist, sent out funny postcards, and offered every station entertaining spots for their pledge drives." Just as important, Mr. Glass connected with his listeners.
But charismatic hosts and lively subjects do not necessarily keep shows on the air. In 1989, NPR launched "Heat," with John Hockenberry as the host. An innovative mix of public affairs segments and performances, it lasted barely a year. "The recession came along, and the network wasn't finding the underwriting dollars they had committed to," said Steve Rathe, president of Murray Street Enterprise, which created the program with WGBH in Boston. "It wasn't NPR's own baby. I understand." Sometimes, he said, even the brightest executives cannot identify the next good thing. "The greatest successes have been built by passionate -- maybe a little crazy -- individuals scattered around the country."
Another adventurous program, "Anthem," produced by NPR in 1998, did not last quite two years. One of its hosts, Rick Karr, now an NPR cultural correspondent, thinks its concept was too complex to sell to stations. "It was more than offbeat music," he said. "We couldn't sum it up in 10 words. It was also expensive. The best way to launch one of these programs is fast and cheap."
But someone also has to be willing to stay with them while they build an audience, as Melinda Ward, a senior vice president at PRI, has done with "Sound and Spirit." That show, introduced at WGBH in Boston in 1996, draws on a wide variety of spiritual music and ideas. "It took quite a while for people to know what to expect from it," Ms. Ward said.
Mr. Olsher fully appreciates the risks of his venture; still, he is intrepid.
"I feel," he said, "as if I've found the keys to the sandbox." That must be something like discovering your "right livelihood."
