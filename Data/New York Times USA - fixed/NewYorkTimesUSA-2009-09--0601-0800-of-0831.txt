HEADLINE: Santander to Sell Stake in Brazilian Unit

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
Grupo Santander, the Spanish bank that is the top lender in Latin America, said on Monday that it was seeking to raise as much as $7.3 billion through a sale of shares in its Brazilian unit. 
 Santander's Brazilian business contributed nearly 20 percent of its net income in the first half of this year, and the bank is hoping to build on that as the Brazilian economy recovers from the global financial crisis. The offering would be one of the largest share sales of 2009 and the largest ever in Brazil.
 Santander plans to use 70 percent of the net proceeds to expand its physical infrastructure in the country, including opening new branches, installing additional A.T.M.'s and financing its commercial banking and global wholesale banking businesses more efficiently. The remainder of the money would go to improving the bank's capital structure and improving its capital base.
 The bank said in a statement that its Brazilian unit, Banco Santander (Brasil), was offering investors 525 million share deposit certificates at a price of 22 to 25 reais each, for a total value of as much as 13.1 billion reais, or about $7.3 billion. The certificates each represent 55 common shares and 50 preferred shares, equivalent to 16.2 percent of the unit's current capital.
 Santander is one of the world's largest banks, with a balance sheet valued at 1.15 trillion euros ($1.69 trillion) at the end of June. It has a market capitalization of about 88.8 billion euros.
 Emilio Botin, Santander's chairman, has identified growth in Latin America as important to the bank's future, but he has also moved aggressively in other developed markets since the onset of the financial crisis, acquiring a bank in the United States, Sovereign Bancorp, and two British lenders, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley.
 In 2000, Santander bought Banco do Estado de Sao Paulo, or Banespa, and it acquired Banco Real in 2007 through the breakup of ABN Amro. Santander now has 3,612 branches and 21 million customers in the country, for a 10 percent market share. It posted profit in Brazil of about $1.3 billion in the first half of 2009.
 A successful offering would give Santander Brazil a market capitalization of 31 billion to 35 billion euros, putting it in the same league as Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale, both of which have market values of around 32 billion euros.
 In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it had been unifying its Brazilian operations and simplifying its corporate structure. Brazil, it said, was ''one of the most attractive markets in the world given its growth potential and low penetration rate of banking products and services.''
 The offering, for which Credit Suisse is acting as lead underwriter, requires approval by the Brazilian central bank. It is expected to be priced on Oct. 6. Trading as American depositary receipts on the New York Stock Exchange is expected to begin on Oct. 7, and on the Brazilian stock exchange, in the form of share certificates, on Oct. 8.

HEADLINE: The Hard And Bitter Truth

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
President Obama is in the uncomfortable position of staring reality in the face in Afghanistan. Reality is not blinking.
 The president's handpicked point man in the war zone, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, wants more troops and a stepped-up commitment by the United States that would lock us into the conflict indefinitely, with nothing like an exit strategy in sight, or even a conception of what victory might look like.
 Mr. Obama himself has banged the war drums loudly, having already increased the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and declaring just last month that the war is absolutely essential to American security, that it ''is fundamental to the defense of our people.'' 
 Among the many problems for the president on this front is the sobering fact that most ordinary Americans do not seem to agree. A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 51 percent of respondents believed the war has not been worth its costs, and only 26 percent favored sending more troops.
 That does not bode well for an expensive and debilitating conflict that is about to enter its 9th year and would go on for untold years to come if the president decides to double down on America's military commitment.
 Senator John McCain gave us a compelling insight into these matters in a foreword that he wrote about Vietnam for David Halberstam's book, ''The Best and the Brightest'':
 ''War is far too horrible a thing to drag out unnecessarily,'' he said. ''It was a shameful thing to ask men to suffer and die, to persevere through god-awful afflictions and heartache, to endure the dehumanizing experiences that are unavoidable in combat, for a cause that the country wouldn't support over time and that our leaders so wrongly believed could be achieved at a smaller cost than our enemy was prepared to make us pay.
 ''No other national endeavor requires as much unshakable resolve as war. If the nation and the government lack that resolve, it is criminal to expect men in the field to carry it alone.'' 
 The only thing that needs to be updated about Mr. McCain's comments is that we now regularly send women as well as men off to war.
 In the case of Afghanistan, we're sending them off to fight and possibly die in support of a government that is incompetent and riddled with corruption and narcotics traffickers. We're putting them in the field with Afghan forces that are ill trained, ill equipped and in all-too-many instances unwilling to fight with the courage and tenacity of the American forces. And we're sending them off to engage in a mishmash of a mission that alternates incoherently between aggressively fighting insurgents and the admirable but unachievable task of nation-building in a society in which most Americans are clueless about the history, culture, politics and mores.
 In a confidential assessment of the war prepared for President Obama, General McChrystal wrote: ''The weakness of state institutions, malign actions of power brokers, widespread corruption and abuse of power by various officials and [the American-led NATO force's] own errors have given Afghans little reason to support their government.'' 
 A friend of mine who lives in South Carolina sent me an e-mail about a young serviceman in civilian clothes whom she and her husband noticed as he talked on a public telephone in the Atlanta airport last week. He was 19 or 20 years old and quite thin. His clothes and his shoes were worn, my friend said, but the thing she noticed most ''was the sadness in his eyes and his sweet demeanor.''
 The young man was speaking to his mom in a voice that was quite emotional. My friend recalled him saying, ''We're about to board for Oklahoma for the training before we move out. I didn't want to bother Amber at work, so please tell her I called if you don't think it will upset her too much. ... I miss you all so much and love you, and I just don't know how I'll get through this.''
 At the end of the call, the serviceman had tears in his eyes and my friend said she did, too. She wrote in the e-mail: ''I stood up and wished him good luck, and he smiled the sweetest smile that has haunted me ever since.''
 As President Obama tries to decide what to do about Afghanistan, reality is insisting that he take into account the worn-down condition of our military after so many years of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the soaring budget deficits and sky-high unemployment numbers here at home in a country that is hurting badly and could use its own dose of nation-building.
 Mr. Obama, in the face of these daunting realities, is said to be re-thinking his plans to ratchet up American involvement in Afghanistan. One can only hope.

HEADLINE: One Common Theme

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
Before the voting comes the speech making. 
 As the Senate Finance Committee takes up the big health care bill on Tuesday, the first order of business will be opening statements. Given the intense national interest, all 23 committee members are expected to make full-throated use of their allotted five minutes -- or longer in the case of the chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and the senior Republican, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa. 
 And while there will be a lot said about the need to fix the broken health care system and cover the millions of uninsured, Tuesday's proceedings will be far more about political theater than policy.
 Democrats, led by Mr. Baucus, will frame the proposed health system overhaul in the same terms as President Obama in recent days -- as an economic and moral imperative. 
 Republicans, in turn, will cast the proposal as bloated and unaffordable even though it would not add to the national debt. They will warn of abusive tax increases, cuts in Medicare spending that could hurt older Americans, and an overall government intrusion into health care. 
 Finally, amid a lot of political posturing, watch for a common theme from both sides of the aisle: regular Americans should have access to the same health benefits as federal workers and members of Congress. DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

HEADLINE: Boston's Mayor Faces Formidable Foes but Is Still a Favorite

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
While the three men hoping to unseat him crammed last Thursday for a final candidates' forum, Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who skipped the forum that night, played sous-chef to Wolfgang Puck, gleefully stirring lobster risotto at a Macy's cooking demonstration. 
 ''I met you before,'' he reminded Mr. Puck as he barreled into the room -- a line that Mr. Menino, the longest-serving mayor in the city's history, can use on countless Bostonians, too. That, his reverent supporters and exasperated foes say, helps explain why Mr. Menino is favored to place first in Tuesday's preliminary election and win an unprecedented fifth term in November. 
 Still, this has been the toughest re-election fight of Mr. Menino's career, suggesting that his challengers have at least partly succeeded with their message that Boston desperately needs change. 
 The challengers, fellow Democrats who are decades younger than the 66-year-old mayor, are two city councilors and an affordable-housing developer who has painted himself as the unjaded outsider. All have struggled to raise money, not least because developers and other big donors shudder at the thought of angering Mr. Menino.
 But the candidates, City Councilors Michael Flaherty and Sam Yoon, and Kevin McCrea, the developer, have turned heads, if only by relentlessly asking why Mr. Menino should be ''mayor for life.'' They seized on the news last week that a top mayoral aide might have improperly deleted months' worth of e-mail messages -- which has led to a state investigation into possible violation of the public records law -- as evidence that Mr. Menino's administration was either ''technologically backward'' or had ''something to hide,'' in the words of Mr. Yoon. 
 ''It clearly shows there's a need for a new way of doing business,'' said Mr. Yoon, 39, who grew up in Pennsylvania and settled in Boston after attending the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. ''For a lot of undecided voters who were waffling between 'I like the mayor' and 'It might be time for a change,' this is certainly going to be one issue that is going to tip them.''
 Mr. Yoon, a City Council member since 2006, and Mr. Flaherty, a member since 2000, have focused on winning over newcomers to Boston and progressives who do not usually vote in mayoral races, rather than longtime Menino supporters. But without statewide or national elections to energize them, those voters may not turn out in enough numbers to make a difference. 
 Jeffrey Berry, a political science professor at Tufts University, said Mr. Menino's political machine, fortified over the years through his diehard devotion to constituent services, would trump his opponents' efforts. He pointed to a poll in The Boston Globe in May in which 57 percent of respondents said they had met Mr. Menino personally.
 ''He's an incessant worker,'' Professor Berry said, ''and he's managed to extend a personal touch that is unusual in a city the size of Boston. In his bumbling, inarticulate way, he does manage to give off a sense of, 'I care.' ''
 He was referring to Mr. Menino's habit of mangling words and phrases, which has led some here to call him Mumbles. 
 After running for re-election unopposed in 1997, Mr. Menino won 77 percent of the vote in 2001 and 67 percent in 2005. His opponents have criticized his stewardship of the public schools, accused him of making backroom development deals and questioned his autocratic style. Even if their points were valid, Professor Berry said, the city, with its abundant universities and hospitals, has weathered the economic meltdown reasonably well. 
 ''Boston needs a lot of things, like every big city,'' Professor Berry said, ''but most would love to trade their problems with us.'' 
 After helping Mr. Puck cook on Thursday, Mr. Menino talked to local reporters about his aide's deleted e-mail messages, rolling his eyes as the questions went on. He never communicates by e-mail himself, he said, but not because he fears a paper trail. 
 ''I'm one of those elected officials who believes you accomplish more talking to a person up close and personal,'' he said. ''There's too much technology and not enough people talking to each other solving problems.''
 One could argue that such statements bolster his opponents' accusation that Mr. Menino is behind the times and that this brainy, high-tech city needs younger, more modern leadership. The up-close-and-personal mayor disagrees.
 ''I get good reception in the neighborhoods,'' Mr. Menino said, summing up his popularity in his signature unpoetic style. ''And I'm working every day.''
 It seemed there was nothing more to say.

HEADLINE: Bank of America Seeks to Pay Back Federal Aid

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
One year and two bailouts later, Bank of America is moving to extricate itself from Washington's grip. 
 With the financial industry on the mend, the giant bank announced several measures on Monday to reduce its reliance on federal aid. The moves are likely to presage a wider effort to repay the many billions of bailout dollars that propped up the bank during the worst of the financial crisis. 
 But the upbeat news came as Bank of America's troubled takeover of Merrill Lynch -- a watershed moment of the financial crisis -- continued to reverberate through Washington and Wall Street. Bank of America on Monday defied a request by Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York, to divulge more details about the star-crossed acquisition. Few expect the controversy to end there. 
 Despite the uproar over the Merrill deal, Bank of America and its leader, Kenneth D. Lewis, are moving quickly disentangle the bank from the federal bailout program. The bank said that it would pay the government $425 million for unused federal guarantees against losses at Merrill. 
 Bank of America is also working to convince federal regulators that it is sound enough to repay billions in federal aid, according to people familiar with the bank's plans. And on Monday, the bank named a new director to its board as part of a continuing effort to break with its troubled past. The director, Charles O. Holliday Jr., is the sixth new member to join the 15-person board since the summer. 
 Analysts characterized it as a day of progress for Bank of America, despite the nagging troubles over Merrill. 
 ''What the bank is trying to show is that it's come back to health and that it's operated solely as a private entity in the marketplace,'' said Richard X. Bove, a banking analyst at Rochdale Securities. ''But the bank is still under this enormous political pressure from Congress, the S.E.C. and the attorney general of New York.''
 A Bank of America spokesman said the bank's next step would be to start repaying $45 billion in federal bailout money. If regulators approve, the bank hopes to pay back at least $20 billion within months. 
 The bank announced its exit from two government programs on Monday. In addition to the Merrill guarantees, under which the government would have absorbed some of the losses on the brokerage company's assets, Bank of America also said it had exited a program run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that provided government backing for the bank's own debt. Those two moves came after five other steps the bank said it had taken to ''reduce its reliance on government support and return to normal market funding,'' the bank said. 
 ''We are a stronger company than we were even a few months ago,'' Mr. Lewis, the chief executive, said in a statement. ''We believe we have all the pieces in place to emerge from this current economic crisis as one of the leading financial services firms in the world.''
 Mr. Lewis has also been trying to smooth relations with regulators. He met with Timothy F. Geithner, the secretary of the Treasury, in recent weeks and has put in place a succession plan in response to regulators' concern that the bank had not thought through who would take over when he eventually leaves.
 Many stock market investors attach little stigma to the bailouts, said Jason Goldberg, an analyst with Barclays Capital. Indeed, the shares of banks that have accepted money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program are actually trading better in some cases than those that have returned it, he said. 
 ''TARP doesn't make you a bad company,'' Mr. Goldberg said. ''At the moment, it doesn't appear to bother the market.''
 But the Merrill deal is still dogging Bank of America and Mr. Lewis. Since the bank acquired Merrill Lynch, Bank of America's management has come under intense scrutiny over information it had given to shareholders. The pressures grew last week when the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform demanded that the bank give up its right to keep private some of its legal documents related to the merger. 
 On Monday, the bank missed the noon deadline that the committee had set for it to file those legal documents. On Tuesday, the bank will send one of its most senior executives who oversees public policies, Anne Finucane, to meet with Mr. Towns, chairman of that committee.
 And, even as the Congressional inquiry swirled, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is also investigating the bank, said on Monday in a court filing that it would ''vigorously'' pursue charges against the bank.

HEADLINE: Ms. Smith and the Washington Game

 BODY:
M. Patricia Smith was a smart choice to be the United States Labor Department's solicitor, the department's third-ranking official. As the New York State labor commissioner, she has shown sound and innovative leadership, particularly through her crackdowns on minimum-wage and overtime abuses. If anyone could help Hilda Solis, the labor secretary, re-energize the department at a time of rising unemployment and rampant violations of workers' rights, it would be Ms. Smith. 
 For those very reasons, some Republicans have been pushing to keep Ms. Smith out of the job. They have unfairly and cynically questioned both her qualifications and her integrity and asked President Obama to withdraw her name. 
 Their ostensible objections focus on a small pilot program that Ms. Smith established to promote compliance with labor laws in New York State. The program, New York Wage Watch, enlists workers in low-wage industries to be the eyes and ears of department investigators. Like a citizen crime watch, it encourages workers to unearth and report off-the-books violations in restaurant kitchens, carwashes, supermarkets and other places where government agencies have little access. 
 Senator Michael Enzi of Wyoming, the ranking Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which is considering the nomination, recently wrote to Mr. Obama asking him to withdraw it. Mr. Enzi claimed that Ms. Smith had made misleading statements about the program, which he suggested would turn workers and unions into arms of law enforcement and was a union-organizing tool in disguise.
 The program does nothing of the sort. Ms. Smith has repeatedly and clearly explained that its role is limited to education, worker outreach and referral of complaints -- all vital but neglected needs in the low-wage workplace.
 Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa recently became chairman of the Senate committee, which had been led by Senator Edward Kennedy. Mr. Harkin should move Ms. Smith's nomination to a full Senate vote without delay. In case they have forgotten, Mr. Harkin and the Democrats hold a majority on the committee. 
 Ms. Smith is not an enemy of business. She has many letters of support from business leaders, including the Business Council of New York State, which praised her honesty, candor and openness. But she definitely and correctly means to enforce the law. Congress should quickly approve her nomination so the Labor Department can get on with its job.

HEADLINE: French Official Indicates Reluctance on a Possible Blockage of Gasoline for Iran

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; David E. Sanger contributed reporting.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS 

 BODY:
Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner of France said Monday that he had deep misgivings about blocking shipments of refined fuel to Iran, one of the sanctions being weighed by the Obama administration if the Iranian government does not negotiate on its nuclear program.
 ''I think this is a bit dangerous,'' Mr. Kouchner said in an interview here, where he is attending the United NationsGeneral Assembly. A blockade would harm the Iranian people, he said, ''and mainly poor people.'' 
 ''This is a choice; we have to study it also,'' he said. ''But it is not my personal favorite at all.''
 French officials cautioned later that the government had not decided its position on such a measure. It was not clear whether President Nicolas Sarkozy of France shared Mr. Kouchner's reservations. But if France is to come out against fuel sanctions, analysts said, they will most likely be off the table as an option for increasing the pressure on Iran.
 As dozens of world leaders began gathering here on Monday for the General Assembly, the puzzle of how to confront Iran and another defiant, nuclear-minded state, North Korea, continued to stymie diplomats. Old strategies have proved fruitless, but it is difficult to build support for bold new ones.
 On Monday, President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea proposed to offer North Korea what he called a ''grand bargain,'' a package of incentives in return for which the North would give up its nuclear weapons.
 ''This is a one-shot deal,'' he said in an interview. ''We will deal with the core issue, once and for all, and then provide North Korea incentives in return for them fully and irrevocably dismantling their nuclear weapons program.''
 Such an approach, Mr. Lee said, would avoid the pitfalls of past negotiations, which took a step-by-step approach, and ended in failure when North Korea reneged on certain elements.
 The incentives could include economic aid, Mr. Lee said, and the details could be worked out among the five countries that negotiate as a group with the North: South Korea, the United States, Japan, China and Russia.
 Mr. Lee's proposal caught the United States by surprise. A senior administration official said the United States admired the South Korean leader and worked well with his government. But, he said, trying to solve the North Korean nuclear problem in a single step seemed ''far-fetched.''
 The United Nations Security Council was unified in imposing strict new sanctions on North Korea after it tested its second nuclear device in May. Mr. Lee noted that China, which historically resisted tough measures against the North, has joined in efforts to cut off financing for weapons programs and supported halting North Korean ships with suspect cargos.
 But that solidarity may not extend to Iran, especially were the United States to push for stricter sanctions if Iranian leaders do not respond to President Obama's diplomatic overtures.
 Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia said last week that he doubted the Security Council would support an embargo of refined fuel products against Iran. Such a step, Mr. Lavrov said, was ''not a mechanism to force Iran to cooperate,'' but a ''step to a full-blown blockade.''
 For the United States, which has viewed such a measure as a possibility, rejection of a fuel embargo would narrow the options for pressing Iran to negotiate.
 American officials plan to meet with Iranian officials on Oct. 1 for the first face-to-face talks since Mr. Obama took office. American officials said Iran's nuclear ambitions would be at the top of the agenda, though Iran has insisted it would not discuss its program, which it says is for peaceful purposes, to generate energy.
 The talks, which are to include France, Russia, Britain, Germany and China, are likely to be held in Turkey. Mr. Kouchner said the countries would meet over the next few days to develop talking points for the meeting.
 ''We welcome direct dialogue with the Iranians,'' he said. ''But I have no predetermination.''
 Mr. Kouchner, a physician who founded the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders before entering politics, called attention to the changing political landscape in Iran.
 While he said previous efforts to negotiate with Tehran had been futile, the political upheaval following the Iranian presidential election in June might give the West new opportunities to reach out to Iranians.
 The West, he said, needed to give ''intellectual asylum'' to those who protested in the streets after the election, which gave a lopsided victory to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and which many Iranians have contested as fraudulent.
 Cutting off shipments of gasoline and other refined fuel products is seen as an effective form of pressure against Iran. Although it is one of the world's largest producers of crude oil, Iran imports about 40 percent of its gasoline to supply its population with plentiful, cheap fuel.
 Other sanctions, including financial measures, could be used to pressure Iran, Mr. Kouchner said. He noted that President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia recently refused to rule out fresh sanctions, although Mr. Kouchner said Mr. Medvedev's carefully hedged words were a ''weak signal.''

HEADLINE: A $1 Million Research Bargain for Netflix, and Maybe a Model for Others

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Even the near-miss losers in the Netflix million-dollar-prize competition seemed to have few regrets.
 Netflix, the movie rental company, announced on Monday that a seven-man team was the winner of its closely watched three-year contest to improve its Web site's movie recommendation system. That was expected, but the surprise was in the nail-biter finish. 
 The losing team, as it turned out, precisely matched the performance of the winner, but submitted its entry 20 minutes later, just before the final deadline expired.
 Under contest rules, in the event of a tie, the first team past the post was the winner. ''That 20 minutes was worth a million dollars,'' Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, said at a news conference in New York. 
 Yet the scientists and engineers on the second-place team, and the employers who gave many of them the time and freedom to compete in the contest, were hardly despairing. 
 Arnab Gupta, chief executive of Opera Solutions, a data analytics company based in New York, took a small group of his leading researchers off other work for two years. ''We've already had a $10 million payoff internally from what we've learned,'' Mr. Gupta said.
 Working on the contest helped the researchers come up with improved statistical analysis and predictive modeling techniques that his firm has used with clients in fields like marketing, retailing and finance, he said. ''So for us, the $1 million prize was secondary, almost trivial.''
 Indeed, since it began in October 2006, the Netflix contest was significant less for the prize money than as a test case for new ideas about how to efficiently foster innovation in the Internet era -- notably, offering prizes as an incentive and encouraging online collaboration to tap minds worldwide.
 The lessons of the Netflix contest could extend well beyond improving movie picks. The researchers from around the world were grappling with a huge data set -- 100 million movie ratings -- and the challenges of large-scale modeling, which can be applied across the fields of science, commerce and politics.
 The prize model is increasingly being tried on work like new science and freelance projects in design and advertising. The X Prize Foundation, for example, is offering multimillion-dollar prizes for path-breaking advances in genomics, alternative energy cars and private space exploration. 
 InnoCentive is a marketplace for business projects, where companies post challenges -- often in areas like product development or applied science -- and workers or teams compete for cash payments or prizes offered by the companies. A start-up, Genius Rocket, runs a similar online marketplace mainly for marketing, advertising and design projects.
 ''The great advantage of the prize model is that it moves work away from the realm of the beauty contest to being performance-oriented,'' said Michael Schrage, research fellow at the Center for Digital Business at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''It's the results produced that matters.''
 The emerging prize economy, according to some labor market analysts, does carry the danger of being a further shift in the balance of power toward the buyers -- corporations -- and away from most workers.
 Thousands of teams from more than 100 nations competed in the Netflix prize contest. And it was a good deal for Netflix. ''You look at the cumulative hours and you're getting Ph.D.'s for a dollar an hour,'' Mr. Hastings said in an interview.
 Netflix, Mr. Hastings said, did not do a crisp cost-benefit analysis of its investment in the contest. But several crucial techniques garnered from the contest have been folded into the company's in-house movie recommendation software, Cinematch, and customer retention rates have improved slightly. Better recommendations, Netflix says, enhance customer satisfaction.
 ''We strongly believe this has been a big winner for Netflix,'' Mr. Hastings said.
 The prize winner was a team of statisticians, machine-learning experts and computer engineers from the United States, Austria, Canada and Israel, calling itself BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos. The group was actually a merger of teams that came together late in the contest. 
 In late June, the team finally surpassed the threshold to qualify for the prize by doing at least 10 percent better than Cinematch in accurately predicting the movies customers would like, as measured against actual ratings. Under the contest rules, that set off a 30-day period in which other teams could try to beat them.
 That, in turn, prompted a wave of mergers among competing teams, who joined forces at the last minute to try to top the leader. In late July, Netflix declared the contest over, and its online leader board showed two teams had passed the 10 percent threshold: BellKor and the Ensemble, a global alliance with some 30 members.
 Netflix said the contest was too close to call, and the leader board showed a slight edge to the Ensemble. However, the teams' software had to go through two data sets -- one public, which was the basis for the leader board, and another hidden one, which determined the outcome of the contest.
 The second data set was there to ensure that the winning solution really was the best at making better movie recommendations in general, and was not just tailored to get the best score from the public data set. 
 Win or lose, researchers agreed that they entered the contest in good part to get access to the Netflix data. ''It was incredibly alluring to work on such a large, high-quality data set,'' said Joe Sill, an independent consultant and machine-learning expert who was a member of the Ensemble.
 Chris Volinsky, a member of BellKor, who is a scientist at AT&T Research, said Netflix ''made a brilliant move by realizing that there was a research community out there that worked on these kinds of models and was starving for data. 
 ''Netflix had the data, but only a handful of people working on the problem.'' 
 Netflix was so pleased with the results of its first contest that it announced a second one on Monday. The new contest will present contestants with demographic and behavioral data, including renters' ages, gender, ZIP codes, genre ratings and previously chosen movies -- but not ratings. Contestants will then have to predict which movies those people will like. 
 Unlike the first challenge, the contest will have no specific accuracy target. Instead, $500,000 will be awarded to the team in the lead after the first six months, and $500,000 to the leader after 18 months. 
 The winners of the first contest said the money would be split seven ways, according to a formula they declined to disclose. The amounts each received, they said, would certainly help with a car, house payments or children's college educations -- but were not life-changing.
 When asked if he planned to take on the second Netflix prize, Bob Bell, a scientist at AT&T Research, said, ''I like the notion, but I think I'm too tired.''

HEADLINE: Russia, Plagued by Heroin Use, to Press U.S. on Destroying Afghan Poppy Crops

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
During talks this week with his American counterpart, Russia's top drug enforcement official, Viktor P. Ivanov, will press the United States to step up efforts to destroy Afghan poppy cultivation, which he said was feeding a devastating drug problem in Russia.
 The request comes just as American policy makers have swung sharply away from Bush-era programs to eradicate the opium poppy crop, which is used to produce heroin. After a visit to Afghanistan in July, the Obama administration's special envoy for the region, Richard C. Holbrooke, said poppy eradication had alienated poor farmers and was ''driving people into the hands of the Taliban.'' 
 Mr. Ivanov, head of the federal drug control service and a trusted adviser to Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, said Tuesday that eradication programs had failed in Afghanistan because they were too weak, and that the United States should apply the more muscular methods it used recently in Colombia, where vast coca fields were sprayed aerially with the herbicide glyphosate.
 ''I would call on the United States to use defoliation from the air,'' Mr. Ivanov said, citing the work of Thomas Schweich, who served as ambassador for counternarcotics and justice reform in Afghanistan under President George W. Bush.
 ''There are people who support this method in the United States,'' Mr. Ivanov said. ''The debate is going on, which is important.'' 
 Afghanistan is seen as a crucial area of cooperation for the United States and Russia, in large part because of Russia's crippling heroin problem. The authorities here estimate that 30,000 young Russians die every year from drug use. Mr. Ivanov said that 90 percent of Russian addicts used Afghan heroin, which flows into the country freely over the ''virtual borders'' it shares with central Asian neighbors. 
 The flow of drugs from Afghanistan may seem abstract in Washington, he said, but it is developing into a global security risk, providing funds to militant groups, and tainting the United States' image. 
 ''I do not back anti-Americanism, but this cannot but affect our relations with third countries,'' Mr. Ivanov added. ''The problem has to be solved somehow. There is a decision to increase the military contingent in Afghanistan, but this idea does not enjoy much support. Arms could be twisted and new forces sent there, but does this solve the problem? We can see that the poppy plantations are not shrinking.'' 
 By advising aerial eradication, Mr. Ivanov is stepping into a longstanding policy debate. Several years into the current war, when efforts to manually eradicate the poppy crop began, some Bush officials began arguing for aerial spraying, said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a counternarcotics expert at the Brookings Institution. 
 But others warned that the tactic would have devastating social and economic consequences, depriving farmers of their livelihood and potentially turning them toward the insurgency. Members of President Obama's policy team were so compelled by these arguments that they rejected the eradication program undertaken by the last administration and shifted their efforts to interdicting opium supplies and cultivating alternative crops.
 ''It's a dramatic change, not just in Afghanistan -- it's a dramatic change in the history of U.S. narcotics policy,'' Ms. Felbab-Brown said, adding that if Russian negotiators are not aware of the shift, ''either there is some real breakdown in communications, or they didn't do their homework.'' 
 Afghanistan's opium crop shrank last year for the second year running, and prices fell to their lowest point in 10 years, the United Nations reported this month. Some observers attributed the drop to successful eradication and interdiction programs, others to market dynamics.
 Afghanistan still produces more opium every year than users worldwide consume, and illicit stockpiles may have grown to 10,000 tons, a two-year world supply, the report said.
 Mr. Ivanov, whose visit is being cast as a kickoff to ''reset'' talks between Russian and American officials, said he would not present the eradication idea as an ultimatum. But he was clearly prepared to make his case, suggesting, for instance, that, the United States eradicate the poppy fields and then use some of the money it spends on antidrug programs to plant wheat for Afghan farmers. 
 ''The Afghan government is against it,'' he said of aerial eradication. ''But they are not able to defeat this monster alone. It is too strong. If they cannot deal with terrorism alone, and need help from outside, they cannot fight this monster, which is much stronger.''

HEADLINE: Emphasis On Growth Is Called Misguided

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
Among the possible casualties of the Great Recession are the gauges that economists have traditionally relied upon to assess societal well-being. So many jobs have disappeared so quickly and so much life savings has been surrendered that some argue the economic indicators themselves have been exposed as inadequate. 
 In a provocative new study, a pair of Nobel prize-winning economists, Joseph E. Stiglitz and Amartya Sen, urge the adoption of new assessment tools that incorporate a broader concern for human welfare than just economic growth. By their reckoning, much of the contemporary economic disaster owes to the misbegotten assumption that policy makers simply had to focus on nurturing growth, trusting that this would maximize prosperity for all. 
 ''What you measure affects what you do,'' Mr. Stiglitz said Tuesday as he discussed the study before a gathering of journalists in New York. ''If you don't measure the right thing, you don't do the right thing.''
 According to the report, much of the world has long been ruled by an unhealthy fixation on swelling the gross domestic product, or the quantity of goods and services the economy produces. With a singular obsession on making G.D.P. bigger, many societies -- not least, the United States -- failed to factor in the social costs of joblessness and the public health impacts of environmental degradation. They allowed banks to borrow and bet unfathomable amounts of money, juicing the present by mortgaging the future, thus laying the ground for the worst financial crisis since the 1930s.
 The report is more critique than prescription. It elucidates in general terms why leaning exclusively on growth as an economic philosophy may yield unhappiness, and it suggests that the incomes of typical people should be weighed more heavily than the gross production of whole societies. But it sidesteps the thorny details of slapping a cost on a ton of pollution or a waylaid career, leaving a great mass of policy choices for others to resolve.
 Some Americans may reflexively reject the report and its recommendations, given its provenance: it was ordered up last year by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, whose dissatisfaction with the available tools of economic assessment prompted him to create the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress. Tuesday's briefing was held in an ornate room at the French consulate. The official French statistics agency is already working to adopt the report's recommendations. Mr. Sarkozy plans to bring it with him to the G-20 summit meeting in Pittsburgh this week, where the leaders of major countries will discuss a range of policy issues.
 But whatever one's views on the merits of European economy policy, and wherever one sits on the ideological spectrum, these appear fitting days to re-examine how economists measure vital signs -- particularly in the United States. 
 By most assessments, the American economy is now growing again, perhaps even vigorously. Many experts expect a 3 percent annualized rate of expansion from July through September. As a technical matter, the recession appears to be over. Yet the unemployment rate sits at 9.7 percent and will probably climb higher and remain elevated for many months. In millions of households still grappling with joblessness and the tyranny of bills, signs of health served up by the traditional economic indicators seem disconnected from daily life.
 This was precisely the sort of contradiction Mr. Sarkozy sought to unravel when he created the commission, tasking it with pursuing alternate ways of measuring economic health. 
 To head the panel, he picked Mr. Stiglitz, a former World Bank chief economist whose best-selling books amount to an indictment of the Washington-led model of global economic integration. Mr. Sarkozy also selected Mr. Sen, a Harvard economist and an authority on poverty.
 The resulting report amounts to a treatise on the inadequacy of G.D.P. growth as an indication of overall economic health. It cites the example of increased driving, which weighs in as a positive within the framework of economic growth, as it requires greater production of gasoline and cars, yet fails to account for the hours of leisure and work time squandered in traffic jams, and the environmental costs of pollutants unleashed on the atmosphere.
 During the real estate bubble that preceded the financial crisis, the focus on economic growth helped encourage overbuilding and investment in real estate. Mr. Stiglitz argues that the single-minded focus on growth gave American policy makers a false sense of assurance that their policies were virtuous, as they allowed financial institutions to direct virtually unlimited sums of money into real estate and as consumer debt levels built with unrestrained momentum. 
 Credit enabled spending, and spending translated into faster growth -- an outcome that was intrinsically good, and never mind how long it might last or the convulsions that would accompany the end of easy money.
 A growth-oriented policy encouraged homeowners to borrow as if money need never be repaid, and industry to produce products as if the real cost of pollution were zero, Mr. Stiglitz added.
 ''We looked to G.D.P. as a measure of how well we were doing, and that doesn't tell us whether it's sustainable,'' he said at the briefing. ''Your measure of output is grossly distorted by the failure of our accounting system. What began as a measure of market performance has increasingly become a measure of social performance, and that's wrong.''
 Instead of centering assessments on the goods and services an economy produces, policy makers would do better to focus on the material well-being of typical people by measuring income and consumption, along with the availability of health care and education, the report concludes.
 Many of these prescriptions will no doubt resonate with policy makers and ordinary people. 
 Indeed, the difficulty comes in turning these general principles into new means of measurement. The report notes that its authors concur on the big picture, but diverge on the methodologies to be employed when it comes to factoring in the value of a better education and cleaner skies.
 The old mode of measurement has taken a beating, and yet the new one, it seems, is still a work in progress.

HEADLINE: A System Breeding More Waste

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: Leonhardt@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 The debate over medical malpractice can often seem theological. On one side are those conservatives and doctors who have no doubt that frivolous lawsuits and Democratic politicians beholden to trial lawyers are the reasons American health care is so expensive. On the other side are those liberals who see malpractice reform as another Republican conspiracy to shift attention from the real problem.
 Yet most people, I suspect, still aren't sure exactly what to think. For them, the good news is that the issue has inspired a lot of research by economists and others with no vested interest. And after sifting through years of data, these researchers have come to some basic factual conclusions.
 The findings are especially useful now that President Obama is promising to finance malpractice reform pilot projects, and Republicans are urging him to go further. Here, then, is the brief version of the facts: 
 The direct costs of malpractice lawsuits -- jury awards, settlements and the like -- are such a minuscule part of health spending that they barely merit discussion, economists say. But that doesn't mean the malpractice system is working. 
 The fear of lawsuits among doctors does seem to lead to a noticeable amount of wasteful treatment. Amitabh Chandra -- a Harvard economist whose research is cited by both the American Medical Associationand the trial lawyers' association -- says $60 billion a year, or about 3 percent of overall medical spending, is a reasonable upper-end estimate. If a new policy could eliminate close to that much waste without causing other problems, it would be a no-brainer. 
 At the same time, though, the current system appears to treat actual malpractice too lightly. Trials may get a lot of attention, but they are the exception. Far more common are errors that never lead to any action. 
 After reviewing thousands of patient records, medical researchers haveestimated that only 2 to 3 percent of cases of medical negligence lead to a malpractice claim. For every notorious error -- the teenager who died in North Carolina after being given the wrong blood type, the 39-year-old Massachusetts mother killed by a chemotherapy overdose, the newborn twins (children of the actor Dennis Quaid) given too much blood thinner -- there are dozens more. You never hear about these other cases. 
 So we have a malpractice system that, while not as bad as some critics suggest, is expensive in all the wrong ways. 
 Medical errors happen more frequently here than in other rich countries, as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation recently found. Only a tiny share of victims receive compensation. Among those who do, the awards vary from the lavish to the minimal. And even though the system treats most victims poorly, notes Michelle Mello of the School of Public Health at Harvard, ''the uncertainty leads to defensive behavior by physicians that generates more costs for everyone.'' 
 Something else that's expensive in all the wrong ways, of course, is the rest of the health care system. That's no coincidence. 
 If you talk to doctors about malpractice, you come to realize that the root of their objections isn't financial. Yes, the money matters, and, yes, there are horror stories about $200,000 premiums for malpractice insurance. But most premiums are nowhere near that high. 
 All told, jury awards, settlements and administrative costs -- which, by definition, are similar to the combined cost of insurance -- add up to less than $10 billion a year. This equals less than one-half of a percentage point of medical spending. There have been years when malpractice payouts rose sharply, but there have also been years when they did not. Over the last two decades, the amount has increased roughly in line with total medical spending, according to a study in the journal Health Affairs, based on a national database. 
 This being said, the malpractice system does affect the morale of doctors. It leaves them wondering when they will be publicly accused of doing the very thing they've sworn not to do: harm patients. Dr. S. Anthony Wolfe, the chief of plastic surgery at Miami Children's Hospital, told me he had been to court three times in the last 34 years and won all three times. ''But it was a Pyrrhic victory,'' he said. He spent weeks in court, enduring ''rude, demeaning and endless depositions and badgering.''
 You can understand why such experiences would lead doctors to order extra tests and treatments. 
 Perhaps the best-known study of defensive medicine -- by Dr. Mark McClellan, who later ran Medicare in the Bush administration, and Daniel Kessler -- compared cardiology treatment in states that had capped malpractice awards in the 1980s and early '90s with those that didn't. In the states without caps, stenting and other treatments were more common, but the outcomes were no better.
 Later research -- into various surgical operations, for instance -- has found less of evidence of defensive medicine. But Mr. Chandra points out that this later work (including some of his own) is not as elegant as the cardiology paper. States have not made as many changes to malpractice law in recent years, which makes research tricky. That's why Mr. Chandra's estimate of the cost of defensive medicine, up to $60 billion a year, stems largely from the cardiology work. 
 Obviously, the precise amount of defensive medicine can never be known. Anyone who sets out to find a certain answer will be able to cite one study or another. (One good example of ideology dressed up as economics: the American Medical Association does not adjust for inflation when claiming that malpractice costs are soaring.)
 Still, the researchers in the field tend to agree about the scale of the problem -- and how much malpractice reform might accomplish.
 Dr. McClellan puts it this way: ''By itself, it's not comprehensive solution. I do think it's an important element.'' Katherine Baicker, another economist who served in the Bush administration, says, ''reforming the malpractice system wouldn't be a bad thing, but it wouldn't solve the crisis of mounting health costs.'' Dana Goldman, director of the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy at the University of Southern California, adds: ''It is one of the things we need to address if we want to bend the cost curve. But it's not going to solve the problem.'' 
 The problem is that just about every incentive in our medical system is to do more. Most patients have no idea how much their care costs. Doctors are generally paid more when they do more. And, indeed, extra tests and procedures can help protect them from lawsuits.
 So the most promising fixes are the ones that don't treat the malpractice system as an isolated issue. 
 Imagine if the government paid for more research into which treatments really do make people healthier -- a step many doctors don't like. Such evidence-based medicine could then get the benefit of the doubt in court. The research would also make it easier to set up ''health courts,'' with expedited case schedules and expert judges, which many doctors advocate. 
 Similarly, you would want to see more serious efforts to reduce medical error and tougher discipline for doctors who made repeated errors -- in exchange for a less confrontational, less costly process for those doctors who, like all of us, sometimes make mistakes. 
 A grand compromise along these lines may be unlikely. But it's a lot more consistent with the evidence than narrower ideas. The goal, remember, isn't just to reduce malpractice lawsuits. It's also to reduce malpractice.

HEADLINE: Yes, We Speak Cupcake

BYLINE: By ANNA LOUIE SUSSMAN

DATELINE: Amman, Jordan 

 BODY:
 AS a young student at the multinational Aramco school in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, Fadi Jaber, a son of Palestinian refugees, always preferred his American classmates' cupcakes, brownies and chocolate chip cookies to his mother's pastries: knafah, qatayef and baklawah.
 But when he tasted a vanilla-frosted vanilla cupcake from the Magnolia Bakery in Greenwich Village in 2004, it changed his life. He quit his marketing job at Unilever and used his savings to enroll in a baking and culinary management program at the Institute of Culinary Education in Manhattan. 
 And after an internship at Billy's Bakery in Chelsea, he was ready for his next move: In July 2007, in Amman, Jordan, he opened Sugar Daddy's, the shop that brought the cupcake craze to the Middle East.
 Cupcake shops have become as ubiquitous as hot dog stands in some American cities, and have spread to Rome; Istanbul; Berlin; Seoul, South Korea; and Sydney, Australia. Now Mr. Jaber has proved that even the Arab world is not immune to such a Western frivolity. 
 Members of Jordan's royal family stop by the shop in jeans and sweatshirts, ordering boxes of cupcakes while their bodyguards wait outside. It is rumored that Queen Rania is a fan.
 Since December 2008, the shop, which also sells cheesecakes and brownies, has been in the well-to-do neighborhood of Abdoun, which is thick with embassies and upscale restaurants. Mr. Jaber has also opened a Sugar Daddy's in Beirut and in Dubai. 
 Most of his clientele (95 percent are women, he estimates) were familiar with cupcakes from living or studying abroad. Others knew them from the TV show ''Sex and the City,'' which has been shown on regional satellite stations for a few years. One customer asked him to draw lips on every cupcake. When he asked her why, she replied, ''Because that's soooo 'Sex and the City.' '' 
 Nabil al-Rabaa, Mr. Jaber's partner in Beirut, where the shop opened late last year, said that while most customers had encountered cupcakes before, there was initial confusion. ''There were a lot that would say, 'I'll take that muffin, and one of those muffins,' '' Mr. al-Rabaa said. ''Please, these are cupcakes!''
 Kamal Mouzawak, a food writer and founder of Lebanon's first farmers' market, said that the chain appeals to the region's historic sweet tooth.
 ''We're also very keen on imported successes, and following food fashions,'' said Mr. Mouzawak, who has a weakness for the carrot cake.
 Dalila Mahdawi, 23, a journalist based in Beirut, said that cupcakes were a symbol of prestige. ''Arabs who have money like to spend it on luxury items, and these are very creative and carefully presented,'' she said.
 At about $2 each, the cupcakes are indeed a luxury in Lebanon and Jordan, where per capita gross domestic product is $11,100 and $5,000 respectively, according to The World Factbook of the Central Intelligence Agency.
 Karim Mikati, 20, was one of the few men at the Beirut branch on a recent night. He bought a carrot cake cupcake for himself and a red velvet one to surprise his girlfriend. He said that when he gave cupcakes to his male friends, they were enamored of them. He also comes in for the colored cupcakes.
 ''They're amazing,'' he added.
 Along with such all-American favorites, Mr. Jaber, 31, also caters to regional tastes, offering specialty items like Blind Date, a sticky date cupcake with cream cheese frosting, and Ramadan cupcakes in flavors like pistachio with orange-blossom frosting.
 Cupcakes have also bridged the most contentious divide of the Middle East. In the last year, three online cupcake stores opened in Israel, all in Tel Aviv. 
 Danielle Levy, who emigrated from England, founded I Love Cupcakes (ilovecupcakes.co.il) with her South African business partner, Hayley Rabie.
 ''We had both enjoyed cupcakes throughout our lives,'' she wrote in an e-mail message. ''In the past few years we have seen tasted and enjoyed them more and more with the rise of their fashion -- in our own lives, film, fashion and TV.'' Chocolate and vanilla are Ms. Levy's most popular flavors.
 Debbie Stein, a founder of TLV Cupcake Company (tlvcupcakes.co.il), also saw a niche in Israel.
 ''Many of the people living in Tel Aviv know about cupcakes either because they are immigrants from countries where the cupcake is popular or they have spent time abroad and were introduced to the cupcake then,'' Ms. Stein, who is originally from Minnesota, wrote by e-mail. ''Second, we saw Tel Aviv as the perfect place to introduce such a product because cupcakes are gourmet and fashionable.''
 Along with chocolate and vanilla, Ms. Stein offers local flavors such as halva, chocolate citrus, and Pink Velvet, which is red velvet with pomegranate juice instead of food coloring.
 Ofer Yeger's Cupcakes (cupcakes.co.il) also opened in Tel Aviv. 
 Mr. Jaber, who hopes to expand further, insists his product is immune from anti-Americanism in the region.
 ''These desserts have such a universal appeal,'' he said.
 ''Not to mention,'' he added, ''walking into a party with a box of cupcakes in hand is trendy.''

HEADLINE: Colleges Take Advantage Of Cheaper Real Estate

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
The names of two higher educational institutions have blossomed recently on the marquees of some old Manhattan movie theaters. This development suggests that at least some professional schools are being pressured to expand, rather than contract, because of the recession.
 The School of Visual Arts, which teaches fine and graphic arts to aspiring professional artists, added its name to the marquee of Clearview Cinemas' former Chelsea West theater, at 333 West 23rd Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, where it now offers events for students and the general public. 
 In Columbus Circle, the New York Institute of Technology, a nonprofit private institution offering career-oriented professional education, took over Clearview's former 62nd and Broadway Cinema, which closed early this year. Next month, the school will begin offering the renovated theater to its instructors and unaffiliated groups to use for lectures, film festivals and other events.
 ''We saw the opportunity to increase our footprint in the Columbus Circle area,'' the institute's spokeswoman, Rebecca Kogan, said. ''The school is always interested in acquiring new spaces, whether it be on Long Island or here in Manhattan.''
 As the recession prompts many adults, some jobless, to return to school, including community colleges and technical institutes, commercial real estate professionals said schools were expanding into former offices as well as theaters.
 ''People are going back to school, getting new degrees, learning a new technical skill, and we've moved and placed a lot of different schools that are expanding in Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, New Jersey, and even outside New York, in Chicago, in California,'' said Brett Zelner, an executive managing director at the Lansco Corporation, a commercial real estate services firm.
 Mr. Zelner said he was working to find space for about a dozen educational institutions around the country and most recently placed the ASA Institute, a two-year college accredited in New York State whose enrollment has increased, in 57,200 square feet of office space at 2 Herald Square. In late spring, the school leased the fourth and fifth floors for 15 years.
 ''The building drew tremendous interest from several schools,'' said David Sitt, a vice president of operations at Sitt Asset Management, which represented the building's landlord.
 Mr. Zelner said schools, which are on fixed budgets determined by tuition, typically paid about $25 to $50 a square foot annually. Two Herald Square offers a ''building within a building'' layout, where the ASA Institute's students will have a private entrance, lobby and elevator bank, he said. 
 That's critical for colleges and institutes, which frequently hold classes six or seven days a week, often from early morning until late at night, he said.
 ''Most office buildings don't want schools, only because with a lot of students, it ties up your elevators for the regular office tenants,'' Mr. Zelner said. ''And because schools run until 10 p.m. at night, they require air-conditioning pretty much 24/7.''
 Neil A. Lipinski, a principal and senior managing director at the brokerage Colliers ABR, who specializes in representing educational tenants, said that if they didn't have the wherewithal to purchase, schools would typically either seek to lease an entire building or have full control of the section occupied. That may mean building their own classrooms and providing their own security guards.
 Mr. Lipinski represented the School of Visual Arts in the Chelsea cinema deal, as well as on its most recent expansion, where it subleased an entire five-story 54,000-square-foot building at 335 West 16th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues for about 15 years.
 ''Because schools of higher education do have a limit on the rent they can pay, they are intrigued now by the rents dropping by 20 or 30 percent,'' Mr. Lipinski said. ''So the combination of increased demand, being opportunistic and rents being reduced has made them more of a player right now in the office market than they have been in the past.''
 Michael Grant, a spokesman for the school, said it had added five new graduate programs in the last two years, and two more are set to start in 2010. With about 4,000 degree students and 2,400 adult education students, the school's graduate student enrollment has grown by 31 percent since fall of 2006, most of that in the last two years.
 ''Traditionally, we've seen an uptick in our graduate applications responding to a weaker economy,'' Mr. Grant said. 
 At its newest building, the school will have not only artists' studios and classrooms, but also ''several state-of-the-art workshops with a lot of equipment that is almost unheard of at an art college, like laser-cutters and computer-driven milling machines,'' Mr. Grant said. 
 ''Art and design, in terms of companies and employment, are coming together, and there's a real initiative from our B.F.A. Fine Arts Department to marry the resources of science and technology to art-making,'' he said.
 According to the New York City Economic Development Corporation's latest figures, 488,155 students were enrolled in 2007 in New York City in branches of the City University of New York, the State University of New York and all the independent colleges and universities with two- and four-year programs -- a number just slightly smaller than the population of Atlanta. 
 Sometimes, universities are not looking for a place to rent, but a place to build or acquire. Jonathan L. Mechanic, chairman of the real estate department of the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, said there had been some large education deals in the last year. Notably, the City University of New York announced that the new $135 million Lois V. and Samuel J. Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College would be built on Third Avenue between 118th and 119th Streets.
 The Art Institute of New York City, a professional arts institute, represented by Colliers ABR, leased 12,500 square feet at 11 Beach Street in the TriBeCa neighborhood.
 Mr. Mechanic said there would be more deals to come. Pace University is in the market for a large block of space, as is the New School, although their searches may take a while, Mr. Mechanic said.
 ''There are schools in the marketplace, but it just takes time for that increased demand to translate into a requirement, and schools going out into the market, finding space, and actually closing on transactions,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Cracks in Iran's Clique

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
For the first time since Iran began enriching uranium that could be used in a nuclear weapon, we have a glimmer of hope for a diplomatic solution to this problem -- as long as we are not too diplomatic, as long as the Iranian regime is made to understand that biting economic sanctions are an absolute certainty and military force by Israel is a live possibility.
 The reason we now have a slight chance -- and I really emphasize slight -- for a negotiated deal is because Iran's nuclear program has always been a survival strategy for Tehran's ruling clique: what Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert with the Carnegie Endowment, calls ''the small cartel of hard-line clerics and nouveau riche Revolutionary Guardsmen who run Iran today.'' 
After stealing June's elections, this ruling cartel is now more unpopular and illegitimate than ever. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad cannot hold a rally in Tehran without hearing ''death to the dictator'' chants more than ''death to America.'' As a result, his government can ill afford real biting sanctions that would make life in Iran not only politically miserable but even more economically miserable -- and his dictatorial clique even more unpopular.
 I wouldn't exaggerate this because this regime has never minded inflicting pain on its people, but this time it may be more vulnerable. That is why we may be in a position to say to the Iranian regime that continuing to grow its stockpiles of low-enriched uranium outside international controls, and suffering real economic sanctions, could threaten its survival more than it would help.
 On Oct. 1, William Burns, the American under secretary of state, will join diplomats from Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China for talks with Iran's chief nuclear negotiator to see whether any deal is possible.
 While real sanctions are necessary to exploit this moment, they are not sufficient. We also need to keep alive the prospect that Israel could do something crazy. I don't favor Israeli military action against Iran and hope we're telling Israel that privately. But I do believe that U.S. officials, particularly the secretary of defense, Robert Gates, need to stop saying that publicly. Gates is a smart power player. He knows better. If any U.S. official is asked for an opinion on whether Israel should be allowed to strike Iran's nuclear facilities, there is only one right answer: Refer them to former Vice President Dick Cheney's 2005 comment that Israel ''might well decide to act first'' to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, and say nothing else. Why should we reassure Iran?
 I would hope by now that the murderous crackdown on Iran's mass democracy movement by the country's oil-funded ruling cartel would have removed the last scales from the eyes of those Iran watchers who think this is simply a poor, misunderstood regime that really wants to repair its relations with the West, and we just have to learn how to speak to it properly. This is a brutal, cynical, corrupt, anti-Semitic regime that exploits the Palestinian cause and deliberately maintains a hostile posture to the West to justify its grip on power. A regime that relates to its own people with such coercive force is not going to be sweet-talked out of its nuclear program. Negotiating with such a regime without the reality of sanctions and the possibility of force is like playing baseball without a bat.
 The U.S. is being advised to explore a variety of sanctions, including encouraging capital flight from Iran, thereby creating a run on the Iranian currency. It is also considering a global ban on companies doing business with Iran's oil industry, which would be a big blow to the regime, because its oil industry -- which provides the vast majority of government revenues -- needs modernizing, and that requires foreign technological help and financing. 
 By improving relations with Russia, President Obama has done a good job of increasing his leverage with Iran. But as the negotiations begin, there is another dimension that we have to keep in mind: Obama officials want to be careful not to say that all they care about is a deal that neutralizes Iran's nukes, and, if we get that, we have no problem with those in power in Tehran. That would be a rebuff of Iranian democrats. This will get tricky.
 ''The Obama administration must reconcile how to deal with a disgraced regime, which presents urgent national security challenges, while at the same time not betray a democratic movement whose success could have enormously positive implications for the U.S.,'' said Sadjadpour.
 ''If we neglect to be vocal about human rights,'' he added, ''our message to the Iranian people is 'We don't care about you. We only care about nukes.' Ultimately, it has to be Iranians themselves who change their history. We can't want it more than they do. But it should be a U.S. foreign policy imperative not to do anything to deter the green movement's success or alter its trajectory. We cannot forget that the underlying problem we have with Iran has more to do with the character of its regime than its nuclear ambitions.''

HEADLINE: Asian Universities Court Students Nearby

BYLINE: By LIZ GOOCH

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia 

 BODY:
Attending a university overseas has long been an aspiration for many Chinese. 
 ''My father said: 'Why do you want to stay in China? Open your mind, look at the world,' '' said Bao Qianqian, a 25-year-old woman from the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo. 
 The predictable choices for her might have been Australia and Britain, countries where her two sisters and thousands of other Chinese students have studied. But Ms. Bao decided on a destination that would keep her closer to home and cost substantially less, while giving her the chance to improve her English and converse with Chinese speakers. She chose Malaysia, where she is a third-year business student at HELP University College. 
 With the appetite for higher education showing no signs of abating among the growing Asian middle class, some Asian countries are seeking to attract more students like Ms. Bao. 
 In 2007, more than 2.8 million students were enrolled in institutions of higher education outside their home country, a 53 percent increase from 1999, according to a Unesco report released in July. The United States, Britain and other Western countries continue to draw the most Asian students, but the report showed that Asians were increasingly attending Asian universities. 
 In East Asia and the Pacific, 42 percent of students who left home remained in their region in 2007, according to the 2009 edition of Unesco's Global Education Digest.
 Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong all want to attract thousands more international students. Malaysia wants 100,000 foreign students by the next academic year, compared with the current 71,000. Singapore hopes to have 150,000 by 2015, up from 97,000 in 2008. Hong Kong has not set specific targets, but recently doubled its quota for nonlocal students in its public universities. 
 All three are trying to capitalize on being able to offer a university education in English, and for considerably less than what many Western institutions charge, but each has its own selling points.
 Singapore, which has only three public universities, has made attracting the involvement of foreign institutions central to its ''Global Schoolhouse'' policy. Some institutions, like the University of Nevada and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, have established branch campuses in Singapore, and others, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford, offer joint degree programs through local universities. 
 Toh Wee Khiang, executive director for human capital at the Singapore Economic Development Board, said the government aimed not only to attract and develop talent, but also to retain it. ''The war for talent is at the heart of economic growth, and education plays an important part in creating and sustaining talent in Singapore,'' he said, adding that another government agency was linking graduating students with Singaporean employers in key growth industries. 
 Although Malaysia's schools are not well known internationally, the government liberalized its education sector in the 1990s, allowing the establishment of more private institutions, and the number of schools has since expanded to 20 public universities, 36 private universities and 5 foreign branch campuses. 
 Morshidi Sirat, director of the National Higher Education Research Institute at the Universiti Sains Malaysia, said that now that more Malaysians of Chinese and Indian ethnicity could enroll in public universities, as a result of the removal in 2004 of a quota system that favored ethnic Malays and indigenous groups, the local enrollments at private institutions had dipped. Those universities have been trying to attract more foreigners to take their place, he said.
 Hong Kong may be better positioned to attract international students, with three of its institutions ranked among the world's top 50 universities in the Times Higher Education rankings for 2008, an annual list from a magazine published in London. Still, in part because of a quota on nonlocal students at public universities, Hong Kong enrolled only about 8,400 nonlocal students in the 2008-09 academic year, more than 90 percent of them from mainland China. 
 Currently, Malaysia may have an edge among price-conscious students; Mr. Sirat, of the research institute, identified Thailand and Vietnam as future low-cost contenders. Japan has also been admitting large numbers of Chinese and South Korean students, as its domestic enrollments have declined. 
 ''There are more suppliers coming into the industry,'' said Chris Nyland, a professor of international business at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, ''but there are more and more people in China and India who can afford higher education.''
 Despite the best efforts of universities around the region, their success may be influenced by factors beyond their immediate control. Education researchers say that after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the subsequent tightening of United States visa rules, some students began looking for alternatives. Malaysia, a Muslim-majority nation, was among the countries to benefit.

HEADLINE: Chase and Bank of America Revise Overdraft Fee Policies

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, two of the nation's biggest banks, announced plans on Tuesday to drastically overhaul their debit card programs by lowering or eliminating fees, changing the way they credit transactions and allowing customers to opt out of overdraft protection.
 The moves come as lawmakers and regulators in Washington push proposals to reform what critics say are excessive charges of which consumers are unaware. The penalties, known as overdraft fees, bring the banking industry tens of billions of dollars in revenue annually. 
 Bank of America said it would allow current customers to turn off the ability to spend when their account hits zero, starting Oct. 19. Next June, the bank plans to limit the number of times each year that current customers can overdraw their accounts when using a debit card at a store. It will let new customers choose whether they want overdraft protection when they are opening their account.
 Chase plans to eliminate by the first quarter of next year a common industry practice that enraged many consumers. Instead of lumping a day's worth of debit card and A.T.M. transactions together and then processing the highest amounts first -- a practice that has caused large numbers of consumers to overdraw more quickly and pay more fees -- it will credit the transactions chronologically. Chase also plans to allow customers to opt out of overdraft coverage. 
 Consumers who overdraw often do not realize that overdraft coverage is automatic and that the bank will not simply cut them off when their balance hits zero. Many banks then refuse to turn off the coverage, even when a consumer calls to request a change. 
 As consumer outcry grows, lawmakers have moved to devise protections. Last week, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, announced that he was drafting legislation to restrict overdraft fees. His bill would require banks to cover overdrafts only when consumers ask for it, a so-called opt-in mandate. Representative Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York, has already introduced similar legislation.
 The Federal Reserve is also considering requiring banks to get permission from consumers before enrolling them in overdraft programs. 
 ''This is just another logical item for us to look at that we know has gotten a lot of attention, and there have been some legitimate issues raised,'' said Charles W. Scharf, the chief executive of retail financial services for Chase. ''We've tried to be very thoughtful about what we think the right thing is to do is for customers.''
 Bank of America said it was spurred by consumer demand rather than legislative pressure to change its policy. ''We made the decision that we had to help customers now and help those most stretched by the economy,'' said Brian T. Moynihan, president of Bank of America's consumer and small-business banking operations. ''They found themselves getting hit by too many fees, and they said, 'Help us out.' ''
 Beginning Oct. 19, Bank of America will stop charging any fees for customers who overdraw their accounts by less than $10 in a single day. It will also limit the number of overdraft fees it charges to four a day, although the bank will continue to charge a fee of $35 per overdraft.
 Chase will cap the number of overdraft fees it charges a day to three. It will stop charging fees when accounts are overdrawn by less than $5. Chase's overdraft fees are $25 for the first fee each year, $32 for the next four and $35 after that. 
 Current customers who want to opt out of Bank of America's automatic overdraft protection can go into their branch on Oct. 19 and turn off the ability to overdraw their accounts. The bank will cut them off when their debit card purchases or A.T.M. withdrawals go beyond the money in their checking account, and will no longer cover bounced checks.
 Mr. Scharf of Chase said it would let its customers know how to opt out once its system was in place. 
 Bank of America has not yet decided how many times each year it will allow customers to overdraw their accounts using a debit card at a store, starting next June. The bank will warn customers before they hit their limit, and will refuse the transaction once they reach that limit. 
 The moves could put pressure on other banks with similar policies to revise their rules. A spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association declined to comment on how rivals might respond. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo said it had no immediate plans to make changes to its overdraft policies.

HEADLINE: From Iraq Hellfire to Hospital Halls, TV Nurses Wage a Battle for Respect

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
In 1962, during the early heyday of the hospital drama, CBS introduced a series that nobly shifted the focus from the lionized role of male physicians to the hard work performed by the women who kept the IVs filled and the compassion on tap. The show was simply called ''The Nurses,'' until the network dispensed with its effort at feminist populism, reeled in testosterone to lead the cast (the actors Michael Tolan and Joseph Campanella) and in 1964 changed the title to ''The Doctors and the Nurses'' to punctuate the indignity. 
 Four decades later, viewers might feel challenged to summon a single instance of nurse heroism on a proudly elitist series like ''House,'' where week after week human suffering is relieved solely at the altar of a brilliant and unfailing empiricism. And yet in recent months, as if decreed by a separate-but-equal clause in television law, medicine's dismissed have secured their own territory -- on ''Nurse Jackie'' (Showtime), on ''HawthoRNe'' (TNT) and on ''Mercy,'' which begins Wednesday on NBC with a scrappy vengeance directed at collective prejudices. 
 The presumption in each case isn't merely that nurses remain more generous caregivers, but that they are more intuitively apt, smarter, more committed and as technically able as their superiors, with none of the accompanying arrogance. The portrayal is something else for which the class warfare brought on by the financial crisis arguably deserves credit: the enemy isn't any single Dr. Feelgood but the whole infectious culture of entitlement that has enabled his ascension.
 ''Mercy'' is an angry little soap, ''Grey's Anatomy'' as if conceived by Michael Moore. In it, Nurse Veronica Callahan (Taylor Schilling) has returned home to Mercy Hospital in New Jersey after a tour in Iraq, where she presumably acquired more knowledge than anything four years at Stanford medical school might have offered. Within the premiere's first few minutes she manages some improvisational lifesaving with a water bottle and a straw at the scene of a car accident -- and this is while she is off duty. Still, she is forced to endure insults from those who ought to express infinite gratitude. At the hospital she earns a whole lot less than the doctors and commands one-tenth the respect.
 Veronica has also come home to a genial if aimless husband and lugs a duffel bag full of feelings for a hot doctor she met on the front lines who happens to land a job at Mercy just as she gets back. Played by the appealing James Tupper, Dr. Chris Sands deeply understands Veronica's value at the side of a gurney and looks at her as if she were Angelina Jolie in Crocs. It is unfortunate that as a narrative mechanism the contest between her two rivals feels like a nine-hole round between Tiger Woods and a midlife Jackie Gleason.
 ''Mercy'' draws its most distinctive line between the haves and the have-nots unimaginatively right at the Hudson River. Manhattan looms on the other side, beckoning to Veronica's socially ambitious nursing colleague Sonia (Jaime Lee Kirchner), who's tired of dating working stiffs who expect certain residuals after ''dinner at Bennigan's.'' 
 The class divide is ugly and pronounced, much more so than on ''Nurse Jackie,'' where Jackie's best friend is a surgeon happiest in the proximity of $600 pumps. Quickly, Sonia's aspirations are shown to be untenable. On a date with a lawyer who takes her to the Costume Institute Ball, she is deflated by a ''Gossip Girl'' cabal of women who all know her escort through those stalwart networks of the rich: St. Bart's and Harvard. ''I've lost so much money on eBay, it's not even funny,'' one of them declares after Sonia proudly admits to having purchased her Robert Rodriguez gown on the site. ''I mean the stock.''
 In the days of ''ER'' nurses dreamed of medical school and even went. They married George Clooney, and there was somewhere to go. Now, apparently, they're lucky enough to shop well at discount.

HEADLINE: All Together Now

BYLINE: By GORDON BROWN. 
Gordon Brown is the prime minister of Britain.

 BODY:
THE next six months will test international cooperation more severely than at any time since 1945. That may seem strange to say after a year of global crisis that has demanded unity on an immense scale, yet five urgent challenges confront us and we cannot delay our responses.
 Crucial meetings this week in New York and Pittsburgh will determine by next spring whether a new era of collaboration is possible. 
 We cannot solve these problems immediately, of course, but momentous decisions are demanded now toward halting climate change, renewing economic prosperity, fighting terrorism, ending nuclear proliferation and overcoming poverty.
 This week starts with efforts to reinvigorate talks to secure a new international agreement on climate change in Copenhagen this December. Progress is too slow and a deal now hangs in the balance. But failure will increase the threat not only of humanitarian and ecological catastrophe but also of economic decline.
 Investment in energy efficiency and low-carbon energy sources will help drive economic growth over the next decade -- as well as reduce dependence on imported oil and enhance energy security. Millions of jobs stand to be created as this investment expands -- the low-carbon sector is now larger than defense and aerospace combined. But it is vital that we give confidence to such investment through a new international climate agreement.
 This will not be possible without the cooperation of developing countries. For this reason, Britain has suggested a program of $100 billion a year by 2020, financed by wealthier countries and the private sector, to help poorer nations develop low-carbon economies. 
 We must move toward resolving the issues that remain before Copenhagen. If it is necessary to secure agreement, I will personally go to Copenhagen to achieve it. I will be urging my fellow leaders to do the same.
 In London five months ago, the world came together to fight the global recession. And this week the world comes together again, this time to forge a global plan for jobs and growth.
 So far, action taken in concert has stabilized the international banking system and created the foundation for the resumption of economic growth. Evidence shows that for every dollar spent on fiscal expansion two dollars of growth has followed -- and estimates suggest that fiscal expansion will create or save seven million jobs this year alone.
 But now the world has to decide whether to stay the course and deliver the promised fiscal stimulus this year and in 2010. Attention must also turn to our next common economic goal: a new system of governance. We need a clear commitment from the Group of 20 on a global compact to provide a framework for jobs, growth and stability over the medium to long term -- one that perhaps even includes objectives for global growth. 
 For nearly a decade, the battle against Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere has also united us. Debates continue in many countries -- including Britain, Canada, Germany, Japan and others -- about whether we are right to be there. I believe we are: 9/11 told us all we need to know about the risks of allowing Afghanistan to become a safe haven for Al Qaeda. 
 But now we need to move to the next stage. We need to develop the strategy I call Afghanization -- building up the Afghan Army, police and civic institutions and handing power to the Afghan people. International agreement -- and progress -- on Afghanization must be among the most urgent priorities, and it is something that NATO has to address in the context of a new assessment of the war's progress by the top American military commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley McChrystal.
 The world is threatened, too, by a looming new arms race. President Obama is to be thanked for making nuclear proliferation the theme of this week's United Nations Security Council meeting. It is clear that a new nuclear nonproliferation agreement is needed urgently. To this end, Britain proposes a new and comprehensive grand bargain on nuclear proliferation: access to civil atomic energy via an international uranium bank for states that renounce current or future nuclear arms, together with a reduction of nuclear weapons by nuclear weapons states.
 Finally, this week I will be calling on every country in the developed world to help poorer nations trade their way out of recession and deliver essential health care to the most vulnerable. This will not be easy and will take time. We must make good on our pledges to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, which are already well behind schedule. But there is one step we can take immediately: to stop charging the world's poorest, particularly pregnant women and children, for medical treatment they cannot afford. 
 So today in New York I will chair an event that will see a major step toward that goal, with announcements from a range of countries -- including Malawi, Ghana, Sierra Leone and others -- some of which will revolutionize their national health care systems. This will be made possible by innovative financing mechanisms -- the focus of a task force that I established with the World Bank last year -- that will speed $1 billion to developing nations.
 After 1945, the world -- fresh from a devastating conflict -- summoned its energies to build a new international order. Now we are being tested again. In the days and months ahead, our collective resolve must hold across all the challenges I have outlined. If it can, then something bigger and even more lasting than the great reconstruction of the postwar era is possible: the creation of the first truly global society.

SECTION: Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; MOVIE REVIEW 'CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY'; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1195 words

HEADLINE: Greed Is Good? He Begs To Differ

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
Michael Moore's ''Capitalism: A Love Story'' is anything but -- something you, I and everyone who has ever watched him shamble into action, megaphone to mouth, know from the start. He might have had a crush on capitalism early on, yet anyone who thinks that the two have been on friendly terms for a while hasn't been paying attention. After years of needling big business in movies like ''Roger & Me'' (about the auto industry) and ''Sicko'' (health insurance), and giving voice to the disempowered, he has finally decided to go after the system that, in his words, is dedicated to ''taking and giving, mostly taking.'' 
 His timing couldn't be better, as the headlines and innumerable journalists, politicians, bloggers, tea partiers, talk-show bloviators and millions of unemployed, underemployed, fed-up and freaked-out citizens are making clear. It's the morning after in America (where one of the big movie hits of the year is titled ''The Hangover''), and Captain Mike is here to explain it all or at least crack jokes, milk tears, recycle the news and fan the flames of liberal indignation. Along the way, because his heart is in the right place even if his images aren't always, he also makes room for other voices, including those of striking workers and members of one family in foreclosure who videotaped the police breaking down the door to evict them. 
 Nothing if not direct, Mr. Moore cuts right to the point or rather the queasy joke, opening the movie with surveillance shots of citizens partaking of a favorite pastime: robbing banks. He then introduces some wittily culled clips from a movie titled ''Life in Ancient Rome,'' which looks and sounds like one of those educational flicks you tried to sleep through in school and which he juxtaposes with more recent totems of American power, including the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center draped in the Stars and Stripes. (The New York premiere of the movie on Monday was at Alice Tully Hall, the main site for the New York Film Festival. Mr. Moore isn't in this year's lineup, but still grabbed some of its spotlight.)
 America, in other words, is headed straight down the historical toilet, along with Nero and his fiddle (or rather Dick Cheney, who's anointed with a throwaway reference to the ''emperor''), a thesis that Mr. Moore continues to advance if not refine with another hour and a half or so of alternatingly entertaining and distracting found footage; some stirring archival images of Franklin Delano Roosevelt; snippets from charming home movies; and assorted weeping, gloating, pontificating and sensible talking heads. Some of those heads are baffling (the actor and author Wallace Shawn, enlisted to explain free enterprise); some of them are sharp, welcome, bracing, provoking, mostly when they're able to talk without too much interference from the comically mugging, slack-jawed Mr. Moore. 
 Despite the waggish invocation of ancient Rome, the story in ''Capitalism'' more truly begins where and when its director did, in Flint, Mich., after the end of World War II. In broad strokes Mr. Moore, who was born in 1954, positions himself as an Everyman whose family reaped all the usual rewards of postwar middle-class prosperity. This collective dream begins to disintegrate rather fuzzily (cue the Vietnam War), coming to a bummer climax in the 1970s (cue an unsmiling Jimmy Carter in a cardigan) and culminating in the ascension of the Smiler in Chief, Ronald Reagan, whom Mr. Moore introduces as a ''spokesmodel for president.'' Tax cuts, union busting and household debt ensue, as does some protest, notably in the form of ''Roger & Me,'' Mr. Moore's first movie.
 Mr. Moore doesn't just refer to ''Roger & Me,'' which involved his attempts to speak with Roger Smith, the chief executive of the floundering General Motors; he also includes some nominal highlights from that 1989 movie. A lot of performers like to replay their early hits, so it isn't surprising that Mr. Moore, a practiced showman, recycles images of his younger, slimmer self engaging in one of his trademark moves: trying to enter a building to speak truth to power, only to be turned away by security guards. It was faintly amusing theater then, especially if you didn't think too hard about the fact that he was hassling working people just trying to do their jobs. It's less amusing when he repeats the same routine in ''Capitalism.''
 He's on far firmer ethical ground when he doesn't use other human beings as props. Some of the more effective scenes in ''Capitalism'' involve his straightforward, journalistic interviews with people who have been abused by the greed of their employers. In one segment he visits with a widower whose wife was unknowingly insured by her company -- a sleazy practice colloquially known as dead peasant insurance -- which earned it a chunk of change when the woman died. (Even after death, your boss can exploit you.) Like many of the stories Mr. Moore pulls together in this movie, dead peasant insurance might not be a revelation to those who follow the news, but it makes for infuriating viewing. 
 In the end, what is to be done? After watching ''Capitalism,'' it beats me. Mr. Moore doesn't have any real answers, either, which tends to be true of most socially minded directors in the commercial mainstream and speaks more to the limits of such filmmaking than to anything else. Like most of his movies, ''Capitalism'' is a tragedy disguised as a comedy; it's also an entertainment. This isn't the story of capitalism as conceived by Karl Marx or Naomi Klein, and it certainly isn't the story of contemporary American capitalism, which extends across the globe and far beyond Mr. Moore's sightlines. 
 Neither is it an effective call to action: Mr. Moore would like us to vote, which suggests a startling faith in the possibilities of social change in the current political system. That faith appears to be due in some part to the election of President Obama. 
 As it happens, the most galvanizing words in the movie come not from the current president but from Roosevelt, who in 1944 called for a ''second bill of rights,'' asserting that ''true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence.'' The image of this visibly frail president, who died the next year, appealing to our collective conscience -- and mapping out an American future that remains elusive -- is moving beyond words. And chilling: ''People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.'' It's a brilliant moment of cinema both for the man delivering the speech and for Mr. Moore, who smartly realized that he'd found one other voice that needed to be as loud as his own.
 ''Capitalism: A Love Story'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Strong language.

HEADLINE: The Numbers and Health Care Reform

 BODY:
Two authoritative surveys in recent days have underscored why all Americans have a stake in successful health care reform. Too many people are being hit with relentlessly rising premiums or are at serious risk of losing their coverage to allow the status quo to continue. 
 A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that, once again, health insurance premiums rose faster last year than either wages or general inflation. A study by the Treasury Department found that almost half of all Americans below Medicare age have gone without insurance at some point over the last decade. 
 The Kaiser study, conducted jointly with the Health Research and Education Trust, an affiliate of the American Hospital Association, found that the average premium for a family policy offered at work rose above $13,300 in 2009 -- up from $5,800 in 1999. The average employer paid more than $9,800 of that, while the workers contributed more than $3,500. The workers were also hit with larger co-payments and deductibles, while their policies often offered fewer benefits. 
 The premium increase this year was a relatively modest 5 percent, far below the 13 percent rate in two previous years. But that still far outpaced a 3.1 percent growth in wages and a small decrease in inflation. Absent meaningful reform, worse is sure to come. 
 Kaiser estimates that, if increases revert to the average of the last 10 years, health insurance premiums in 2019 will average a whopping $30,800, which it calls ''a very scary number.'' More immediately, a fifth of the employers surveyed said they are very likely to increase the amount that employees pay for premiums next year.
 Meanwhile, the Treasury Department's study highlighted how vulnerable Americans are to losing their coverage. 
 It found that, between 1997 and 2006, 48 percent of nonelderly Americans went without health insurance for at least one month, 41 percent lacked coverage for at least six months and 36 percent were uncovered for a year or more. That happened during a decade of strong economic growth. The number of uninsured is likely to be higher over the next decade, the study warns. 
 The argument for reform seems clear. Americans without insurance need guaranteed access to coverage. Those with insurance need a guarantee that they will not be dropped by their insurers and will be able to buy an affordable policy if their employers decide to drop coverage. And ways must be found to slow the rise in health care costs and ease the burden of paying for insurance.

HEADLINE: House Bill Extends Jobless Benefits for Some

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Jobless workers in imminent danger of losing their unemployment benefits would get a 13-week reprieve under legislation approved by the House on Tuesday. 
 The House bill applies to 27 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, all of which have unemployment rates of 8.5 percent or higher. It would not, however, provide extra benefits in states with lower levels of joblessness, including Nebraska, North Dakota and Utah.
 The bill passed easily, 331 to 83, although the two parties cast the measure in different lights.
 Democrats said the relief was still needed despite signs that their policies were reviving the economy. Republicans said the high jobless rate proved that the Obama administration's economic strategies were not working.
 Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.
 The bill, if enacted, would offer a reprieve to more than 300,000 jobless workers who otherwise would run out of unemployment compensation at the end of September, as well as to the more than one million people expected to exhaust their benefits by the end of the year.
 ''Across America, there are people who are hanging on by a thin economic lifeline called unemployment insurance,'' said the bill's sponsor, Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington. 
 Mr. McDermott said the bill was necessary to preserve ''the positive signs we are beginning to see in the economy.''
 Representative Geoff Davis, Republican of Kentucky, which would qualify for more benefits under the bill, said the further extension of benefits was ''yet another sign of the failure of this administration's stimulus plan to create jobs.''

 10 P.M. (13) WALLACE STEGNER On the centennial of his birth, a portrait of this Pulitzer Prize-winning author often called the ''dean of Western writers''; his book ''The Wilderness Letter'' became a manifesto of the conservation movement.
 10 P.M. (ABC) EASTWICK In this new series based on the 1984 novel by John Updike and the 1987 movie starring Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon and Cher, three comely but very different women in a seaside village open a Pandora's box when a mysterious, terribly wealthy man arrives in town. Ashley Benson, Lindsay Price, Rebecca Romijn and Paul Gross star. Veronica Cartwright, above right, who worked wonders with cherry pits in the original film, also shows up here. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

HEADLINE: First Course at Tavern: A Clash With Labor

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
A SURPRISING menu item could dominate the future carte du jour at the landmark Central Park restaurant Tavern on the Green: a nasty labor dispute. If it proceeds beyond negotiation posturing, it could be the first major restaurant labor showdown in years, pitting the new operator of a legendary restaurant against one of the city's most aggressive unions.
 Dean J. Poll, who was awarded the license to Tavern by the Parks Department last month, has made a proposal to the union representing some 400 Tavern employees that would nullify most of the provisions of the current contract. 
 The proposal by Mr. Poll -- who runs the nonunionized Boathouse restaurant in Central Park -- calls for significant reductions in many employees' wages, overtime pay, seniority and vacation time, and changes in pension, benefit and scheduling provisions. 
 Peter Ward, the president of the restaurant's union, the New York Hotel Trades Council, responded bluntly. ''This proposal is an insult, an atrocity and a slap in the face of not only this union but every New Yorker,'' he said in an interview. ''We will strike this guy for a hundred years over this, and we will never, ever give in.'' 
 A lawyer for Mr. Poll, Barry B. LePatner, said in response to e-mail messages that Mr. Poll ''is sensitive to workers' rights but also believes that management needs to be able to run the restaurant,'' adding that ''outdated rules can't work in the new economy, and ultimately ensuring that the restaurant is financially viable will ensure that the workers have their jobs for many years to come.'' 
 He added that Mr. Poll is ''hopeful that a satisfactory agreement with the union will be reached that will ensure an excellent workplace environment.'' He did not respond specifically to the strike threat. 
 Though representatives of more than 150 companies expressed interest in Tavern's new license when it was offered to restaurateurs earlier this year, some walked away because of Tavern's high costs, including its contract with the waiters, cooks and other workers. 
 Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant based in New York who is not involved in the negotiations, said that ''no one wants to be anti-labor, but Dean Poll is wise to go full tilt.'' He added: ''It is a good bargaining position for him to be taking in this recession.'' 
 But the union has proved resilient to such strategic maneuvers before. 
 In 1989, a bitter confrontation at Tavern over whether the union should be allowed to represent the workers cut business by as much as 60 percent. It took 10 weeks to resolve the messy public dispute. Restaurant patrons who crossed the picket line stepped from their taxis into a gantlet of insults. 
 The conflict became a political football and a test of wills between the union and Warner LeRoy, Tavern's operator at the time, who ultimately had to accept the union. 
 In 1999 its members picketed the Rainbow Room for eight months and created a public relations debacle for its operator, the Cipriani family, which eventually accepted a labor agreement. 
 In 2005, Mr. Ward's union became a formidable opponent of the new owners of the Plaza Hotel, who sought the landmark's sweeping conversion to condominiums and stores. Eventually Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had to intervene in the ugly confrontation to broker a compromise that preserved nearly half the hotel rooms and kept the jobs of more than a third of the Plaza's 900 workers.
 Mr. LePatner said that ''Mr. Poll has been trying to get a meeting with the union for more than three weeks,'' adding that the union asked for a proposal before it would meet. Mr. LePatner added that ''Mr. Poll's initial proposal does not change salary, health care or pension benefits for the workers already employed at the restaurant.'' 
 But the five-page 23-section proposal sent to the union recently, a copy of which was furnished to The New York Times, would nullify many of the provisions in the current collective bargaining agreement. 
 Mr. Poll proposes a two-tier system under which all newly hired employees are paid minimum wage (for tipped waiters, this would amount to $4.65 an hour, instead of the current $5.26). It provides no advance notice for layoffs or reduction in hours. And it would pay the banquet staff an hourly rate to be negotiated, without tips. Now they are paid $5.26 an hour, plus tips.
 Depending on their shifts and seniority, union waiters have been making from $35,000 to $45,000 a year including tips, and senior banquet waiters as much as $60,000 a year. Under the management proposal, Mr. Ward said, those salaries would be substantially reduced. 
 The proposal would also remove job categories from union jurisdiction, such as sous-chefs and coat-check workers, and would require more flexibility in assigning workers to different jobs. Seniority would not govern the amount of employees' vacation time under the proposal, and management would be given the right to change schedules without prior notification. 
 The proposal would also move some employees from the union pension plan and into a plan of Mr. Poll's choosing, and would no longer require the operator to absorb increases in medical-coverage costs. 
 In August, after 33 years under the management of the LeRoy family, the Parks Department -- Tavern's landlord -- awarded the restaurant's 20-year operating license to Mr. Poll. On Sept. 9, the current operator, Tavern on the Green Limited Partnership, filed for bankruptcy, citing liabilities of as much as $50 million, so it could keep operating until Dec. 31. 
 Mr. Poll has said he hopes to keep Tavern open after he takes over the license Jan. 1, while he conducts renovations to which he has committed $25 million, according to the Parks Department. Mr. Ward did not specifically suggest a strike on Jan. 1, but rather, ''at the time that best suits us.'' 
 Of critics who say that Tavern can't make money without a change in work rules and salary structure, Mr. Ward said, ''Tavern was an immensely profitable restaurant for every year it has been a union restaurant -- except one,'' referring to the 2008 economic crisis. He added that it made money ''under our contract and can continue to be successful.'' 
 Though Mr. Poll has been designated the new licensee, he and the city have not agreed to terms, and no contract has been signed. The Parks Department declined comment when asked whether a labor dispute would hinder such a contract. The Parks Department requires that the new operator have union employees for 90 days. It did not specify that a union contract would have to be negotiated. 
 The new Tavern management has no obligation to honor the previous labor contract, said Gene Eisner, a labor lawyer in Manhattan for 45 years, ''but it must bargain in good faith.'' 
 According to Mr. Ward, Mr. Poll ''is going to settle a contract with us the easy way or the hard way.'' 
 ''He can sit down and negotiate with us in good faith to work out a fair contract,'' Mr. Ward added. ''Or he can do it the hard way, and we will drive his customers away, and when he gets to the point where he has no business and no choice, then he'll sign a contract with us.''
 But Mr. LePatner said that ''throughout the country, forward-looking union leaders are working on behalf of their members to find common ground with management to ensure financial viability because workers can only get jobs at businesses that can keep their doors open.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Census Uses Telenovela to Reach Hispanics

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Perla Beltran, a young woman from the wrong side of the tracks in New York, has suffered a great deal lately -- her husband, a thief, has been murdered and she has been associating with lowlifes. But she thinks she has found a way out: as a recruiter for the United States Census Bureau.
 Ms. Beltran, a character in the popular Spanish-language soap opera ''Mas Sabe el Diablo,'' ''The Devil Knows Best,'' represents only one element of the government's yearlong effort to garner trust among Hispanics, an ethnic group that has been historically wary of the decennial census process.
 In addition to the typical public service announcements and advertisements, the Census Bureau is helping to compose a remarkable story line featuring the Perla Beltran character on the telenovela, amid the genre's usual tales of sex scandals, unspeakable illnesses and implausible villains. It may be the first plotline on a soap opera blessed by the United States government. 
 ''It's the perfect vehicle for product placement,'' said Patricia Gaitan, a communications consultant for the bureau, as she watched the taping here last week. She swiftly gave the technique a new name: ''people placement.''
 The coordination between the Census Bureau and the ''Diablo'' producers at the Telemundo network also strikes some as an unusual intrusion by the government. Although a bureau staff member met with the writer of ''Diablo'' and provided props for the production, the network's president, Don Browne, said it maintained ''total creative independence.''
 Many Americans are unfamiliar with telenovelas like ''Diablo,'' and most efforts to introduce them to English-speaking audiences have flopped. But among Spanish-speaking viewers, the five-nights-a-week dramas are enormously popular, making them a prime way to encourage Hispanics to be counted next year.
 ''We've been evangelizing,'' Mr. Browne told Ms. Gaitan and other visitors between takes on the set last week. ''Hopefully, we'll get the message across without hitting viewers over the head.''
 The message is the same one Census Bureau officials are trying to emphasize at nearly every turn: Do not be afraid to be counted. 
 Next year's census is expected to show a substantial increase in the Hispanic population, which is already the fastest-growing ethnic group in the United States. The government estimated in May that 46.9 million Hispanics lived in the Unites States last year, up from about 33 million during the last census in 2000. Census figures are analyzed to apportion Congressional districts and distribute about $400 billion in federal money each year.
 But the census is a delicate subject for some minorities, including Hispanics. Language barriers and fear of filling out forms for the government limited participation in earlier counts. 
 Census officials contend that Hispanics were undercounted in 2000 by about 0.7 percent, or roughly a quarter of a million people. Other scientific studies assert that as many as 1.3 million Hispanics were not counted. 
 With the census story line, ''we're trying to fight the fear,'' Aurelio Valcarcel, an executive producer at Telemundo Studios, said. 
 The campaign is not merely about civic participation. Next year's count is likely to mean more advertising revenue for Telemundo, a unit of NBC Universal, and other Spanish-language networks over time. Nielsen Ratings sample of television households is directly tied to the census results. 
 ''It's very good for our business,'' Mr. Browne said in an interview, given that the census numbers should help substantiate audience growth. 
 With the enduring debates over immigration, some people are wary of giving their name, address and information about their household to the government. ''In some cases they're trying to hide from the government,'' said Stacy Gimbel, a bureau spokeswoman who observed the taping. ''We're trying to convince them that their information is safe.''
 Next year, in a first for the bureau, about 13 million households will receive census questionnaires in English and Spanish. But other issues compound the bureau's challenge in trying to achieve a comprehensive count.
 Some advocates warn that the recession has forced more families to share a single residence, sometimes in violation of housing codes or leases. Those families may be reluctant to provide information, said Arturo Vargas, the executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.
 Some Hispanic religious leaders are urging their congregations to boycott the count, which will begin next spring, as a way of forcing Congress to act on immigration reform. Most Hispanic advocacy groups oppose such a move. 
 Telemundo is taking a stand in favor of the census, though it says it covers other points of view in its news programs. Mr. Vargas said Telemundo and Univision, the country's dominant Spanish-language network, which is conducting a public service campaign of its own, were being ''good corporate citizens.'' 
 Telemundo producers started considering a census plot in the spring at the start of the network's yearlong campaign to increase census participation. Eventually a census employee worked directly with the writer of ''Diablo.'' 
 In an episode that will be shown in early October, Ms. Beltran is selling empanadas, stuffed pastries, on the street when a Census Bureau employee approaches her. The ensuing conversation amounts to Census 101, explaining why the count matters. 
 Soon Ms. Beltran, who is played by Michelle Vargas, will become a census worker. At the Telemundo Studios last week, Ms. Beltran was shown completing a skills test for her census job application. After handing in the test, she asks about the census, and the test administrator tells her that the information collected is ''estrictamente confidencial,'' or strictly confidential. 
 Mr. Valcarcel said previous novelas had included social messages about drug abuse and workplace violence. Working with a government agency, though, is a new strategy. He said he wanted the census information to feel as organic as possible. ''I don't want to feel like it's a Discovery Channel documentary,'' he said. 
 Ms. Gaitan and other consultants smiled as they watched the taping and spotted census pamphlets and logos on the set. ''Do you see all the brochures?'' one of the marketers asked.
 ''Diablo'' ends its run next February. While the network has not determined if it will add census plots to any other telenovelas, Mr. Browne said that another contemporary series was in the works that would ''lend itself to this.''
 For more traditional forms of communication, the government has allocated hundreds of millions of dollars for census community outreach, part of which will be devoted to Spanish-language advertising.
 Although it is hard to put a dollar figure on the people placement in ''Diablo,'' it may prove to be even more valuable.
 Spanish-language networks say they have struggled for years to achieve advertising budget parity with the broader media marketplace. Post-census, Mr. Browne contends, they will be much closer to that goal.
 In a business presentation last year for his bosses at NBC's parent company, General Electric, Mr. Browne concluded by saying, ''If you think it's a good business now, wait until after the census.''

HEADLINE: After a Tornado, a Kansas Town Rebuilds Green

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: GREENSBURG, Kan. 

 BODY:
Even if it were the only one of its kind, Mike Estes's brand-new, energy-efficient, wind-powered, water-conserving, environmentally sensitive John Deere dealership here would attract considerable attention in Kansas. This is a state that consistently ranks among the top 10 in oil and natural gas production, and routinely elects to Congress skeptics on matters of energy conservation and environmental regulation.
 But in July, Mr. Estes's 28,500-square-foot, $3 million BTI Greensburg dealership (BTI stands for Bucklin Tractor and Implement, the name of the original store, which has since expanded to four locations) earned the United States Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design platinum certification, the highest designation, Six other buildings anticipate LEED certification.
 While many of the nation's biggest cities do not have a single platinum development, BTI was not even the first building in Greensburg to receive it. That distinction goes to the 1,670-square-foot Arts Center at the center of town, designed, built and opened a year ago by graduate students of the University of Kansas School of Architecture. The center is powered by windmills and a bank of solar photovoltaic panels, and heated and cooled by a state-of-the-art geothermal system. It was the first LEED-platinum building in Kansas. 
 That such visionary development is occurring in this sun-washed, wind-whipped agricultural community of 900 residents can be attributed to a single event: a monstrous tornado in May 2007 that killed 11 people. 
 In the weeks after, as federal and state officials assessed the damage and estimated the cost of rebuilding, business and civic leaders gathered with residents to come up with a reconstruction plan. The most important goal, city leaders said in interviews, was to build a sense of economic dynamism that would generate new businesses and jobs and persuade Greensburg's talented young people not to leave. 
 ''We had the chance to start over,'' Mr. Estes said. ''What do you do when you start with a clean slate? You want to build it better. Right?''
 And so his company decided to incorporate in the new dealership -- the old one was wrecked in the tornado -- design features like skylights and electrical systems that cut energy use by half, plumbing fixtures that save almost 40,000 gallons of water a year, and two wind turbines out back that spin in a steady wind and generate a part of the dealership's electricity.
 The first gatherings after the tornado produced a surprising civic consensus in a community where ''green roofs'' and the ''heat island effect'' were foreign concepts. As Dea Corns, a real estate agent who manages the Greensburg State Bank with her husband, Thomas V. Corns, recalls, ''We decided to put the 'green' in Greensburg.'' 
 These days, the technical language of the green building world is in everyday use as Greensburg sets out to achieve the distinction that the former Kansas governor, Kathleen Sebelius, now the secretary of Health and Human Services, described in a news conference two years ago. ''We have an opportunity of having the greenest town in rural America,'' she said.
 Last year, leaders approved a redevelopment plan drawn up by the architectural firm BNIM, based in Kansas City, Mo., that called for Greensburg to be a ''truly sustainable community that balances the economic, ecological and social impacts of development,'' and ''a laboratory for research on sustainable design and community development.''
 Greensburg also approved an ordinance requiring that all municipal buildings larger than 4,000 square feet be built to LEED-platinum standards, putting it in the forefront among communities in the United States in energy conservation standards. 
 BTI's John Deere dealership is a small part of a bustling panorama of development whose total cost is expected to reach $100 million. Financing comes from a mix of federal, state and local sources, and to a surprising degree, private donations.
 In April, for example, the city's 10,000-square-foot $3.4 million business incubator opened on Main Street. Financing for the office building, which offers temporary space at low rents for 10 small businesses, was provided by Frito-Lay, the federal Department of Agriculture and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio.
 The 4,700-square-foot $2.9 million City Hall, designed to achieve LEED platinum designation, is about to open at the center of town.
 A block away, the 18,800-square-foot Kiowa County Courthouse, built in 1914, is being renovated at a cost of $5 million. The reconstruction includes highly insulated walls, geothermal pumps for heating and cooling, high-performance lighting and controls and other environmental and clean energy features that qualify for LEED gold designation. 
 Along United States Route 54, the Kiowa County Memorial Hospital, a 48,500 square-foot, $25 million medical building, is under construction and scheduled to open next year. 
 According to Kiowa County, the new hospital is seeking to become the first LEED platinum critical-access operation in the country. The building incorporates natural light; high-performance insulating glass; light-sensing dimmers; motion sensors; an on-site wind turbine to generate electricity; a bio-swale filtration system to process all waste water from the laundry, showers and lavatories; and a system to capture rain water to flush toilets. Those and other energy conservation features mean that it will not need fuel oil boilers to back up its heating and cooling systems, drastically reducing costs. 
 ''People saw that a terrible tragedy could be made into something valuable and durable and better,'' said Daniel Wallach, founder and executive director of Greensburg GreenTown, a nonprofit organization that has provided technical assistance and organizational support for the reconstruction. ''They said, 'Look what we can do when we think about this in a new way.' ''
 Not everybody in town is so sure. Some residents and business owners, particularly in the months after the tornado, expressed concerns that the green plan would increase costs and slow the process of getting construction permits. 
 But Mr. Estes and others who have added energy-saving designs and equipment report that the higher initial installation costs have been more than offset by significantly lower operating costs. Mr. Estes said he was saving the equivalent of $25,000 to $30,000 annually in energy and water costs compared to his old building.
 Greensburg's green showcase also includes a 32-unit LEED-certified town house complex, comprising 40,000 square feet and built at a cost of $4 million, and 200 new homes, most of which were built with energy efficiency, water conservation and other environmental values in mind. 
 The National Renewable Energy Lab, a unit of the federal Department of Energy that advised the city in green development, tested 100 of Greensburg's recently built homes and found that, on average, they consumed roughly 40 percent less energy than those they replaced. 
 Greensburg is also among the first in the nation to light its streets with LED lamps, which focus their beams on the ground and make it possible to see the stars. The new lamps also save 70 percent in energy and maintenance costs over the old sodium vapor lights, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 tons a year, city leaders say. 
 And Greensburg is planning to generate all of its electricity from the wind. Outside of town, John Deere Renewable Energy, an Iowa-based unit of the equipment maker that has built wind farms in other Midwest states, is planning to break ground on a 12.5-megawatt wind farm that consists of 10 turbines capable of supplying electricity to 4,000 homes. 
 Mr. Estes is so enthusiastic that he embraced a new clean energy business plan that responds directly to the city's goal of generating new jobs.
 BTI is now the national distributor of Canadian-built Endurance Wind Power turbines capable of powering homes and businesses. ''Two years ago, the whole town needed to be rebuilt,'' Mr. Estes said. ''And we needed industry. We are learning that green makes sense.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Resume Rally; Dollar at Year's Low

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The stock market's rally goes on.
 After a day of losses, stocks rebounded on Tuesday as top officials of the Federal Reserve held a two-day meeting to discuss interest rates, inflation and the economy. With big banks and industrial companies taking the lead, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.01 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 9,829.87. JPMorgan Chase and Caterpillar were the biggest gainers in the Dow's index of 30 blue-chip stocks.
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,071.66, while the Nasdaq composite index picked up 8.26 points, or 0.4 percent, to end at 2,146.30. 
 Meanwhile, the value of the dollar slipped again against a half-dozen major world currencies, hitting its lowest level in a year against the euro, at $1.479.
 Investors who fled to the relative safety of the dollar during last year's financial crisis are now streaming away from the currency for a variety of reasons, pushing its value lower. Some are seeking higher returns in other currencies and different investments. Others worry that emergency financial interventions by the government and the Fed have laid the groundwork for higher inflation in the future.
 Despite worries that foreign governments -- China above all others -- are losing their appetite for American debt and dollars just as the United States is racking up huge new deficits, analysts said that overseas dollar holdings remained strong. This June, 36.4 percent of China's reserves were Treasuries, up from 29.6 percent last year, said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 ''The dollar's weakness is cyclical,'' said Mr. Chandler, who expects the dollar to rebound when the Fed eventually raises interest rates. ''The dollar will begin finding more traction, assuming that growth in the U.S. is going to be stronger than most people expect.''
 More optimistic analysts say they are encouraged by the responses to Wall Street's down days. The S.& P. 500 has closed lower five times, and four of those trading sessions were followed by gains, showing that investors are buying into the market when it dips. 
 Some are bracing for a correction, but so far, the recent rally has kept chugging on, carrying the Dow to within striking distance of 10,000 points -- a threshold the index last saw in October.
 ''Could we pull back?'' said Ryan Detrick, a strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research. ''Yes. But we don't think there's any way we could crash.''
 Shares of Macy's rose 5.5 percent on Tuesday after Citigroup analysts upgraded the department store chain to buy and raised their price targets. Other shares of retailers like Dillard's, J. C. Penney and Saks rose, though less so. 
 As financial firms and oil companies climbed higher in the stock market, the prices of gold and crude oil surged back after dipping one day earlier. Recently, the value of the dollar and prices of commodities have jagged in different directions, as investors use oil or gold as defensive bets against inflation.
 But the Fed's outlook on inflation is still muted, even though crude oil prices have more than doubled since their lows of $33 a barrel this winter, rising to $71.55 a barrel on Tuesday, up $1.84 for the day, and the costs of gasoline, plane tickets, health care and other consumer items are rising.
 At its meeting this week, the Fed is widely expected to leave its target short-term interest rate at a record low of nearly zero. But investors are looking for some guidance about whether the central bank will begin scaling back any more of its emergency financing programs. This summer, the Fed's Open Market Committee announced that it would wind down a program to buy $300 billion in Treasury securities this October.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 10/32, to 101 16/32. The yield fell to 3.44 percent, from 3.48 percent late Monday.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills, 52-week bills and two-year notes:

HEADLINE: Travelers' Fee Can Help Fight Diseases

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
A United Nations program that has raised $1.2 billion over the past three years for the treatment of H.I.V./AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis through a small fee added to airline tickets sold in 15 countries is going global.
 Starting in January, travelers in the United States and other countries buying airline tickets through some of the world's largest booking companies -- including Travelocity, Orbitz and other companies owned or served by Sabre, Travelport and Amadeus -- will have the option of adding $2 to their cost to support the fund-raising efforts of Unitaid, which fights life-threatening diseases in poor countries. 
 Philippe Douste-Blazy, chairman of the organization and the under secretary general at the United Nations charged with developing new financing mechanisms for development projects, said he expected the extended program to add hundreds of millions of dollars to Unitaid's coffers each year. 
 In 2006, when Mr. Douste-Blazy was the French foreign minister, he and Jacques Chirac, who was then the French president, and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil conceived the idea of taxing airline tickets and subsequently persuaded 16 countries to participate -- one has not yet had a chance to contribute. He said the tax currently applies to 7 percent to 10 percent of airline tickets sold and accounts for three-quarters of Unitaid's financing. ''This new program will be the first global voluntary citizen contribution system, and it comes at a very important time,'' Mr. Douste-Blazy said. 
 He noted that government support for development aid is decreasing because of the economic crisis, which will make United Nations targets known as the Millennium Development Goals harder to achieve. The eight goals -- which include reducing extreme poverty by half and providing universal primary education -- were adopted in 2000 at a meeting of world leaders, but they are looking more and more elusive as the 2015 deadline approaches.
 A United Nations report released last week found that donations have fallen $35 billion short of the pledges made by the Group of Eight industrialized countries in 2005. Similarly, aid to Africa has fallen $20 billion short of the total pledged. 
 ''The consequences for developing countries are devastating, particularly for health care,'' Mr. Douste-Blazy said.
 The program, to be unveiled Wednesday at the United Nations under the name Massive Good, will work through various channels that people use to buy airline tickets. At the point of purchase, customers will be asked to indicate their willingness to make the contribution, while corporate travel departments will be asked to agree to add the donation to each ticket they buy for employees' travel. Countries that have already agreed to the tax will continue to pay it.
 Unitaid uses the money it raises to do what Daniel Altman, president of the consulting firm North Yard Economics, calls ''innovative spending.'' For instance, the partners it supports were able to use its buying power to coax drug companies to create pediatric doses of anti-retroviral medicines so parents would not have to break pills originally intended for adults.
 Because Unitaid finances drugs for three-quarters of the children in the world receiving anti-retrovirals, it could guarantee a market for those drugs. Mr. Altman, who is writing a book about new types of development programs with Mr. Douste-Blazy, said, ''The financing has led to much higher quality of treatments for these diseases.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees Rough Consensus on Lessons of Crisis as Leaders of G-20 Gather

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As President Obama prepares to host the leaders of the Group of 20 nations at an economic summit meeting this week in Pittsburgh, American officials say they are optimistic about reaching agreement on strategies to rein in practices that led to the current financial crisis.
 Though differences persist, administration officials said a rough consensus had been reached on broad lessons from the crisis. The firmest area of agreement at the two-day meeting this Thursday and Friday is likely to be on the need for higher capital reserve requirements at banks and other financial institutions. 
 Requirements on capital reserves -- safety cushions against losses -- are at the heart of the risk-taking behavior of financial institutions. Higher reserve requirements mean that institutions have less latitude to leverage their investments with large amounts of borrowed money.
 The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has been circulating a lengthy framework of principles for requiring institutions to build up bigger cushions to guard against investment losses and the risk of cash shortages caused when the credit markets seize up.
 American officials said on Tuesday that they were also confident about reaching agreement with European leaders on how best to regulate compensation for finance industry executives. French officials have been pushing for specific caps on bonuses, an approach that American and British regulators consider too rigid. 
 But French officials have signaled in recent days that they do not expect agreement on specific caps. And European officials appear to agree with American policy makers that the most important goal is to clamp down on huge bonuses that reward short-term results without holding executives accountable for a company's long-term stability.
 The third and most difficult area of discussion involves how to prevent the kind of huge global economic imbalances that many analysts believe were central to the bubble-and-bust cycles of the last several years.
 The biggest imbalance of the past decade has been the gap between the soaring indebtedness of the United States, with its consumer economy, and the mounting surpluses of China and other countries whose growth has relied on exports.
 Export-dependent countries plowed trillions in surplus profits back into the United States over the decade, supplying a flood of cheap money that kept interest rates low and aggravated the huge speculative bubble in American home prices.
 American officials said they had no expectation of establishing any enforcement mechanism over the policies of individual nations. But they said they hoped to persuade the Group of 20 to support more balanced growth strategies, and officials were discussing proposals calling for governments to monitor each other through a ''peer review'' process in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund.
 Mr. Geithner said the goal was not force countries into changing their policies but to get them to agree on what was in their long-term self-interest. ''The central insight is to force people to look forward,'' he said, ''to look at the size of the imbalances and at the risks building up.''
 For the United States, that would mean increasing investment and savings while slowing the growth of consumption. For China and other Asian nations, that would mean relying less on exports for growth and doing more to stimulate consumer spending at home.
 Some outside experts were skeptical that any pledges made in Pittsburgh would amount to more than platitudes. Simon Johnson, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, noted that Group of 20 leaders were not even trying to set timelines for ending their emergency economic stimulus measures.
 Eswar S. Prasad, an international economist at Cornell University, said there was still ''a chasm on macroeconomic issues.'' 
 ''China continues to see the proposed framework as an underhanded ploy by the U.S. to shift attention from its massive fiscal deficit,'' Mr. Prasad said.
 But analysts said many governments were shocked so badly by the current crisis that they were already re-evaluating their strategies out of pure self-interest. In the last year, Chinese leaders have carried out a huge domestic spending program that has been a leading contributor to global growth.
 Though American officials insist they are not trying to cut a deal with China, the United States is also pressing hard to give China and other fast-growing emerging countries a bigger share of voting power at the International Monetary Fund. 
 China, India and emerging economies have been pushing for a bigger role for years, contending that their voting power in monetary fund decisions has lagged behind their influence in the global economy. American officials agree, but European governments would be the losers in any rearrangement of voting rights and they have been reluctant to go along.
 White House and Treasury officials, for their part, have not tried to push European and Asian leaders into highly specific commitments. Mr. Geithner has refused to propose any specific capital ratios for banks, for example, saying that leaders should simply agree to nail down such numbers by the end of 2010. In part, that is a nod to European banks, many of which have higher debt level ratios than American banks.

HEADLINE: Union Chief Leads Protest of Wall St. 'Apostles of Greed'

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
As one of his first acts as the new president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Richard L. Trumka led a rally on Wall Street on Tuesday to protest the ''apostles of greed'' and to back President Obama's push for increased financial regulation.
 Speaking before a modest crowd, Mr. Trumka issued repeated warnings that the labor movement would battle the nation's bankers if they did not do more to lend to homeowners and small business and to create jobs. 
 Repeatedly using populist rhetoric to hammer the financial community, Mr. Trumka said, ''We are here today to demand more accountability from our financial system -- from Wall Street -- from Masters of the Universe who speculate in phony instruments rather than invest in the real economy.''
 Mr. Trumka added, ''If you take money from U.S. taxpayers and spend it on more speculation instead of investing in business that create jobs, if you lard your executives with bonuses and largess while you're squeezing families out of their homes with unfair lending, we're going to fight you, we're going to tell the truth about what you're doing.''
 In his 20-minute speech, Mr. Trumka, who was elected the federation's president last week after serving as its secretary-treasurer for 14 years, did not detail exactly how organized labor would battle Wall Street.
 He made clear that the A.F.L.-C.I.O., a federation of 57 unions representing 8.5 million workers, would use its considerable lobbying clout to advance President Obama's proposals for financial regulation. He called for stronger banking regulations to prohibit redlining of neighborhoods and predatory lending, and he called for creating a consumer finance protection agency.
 He said he wanted Mr. Obama to ''be bold, be strong, accepting nothing less than real accountability.'' 
 ''We stand with S.E.C. Chairwoman Mary Schapiro and C.F.T.C. Chair Gary Gensler in their fight for stronger regulation for hedge funds and derivatives and all the crazy stuff that brought our economy down,'' Mr. Trumka said.
 The federation's new secretary-treasurer, Liz Shuler, and executive vice president, Arlene Holt Baker, joined Mr. Trumka on the podium.
 As the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s secretary-treasurer, Mr. Trumka ran organized labor's capital stewardship program, which pushed pension funds and Congress to take positions to check executive compensation. Before serving as the federation's secretary treasurer, he was president of the United Mine Workers, with a reputation for labor militancy.
 Mr. Trumka repeated his view that the nation was composed of two economies: the financial economy and the real economy. ''Our real economy needs a financial system that will support it, not a high-risk system that only supports itself and the wiliest speculators,'' he said. ''That means strict oversight of banks and other financial institutions that nearly drove our economy off a cliff.''
 He likened the financial system to a public trust, resembling an electric power grid that the overall economy needed to work well.
 ''It can't be left unregulated,'' he said, ''because people get hurt and the system crashes.''
 ''We're advocating for new regulations to make sure the financial sector is the servant to the real economy, and not its master,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Former eBay Chief Running For Governor of California

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
The former eBay executive Meg Whitman formally declared her candidacy for governor of California on Tuesday, a quest that would make her the first woman to lead the nation's most populous state. 
 Ms. Whitman, a 53-year-old Republican, made her announcement amid growing challenges to California, which has been hit hard by recession, unemployment, chronic budget problems and the flight of businesses to other states. 
 She touched on all those issues on Tuesday in her first speech as a candidate, sounding a strong antitax, antiregulation and antispending message.
 ''Honestly, when I talk about spending, I get mad,'' she said. ''I simply cannot understand how even politicians could have let things get so bad.''
 Democrats have won most recent statewide elections and hold an advantage in California voter registration. But Republicans have regularly triumphed in races for governor, most recently with the resounding 2006 re-election victory of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is barred by term limits from running again.
 The state's economy has since deteriorated, and Ms. Whitman seemed eager on Tuesday to paint herself as the most business-friendly candidate. At one point she criticized ''liberal environmentalists'' who ''may not like jobs or people.'' 
 She said that her first goal as governor would be to create two million private-sector jobs and that she would reduce state government's work force by 40,000 as part of a permanent spending cut of $15 billion a year.
 Ms. Whitman, who made a fortune as president and chief executive of eBay, established a campaign exploratory committee in February but has lately ratcheted up her candidacy and her wooing of fellow Republicans.
 She delivered Tuesday's speech in Fullerton, in the longtime conservative stronghold Orange County, and recently gave $250,000 to the California Republican Party. She is also scheduled to speak this weekend at the party's statewide convention, along with two other Republican candidates for governor: Tom Campbell, a former congressman, and Steve Poizner, the California insurance commissioner.
 Only one Democrat, Mayor Gavin Newsom of San Francisco, has declared his candidacy, though Attorney General Jerry Brown, who was elected governor 35 years ago and held the office for two terms, is widely expected to run and leads in most statewide polls among all comers of either party.

HEADLINE: Parties Clash on Long-Awaited Day for Health Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As the Senate Finance Committee took up legislation, Democrats expressed confidence Tuesday that their effort to remake the nation's health care system was gaining momentum. But Republicans sharpened their attacks on a requirement that most Americans carry insurance, a central element of the bill.
 ''This is our opportunity to make history,'' said the committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, as the panel began its long-awaited work on his measure.
 The rising optimism among Democrats came as the Massachusetts Senate, on the heels of a similar vote in the Massachusetts House, approved a bill allowing Gov. Deval Patrick to appoint a temporary successor to the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy. The Democratic governor's appointee could supply a crucial 60th vote allowing Senate Democrats to overcome any Republican filibuster on health care.
 In an effort to round up additional votes for his mammoth bill, Mr. Baucus made further changes to it Tuesday, in part to make insurance more affordable for low- and middle-income people. 
 Longtime senators of both parties said the bill was the most ambitious project they had ever worked on. Opening remarks at the committee's session indicated a hardening of opposition among Republicans, with the notable exception of Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, who has been at the center of negotiations over the bill.
 Several Republicans said Democrats were trying to jam through a measure that would restructure one-sixth of the nation's economy. And they predicted an angry public revolt if Democrats rushed the bill through Congress by using a procedural device to limit debate.
 ''You think the American people were upset in August?'' said the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. ''You haven't seen anything like they're going to be if this device is chosen.''
 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said the White House and Democratic leaders had short-circuited bipartisan talks by imposing a mid-September deadline on negotiations by a group of three Democrats and three Republicans.
 ''The cry of impatience has won out, and the artificial deadline was put in charge of this process,'' Mr. Grassley said. ''They have put moving quickly over moving correctly.''
 Mr. Grassley said the requirement that people carry insurance was an unwarranted ''intrusion into private lives.'' And he maintained that it had originated with insurance companies, which, he said, stand to benefit.
 ''For them,'' Mr. Grassley said, ''a requirement that everyone buy their product sounds like a great idea. But to the rest of us, it might seem just a little bit self-serving.''
 The Senate's No. 2 Republican, Jon Kyl of Arizona, described the bill as ''a stunning assault on liberty, mandating that everyone buy a certain type of insurance mandated by Washington.''
 The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said at a news conference that Mr. Baucus's efforts over the last year had built broad support for the legislation among Democrats. He expressed confidence that a major health care bill would be approved by the full Senate in coming weeks.
 Changes announced Tuesday by Mr. Baucus respond to concerns expressed by members of both parties. The changes would tighten regulation of insurance companies, expand consumer protections and increase subsidies to help people buy insurance.
 Mr. Baucus tried to address the biggest concern of fellow Democrats by proposing the more generous subsidies, to be given in the form of tax credits. Under his original plan, people with income at the federal poverty level ($22,050 for a family of four) would have been expected to spend 3 percent of their income on premiums, while people with incomes of 300 percent to 400 percent of the poverty level would have been expected to spend 13 percent of their income.
 Under his new proposal, premium contributions would range from 2 percent to 12 percent. 
 In addition, Mr. Baucus would cut the maximum penalty for people who do not have insurance, to $1,900 a year for a family, from $3,800 in his original proposal. The penalty would be an excise tax, collected by the Internal Revenue Service, and the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation said it would hit some people with annual incomes of less than $200,000.
 One of Mr. Baucus's changes Tuesday could profoundly alter the insurance market, now dominated by employer-sponsored plans. Under the proposal, it would be easier than in his original bill for people with access to insurance through their employers to obtain tax credits to help them buy coverage on their own, in new state-based exchanges.
 Mr. Baucus would still impose a tax on high-cost health plans, generally those with premiums exceeding $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families, starting in 2013. But he would increase the thresholds for plans covering retirees over the age of 55 and for those covering people in certain high-risk occupations, like law enforcement, firefighting, construction and mining. The threshold for such plans would be raised by $750 for individual coverage and $2,000 for family coverage. 
 Mr. Baucus would also make it more difficult for people to take tax deductions for medical expenses. Under current law, taxpayers can take an itemized deduction for unreimbursed medical expenses, to the extent they exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. Mr. Baucus would raise the threshold to 10 percent.
 To address another concern, he would allow some older Americans to keep extra benefits they receive from private insurance plans known as Medicare Advantage plans. The proposal would help beneficiaries in a limited number of high-cost areas, including some in Florida and New York.
 Mr. Baucus would partly offset the cost of this provision by imposing higher fees on insurance companies, in addition to the excise tax on high-cost policies. The fees would total $6.7 billion a year, instead of the $6 billion he originally proposed.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said it was clear that Democrats were prepared to make the compromises needed to pass a bill. ''There is going to be a herculean effort to get this done, even if every member doesn't get everything he or she wants,'' Mr. Schumer said.
 Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said, ''We are going to have it to the president, and he is going to sign it, before Christmas.''
 While deflecting criticism from the left and the right, Mr. Baucus acknowledged that he was disappointed with one element of his own bill. It does not do enough to protect doctors from cuts in their Medicare fees, he said. 
 Under current law, doctors face cuts of 21.5 percent in 2010 and 5.5 percent a year from 2011 to 2014. Mr. Baucus's bill would give doctors one year of relief, increasing their Medicare fees by 0.5 percent in 2010. The cost to the government would be $11 billion in 2010-11.
 A companion bill in the House would provide annual inflation adjustments in Medicare payments to doctors, at a higher projected cost: $228 billion over 10 years.

HEADLINE: With a Receptive White House, Labor Begins to Line Up Battles

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
When China's president, Hu Jintao, attends the G-20 summit meeting this week in Pittsburgh, he will no doubt complain about the punitive tariffs that the Obama administration recently slapped on Chinese tires and steel.
 While Mr. Hu is certain to make his displeasure known to President Obama, the man responsible for pressuring the administration to act on those disputes will be elsewhere, sitting in his office a few hundred yards from where the meeting is taking place.
 That man is Leo W. Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers, often viewed as the No. 1 scourge of free traders. 
 And the leaders of the G-20 should take note: Mr. Gerard and his fellow labor leaders are just getting started. 
 While labor's opposition to free trade is nothing new, having an ear in the White House is. The Obama administration, though it says it supports free trade, has so far seemed more aligned with labor's trade agenda than has any administration in decades. 
 What has alarmed America's trading partners is the steelworkers' victory when the president imposed a 35 percent tariff on Chinese tires under special trade rules that allow punitive measures without a finding of illegal trade practices.
 Under these ''safeguard'' rules, the White House can impose penalties merely by finding that a surge in Chinese imports hurt a particular industry. It was the first time a president had ordered penalties under the provision, which China agreed to as part of its push to join the World Trade Organization. 
 The president's move has stirred worries that other unions and industries will rush to seek similar relief. 
 ''This runs a big risk of driving a huge hole in the whole G-20 strategy of avoiding an outbreak of protectionism during this economic crisis and doing serious damage to the world economy,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
 Mr. Gerard insists his union is merely pursuing its rights under trade rules. ''Anybody who believes we have a rule-based system, but we shouldn't enforce the laws, they're the ones jeopardizing the global trading system,'' he said. 
 The steelworkers, who represent steel, rubber, paper, chemical and aluminum workers, hailed Mr. Obama for standing up to Beijing, after China's trade surplus with the United States has soared to more than $200 billion a year.
 ''They cheat in every area,'' Mr. Gerard said, pointing to repeated findings of illegal subsidies, as well as one American tire maker's saying that Beijing had illegally required one of its factories in China to export all its output. ''If the bully keeps beating you up, is it so bad to stand up to him?''
 Some critics called Mr. Obama's move payback to a union that helped to elect him -- the steelworkers are a powerhouse in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and other pivotal states. 
 Uri Dadush, director of the international economics program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, warned that the steelworkers' victory would hurt other American industries because it could encourage other countries to invoke their own safeguard provisions to keep out American products.
 ''Maybe this is a victory for the head of the United Steelworkers, but it's not a victory for the United States,'' Mr. Dadush said. ''In the end. this will hurt U.S. workers indirectly in other sectors.''
 Next, Mr. Gerard and his union, the nation's largest manufacturing union, plan to push for Buy America provisions in any climate change legislation, building on the steelworkers' success in getting such provisions into the $787 billion stimulus bill. 
 As part of any cap-and-trade climate bill, the steelworkers are pushing for special tariffs on imports from countries that do little to require manufacturers to reduce carbon emissions. Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat who works closely with the steelworkers, said that without such a tariff, climate legislation would never pass the Senate, which the Democrats control.
 And, as usual, the union is also pushing many individual trade cases, among them several that accuse China's producers of steel pipe for the oil industry of receiving illegal subsidies and selling at prices below production costs.
 Last year, in cases brought by the steelworkers and various companies, the Commerce Department imposed tariffs on Chinese exports of thermal paper and tires for off-road vehicles, after finding illegal subsidies. Earlier this month, the department, in ruling for the steelworkers, found illegal subsidies on Chinese-made steel pipe. In a preliminary decision, it announced tariffs of 10.9 to 30.6 percent, with a ruling to come in November. 
 Mr. Gerard, a native of Canada who used to work in a nickel smelter, has little patience for people who accuse him of protectionism because of the many trade cases filed by his union.
 ''This isn't protectionism; we're enforcing the law,'' Mr. Gerard said. ''We're trying to defend our members' job security. In order to do that in this kind of a global economy, we need to police imports and trade law.''
 His message resonates with union members. Last winter, when Goodyear closed its tire plant in Tyler, Tex., eliminating 1,200 jobs, the workers directed most of their anger at China. 
 Jim Wansley, the former president of the steelworkers' local there, praised Mr. Obama's ruling for helping beat back the surge of Chinese tire imports, which nearly quadrupled since 2004. ''Although it's too late to save our factory, the people here are extremely glad that something is being done to help save the jobs at other plants,'' he said. ''It could save an industry that would be dead in 10 years if we didn't do something like this.''
 In four safeguard cases, President George W. Bush declined to impose penalties even though the United States International Trade Commission, a bipartisan panel, had found that Chinese imports hurt particular industries. 
 Convinced that Mr. Bush was not enforcing trade laws in a way that protected workers, the United Steelworkers led organized labor's efforts to stall the Doha trade liberalization round and block ratification of bilateral free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea.
 In the 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. Obama promised to enforce the trade laws, including the safeguards provision. Influenced by that, early this year the steelworkers thought it was time to bring another safeguards case, this time against Chinese tires. Before Mr. Obama ruled, the trade commission concluded that a surge in Chinese imports was responsible for four plant closings and the loss of 5,100 jobs.
 The union hired numerous lawyers and consultants who had to show that American industry had suffered injury and that Chinese imports were responsible. 
 David Spooner, who represented China's tire industry, brought executives from China to meet with officials in the State, Treasury and Labor Departments as well as the trade representative's office. He argued against punitive tariffs because China's tire exports had started to fall. 
 ''Many folks who believe in open markets cringe at the idea of imposing tariffs or quotas on fairly traded goods,'' said Mr. Spooner, who headed the Commerce Department's imports administration under Mr. Bush. ''We're seeing the bar set so low for trade relief I fear we will see a flood of petitions, and it will be hard for the White House to say no in the future.'' 
 The steelworkers are looking into bringing other safeguard cases and voice confidence for a climate bill. Free traders see those provisions as tricks to help the steelworkers keep out foreign steel or wind turbines. But Mr. Brown said: ''If a company closes in Cleveland and moves to Calcutta and Shanghai, we lose jobs and CO2 emissions get worse. It's clear that the border adjustment is the right thing to do for the environment and for American manufacturing.''

HEADLINE: Proposals Lag Behind Promises On Climate

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; John M. Broder contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS 

 BODY:
World leaders gathered here for a global summit meeting on climate change made modest proposals on Tuesday for combating the problem, underscoring the way domestic political battles still trump what United Nations officials had hoped would be a sense of global urgency. 
 The negotiations for a new international agreement to curb emissions of greenhouse gases have stalled, making an agreement in Copenhagen by December difficult. In calling the conference, Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, asked heads of state and government both in public and in private to set aside national concerns and become ''global leaders.'' 
 In speech after speech, presidents and prime ministers of countries large and small spoke with soaring promises about the importance of confronting the problem for future generations. But when it came down to the nuts-and-bolts promises of what they were prepared to do in the next decade, experts and analysts were disappointed that there were no bold new proposals, particularly from the United States. 
 ''It was really great to have the vision, but with just 70 days left to Copenhagen, it is time to put some substance on the table,'' said Steve Howard, the founder of the Climate Group, an international organization pushing for a climate change agreement. ''The two most important countries on this issue are being guarded in their positions.'' 
 Those two countries -- the United States and China -- account for more than 40 percent of the carbon emissions, roughly divided between both. 
 Speaking at the green marble lectern of the General Assembly chamber, President Obama told the audience of some 100 heads of state and government that ''unease is no excuse for inaction.'' 
 China's president, Hu Jintao, spoke of reducing the ''carbon intensity'' of his fast-growing economy, or cutting emissions as a percentage of future economic output, by a ''notable'' margin that he did not specify.
 Mr. Obama acknowledged that the United States once played down the issue, but now recognized its gravity. The world ''cannot allow the old divisions that have characterized the climate debate for so many years to block our progress,'' he said, adding that forging consensus would come slowly. ''And so all of us will face doubts and difficulties in our own capitals as we try to reach a lasting solution to the climate challenge.''
 In a shift of emphasis, Mr. Obama divided developing nations into two categories. The nations with a strong industrial base -- countries like China, India and Brazil, although he did not name them -- would need to accept curbing their emissions in any agreement. But the poorest nations, he said, deserve financial and other aid to tackle current climate problems and future green development. 
 Mr. Obama said he was committed to having the United States make its largest investment ever in renewable energy, to setting new standards for reducing pollution from vehicles and to making clean energy profitable, among other initiatives. 
 The United States is considered essential to success in Copenhagen. It never joined the 1997 Kyoto accord, the first major attempt to limit emissions in a global treaty, partly because the accord did not set mandatory targets for powerhouse developing states like China.
 In his speech, President Hu of China said his nation would take four steps toward greener development. He said China would reduce the amount of carbon dioxide it emits to produce each dollar of gross domestic product by a ''notable margin'' by 2020 compared with 2005 levels; increase forests by 40 million hectares (about 98.8 million acres); increase nuclear or nonfossil fuels to 15 percent of power by 2020 and work to develop a green economy. 
 Analysts gave China credit for taking carbon emissions more seriously. Its leaders now accept the need to reduce pollution, partly because their country is vulnerable environmentally and partly because they hope to become leaders in green technology. But Mr. Hu neither defined ''notable'' nor accepted any binding cuts on emissions. He also tied the emissions reduction effort to the growth in China's gross domestic product, so the amount of emissions per dollar of output -- or ''carbon intensity'' -- might shrink, but the overall number could still rise as the economy expanded. 
 ''Developing countries need to strike a balance between economic growth, social development and environmental protection,'' President Hu said. 
 Todd Stern, the United States envoy for climate change, reflected the general reaction to the Chinese proposal by saying, ''That can be good, but it all depends on what the number is.''
 The president of India did not attend, but the country's environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, told reporters that the government hoped to enact a series of measures that would curb emissions, including new building codes, limits on deforestation, reductions in greenhouse gases generated by agriculture and increases in renewable sources of energy to 20 percent by 2020 from 8 percent now. 
 Mr. Ramesh said the lack of specific promises from Mr. Obama should not have been a surprise because like India, the United States is a democracy in which actions depend on popular approval. 
 The prospect of action by the United States Senate this year appears dim, with Congress mired in the fight over health care and Democrats divided on climate change measures. In late June, the House passed a climate change and energy bill sponsored by two Democratic representatives, Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts.
 But on the domestic front, even some enthusiastic Obama supporters expressed disappointment that he had not used such an important global pulpit to make a stronger case for both international action and a forceful declaration of what the United States would do. 
 ''We need President Obama to step up and say, 'I need an economywide emissions cap,' '' said Andrew Deutz, director of the Nature Conservancy's international government relations program. '' 'I need money to negotiate. I need Waxman-Markey passed by X date so I can go to Copenhagen and negotiate.' ''
 A few leaders did make significant commitments. 
 Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama of Japan, who took office last week, said that his country would seek to cut greenhouse gas levels 25 percent, to 1990 levels, by 2020, and that Japan would provide significant financial and technical aid for green development. 
 Mohamed Nasheed, the president of Maldives, an Indian Ocean island state threatened with extinction if global warming causes seas to rise, said developing states should commit to mandatory limits. He said his country would commit to being carbon neutral by 2020. 
 Rajendra K. Pachauri, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, warned that current emissions trajectories were speeding the world toward the panel's worst-case possibilities.
 ''Science leaves us with no space for inaction now,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Brazil's Olympic Bid Gets Presidential Push

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The easiest job in the world belongs to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, as he supports Rio de Janeiro for the 2016 Olympics.
 All da Silva has to do is say ''Rio has the most beautiful beaches in the world,'' and he has an instant audience. 
 He made this simple statement Tuesday in throaty Portuguese, with English translation, and right away I was picturing the long foamy waves and Corcovado in the background and, well, all right, I was also picturing ''The Girl From Ipanema.'' 
 In a week or so, da Silva will fly to Copenhagen for the Oct. 2 vote by the International Olympic Committee that will decide from among Chicago, Tokyo, Madrid and Rio. He will undoubtedly mention beaches. But he will also push his other talking points: Brazil is an emerging economic giant and it deserves to represent South America, which has never hosted the Olympics.
 A union man, a former lathe worker, da Silva talks with passion about poor kids from Brazil or Argentina or Colombia who could ''hop on a bus or a truck'' to see the Games. It is not clear that any of the 106 voting members of the I.O.C. will care about this populist sentiment. 
 In New York to visit the United Nations on his way to Pittsburgh for the G-20 economic summit on Thursday and Friday, da Silva will then go to Copenhagen. He is following in the path of Prime Minister Tony Blair, who flew to Singapore in 2005 and chatted up I.O.C. members, apparently so successfully that London was chosen for 2012. 
 And then there was Vladimir V. Putin, who as Russia's president traveled to Guatemala City in 2007 and turned on his K.G.B. charm until the city of Sochi was chosen to hold the 2014 Winter Games. 
 After those two missions, the folk wisdom is that it does not hurt to have a head of state work the room before the members take their secret vote. 
 ''I have information on how London won,'' da Silva said. ''And yes, Blair talked to a lot of people.'' Sebastian Coe, the head of the London organizing committee and a gold-medal runner, is also said to have turned a few delegates as London stunned Paris to win the vote for 2012. But the point was made: schmoozing just might work. 
 With that in mind, Japan's new Prime Minister, Yukio Hatoyama, is considering traveling to Copenhagen and King Juan Carlos of Spain is expected to attend. But President Obama has said he is not going.
 ''I would make a case in Copenhagen personally if I was not so firmly committed into making real the promise of quality affordable health care for every American,'' Obama said recently, adding, ''But the good news is I am sending a more compelling superstar to represent the city and country we love and that is our first lady.'' 
 Asked if it was helpful for a head of state to attend the meeting, da Silva volunteered that he has been talking to I.O.C. members for two years. When somebody noted that Michelle Obama would represent the United States in Copenhagen, da Silva said he was bringing his wife with him, ''so it will be two against one.'' 
 More damaging than the absence of President Obama is the reality that the acting chief executive officer of the United States Olympic Committee, Stephanie A. Streeter, and the president, Larry Probst, have relatively little standing in the I.O.C., which is known for clubbiness and contacts.
 The I.O.C. president, Jacques Rogge, has said, rather ominously, that disputes with the U.S.O.C. about revenue sharing and a proposed Olympic network in the United States will have ''no negative effects whatsoever'' on Chicago's chances. The generally attractive plan by the great city of Chicago could be offset because some I.O.C. members are still unhappy over losing their perks in bid cities after revelations that favors helped bring the 1996 Summer Games to Atlanta and the 2002 Winter Games to Salt Lake City. 
 All four finalist cities for 2016 received good reports by the bid committee earlier this month. The strongest criticism of Rio mentioned violence, but da Silva said Brazil had not suffered an overt terrorist attack, and he told how poor youth from Brazil's slums had helped quell robberies during recent sports events. 
 Speaking to invited representatives of about a dozen news outlets, da Silva made the point that Brazil has the largest economy of any nation that has not yet held the Summer Games. He stressed the development of oil fields off the Brazil coast and the nation's aircraft industry. 
 ''We're not this tiny country people thought,'' he said. 
 He noted that Brazil will be the host for the World Cup of soccer in 2014, and said infrastructure would be created for the tournament that would be useful in 2016. But the best infrastructure of all might be the sand and the waves.
 Wait a minute: the 2016 Summer Games will be in August, which just happens to be late winter south of the Equator. However, a check of the weather for Rio in August revealed an average high of 76 degrees Fahrenheit and an average low 64 (24 to 18 centigrade). Very nice for walking on the beach, somebody from the bid committee reassured me. No doubt da Silva will mention this to the I.O.C. members.

HEADLINE: Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu on Warming

 BODY:
Of more than 100 world leaders who gathered Tuesday at the United Nations for a summit meeting on climate change, two mattered most: Barack Obama and China's president, Hu Jintao. Together their countries produce 40 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Together they can lead the way to an effective global response to this clear global threat. Or together they can mess things up royally. 
 In less than three months, negotiations will begin in Copenhagen for a new agreement to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The hope is these talks will produce commitments from each nation that, collectively, would keep temperatures from rising 2 degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. That will require deep cuts in emissions -- as much as 80 percent among industrialized nations -- by midcentury. 
 And there's not a lot of time to waste. As Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, warned on Tuesday: ''Science leaves us no space for inaction.''
 While Europe and the United States disagree over how quickly developed countries should move, their differences pale in comparison to the historical divide between developed and developing nations, which have argued that the industrialized West should bear most of the burden. For its part, the West has argued that countries like China and India are growing so fast that they can no longer remain on the sidelines, as they did in Kyoto.
 Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu did not bridge that gap, but their governments are listening more carefully to one another. China is no longer pretending that it is a backward country whose need for economic growth relieves it of any obligation to control emissions. The United States -- the world's largest emitter in historical terms -- is acknowledging its responsibility to help the poorest and most vulnerable nations reduce emissions without sacrificing growth. 
 Still, the two leaders have a considerable distance to go.
 For Mr. Hu, this means becoming much more specific about his encouraging pledges. On Tuesday, he promised to reduce the rate of growth in carbon dioxide emissions between now and 2020 by a ''notable margin'' -- at which point, he implied, China would seek to reduce them in absolute terms. This vague formulation is unlikely to pass muster in Copenhagen. An agreement does not have to be one-size-fits-all, but every country should be obliged to make real and verifiable commitments. 
 Mr. Obama recognizes the urgency of the problem. He will have to work hard to persuade a Democratic-controlled Senate (the House has acted) to see it as well and to pass strong legislation committing the United States to binding cuts in greenhouse gases. 
 The president made much of the regulatory steps he had taken or planned to take to control emissions, and the investments he had made in cleaner technologies. Legislation, however, remains essential to America's claim to leadership and to getting an international deal. 
 For years, China and the United States have engaged in a dangerous Alphonse-and-Gaston routine, using each other's inaction to shirk their responsibility. Both leaders agreed that it is past time for this dance to end. Though much more will be required to produce a credible, comprehensive agreement, that is progress.

Turning to Junk
 To Stay Execution
 Junk borrowers are trading death row for extended jail time. Resurgent debt markets have helped several high-yield borrowers refinance loans. That will keep them from defaulting when loans come due, averting the possibility of near-term death by bankruptcy. But with interest costs most likely at least doubling, their cash flows will be squeezed -- condemning some to protracted penny-pinching, if not worse.
 Blockbuster, MGM Mirage, Dole Food, Del Monte, Frontier Communications and Ford Motor Credit are among the companies that have sold new debt in the last week or so. Some are using the proceeds specifically to repay loans, others are refinancing bonds or more generally paying down other debt. 
 Refinancing debt that would otherwise soon need repayment defers a potential worry. But these deals don't always come cheap.
 The casino operator MGM Mirage, for example, issued notes carrying a fixed 11.375 percent interest rate to repay floating-rate bank loans that had an average interest rate of 3.4 percent last year. 
 This kind of huge step up in debt service costs could be crippling. Consider the imaginary XYZ Corporation. Two years ago, it was the target of a leveraged buyout and took on $600 million of debt -- six times its $100 million of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Its debt consisted of $450 million of loans, with an average interest rate of 5 percent, and $150 million of bonds with an 8 percent coupon. The company's annual interest bill was about $35 million.
 The loans were due to be repaid in a year or two. Happily for XYZ, it has just sold new bonds to refinance them, with an interest rate of 11.5 percent. Combined with the continuing interest due on the other $150 million of bonds, the company's annual interest expense has nearly doubled. And nearly two-thirds of its cash flow is now eaten up by interest, against one-third before.
 So companies that have refinanced in this way may well now have much less spare cash to invest in their businesses and employees, and less cushion against rough periods. Sure, they may have spared themselves an imminent default. But they're far from home free.
 Wynn's Smart Bet
 Steve Wynn has uncovered a pocket of betting fever. Mr. Wynn, the gambling mogul, plans a public offering of 25 percent of his Macao business in Hong Kong to raise $1.6 billion and reduce the debt his empire has racked up in Las Vegas. He couldn't have picked a better time. Wild speculation has spilled out of the casino and into the stock market. 
 Macao, China's only legal gambling enclave, is on a lucky streak. Sure, revenue plunged over the last year, just as it did in Sin City. But Macao's problem was political. Beijing clamped down on visas after too many local mayors got caught at the baccarat table. That trend is now in reverse. Macao chalked up record gambling revenue in August, and analysts expect a flat haul for 2009 to grow 20 percent in 2010. 
 Mr. Wynn is in a particular sweet spot. His is one of few global casino groups to offer investors a bet focused on Macao's luxury side. 
 The market leader, SJM Holdings, operator of the pineapple-shaped Grand Lisboa complex, is more geared to the mass market. The heavily indebted Las Vegas Sands is also planning an initial public offering, but is farther back in the I.P.O. queue. 
 At the top of the indicated price range, Wynn's Macao business would be valued at 13 times forecast operating cash flow for 2010, a premium to its peer group. Despite the offering's attractive features, the apparent lack of any I.P.O. discount shows how exuberant the market has become. 
 Meanwhile, Macao may face overcapacity before long. By 2011, it will have 42 percent more gambling tables and 66 percent more hotel rooms. Yet existing hotels are on average only two-thirds full. Even if China's day-shift gamblers stay loyal, other gambling centers like Singapore will try to lure the high-rollers Mr. Wynn is courting. That could lead to a price war. 
 These problems may seem distant. But in the long term, the house always wins. It's likely that by using Asia's fevered equity markets to help recapitalize his United States operations, it's Mr. Wynn himself who has placed the best bet.

HEADLINE: Behind the Scenes of the Dark Cold War, Where an Even Darker Side Lurked

BYLINE: By DWIGHT GARNER

 BODY:
THE DEAD HAND 
 The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and Its Dangerous Legacy 
 By David E. Hoffman 
 Illustrated. 577 pages. Doubleday. $35. 
 From the sorry final years of Leonid Brezhnev's rule, which ended at his death in 1982, to the arrival of Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1985, the Soviet Union seemed to be led, as David Remnick has put it, by a series of ''half-dead men in half-lit hospitals.''
 After Brezhnev came Yuri Andropov, then Konstantin Chernenko: gray eminences who each died barely a year after coming to power. A weary Ronald Reagan asked in private, after learning of Chernenko's death, ''How I am supposed to get anyplace with the Russians if they keep dying on me?'' 
 At this same moment the Soviet Union had succession issues of a far darker sort on its mind, David E. Hoffman writes in ''The Dead Hand,'' his authoritative and chilling new history of the cold war arms race. 
 His book takes its title from a Soviet doomsday machine first conceived under Brezhnev. Because the Soviets feared ''decapitation'' -- the killing of its leaders in one fast, huge American nuclear strike -- they developed an automatic retaliatory system to launch their missiles even if their command structure no longer existed. Thus the fate of the planet would rest on the shoulders of a few low-ranking officers sweating in a concrete bunker. Those officers were the twitching fingers of a dead hand. 
 Mr. Hoffman is a contributing editor at The Washington Post, and he was The Post's Moscow bureau chief from 1995 to 2001. In ''The Dead Hand'' he delivers a readable, many-tentacled account of the decades-long military standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union. He touches the usual bases, from the dawn of mutual assured destruction through the Nixon-era attempts at detente to Reagan's unshakable devotion to the Strategic Defense Initiative, a k a Star Wars.
 What's particularly valuable about Mr. Hoffman's book, however, is the skill with which he narrows his focus (and his indefatigable reporting) down to a few essential areas. Thanks to interviews and new documents, he provides the fullest -- and quite frankly the most terrifying -- account to date of the enormous and covert Soviet biological weapons program, developed in defiance of international treaties at the same time that the Soviets appeared to be earnestly interested in reducing their weapons stockpile.
 This biological weapons program -- Mr. Hoffman refers to it as ''a dark underside of the arms race'' -- included the development of a super germ that mounted a grisly one-two attack on its victims: it would make them mildly ill and then, once they appeared to recover, hammer them with a death blow. 
 Mr. Hoffman details how truly paranoid the Soviets were that America would launch an unprovoked nuclear attack. He offers an inside account of how Mr. Gorbachev stood up to his own generals to slow and then reverse the arms race. And he is particularly good on the dangers, after the Soviet Union's collapse, of its stockpiles of nuclear and biological weapons, much of this material stored in unguarded warehouses. 
 Almost as dangerous were (and are) the tens of thousands of newly unemployed Soviet defense workers, some willing to sell weapons or skills to the highest bidder. Mr. Hoffman recounts the story of one chemical warfare expert who ended up selling Snickers bars and blue jeans in a Moscow open-air market. 
 ''The Dead Hand'' is deadly serious, but this story can verge on pitch-black comedy -- ''Dr. Strangelove'' as updated by the Coen Brothers. Mr. Hoffman has an eye for bleak, jagged details. When he writes about how the Soviet disposed of nuclear waste -- even nuclear reactors -- by dumping it at sea, he notes that workers shot holes in any waste barrels that surfaced. 
 He observes the curious Soviet idea that it could predict a nuclear attack by looking for a spike in prices for blood donations in Britain. ''The K.G.B. failed to realize,'' Mr. Hoffman writes, ''that British blood donors are unpaid.'' 
 He quotes Nixon on losing his interest in biological weapons. ''We'll never use the damn germs, so what good is biological warfare as a deterrent?'' Nixon said. ''If somebody uses germs on us, we'll nuke 'em.'' 
 Mr. Hoffman gives detailed reconstructions of large Soviet blunders, like the shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983. But he contrasts these with quirkier (if no less unnerving, at least for the Soviets) events, like the day in 1987 when a disaffected young West German named Mathias Rust managed to land a single-engine Cessna near Red Square in Moscow. 
 If ''The Dead Hand'' has a pair of looming antagonists, they are Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev, and Mr. Hoffman offers sympathetic accounts of both men's actions and thinking. About Mr. Gorbachev he is especially admiring. 
 ''A leader's courage is often defined by building something, by positive action,'' he writes, ''but in this case, Gorbachev's great contribution was in deciding what not to do.'' Mr. Gorbachev declined to up the ante by building a Soviet Star Wars missile system; he did not intervene during the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. 
 One of this book's few villains, at least on the international stage, is George H. W. Bush's Defense Department under Dick Cheney. The department opposed aiding the Soviets, as their country fell apart, to destroy or properly secure weapons. Donald J. Atwood, deputy secretary of defense, is quoted as saying that he wanted the Soviets to be in ''free fall.'' 
 ''The Dead Hand'' is a large book but also a jumpy one; it's as full of quick cuts and dateline switches as a ''Bourne Identity'' movie. Mr. Hoffman is so careful not to bore his readers that he sometimes underestimates them, verging closer to Tom Clancy than to John Lewis Gaddis. More synthesis and cerebration would have made this good book better.
 ''The Dead Hand'' has a title that sounds like an early-period Stephen King novel. Its imagery is even more terrifying than Mr. King's, especially toward the end. The stray parts of the Soviet empire became -- and to some degree still are, Mr. Hoffman writes -- ''a Home Depot of enriched uranium and plutonium, with shoppers cruising up and down the aisles.''

HEADLINE: For First Advocate, a Focus on Record

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
By Mark Green's count, he has written or edited 22 books, appeared on political talk shows hundreds of times, founded a public affairs institute and, since 2007, has presided over Air America Radio, the liberal talk radio network.
 ''I've been a player, a caddie, the manager of the restaurant at the club,'' he said the other day, summing up his job experience with a golf metaphor. 
 But as Mr. Green campaigns for public advocate, the city's second-highest elected official, he is running largely on his record in public office: three years as consumer affairs commissioner and eight years as the city's first public advocate, from 1994 through 2001.
 He has had his eyes on bigger prizes in the past, with failed runs for the Senate, state attorney general and New York City mayor. 
 After the attorney general's race in 2006, Mr. Green vowed never to run for office again. But he changed his mind after the economy collapsed and after he was angered by the City Council's vote to upend the term-limits law. 
 Though some believe he is seeking to use the public advocate's office as a springboard for another mayoral run, Mr. Green says he wants to serve as a check on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is heavily favored to win a third term.
 It is a role Mr. Green played during his first turn as public advocate. Using the office as a bully pulpit, he was a liberal adversary to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, taking on police corruption, Joe Camel and even dry cleaners who charged more for women's shirts than for men's.
 He and Mr. Giuliani clashed in court numerous times, particularly over access to files of police officers accused of brutality, and Mr. Giuliani tried to cut the budget and power of the public advocate.
 Mr. Green, who has been called abrasive by some critics, was a counterweight to Mr. Giuliani, a ''strong, brash figure who needed a strong, brash figure to stand up to him,'' said Kenneth K. Fisher, a lawyer and a City Council member from 1991 to 2001. Mr. Green, he added, ''viewed his role as reaching out to and speaking for constituencies for which he felt Giuliani had disdain.'' 
 The Democratic race for public advocate will be decided on Tuesday, when Mr. Green and Bill de Blasio, a city councilman from Brooklyn, compete in a runoff. The winner has an overwhelming advantage in the general election, since the little-known Republican opponent, Alex T. Zablocki, is unlikely to attract a large following among the city's heavily Democratic electorate.
 Mr. Green, 64, a Brooklyn native who lives in the Gramercy neighborhood of Manhattan with his wife, Deni Frand, was elected public advocate in 1993, after the office was created to replace the position of city council president. Mr. de Blasio has questioned the relevance of Mr. Green's public service during the 1990s, frequently noting that his own time in elected office occurred ''during this decade.''
 Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant who advised Mr. Green during his 2001 mayoral bid, said Mr. Green's core support has weakened since he was last in office. ''It is a very different generation he's facing,'' he said. ''Others want an opportunity to run, and the demographics of this city have shifted.'' 
 Mr. Green, in his defense, said that much of his work has had a lasting impact. ''The experience that best justifies my election as the next public advocate is the years when I performed in this exact role in ways that got an awful lot accomplished for consumers and taxpayers,'' he said. ''Clearly my work on police misconduct, access-a-ride for seniors and child welfare are entirely current and relevant for the next decade.''
 Douglas Muzzio, a professor of public affairs at Baruch College, said Mr. Green deserved credit for demonstrating the capacity of the office, and for outperforming his successor, Betsy Gotbaum, who has kept a lower profile.
 ''Given the very ambiguity of the office, Mark made it into something as the first public advocate,'' Mr. Muzzio said. ''He really made the office an ombudsman, and he used it for personal reasons. I think it was a very active, vigorous office, and one that really did act as a check and a counterpoint on the mayor.'' 
 But Fred Siegel, a historian who has served as an adviser to Mr. Giuliani, said Mr. Green sometimes failed to choose his battles wisely. 
 ''It was a mixed record,'' he said. ''There were times when he got into fruitless conflicts with Giuliani.'' On the other hand, Mr. Siegel added, Mr. Green ''wrote a number of useful position papers and did a lot in the way of serious policy analysis, some if it substantial.'' 
 As one of two citywide elected offices -- the other is comptroller -- the public advocate is seen as one likely place to produce a future mayoral candidate, said Kenneth Sherrill, an emeritus professor of political science at Hunter College.
 ''The question for public advocate is not just, what has he or she done,'' Mr. Sherrill said, ''but what is he or she likely to do eight years from now?''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Senator Draws Critics in Both Parties

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Nearly three decades ago, Charles E. Grassley was among the Republican conservatives swept into the Senate on the wave that Ronald Reagan rode to the White House. Now he is on the defensive as he seeks a sixth term, no longer conservative enough for those back home in Iowa who style themselves the protectors of the Reagan legacy.
 So it was that Mr. Grassley, who often has been at the center of creating major legislation, instead mostly kept his head down on Tuesday, reading news clippings and his Kindle as the Senate Finance Committee began work on legislation to overhaul the health care system. 
 That effort is anathema to the conservatives who dominate the Republican Party these days, as was made clear in angry town-hall-style meetings this summer. In Iowa, conservatives had threatened to seek a primary election opponent if Mr. Grassley cut a deal with Democrats. In Washington, they openly speculated that if he were re-elected, he would lose his chance at the top Republican seat on the Judiciary Committee after 2010. 
 As for President Obama, the inability to work with a legislator with a record of pragmatism like Mr. Grassley's underscores the difficulty of restoring bipartisanship in a polarized capital.
 Just as the health care debate has taken its toll on Mr. Obama's popularity, Mr. Grassley's long-iconic status in Iowa has suffered. A poll last week for The Des Moines Register put Mr. Grassley's support at 57 percent, down from 75 percent in January. The erosion is among Democrats and independents; his recent vocal opposition on health care seems to have shored up his standing among Republicans.
 On Tuesday, when the Finance Committee assembled in a cavernous room to accommodate the crowd of news media, staff members and interest groups, Mr. Grassley, as the panel's senior Republican, took his usual seat next to its chairman, Senator Max Baucus, the Democrat from Montana. 
 But after a decade in which the two friends have taken turns as chairman of the prestigious committee, and repeatedly worked together to cut taxes, create a Medicare drug benefit, establish a children's health program and more, this time their months of private talks failed to yield the bipartisan health overhaul bill they had sought. 
 During his opening remarks, Mr. Grassley blamed the White House and Democratic leaders. Their pressure for the Finance Committee to act by a mid-September deadline, he complained, forced a premature end to talks among three Republicans and three Democrats that began last June. Four other committees finished during the summer.
 ''I find it utterly and completely appalling,'' he said.
 Mr. Grassley also cited policy objections to the Baucus legislation. He criticized its costs, though Mr. Baucus has proposed offsetting savings, and he objected to its mandates that individuals have insurance, though Mr. Grassley previously has said health insurance should be mandatory just as auto insurance is for drivers. He said the bill would not do enough to guard against aid going to illegal immigrants and for abortions, and complained that it would not limit malpractice awards.
 For Democrats, Mr. Grassley's list only reinforced their belief that he never would have compromised no matter how much time he had.
 Democrats wrote off Mr. Grassley in August, when at his meetings with Iowa voters he seemed to affirm conservatives' claims that Democratic proposals would create government death panels to ''pull the plug on grandma,'' and when he vowed in fund-raising appeals to lead the opposition to health care legislation.
 A Grassley spokeswoman, Jill Kozeny, dismissed suggestions that political considerations had dictated his stance. ''He'd still be at the table today if the Democratic leader in the Senate hadn't pulled the plug on the effort,'' Ms. Kozeny said.
 But Democrats, as well as some Republicans and nonpartisan observers, say Mr. Grassley is running scared. 
 ''Chuck Grassley is not in serious trouble in Iowa and has not been for some time, but I think he's a little rattled at what he's heard at these town hall meetings and on some of the conservative talk shows,'' said David Yepsen, the longtime political reporter for The Des Moines Register who recently became director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University. 
 ''The Republican Party in Iowa,'' Mr. Yepsen said, ''has become a lot more conservative, particularly on social issues'' since Mr. Grassley was first elected to the Senate in 1980.
 Back then, he fit right in among the economic conservatives who counted themselves as soldiers in the Reagan Revolution for lower taxes and smaller government. Now he is suspect among more socially conservative ideologues who have gained prominence.
 Before the health debate, Iowa conservatives had registered their unhappiness. Mr. Grassley was not chosen to be a delegate to the party's 2008 convention, and he has been criticized for voting for the $700 billion financial bailout and for insufficiently condemning an Iowa Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriages.
 His role in Mr. Baucus's health care talks further riled Iowa Republicans, and two conservative groups mobilized activists to attend his August meetings to protest.
 ''There is so much talk of primarying Chuck Grassley now,'' a well-known conservative, Bill Salier, said on an Iowa radio show. The senator's seniority means ''absolutely bupkis if what you do with that power is work with Max Baucus to try to advance socialized medicine.''
 In late July, a conservative state representative published an open letter castigating Mr. Grassley, giving rise to speculation that he would challenge the senator. Instead, on Tuesday, the state lawmaker said he would run for the State Senate.
 Among Democrats, a former state legislator, Bob Krause, is talking of running against Mr. Grassley, saying it has been ''a long time to go without rotating crops.'' But in Washington, Democratic leaders say the only threat to Mr. Grassley is in his own party.

HEADLINE: Consuming E.D.S.

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif. 

 BODY:
By many measures, it has been a tough year for employees of Electronic Data Systems. 
 After Hewlett-Packard bought the computer services company last August for $13.9 billion, it immediately began hacking the work force. Led by a master cost-cutter, Mark V. Hurd, H.P. laid off 25,000 E.D.S. workers, and cut the salaries of some by more than 20 percent. Mr. Hurd even stripped the E.D.S. brass of their plush offices and corralled them into 6-by-6-foot cubicles.
 But despite the risk that disgruntled employees and customers would walk out the door, the acquisition has paid off big for H.P. -- so well, in fact, that an important rival has decided to strike a similar deal. Dell announced Monday that it was paying $3.9 billion for Perot Systems, the Texas computer services company started by H. Ross Perot after he left E.D.S. 
 Plenty of employees have complained about H.P.'s tactics, but the company says it has persevered through the turmoil to keep most of E.D.S.'s customers. Last quarter, H.P.'s operating profit margin on services hit 13.8 percent, the highest in a decade. And the combined company's services division is H.P.'s biggest business in terms of revenue -- a remarkable metamorphosis for what has long been viewed as a slow-growth PC and printer maker.
 On Wednesday, H.P. will take another big step toward full integration of E.D.S., extinguishing the 47-year-old company's name. The new name, H.P. Enterprise Services, reflects the union of the services operations at the two companies.
 ''I acknowledge that we have done a lot of hard stuff, but this is all about getting H.P. in a position where we can compete and win,'' said Ann Livermore, an executive vice president at H.P. who heads its services and data center products businesses.
 In talks with E.D.S. employees, executives have put it more bluntly. At one meeting in August, Andy W. Mattes, who runs H.P.'s services business in the Americas, said that the deep salary reductions and broad cost cuts were for the good of the remaining employees. 
 ''Just letting things go on will result in much more bleak and horrible scenarios,'' Mr. Mattes said, according to an audio recording of the meeting.
 The bloodletting pains Mort Meyerson, who served alongside Mr. Perot at E.D.S. and Perot Systems for many years. ''It's sad to see this happen because of the decades of work the men and women of E.D.S. put into the company,'' he said. ''But that's what happens in business.''
 H.P. executives concede that the company's aggressive pruning comes with costs, as workers fret about their futures and the overall business endures some disruption. 
 But they say that tough actions were needed to bring E.D.S. in line with competitors like I.B.M., Infosys and Wipro Technologies. 
 By common business yardsticks, the Hurd touch on E.D.S. appears to have worked better than investors and analysts had expected. 
 When H.P. announced its intent to buy E.D.S. in May 2008, H.P.'s share price sank. E.D.S. had developed a reputation as a bloated has-been that had burned investors in the past through bad deals, accounting issues and an overreliance on services contracts with the government and automakers. 
 And while E.D.S. received high marks from customers for its role in taking over their technology operations, it required far more people than competitors to accomplish the task. 
 ''It was almost, the closer you were to E.D.S., the more concern you had about the acquisition,'' said Shannon Cross, an equities analyst with Cross Research. 
 E.D.S.'s own efforts to lower costs had stalled, particularly since the company lacked the financial resources to undertake a major reorganization, according to Joe Eazor, a former E.D.S. executive who is now a senior vice president and general manager of services at H.P.
 Investors were also worried about change-of-control provisions in contracts that would allow customers to renegotiate or cancel long-term deals with E.D.S. 
 But H.P. has held onto 199 of the top 200 accounts at E.D.S., according to Mr. Eazor. Some of the deals have been reworked, but H.P. points to its improving operating margins in services as evidence that any reductions in revenue have been minor. 
 Meanwhile, as sales of printers, PCs and data center gear have plummeted during the recession, H.P. has used services to bolster its overall revenue and profits. ''The deal has really helped insulate them from the downturn,'' said Ben Reitzes, an analyst with Barclays Capital. ''Without E.D.S., things could have been a lot worse.''
 According to analysts, H.P. may have engineered the deal at just the right time. The down economy gave H.P. time to perform its painful restructuring and primed the company to grow when the good times returned. 
 Historically, E.D.S. promoted computing gear from H.P. rivals like Sun Microsystems, Xerox and Cisco Systems. But Mr. Eazor says that more of H.P.'s own hardware is slated to go into deals that are currently up for bid. 
 H.P. has been criticized by some analysts and derided by competitors for declining to detail the value of the services deals it has signed, as is industry practice. During a meeting this week with analysts, H.P. plans to reveal that it recently closed 32 deals valued at more than $100 million and that its customer service scores rose over the past year. 
 Niall Quinn, the director of commercial management for Aviva, an insurer, said that H.P. had held up well under the pressure of the acquisition. In March, Aviva picked H.P. over I.B.M. for a $1 billion, 10-year outsourcing contract in Britain. 
 But, while Aviva has committed to H.P. for the long haul, Mr. Quinn said he had short-term concerns. 
 ''Mark Hurd is a bit focused on hitting numbers on a quarterly basis, and some of the things he's done, people in Europe find quite amazing,'' Mr. Quinn said. ''The layoffs are a concern because what you're buying is tremendous expertise.''
 H.P.'s critics, including current and former employees, warn that the company has done away with too many high-salaried, veteran executives. Jeff Kelly, who had run the E.D.S. business in the Americas, left the company in March, leaving a gap in the company's most crucial region. His successor, another E.D.S. veteran, Mike Koehler, left in May. Now Mr. Mattes, who came from the H.P. side, is in charge. 
 The heads of finance, human resources, sales and software services left E.D.S. earlier this year as well. 
 Current and former employees, who requested anonymity because they signed nondisparagement agreements with H.P. or are afraid of being fired, complain that H.P.'s tactics work better for a product company. In the services realm, customers depend on their long-standing relationships with executives and sales team leaders. 
 In addition, morale has dipped, particularly in the United States, where most salary cuts have taken place, these people say. 
 I.B.M., H.P.'s biggest competitor in services, contends that customers have been complaining about disruption in their H.P. accounts. 
 ''In the services business, if cost-cutting and price are the only levers you have to compete, it's not sustainable,'' said Dave Liederbach, the general manager of I.B.M.'s outsourcing business. ''The chaos that results in a client situation will be severe.''
 H.P. paints a much different picture, saying that for the first time, it has enough salespeople and services expertise to go up against I.B.M. for some of the largest, most lucrative contracts.

HEADLINE: President of Iran Defends His Legitimacy

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and NAZILA FATHI; Neil MacFarquhar and Sarah Wheaton contributed reporting.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS 

 BODY:
With thousands of demonstrators protesting outside that he had stolen Iran's election, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stoutly defended his legitimacy here on Wednesday, declaring in a speech that the Iranian ''people entrusted me once more with a large majority'' in a ballot he described as ''glorious and fully democratic.''
 In a 35-minute address, Mr. Ahmadinejad leveled familiar attacks against the United States and delivered an oblique rant against Jews, saying it was unacceptable for a ''small minority'' to dominate the politics and economy of much of the world through ''private networks.'' But he did not raise the Holocaust, the subject of another anti-Semitic theme he has used in speeches. 
 Shortly before Mr. Ahmadinejad began speaking, the United States and other world powers met and announced that they would give Iran a chance to begin negotiating seriously over its nuclear program at a meeting on Oct. 1, or face consequences -- harsher sanctions.
 ''They are at a turning point; they have a choice to make,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said after the meeting, which included foreign ministers from Russia, Britain, France, Germany and China. ''We will now await the results of the Oct. 1 meeting and take stock at that time.''
 While the statement issued by the countries did not appear to break new ground, senior American officials said it was significant because China and Russia had signed on to a strategy that explicitly warned Iran that there would be serious consequences if it was not prepared to negotiate.
 Both countries have historically been reluctant to impose sanctions on Iran, with which they have extensive commercial ties. Obama administration officials also pointed to comments made by Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, to President Obama in which he said Russia would consider sanctions.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad, in an interview with Newsweek and The Washington Post, said Iran would consider permitting its nuclear experts to meet with scientists from the United States and other major powers to try to resolve concerns about its nuclear program. It was not clear what Mr. Ahmadinejad's offer would entail or whether it could help resolve the standoff. 
 While American officials emphasized the progress they had made on Iran, Mrs. Clinton announced a shift in American policy toward another recalcitrant government, the military junta in Myanmar.
 Speaking to a group of countries with ties to Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, Mrs. Clinton announced that the United States would begin engaging directly with Burmese officials after concluding that its longstanding policy of sanctions had not worked.
 ''We believe that sanctions remain important as part of our policy,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''But by themselves, they have not produced the results that had been hoped for on behalf of the people of Burma.''
 ''Engagement versus sanctions is a false choice, in our opinion,'' she added, ''so going forward, we will be employing both those tools.'' 
 She declined to discuss the level at which American engagement with Burmese officials would take place, though senior officials said the secretary herself was unlikely to meet with anyone.
 Myanmar, however, is sending a minister to the United States next week, and a senior official said that by announcing this policy shift, Mrs. Clinton opened the door to some kind of meeting with that minister.
 At the end of the meeting of foreign ministers on Wednesday, Foreign Secretary David Miliband of Britain read a statement indicating that the countries were united in their determination to present Iran with a clear choice.
 There was similar solidarity outside the United Nations, where thousands of people from the Iranian diaspora massed to show their support for the democracy protesters in Iran, many carrying placards with a picture of Mr. Ahmadinejad and the message, ''Not Iran's President.''
 Others carried pictures of young people who had been killed in Iran in demonstrations after the June election, some of whom had been tortured. Many wore green, which has become a symbol of the movement.
 Hadi Ghaemi, the director of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, who helped organize the protest, said Iranian expatriates wanted to send a strong message to Mr. Ahmadinejad that the world was ''aware of the crimes that took place'' since his re-election. 
 Nima Momeni, 25, an information technology consultant who traveled from Los Angeles for the rally, said he ''could not bear the idea that Mr. Ahmadinejad could just come and address the General Assembly after the crimes that took place in Iran.''

HEADLINE: A Tiny Tax Could Do a World of Good

BYLINE: By PHILIPPE DOUSTE-BLAZY. 
Philippe Douste-Blazy, the French foreign minister from 2005 to 2007, is the chairman of Unitaid and a special adviser to the United Nations secretary general on innovative financing.

 BODY:
AS leaders of the world's largest economies gather today in Pittsburgh for the Group of 20 meeting, people in the world's poorest countries will likely look on with a mix of hope and trepidation, wondering whether their needs will figure in the deliberations at all. The G-20 nations could help both the poor and the global economy by fully financing lagging efforts to fight poverty and disease worldwide, and the best way to do this would be to impose a very small tax on the prosperous foreign exchange industry.
 The eight United Nations Millennium Development Goals -- which include eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, establishing universal primary education, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health and combating AIDS, malaria and other diseases -- are meant to be reached by 2015. Morally and practically, the world must try harder to keep these promises. President Obama has made it clear that the United States has, in his words, ''a responsibility to protect the health of our people, while saving lives, reducing suffering and supporting the health and dignity of people everywhere.'' 
 Disease takes an enormous toll on economic growth: it sidelines or kills productive workers and causes tremendous suffering. Take, for instance, tuberculosis, an illness that with the right treatment can usually be cured. In 2007, it killed nearly 1.8 million people, more than 600 times the number who have died from H1N1 swine flu. The World Bank estimates that tuberculosis has caused the gross domestic product in some countries to fall as much as 7 percent.
 Or consider maternal health. About 530,000 women worldwide die each year from pregnancy-related causes, most of them preventable, and millions more suffer injuries or develop lifelong disabilities. A serious effort to reduce those numbers would bring real economic gains. Improvements in the health of Asian women and children accounted for a significant share of that continent's economic growth from 1965 to 1990.
 Unfortunately, though, there is an enormous shortfall in the level of outside aid needed to reach the goals the world has set. Donor countries, including the wealthiest of the G-20, are providing only 0.3 percent of their combined income in development aid. Although the donor countries have made commitments to provide more money, they are not giving it fast enough to tackle runaway health problems, including the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens that threaten people across the globe. 
 The one untapped source that could easily provide the amount of money needed is the foreign currency market, which handles almost $800 trillion in trades annually, all of which is untaxed. A tiny levy of 0.005 percent on transactions involving the world's most traded currencies -- the dollar, the euro, the pound and the yen -- would raise more than $33 billion annually for development, while not hurting the market or affecting the average international traveler. 
 The tax could be collected automatically by the computer system that handles foreign exchange transactions -- so it would be easy to put into place, and impossible to evade. And because not all currencies would be taxed, only the countries whose currencies would be affected would need to consent. France already supports the idea, and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has signaled her willingness to consider it. 
 We have already seen what innovative taxation can do to save lives, with sufficient political will. Since 2005, France and 10 other countries have collected a small tax on airline tickets (in France, it amounts to only $1 to $5 per ticket). And this has, without hurting the airline industry, raised about $700 million -- enough to finance three-quarters of the AIDS treatment now being received by the world's H.I.V.-positive children. Unitaid, the international organization that I lead and that manages the money from the airline tax, has also been able to negotiate 50 percent to 60 percent reductions in the price of pediatric anti-retroviral drugs in low-income countries.
 How should the proceeds of a foreign exchange transaction tax be managed? One model is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which holds medical programs in more than 100 countries to high performance standards, and can withhold financing when money is not used properly. 
 The banking industry has so far managed to keep currency trading untaxed, but this industry, which has so recently been dependent on government aid, has a duty to give back. President Obama has reminded Wall Street leaders about what he called their ''obligation to the goal of wider recovery, a more stable system and a more broadly shared prosperity.'' The same principle applies internationally. President Obama and other G-20 leaders should harness the mighty foreign exchange market in the service of better health for all.

HEADLINE: The Design Universe Lines Up at Bergdorf's

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
ON Tuesday evening, MARGARET RUSSELL, above, editor in chief of Elle Decor, was seated at a wide black glass table in the Marc Jacobs boutique on the third floor of Bergdorf Goodman. She wore a satin tea dress and a serious rhinestone necklace and looked a bit like a debutante, except that her dress was black.
 Stacks of her glossy new coffee table book, ''Style and Substance: The Best of Elle Decor,'' were arrayed at her left elbow, along with silver-and-white boxes holding a candle developed to embody the essence of her magazine by Votivo, the olfactory staple in Upper East Side living rooms. 
 What does a decorating magazine smell like? Paper? New sofas? Money?
 ''It shouldn't give you a headache,'' Ms. Russell said. Then, at a prompt from a publicist, she grinned and added, ''I've been told it's a timeless scent.''
 Velvet ropes and brass stanchions loosely defined a snaky line of well-wishers, making up pretty much the entire New York design community, all of whom were inching toward Ms. Russell's table. Mid-line, the decorator TODD ROMANO hitched up tweed sleeves and recalled his first Elle Decor cover eight years ago. ''It was the tiniest two-room shack you can imagine,'' Mr. Romano said of the Southampton house he shared with his miniature dachshund, Missy. ''I really felt I'd arrived.'' 
 Elle Decor, the unstuffy, vaguely urban interior design magazine, is 20 years old next month; the evening's party was in honor of that birthday, a particularly important one given that during those two decades, its competitor House & Garden folded, was resurrected and folded again, and the ingenue-competitor Domino was shuttered last January. So the night was a bit of a victory lap: In a year of dismal numbers, Elle Decor had inched ahead of the shelter behemoth Architectural Digest (now the only decorating magazine in the Conde Nast stable) to hold the No. 1 spot in the shelter category. It was a heady feeling, Ms. Russell had said earlier. 
 Observing that New York City is organized into powerful tribes or mafias, MICHAEL GROSS, author of ''Rogues' Gallery,'' an unauthorized history of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, compared the crowd at Bergdorf's to the trustees of the Met. Mafias, be they museum board members or decorators, Mr. Gross said, could be defined as a ''group that keeps each other's secrets.'' 
 Eyeing a crowd that included MARIO BUATTA, THOMAS O'BRIEN, CELERIE KEMBLE and ALEXA HAMPTON and her mother, DUANE, who'd tacked toward the Prescriptives counter on her way to the party (Prescriptives is going out of business, and Mrs. Hampton was stocking up), Mr. Gross allowed that this tribe was a largely friendly one. ''They don't close up the castle and pour boiling oil out the windows,'' he said. ''And they only keep each other's design secrets.'' 
 Still, the security detail was prodigious. Burly young men with walkie-talkies sidled through the crowd as if they were members of the Secret Service. Some were as beautifully accessorized as Ms. Russell: one young man sported a gargantuan diamond ring, captivating a photographer. Another herded MARTHA BAKER, the fashion editor turned landscape designer, and NINA GRISCOM, the husky-voiced social figure turned television personality turned retailer, away from Ms. Russell's table when they tried to get close enough to wave. 
 Describing the scene as she rode down the escalator, Ms. Griscom shrugged it all off. ''Anyway, I bought my book and it's time to go home.'' 
 Musing on an economic climate that was hammering even formerly recession-proof industries like cosmetics, Ms. Griscom said she was closing her Lexington Avenue home-goods store next month. The landlord had raised her rent, a sign of the times, she said. ''It's a tough business. I'm looking forward to starting a new chapter.''

HEADLINE: The Mother of Reinvention

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
IN a mock interview with Coco Chanel in the August issue of Harper's Bazaar, Karl Lagerfeld attempted to channel his muse. Asked ''what inspires, you, an architect, an actress?'' Chanel, a k a Mr. Lagerfeld, was quick to respond, ''An actress, why not?'' 
 Why not indeed? If, apart from her work, Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel possessed an overarching talent, it was her gift for self-invention. In the words of Axel Madsen, one of her many biographers, she ''made things up.'' The scrappy peasant girl form the Auvergne transformed herself in the public eye from the child of an itinerant peddler to a daughter of privilege brought up by genteel maiden aunts; from a fiercely ambitious courtesan to the social equal of the Duke of Westminster; from a moderately gifted seamstress to a celebrated couturier -- and an enduring emblem of what ambition can achieve. 
 ''She is the ultimate Gatsby character,'' said Rhonda Garelick, a professor of English at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, and the author of a forthcoming Chanel biography, ''Antigone in Vogue.'' Professor Garelick argued in an interview that Chanel represents ''a very American rags-to-riches story.'' 
 ''She is a successful poseur who came from nothing and blasted her way into society and celebrity,'' Professor Garelick writes. Chanel improvised as she went, ''tapping into desires that are far more than sartorial.'' 
 Today many of those desires are mirrored in a spate of films, books and fashions that explore the designer who has been called the first modern woman -- if not the first modern celebrity. ''As a phenomenon, Chanel shoulders a lot of different narratives,'' said Harold Koda, the curator in charge of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. ''Her life has a kind of mythic quality.'' 
 Interest in the couturier has never really waned, but 2009 has taken shape as a banner year for all things Chanel. In a recession, the perpetual reinvention of her life -- not to mention the still-influential designs that in their day elevated humble materials into high style -- strikes a chord, making Chanel an inspiring figure for lean times. 
 In ''Coco Before Chanel,''' a gauzy film biography that opens on Sept. 25 in New York and Los Angeles, the director Anne Fontaine reconstructs Chanel's early years as a ''Pretty Woman'' saga. The film follows the onetime music-hall singer as she turns the attentions of well-born lovers like Etienne Balsan and Boy Chapel to her advantage, wooing them into financing her career as a designer. 
 The movie is framed to capture a youthful heroine who is gritty and vulnerable. ''When you know her better at the beginning of her life, you understand her fragility, her stress,'' Ms. Fontaine said. ''She never knows what is going to happen next and she has no protection, so she must fight against her destiny and create a new way not just to dress but to be.''
 That film follows ''Coco Chanel,'' an Emmy-nominated television miniseries broadcast last year on the Lifetime network, which similarly focused on Chanel's formative years and her efforts to face down privations and social snubs as she refashioned herself as the imperious couturier (played by a caustic Shirley MacLaine)
 Nor will filmgoers see the simian features and hard-bitten persona of the aged Chanel in ''Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinsky,'' a biopic that closed the Cannes Film Festival this year. 
 Darker, more villainous aspects of the designer's history are explored in ''Coco Chanel,'' (HarperCollins), a biography by Justine Picardie to be published later this fall. Ms. Picardie discusses Chanel's affair with a Nazi officer during the occupation of Paris, one in a series of morally compromising choices she made to ensure that even in wartime, with her competitors shuttering all around her, her business would continue to thrive. 
 Portrayals of Chanel as a feisty warrior bent on making her way at any cost carry feminist overtones for some. Chanel ''seems to be the third-wave feminist heroine of the moment,'' said Mallory Young, an author of ''Contemporary Women at the Movies'' (Routledge, 2007). A protagonist like Chanel combines ''the crucial importance of style and fashion in identity and self-fashioning, the promotion of femininity and the relationship of style to power,'' Ms. Mallory added. Think Lady Gaga. 
 The notion that Chanel is a role model for aspiring divas informs another work, ''The Gospel According to Coco Chanel'' (Skirt!, 2009), a self-help guide masquerading as an irreverent biography. ''My book is not just for people interested in fashion,'' said the author, Karen Karbo. ''It is more for people who are looking for a philosophy of living -- a biography for a self-absorbed age.'' 
 Chanel's own towering self-regard is legendary. Her life and style have been copiously documented in past works including ''Chanel and Her World'' (1985) by her friend and biographer, Edmonde Charles-Roux, and the 1969 Broadway musical ''Coco,'' starring Katherine Hepburn. 
 Her seminal designs -- from the little black dresses and ''poor boy'' jersey pullovers to the braid- trimmed boucle collarless jackets and schoolgirl sailor blouses inspired by Colette -- are routinely resurrected on fashion runways. Last week during the presentation of spring 2010 collections in New York, Tory Burch, Jason Wu and Donna Karan were among those re-adapting Chanel to modern tastes. 
 The look -- slim, easy and devoid of embellishment -- conveys a feeling of ''youth and hopefulness,''' Professor Garelick suggested. It is also, she added, well adapted to an economic downturn. ''It reflects austerity and speaks to great elegance without requiring lavish materials. It is a kind of fashionable way to establish financial restraint.'' 
 Chanel's signature style may well be fundamental to the survival of the designer's mystique. ''If she was just a demimondaine who had a little millinery shop, even though she had wildly notorious affairs we wouldn't remember her,'' said Mr. Koda of the Costume Institute. She owes her presence in the contemporary consciousness to a ''very lively if disputable biography, together with the continuing vigor of the brand.'' 
 The survival of that brand has served the designer well indeed. Even people who know little about the proud, brittle couturier seem intuitively to grasp the power of the double-C logo, Professor Garelick pointed out. ''They know there is some talismanic power in those C's.'' Now, as decades ago, ''They confer a sense of limitless possibilities.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 1, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article last Thursday about Coco Chanel misspelled the first name of the actress who portrayed her in the Broadway musical ''Coco.'' She was Katharine Hepburn, not Katherine. The article also misstated the surname of one of Chanel's lovers. He was Boy Capel, not Chapel.

HEADLINE: Business Perks (Must Be Laid Off)

BYLINE: By SARA ECKEL

 BODY:
LAST spring, a prominent businesswoman in Lancaster, Pa., made a tearful phone call to her friend Darla Broderick, an owner of Visage a Visage, a local day spa and salon. The woman explained that her real estate and restaurant businesses had been slammed by the economic downturn, and she could no longer afford to keep her hair appointment.
 ''She was crying and embarrassed,'' said Tina Stoltzfus, Ms. Broderick's daughter and a co-owner with her parents. ''Of course, it broke our hearts, so we asked ourselves what we could do.''
 The Brodericks decided to start offering free haircuts to those who had lost jobs or were otherwise struggling because of the recession, even providing limousine service to anyone who didn't have transportation to the salon. 
 After some local news media attention, not only were they flooded with phone calls from the recently laid off, but they also heard from owners of other nearby businesses -- including two restaurants, a dog-grooming service and a comedy club -- who subsequently started similar free programs for the unemployed. ''It really blew up,'' said Ms. Stoltzfus, 41.
 With the national unemployment rate close to 10 percent, the swelling ranks of the jobless have generated an unexpected wave of benevolence: businesses are offering freebies to laid-off workers everywhere -- and not just necessities like groceries and flu shots. Instead, they're providing free monthly gym memberships, yoga lessons, golf rounds, therapy sessions and salon visits. 
 This generosity reflects a changing attitude toward the unemployed, said John Challenger, chief executive of the out-placement agency Challenger, Gray and Christmas.
 ''There's more empathy out there because everyone has friends and family who are caught up in this,'' Mr. Challenger said. ''There isn't the stigma that there used to be, because there's so much no-fault job loss.''
 While the offers sometimes generate skepticism among the unemployed, many report being pleasantly surprised by the quality of the services and the professionalism of the personnel.
 Michael Dixon, a software engineer from Seattle who is out of work, was prepared to be disappointed when he attended a two-day event last week at Flint Men's Grooming, a salon in Bellevue, Wash., that was offering free haircuts, suits and career counseling to the jobless. ''I thought it might be an up-sell, where they get you in and then immediately put you in front of a salesperson,'' said Mr. Dixon, 35.
 So he was stunned when a staff member escorted him to a room full of high-quality gently used suits and provided him with a tailor, as well as a free shirt and tie, all of which he estimates would have cost him $1,000 otherwise.
 Michelle Immel had a similar experience at Visage a Visage. Ms. Immel, a 41-year-old single mother, was initially reluctant to request a free cut and blow dry. Since losing her administrative job five months earlier, she'd had her share of humbling experiences, like frequenting the local food bank with her head down and her face shaded by a baseball cap. But at Visage a Visage, only the staff members knew she was a pro bono client, and Ms. Immel says they treated her as well as, if not better than, the salon's paying customers, even offering to trim her 2-year-old daughter's hair, too.
 ''They really took the time to make you feel good,'' Ms. Immel said. ''That helps because when you're unemployed you can get to the point where you start looking down on yourself.'' 
 Because the effects of this recession are so widespread, there is also a stronger sense of humility among the still-employed, as business owners see customers dwindle and employees brace for the next round of layoffs.
 Gary Donlin, the owner of the Quail Hollow Golf and Country Club in Oakham, Mass., said gratitude for his own job inspired him to offer free weekday golfing to the unemployed. He had noticed that membership was down -- both because of golfers who had lost jobs and those who feared they might -- and he realized that his longtime customers shouldn't be taken for granted.
 ''These were the people who had given us a job for 18 years,'' said Mr. Donlin, 64. ''If they didn't have a job, then what kind of people would we be if we didn't help them?'' 
 However noble the intentions, though, these programs do offer some financial upsides. If the barber chair or golf course would otherwise be empty, why not generate some good will and positive press with free services? 
 And Mr. Donlin notes that the laid-off golfers frequently bring paying friends, who often rent golf carts and buy sandwiches and beer at the clubhouse. ''It hasn't been a completely one-way street,'' he said.
 There is also the hope that such offers will build future clientele. 
 Janet Raiffa, an unemployed law-firm recruiter who writes a column for a networking organization in New York called the 405 Club (named for the state's maximum unemployment benefit of $405 a week), said that many businesses now recognize that the jobless are a group worth investing in, like students.
 ''There are a lot of lawyers and investment bankers who made a lot of money in the past and will make a lot of money in the future,'' Ms. Raiffa said. ''They may be low now, but it's still a population you want to build inroads with.''
 Offering free services is no guarantee that beneficiaries will eventually become paying customers. Ms. Raiffa now works out at New York Underground Fitness, which offers free memberships to jobless people when they show their unemployment stub each month. But she admits that she has frozen her membership to a fancier club and intends to return once she finds a job. 
 Eric Slayton, the owner of Underground, said he is fine with that, insisting that his offer is a gift, not a marketing strategy. 
 ''Everyone said, 'That's a good idea, that's a good marketing idea,' but that isn't the point,'' said Mr. Slayton, 40, who said he feels a responsibility to back up his advice to unemployed friends that they stay fit and keep their stress level down. ''It might sound corny, but I'm sincere.'' 
 Whatever the motives, business owners do need to be mindful that their good deeds aren't punished.
 Last April, Giuseppe Lazzara, the owner of Papa Joe's Barbershop in Chandler, Ariz., placed a sign in his window offering free haircuts to the jobless, after several of his regular customers said they were out of work and couldn't afford a trim.
 ''I felt like someone was stepping on my heart, so I said, 'You've been coming here for 20 years, you've been supporting me, so I will give you a free haircut,' ''said Mr. Lazzara, 69, who is known as Joe.
 Two weeks later, a local television station featured a story on Papa Joe's. Soon Mr. Lazzara's barber chair was full of laid-off workers from across the Phoenix area; he estimates he gave out about 150 cuts -- none to his original customers. So in June he quietly took the sign out of his window.
 ''If someone comes in and says they are having a hard time, I'll give them a cut, but I don't advertise it anymore,'' he said. ''I would go out of business.''
 To contain their exposure, many businesses limit their offers to one-day events or designate specific hours or days of the week as free periods.
 Integral Yoga Institute in New York, for example, offers a class called Free Yoga and Networking for the Unemployed every Wednesday evening (the jobless can also get discounts for regular classes). 
 Pooling resources also helps. Anita Astley, a marriage and family therapist from Clifton Park, N.Y., teamed up with other professionals -- including a psychiatric nurse, a social worker and a career counselor -- to form Professionals Without Fees, which offers four free sessions to the unemployed.
 ''I can't take everyone who calls, but I can refer them to other mental-health professionals in the network,'' said Ms. Astley, 40.
 At Visage a Visage, Ms. Stoltzfus hasn't imposed any formal limits on the number of cuts she will give away -- she said the current count is nearly 100 -- but she does keep a list to ensure that first-timers have priority over return visitors. And since her salon does not ask for proof of unemployment, she has encountered the occasional scammer. 
 ''That hurts,'' she said. ''But then the next minute you have someone who really needs it, so you decide it's O.K.''
 Fortunately, Ms. Stoltzfus said that the majority of customers are honorable, and some, like Ms. Immel, now have jobs and are returning as paying clients.
 ''We've gone back for basic haircuts,'' Ms. Immel said. ''We're not ready to get the $200 daily treatment yet, but we'll get there.''

HEADLINE: Even the Smallest Groups Tried Hand at High Finance

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Even the smallest of nonprofits ventured into the world of high finance. 
 A decade ago, Family Service of Greater Boston, a 174-year-old social services agency with an annual budget of about $6 million, sold its nine-story row house on Beacon Hill. Rather than use the $8.1 million in proceeds to buy a new building, Family Service put the money from the sale into its endowment and floated $8 million in variable-rate tax-exempt bonds tied to a swap contract that protected it from interest rate fluctuations. 
 ''The thinking was that dividends and interest on the investments would be at least sufficient to make payments on the notes,'' said Randal Rucker, the group's chief executive.
 In fact, investment income never sufficiently covered payments on the bonds, which ended up costing it roughly $800,000 a year -- or about 12 percent of its annual budget.
 Late last year, with a balloon payment on the bonds looming and its endowment's value down by more than 20 percent, Family Service had reached what Mr. Rucker called ''a very important and undesirable decision point'' to lay off staff members and discontinue some programs or reduce all programs across the board. 
 Then it got lucky. Under a new federal program, the charity was able to refinance its bonds, reducing its debt service costs by more than half.
 ''I think the strategy was right back then,'' Mr. Rucker said. ''In hindsight, I might have done some things differently. The assumption was that the market would always give about an 8 percent return, and no one projected we would be in the situation we are now.''

HEADLINE: Delivering Something Extra

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
SINCE 1907, United Parcel Service has been delivering packages ordered by consumers. Next week, the company plans to deliver packages they have not ordered, in a test of an effort to expand into direct marketing.
 Beginning on Monday, U.P.S. will experiment in five major markets with a service it calls Direct to Door, giving advertisers and retailers a chance to provide offers and product samples to U.P.S. customers. The marketing materials will come inside small boxes labeled Direct to Door Paks, and will be delivered to customers along with merchandise they actually ordered.
 The test, to run through Oct. 2, is intended to gauge whether there is interest in having U.P.S. serve as an alternative to marketing mail delivered by the United States Postal Service or by companies like Valpak. 
 If Direct to Door goes forward, the added revenue could help United Parcel offset declines in demand for its mainstay package delivery service since the recession started.
 In July, U.P.S. reported its sixth consecutive quarter of lower package volume in this country. The decline in the second quarter was 4.6 percent compared with the period a year earlier, which Bloomberg News described as the worst result since United Parcel went public in 1999.
 ''I wouldn't say it was developed as a result of the economy,'' said Lisa Lynn, marketing director for new-product research and development at United Parcel in Atlanta.
 Rather, she said, it stems from ''some opportunity we saw at the heart of what we do every day working off our delivery network.''
 The test is also meant to see if U.P.S. customers welcome unsolicited packages or dismiss them as some new type of junk mail.
 One effect of the economy is that ''people are very receptive to offers right now,'' Ms. Lynn said.
 An experiment in figuring out how to better aim traditional, tangible marketing materials at consumers may seem quaint when so much of the buzz along Madison Avenue is about aiming virtual pitches at them online.
 But direct marketing remains a lucrative business. According to the Direct Marketing Association, it accounted for $176.9 billion in ad spending last year in the United States -- 52.1 percent of the total, by the association's tally.
 ''We did some focus-group research and it really indicated that people were receptive to receiving offers from U.P.S.,'' Ms. Lynn said. ''What we heard was, 'If U.P.S. brings it to me, it's not junk.' ''
 Still, the company is taking several steps to try to ensure that a Direct to Door Pak is received more like a gift than another application for another credit card.
 For one thing, the offers inside each box are intended to be special rather than ''mass offers distributed through other channels,'' Ms. Lynn said.
 For another, no Direct to Door Paks will be delivered unaccompanied by packages ordered by that household, she said.
 And the boxes will not bear the addresses of the recipients, Ms. Lynn said. Rather, they will carry phrases like this one: ''Inside are premium offers from some of America's best-known brands.'' They will also include a photograph of the familiar brown United Parcel truck next to the words ''Delivered to you by U.P.S.''
 About a dozen companies -- advertisers and retailers that use United Parcel to deliver orders to customers -- are taking part in the test, Ms. Lynn said. They include the Finish Line; Men's Wearhouse; Sephora; two Williams-Sonoma home furnishings brands, Pottery Barn and West Elm; and Zappos.com, the online retailer of shoes and housewares recently acquired by Amazon.
 ''It's an interesting way to reach out to our customers and partner with one of our closest business partners,'' said Aaron Magness, director for business development and brand marketing at Zappos.com in Henderson, Nev.
 ''We are an online retailer,'' he added, ''but we want to maintain a high-touch relationship with customers, constantly trying to find different ways to interact with them in whatever means they're comfortable with.''
 Mr. Magness said he liked the idea that the boxes would not arrive ''out of nowhere, from random people knocking on your door.''
 The offer to be made by Zappos.com during the test will invite recipients to ''become a member of our V.I.P. program,'' he added, entitling them to ''free next-business-day shipping on every order.''
 United Parcel plans to deliver about 250,000 Direct to Door Paks in about 150 ZIP codes in Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Miami, Phoenix and Washington.
 Those chosen to participate in the test are ''high-opportunity consumers,'' Ms. Lynn said, meaning that they often order merchandise delivered by United Parcel Service.
 ''Our drivers have relationships with these people because they deliver to them frequently,'' she added. ''There's a lot of trust in the driver and the brand.''
 Mr. Magness also cited the trust factor as a reason Zappos.com was interested in the test.
 Ms. Lynn described the customers to receive Direct to Door Paks as ages 35 to 54 in households of two persons or larger and living in single-family, owner-occupied homes.
 As for what the service will cost marketers, ''I can't go into specific pricing,'' Ms. Lynn said, ''but the pricing model is similar to other media.''
 The goal is for the cost to reach each 1,000 consumers -- a common media measurement known as cpm -- to be ''comparable or less than an equivalent piece of direct mail,'' she added.

HEADLINE: Immigrants Cling to Fragile Lifeline at Safety-Net Hospital

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
If Grady Memorial Hospital succeeds in closing its outpatient dialysis clinic, Tadesse A. Amdago, a 69-year-old immigrant from Ethiopia, said he would begin ''counting the days until I die.'' Rosa Lira, 78, a permanent resident from Mexico, said she also assumed she ''would just die.'' Another woman, a 32-year-old illegal immigrant from Honduras, said she could only hope to make it ''back to my country to die.''
 The patients, who have relied for years on Grady's free provision of dialysis to people without means, said they had no other options to obtain the care that is essential to their survival. But the safety-net hospital, after years of failed efforts to drain its red ink, is not backing away from what its chairman, A. D. Correll, calls a ''gut-wrenching decision'': closing the clinic this month. 
 The sides confronted each other in state court on Wednesday morning as lawyers for the patients sought to keep the clinic open until other arrangements for dialysis could be secured. Dialysis patients and their families packed the benches and 60-year-old Nelson Tabares, a seriously ill illegal immigrant from Honduras, was wheeled into court in a portable bed. 
 Despite a judge's urging that the two sides negotiate a solution Wednesday, there was no agreement by the end of the day on how to go forward. For the time being, a restraining order keeping the clinic open stands. The judge is considering whether to extend it. 
 The dialysis unit on Grady's ninth floor might as well be ground zero for the national health care debate. It is there that many of the ills afflicting American health care intersect: the struggle of the uninsured, the strain of providing uncompensated care, the inadequacy of government support, and the dilemma posed by treating illegal immigrants. 
 Grady is one of many public hospitals that have been battered by the recession as the number of uninsured has mounted. New York City's public hospital system is eliminating 400 positions and closing some children's mental health programs, pharmacies and clinics. University Medical Center in Las Vegas has closed its mammography center and outpatient oncology clinic.
 ''It comes down to which service do you need to keep open,'' said Larry S. Gage, president of the National Association of Public Hospitals. ''You try your hardest to cut back on services that are going to be available elsewhere in the community.'' 
 Public hospital officials are concerned that the health care legislation being negotiated in Washington could worsen their plight before making it better. Under bills traveling through both houses of Congress, as the number of uninsured declines there would be commensurate reductions in Medicaid subsidies to hospitals that provide large amounts of uncompensated care. 
 At Grady, about four in 10 patients are uninsured, and an additional 25 percent are insured by Medicaid, which reimburses at rates so low they often do not cover actual costs. As a result, the hospital lost $33.5 million last year, with the dialysis clinic accounting for about $2 million of that total, said Denise R. Williams, the hospital's executive vice president.
 Nonetheless, as a taxpayer-supported hospital with the mission of serving the indigent, Grady is expected to take all comers in need of emergency care, like dialysis. Treatment there does not depend on a patient's insurance or immigration status. 
 The hospital has been encouraging some of the dialysis patients to move to other states or back to their home countries, offering to defray some costs. 
 Hospital officials estimate that two-thirds of the outpatient clinic's roughly 90 patients are illegal immigrants. They do not qualify for Medicare, which covers dialysis regardless of a patient's age, and they are excluded in Georgia from Medicaid and other government insurance programs. Legal immigrants face a five-year waiting period before becoming eligible. That leaves Grady to absorb costs of up to $50,000 a year per dialysis patient, some of whom have availed themselves of the thrice-weekly treatments for years.
 After years of fiscal desperation and management turmoil at Grady, Atlanta business leaders stepped in last year to force a restructuring, from a quasi-governmental authority to a nonprofit corporate board. In response, the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation pledged $200 million over four years to replace dilapidated beds and modernize computers. A $20 million gift from Bernie Marcus, a founder of Home Depot, is helping to update the emergency department, which provides regional trauma services. 
 But the hospital's operating deficits have continued. Grady's senior vice president, Matt Gove, estimated that its uncompensated care would grow by $50 million this year, up 25 percent. The new nonprofit board eliminated 150 jobs this year, closed an underused primary care clinic and began charging higher fees to patients who live outside of the two counties that support Grady with direct appropriations. 
 The closing of the outpatient dialysis clinic was recommended by consultants in 2007, who said that equipment was outmoded, that most hospitals did not provide outpatient dialysis and that Atlanta had scores of commercial dialysis centers. When the hospital's chief executive at the time tried to shut it down, the resulting firestorm helped prompt his dismissal.
 This July, the new board voted to try again. The hospital gave patients a month's notice of the scheduled Sept. 19 closing, and vowed to assist them in finding local dialysis providers, relocating elsewhere and qualifying for public insurance. ''We committed that not a single person would be left behind,'' Mr. Correll wrote in a newspaper advertisement published on Sunday. 
 About a third of the patients have been successfully moved, including several illegal immigrants who returned to Mexico with the hospital's financial help, Mr. Gove said. But others have said they have no place to go, have no means to pay for dialysis or are too ill to travel. 
 The female illegal immigrant from Honduras, who has a 7-year-old son, said her parents live more than a four-hour drive from the nearest dialysis center, in Tegucigalpa. She is mindful that her sister died from a stroke while being driven to a hospital there. She said she had no money to pay for dialysis because she was too weary from her kidney condition to hold down a job. 
 ''I feel like they are trying to get rid of me because I don't work,'' she said, her eyes tearing. ''But being sick is not my fault.'' 
 Samuel Tabares, who rolled his father into court in his bed, said his father, who was paralyzed by a stroke, would probably not survive the strain of relocation or repeated trips to the emergency room in search of treatment. 
 ''They're treating the closing of this clinic like it's the closing of a dental clinic,'' Mr. Tabares said, ''as if people's lives don't depend on it.''

HEADLINE: Federal Government Spends Stimulus Money Faster Than Expected

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The federal government is spending stimulus dollars slightly faster than originally expected, according to a government report issued Wednesday, but some programs have been hampered or delayed by confusion over some of the law's requirements. 
 The government has already paid out around $48 billion of the $49 billion that was expected to go to states and localities in the fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30, putting the rate of spending slightly ahead of schedule, according to the report, which was issued by the Government Accountability Office. The vast majority of the money spent so far -- 84 percent -- was provided in the form of extra Medicaid and education money to keep states afloat during the downturn; about 4 percent of it was for highway construction. 
 When direct federal spending to contractors and other parties, as well as tax relief, are included in the tally, more than $150 billion worth of stimulus money has been pumped into the economy so far, the White House stated. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in a statement that the report had confirmed that the stimulus ''is working to jump-start critical infrastructure projects, cushion the impact of record state budget deficits and provide new job opportunities for hard-hit communities.''
 But confusion over certain provisions of the stimulus law have slowed some programs, the report stated. 
 The law devotes $5 billion to weatherizing homes of people with low incomes to make them more energy efficient and comfortable, but the report found that many states had yet to weatherize any homes because of uncertainty over how much they had to pay their workers. 
 Unlike the government's regular, much smaller weatherization program, the stimulus law requires that workers be paid the prevailing wages for their work. But the Department of Labor had never established prevailing wage rates for weatherization work, the report found, so many states and contractors were reluctant to start work for which they might end up having to pay back wages. As a result, California, Florida and Texas -- states where weatherization is largely intended to keep houses cooler in summer -- ended August without using stimulus money to weatherize any homes. 
 The Department of Labor released its list of prevailing wages on Sept. 3 -- establishing that a weatherization worker in Bibb County, Ala., can expect $11.48 an hour, while one in Manhattan can expect $22.99 an hour -- and more states are now preparing to start work. 
 Spending on public housing was slightly slower than expected, the report found. It said housing officials attributed some of the delay to confusion over how the stimulus law's ''Buy American'' provision, which requires the use of American-made materials in some projects, applied to housing construction. 
 The report also raised questions about the Workforce Investment Act Youth Program, a $1.2 billion program to provide training and jobs for young people. California found summer jobs for only 42 percent of the 33,789 young people it served, the report found. And in Detroit some young people in the program had to wait up to four hours in the rain for their paychecks, and the police were called to assist with crowd control.

HEADLINE: Fed to Lower Safety Net, but Gingerly

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve, acknowledging that an economic recovery has begun, took a cautious step on Wednesday toward weaning the housing market off its trillion-dollar support program.
 But even as policy makers expressed new optimism about growth, they also conveyed the difficulties that lie ahead in removing the vast safety net that they have erected over the last year. 
 ''Economic activity has picked up following its severe downturn,'' the central bank said in a statement after a two-day policy meeting. It said financial markets had improved further, that activity in the housing market had increased and that household spending seemed to be stabilizing. 
 But Fed officials also cautioned that the recovery would be slow and repeated their vow to keep the benchmark overnight interest rate at virtually zero for ''an extended period.'' That almost certainly means until at least sometime next year. 
 Policy makers also announced that they would slow down the Fed's program to buy almost $1.5 trillion worth of mortgage-related securities and stretch it out through the end of March. 
 That program is aimed at keeping mortgage rates low and propping up the housing market. But the Fed now dominates the mortgage market so much that many analysts predict it will be difficult for the central bank to extract itself. 
 ''I don't think there are enough private buyers to replace the central bank,'' said Sung Won Sohn, professor of economics at California State University. ''If there is even an inkling that the Fed is going to start selling by 2010, we would see mortgage rates go up right away.''
 Fed officials did not even hint at a timetable for selling the central bank's huge mortgage portfolio. But to prevent disruptions when it simply stops buying, the Fed said it would gradually phase out its purchases over the next six months. 
 Even that could cause heartburn for prospective home buyers. Analysts estimate that the Fed is buying more than 80 percent of new mortgage-backed securities. 
 Private investors have retreated to the sidelines, and no one is sure how rapidly they will return if the Fed retreats.
 Ian Shepherdson, a forecaster at High Frequency Economics, said private credit markets were still so weak that an important measure of the money supply, known as M-2, had actually edged down in recent months. That is the opposite of what is supposed to happen under the Fed's policy of ''quantitative easing,'' under which it creates large volumes of money out of thin air to buy Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. 
 ''That tells you that the volume of private credit is falling,'' Mr. Shepherdson said. If the Fed stops its purchases, he added, the money supply might fall sharply and make credit even harder to obtain. ''I just wonder whether they have the stomach for that kind of contraction,'' he said.
 The Fed's statement on Wednesday suggested that policy makers had become slightly more optimistic since their meeting in August. At the same time, policy makers left themselves ample room to keep rates low, contending that that high unemployment and unused factory capacity would keep inflation subdued for the foreseeable future.
 The unemployment rate was 9.7 percent in September, its highest level since the early 1980s, and many analysts say they believe it will ultimately climb above 10 percent and remain well above its normal levels for several years. 
 In a sign that officials were worried about how jittery markets might become, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York issued an unusual follow-up statement on Wednesday to explain how it planned to scale back the purchase of mortgage securities.
 It said the process would start this week, with its purchases of mortgage-backed securities gradually declining in volume. It also said it would gradually reduce both the frequency and the volume of its purchases of debt issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other federal agencies that guarantee mortgages. 
 The Fed has already phased out some of the emergency lending programs it created during the financial crisis last fall. It is also wrapping up its program to buy $300 billion worth of Treasury bonds, stretching out its final purchases through the end of October.
 Even so, the Fed's balance sheet has more than doubled over the last year, to about $2 trillion. And the mortgage-security program is both bigger than any of its other efforts and more central to the economy's core weakness -- the housing market.
 Several of the Fed's more hawkish board members have pushed to end the mortgage program early, contending that it has displaced private investors and feeds inflationary pressures.
 But the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has warned that ending the stimulus programs too quickly could tip the United States back into a recession -- the same mistake policy makers made in the 1930s. On Wednesday, the Fed's policy makers voted unanimously to finish buying all the securities they had originally planned but to end the purchases by the end of March.
 Fed officials say they are under no pressure to raise interest rates quickly. With unemployment approaching 10 percent, and underemployment pushing the true jobless rate above 16 percent, Fed officials expect wage pressures to remain scant.
 Largely because of the fall in oil prices this year, the government's Consumer Price Index has actually edged down 1.5 percent over the last 12 months. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, has declined to an annual rate of 1.8 percent. Fed officials expect that rate to decline more over the next year, possibly below 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Profit at General Mills Tops Expectations

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
General Mills posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast, helped by strong sales of products like its breakfast cereals in the United States. 
 General Mills has counted on a steady stream of new products and cost-cutting measures, as well as higher prices, to lift profits. The company, whose products include Cheerios cereal and Progresso soup, has also benefited as consumers ate more meals at home to save money amid the recession, and as prices for commodities like wheat fell.
 General Mills has been gaining market share in cereal, soup and other categories, with new products like high-fiber soups and a Yoplait frozen smoothie kit helping it stave off private-label competitors.
 The company also has not raised prices in more than a year in 12 of its top 15 categories, Kendall J. Powell, its chief executive, said.
 General Mills on Wednesday said profit rose to $420.6 million, or $1.25 a share, in the first quarter, ended Aug. 30, from $278.5 million, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Excluding changes in the market value of commodity hedges the company holds, earnings were $1.28 a share. Wall Street analysts had forecast $1.03, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Sales rose less than 1 percent, to $3.52 billion, compared with a 14 percent increase a year ago. The stronger dollar, which lessens the dollar value of sales outside the United States, cut 2 percentage points from sales.
 Retail sales in the United States rose 6 percent, to $2.42 billion, helped by a 9 percent increase in sales of its Big G cereals, which include Cheerios, Fiber One, Trix and other brands.
 The company said it now expected full-year earnings of $4.40 to $4.45 a share, excluding one-time items, an increase from a previous forecast of $4.20 to $4.25. Analysts on average forecast $4.27, according to Reuters Estimates.
 While commodity costs were down in the quarter, General Mills said it still expected low-single-digit inflation for the year. It also said it planned to use some of the earnings increase on more marketing.
 Shares of General Mills rose $2.83, or 4.6 percent, to $63.80.

HEADLINE: Family-Run Amusement Parks Surviving a Downturn

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: WILDWOOD, N.J. 

 BODY:
Given that consumers have been so reluctant to spend lately, the family-run amusement park would seem especially vulnerable. 
 But amusement park owners around the country say the weather, not the housing downturn or job losses, played a bigger role in their fortunes this past summer.
 ''We had a lousy, wet June and a couple of hurricane threats this summer, so that was bad,'' said Jack Morey, who with his brother Will, owns and runs three amusement piers along the Wildwood boardwalk. ''Then the weather got better in August, and suddenly everyone was there.'' 
 If they have sunshine and moderate temperatures, Mr. Morey and his fellow owners around the country say, the slower economy seems to be favoring them. 
 Indeed, the fact that most of the independent parks are owned by families may insulate them a bit from the normal business cycles, said William Alexander, who teaches courses in family business at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ''In many cases, these are seasonal businesses,'' Mr. Alexander said. ''And in the summer, the whole family would participate. In difficult economic times, particularly, a family committed to a business will sacrifice in deferring compensation and bonuses.''
 Mr. Alexander also noted that the family-run amusement parks were generally ''not as involved as the large ones in the amusement arms race, where building the next big roller coaster is the goal.'' As a result, he said, ''Their capital cost structures are not as stretched.''
 Six Flags, which runs the Great Adventure Parks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June. New owners took over in 2005 after the company had increased its debt through expansion and spending on gigantic roller coasters. When it filed for bankruptcy, the current managers said that park attendance had held up over the last couple of years, but that revenue was not adequate to cover its debt.
 Family-operated parks run the gamut from places like Storybook Land, an amusement park in Cardiff, N.J., about a dozen miles west of Atlantic City, that offers smaller rides aimed at younger children, to places like Morey's Piers, which have roller coasters just short of the Six Flags-type screamers. Most have 20 to 50 rides or attractions, sometimes water parks, and often arcades or shows. They are day-trip places, with passes that stay firmly in the low- to mid-double-digit dollar range. A day pass for one of the Six Flags parks costs $45 to $55 a person, and parking is at least $15.
 ''We feel in competition with places like Six Flags,'' said Dick Andrew, vice president of marketing at the Lagoon and Pioneer Village, a 49-ride park in Farmington, Utah, which opened in 1886, 10 years before Utah became a state. ''Denver has a Six Flags and that is 600 miles away, and the large parks in California are more than 700 miles away. But people here in Utah think nothing of loading up the kids in the van and just driving. We always have to be aware that the customer isn't just going to come here because we are down the road.''
 Thus, the family amusement parks have to be both keepers of nostalgia and up-to-date. In Wildwood, the Moreys say they try to come up with at least one new ride or attraction a year, but still have the old bumper cars and carousel. At the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk in that central California seaside town, the Canfield family, which has owned the park for more than a century, decided not long ago to replace the Haunted Castle ride that had been showing wear after 30 years in operation.
 ''But we asked around and you know what we replaced it with? An updated Haunted Castle ride,'' said Marq S. Lipton, the company's vice president of marketing and sales. ''It is an advantage to be working for a company that has been in business for more than 100 years. You have seen just about every type of economy. You can let the past help guide your future actions and plans.''
 Even though the economy did not devastate the family parks, it did lead many of them to re-evaluate what the future might bring. At Wild West City, a 53-year-old park in northwestern New Jersey with an old-time Western village, some rides and a mock shootout and Western show on the Main Street every hour or so in the summer, there are often obstacles just to staying in business.
 ''Our cap-gun supplier went out of business two years ago,'' said Wild West City's manager, Mary Benson. ''Who would figure that? So we had to find someone else, which was more expensive.'' Licensing and insurance goes up every year, she said, and the minimum wage, which is what many young seasonal workers often get, jumped in New Jersey to $7.25 this year from $6.15 an hour in 2006. Corporate business -- companies throwing picnics and the like -- has declined but, she said, will hopefully come back when the economy improves.
 ''We're managing, but we do it because we love it,'' she said, noting that the owner, Mike Stabile, whose family bought the park in 1963, still gets out on the Main Street daily to do the lasso show.
 There have been at least three closings of long-term amusement parks this year, according to Jim Futrell, the historian for the National Amusement Park Historical Association and the writer of four books on amusement parks. But all those, he said, had family-based disagreements, and were not related to the general economy. In the early part of the decade, though, he said, several seaside parks in places like Myrtle Beach and the Outer Banks and the New Jersey shore closed because the land along the ocean just became too valuable.
 ''The ironic thing, though, is that most all of that land lies vacant today,'' he said. ''It never did become condos or housing developments,'' he said. In fact, in one place, Sea Isle City, N.J., the town leased back the land to an amusement operator this summer. John Fricano, owner of Storybook Land, which has been in his family for 54 years, said the family amusement park offered a form of stability to customers. ''People know what we have to offer, and well, we have been lucky that they always come back,'' he said. ''There are always new kids and, for the most part, this business is about kids and their families. Now the original kids bring their kids.''

HEADLINE: For Host City, G-20 Is a Shot at Image Repair

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
For this city, the G-20 economic meeting is a mixed blessing.
 The mayor, Luke Ravenstahl, has estimated that the thousands of attendees and protesters will spend $35 million in the city during the two-day conference, which starts Thursday. But his office has also said the extra security may cost more than $19 million. The federal government is providing $10 million, and the state around $4 million, leaving the city responsible for the rest. 
 But more important, the mayor said, the meeting will give Pittsburgh the chance to change its pervasive image as a gritty, dying Rust Belt city. 
 ''Since early August, journalists, dignitaries and safety officials have been visiting our city, eating at our restaurants, shopping in our stores and staying in our hotels,'' Mr. Ravenstahl, 29, said. ''That's just the short-term gain. In the long-term, you really can't put a dollar value on the amount of free marketing we've received worldwide.''
 The mayor said Pittsburgh's story of economic transformation had helped to dispel ''our city's 'smoky' image and replace it with the real 'green' image, which tells the story of how you can reinvent and diversify your economy.''
 Pittsburgh's unemployment rate, the mayor noted, is 7.7 percent, below both the state and national averages, and he said the city had been a pioneer in green technology. The G-20 leaders will meet in the new, energy-efficient David L. Lawrence Convention Center, and they will eat dinner at the Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, which was designed to use almost no outside energy or water.
 The protests planned for the conference, however, are also a painful reminder of how many still see this former steel town. Even though Pittsburgh has remade itself by attracting young professionals with university and hospital jobs, the city, for many, remains a symbol of the collapse of the nation's industrial base and the loss of manufacturing jobs. 
 ''This city is a perfect place to be raising these concerns about jobs being sent overseas and a government that bails out banks but isn't willing to regulate capital,'' said Larry Holmes, a spokesman for Bail Out the People Movement, whose group has called for a new version of the Works Progress Administration that President Franklin D. Roosevelt created during the Great Depression. In the Hill District, a largely black neighborhood, Mr. Holmes's group has erected a ''tent city'' of unemployed and homeless people who have come here to have their voices heard. 
 The protests began in earnest Wednesday as Greenpeace activists unfurled a banner off the West End Bridge that billowed over the Ohio River and read ''Danger'' above the words ''Climate Destruction Ahead'' and ''Reduce CO2 Emissions Now.''
 Fourteen activists were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and obstructing traffic, among other charges, said Assistant Chief Bill Bochter of the Pittsburgh Police Department.
 While most protest groups applied for city permits and have pledged to use nonviolent means to get their messages across, the city refused to grant permits to use several parks and routes that would have allowed demonstrators to march within sight and sound of the G-20 conference.
 Two groups sued the city in federal court here for what they described as sustained harassment and pre-emptive arrests by the police, but a judge Tuesday declined to issue an injunction.
 The police this week have said they want to be prepared if things become chaotic.
 National Guard troops are joining the city's 900 police officers in patrolling the streets. The city has also called on an additional 3,000 city, state and federal officers to help.
 ''Our goal all along has been to work with groups who want to peacefully demonstrate their views to world leaders,'' Mr. Ravenstahl said. 
 The police said they wanted to avoid the types of confrontations that occurred in 1999 in Seattle during meetings of the World Trade Organization, when the police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to quell protests, resulting in about 600 arrests and $3 million in property damage. 
 Wayne Ranick, a spokesman for the United Steelworkers union, whose world headquarters is in Pittsburgh, said he was focused on other legacies from the 1999 W.T.O. protests.
 ''The blue-green alliance'' is still intact, he said, referring to the partnership formed on the streets of Seattle, where Teamsters and protesters dressed as sea turtles. 
 Leo W. Gerard, president of the steelworkers union, said he and several leaders of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. had organized joint events this week with the Sierra Club and the Alliance for Climate Protection. Mr. Ranick said that the shared goal would be to push for more vigorous regulation of financial and credit markets, more stringent environmental standards and stronger commitments to human rights and the rights of workers to organize.

HEADLINE: Clip-and-Save Renaissance

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Heather Hernandez walked into a supermarket with a stack of coupons last month and walked out with $160 worth of groceries, for which she paid $30.
 ''With the economy right now everyone wants to make their dollars go further,'' said Ms. Hernandez, a stay-at-home mother in Houston who clips and files coupons with the meticulousness of an accountant. ''I see all kinds of people using coupons. I see teenagers using coupons. I see grandfathers using coupons.''
 It may be the digital age, but when it comes to pinching pennies, most consumers are opting for a method that is well over a 100 years old: the paper coupon. Thanks to the miserable economy, coupons -- like board games and family dinners around the kitchen table -- have made a comeback. The recession has even made coupon clippers out of some groups that once avoided them, including well-to-do shoppers and young shoppers.
 ''Coupons were not in vogue during our period of gluttonous consumption,'' said Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist in San Francisco and an author of ''Gen BuY: How Tweens, Teens and Twenty-Somethings Are Revolutionizing Retail.'' ''But now that it's once again cool to be cheap, they're back.'' 
 Coupon redemption in America peaked in 1992, at the end of a recession, when 7.9 billion coupons were redeemed, according to Inmar, a coupon-processing company. By 2006, that number fell to 2.6 billion and stagnated there through 2008. 
 As the economy worsened and consumer sentiment plunged, coupon redemption ticked up 10 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with the period a year ago -- the first jump in coupon redemption since the early 1990s. In the first half of this year, coupon redemption climbed 23 percent. Some 1.6 billion coupons were redeemed, leading Inmar to forecast that more than three billion coupons will be redeemed this year.
 More of them are being redeemed by consumers who have long avoided coupons. 
 ''The households that tend to not coupon as much are all couponing significantly more this year versus last year,'' said Neil Heffernan, senior vice president and general manager for the research company Knowledge Networks/PDI. The group's most recent figures show that in January and February combined, coupon use among young, single consumers with minimal savings rose 14 percent, in contrast to the same months last year. 
 Coupon use among another group -- affluent consumers born in the late 1950s and 1960s -- rose 13 percent in January and February, compared with the same months in the previous year. Data from Nielsen published last month underscored this trend, showing that households earning $70,000 or more a year were among the top coupon users.
 Matthew Tilley, director of marketing for Inmar, said that coupon use was growing most among such groups and that they were the ones driving traffic to Web sites with printable coupons, like Redplum.com and Coupons.com. Redemption of printable coupons, which span the divide between old-fashioned paper coupons and newer digital versions, grew 308 percent in the first half of this year, from a small base.
 ''I believe it's not coincidental that the spike in coupon redemption began just as some of the worst economic news hit the front pages,'' Mr. Tilley said, adding that coupon-cutting is but one more way consumers are changing their habits. ''Folks are going back to the basics,'' he said, ''trying to live simpler lives.'' 
 Coupon redemption was also spurred on by marketers who dangled more valuable deals. Mr. Tilley said there was a 9 percent increase last year in the face value of coupons. That has declined slightly this year, though; marketers know more consumers are using coupons, and companies can afford to pull back a bit. 
 ''It is a sign of the times,'' said Kelly McFalls, a spokeswoman for BJ's Wholesale Club, which accepts manufacturers' coupons. Underscoring the nationwide trend, more BJ's shoppers are using such coupons, as well as the BJ's store coupons.
 Digital coupon use, on the Web and on cellphones, is also growing. In the first half of this year about 10 million digital coupons were redeemed, up 25 percent compared with the period a year earlier, according to Inmar. However, paper coupons still make up the bulk of coupons redeemed in the nation, with digital coupons accounting for less than half a percent of all coupons distributed. 
 The primacy of paper over pixels is partly because new methods of digitally distributing coupons have yet to fully catch on. It is also because many grocery and drug stores still offer coupons inside weekend newspapers. Indeed, in the first half of this year there was a 29 percent increase in coupons distributed for food products, in contrast to the period a year ago, according to Inmar. As Mr. Tilley put it, that ''is going to boost redemption because everybody's got to eat.''
 Consumer psychologists posit yet another reason for the popularity of paper coupons: Because it takes more work to acquire them, the people who do so feel they have outsmarted other shoppers. 
 ''Saving money so often means not doing something, as in not buying something,'' Ms. Yarrow said. ''Coupon-clipping has a proactive quality to it that appeals to bargain hunters.''
 And though some consumers know about mobile coupon services like Cellfire, scholars say shoppers still have concerns about privacy and security. ''In the same way it took a while for A.T.M.'s to catch on,'' Ms. Yarrow said, ''I think it'll take a bit longer for the mobile coupons to become mainstream.''
 Coupon devotees see the enterprise as vast game of saving money, and they share tips through increasingly popular Web sites. 
 One of their strategies is to hold onto their coupons until the store puts those items on sale -- typically a month or so after the coupons are first offered. Coupon clippers who regularly save about half of their weekly grocery bill say it is because they watch store fliers to find out when items will go on sale and then use their coupons on top of the sale price. 
 ''Sometimes the coupon brings you down to nearly zero dollars,'' said Susan J. Samtur of Scarsdale, N.Y., who is known in bargain-hunting circles as the coupon queen. 
 While some consumers dismiss coupon-cutting as too time-consuming, adept coupon users contend it is a matter of getting into the habit, though it does require discipline. 
 Longtime coupon users, for instance, do not keep coupons crumpled up in their wallets. They opt for small accordion folders with tabs for shopping categories that correspond to store aisles, like ''baking'' and ''frozen foods.'' They keep scissors on hand. They clip coupons on Sundays and file them while on the subway, or while boiling water for spaghetti. And they paper-clip coupons to their shopping lists so they do not forget to use them.
 Another way coupon clippers save is by shedding brand loyalty and buying whatever is on sale. Ms. Samtur, who hunts for coupons for consumers at Selectcouponprogram.com, is so good at it that she also shops for her adult children -- including the girlfriends of two of her sons. 
 ''I'm paying 30 cents for the yogurt, and they're not fussy,'' she said, ''so long as it's the low-fat ones.''
 Also, coupon mavens point out that even if a coupon expires, stores may be flexible about the rules for their own coupons. Ms. Hernandez of Houston, who chronicles her deals at freebies4mom.com, recently spent more than $50 on groceries, then found out she missed a deal for $10 off any purchase of $50 or more. She went back to the store with her receipt and got $10 back. 
 ''It never hurts to ask,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Survey Shows Pull of the U.S. Is Still Strong Inside Mexico

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
In spite of high unemployment in the United States and strict border enforcement, one-third of Mexicans say they would move to this country if they could, and more than half of those would move even if they did not have legal immigration documents, according to a survey published Wednesday by the Pew Research Center. 
 The United States still exerts a powerful attraction for Mexicans, the survey found, with 57 percent saying that those who leave home to settle here have better lives, while only 14 percent say life is worse in the United States. 
 Many Mexicans want to migrate here even though they are well informed about the hardships they could face and are expecting conditions at home to improve. Nearly half of those surveyed said they knew someone who had tried to reach the United States but had returned home after being caught by border authorities. Four in 10 said they knew someone who had returned home unable to find a job here.
 Although 78 percent of Mexicans said they were not happy with their nation's direction, 61 percent said they expected the economy to get better in the coming year. 
 ''For many, many people in Mexico, this is still the land of opportunity,'' said Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan organization in Washington. The poll in Mexico is part of a series of surveys that Pew conducted this year in 24 nations and the Palestinian territories to examine global attitudes.
 Personal connections between the two countries are intense. About 4 in 10 Mexicans reported having relatives or friends in the United States they communicated with regularly. 
 The survey suggests that recent declines in Mexican migration to the United States may be only temporary. A study in July by the Pew Hispanic Center, part of the Pew organization, found a steep decrease in recent years in the flow of Mexican migrants, especially since 2007. Scholars and immigration officials say intensified border controls have combined with the lack of jobs in the United States to discourage Mexicans from attempting an illegal journey. Currently, about 11.5 million Mexicans live in this country, according to Pew; an estimated 7 million of them are illegal immigrants. 
 The survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews from May 26 to June 2 with 1,000 adults in Mexico, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

HEADLINE: A Plan to Add Supermarkets, and Fresh Food, to the City's Poorer Neighborhoods

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration, in its ever-expanding campaign to make New Yorkers eat better, has already clamped down on trans fats, deployed fruit vendors to produce-poor neighborhoods and prodded corner bodegas to sell leafy green vegetables and low-fat milk.
 Now, in a city known more for hot dogs and egg creams than the apple of its nickname, officials want to establish an even bigger beachhead for healthy food -- new supermarkets in areas where fresh produce is scarce and where poverty, obesity and diabetes run high.
 Under a proposal the City Planning Commission unanimously approved on Wednesday, the city would offer zoning and tax incentives to spur the development of full-service grocery stores that devote a certain amount of space to fresh produce, meats, dairy and other perishables.
 The plan -- which has broad support among food policy experts, supermarket executives and City Council members, whose approval is needed -- would permit developers to construct larger buildings than existing zoning would ordinarily allow, and give tax abatements and exemptions for approved stores in large swaths of northern Manhattan, central Brooklyn and the South Bronx, as well as downtown Jamaica in Queens. 
 ''This is about being able to walk to get your groceries in those areas that are really, really underserved and basically have no place to buy fresh produce,'' said Amanda M. Burden, the city planning commissioner. Residents in such areas, she said, have been spending ''their grocery dollars at Duane Reade and CVS on chips and soda.''
 The move comes as governments across the nation struggle to solve what public health advocates call an epidemic of obesity and diabetes. Schools have banned sugary drinks; lawmakers have helped urban farms spread like crabgrass on undeveloped lots; and cities like Los Angeles and Berkeley, Calif., have limited the concentration of fast-food restaurants in low-income areas. 
 But the New York proposal, adapted from a Pennsylvania program that provides grants and loans for supermarket construction, is unusual because it employs a mix of zoning and financial incentives to attract, rather than repel, a narrowly defined type of commercial enterprise.
 ''It is exciting to see that City Planning is taking an initiative to address food because the planning profession has really ignored the food system for the past 100 years,'' said Nevin Cohen, an assistant professor of urban studies at the New School, pointing out that the Bloomberg administration's elaborate blueprint to guide future development, PlaNYC 2030, barely mentions food. 
 The new zoning would break down some barriers that grocery stores face, said Ben Thomases, the city's food policy coordinator, including competition from drugstores and other retailers that have higher profit margins than supermarkets do and can pay higher rents. 
 Under the proposed rules, a residential building with a fresh-food store could be up to 20,000 square feet larger than would normally be allowed, enabling developers to make more money by building more apartments.
 Smaller stores in certain commercial and manufacturing districts would be exempt from a requirement that they provide customer parking. And in manufacturing districts, developers could build stores of up to 30,000 square feet -- the current limit is 10,000 -- without going through the city's laborious and expensive land-use review process.
 Although there has been little opposition to the proposal's goals, labor leaders have insisted that the stores be required to pay so-called living wages and offer health benefits to employees.
 There is little consensus outside the administration that the program would significantly change eating habits, especially in a grim economy. 
 A recent report to Congress by the Department of Agriculture said that the relationship between access to good food and obesity was ''not well understood'' by experts. It concluded that more research was needed to identify the many factors that can guide food choices.
 Indeed, the city's earlier efforts to make fresh foods more readily available in poor neighborhoods have yielded mixed results.
 Efforts to encourage the city's bodegas to stock low-fat milk and fresh produce have been less successful than originally hoped, with health department officials now focusing their efforts on 60 stores every six months, rather than the roughly 1,000 they started with in the two programs in 2006. 
 And though there is anecdotal evidence that customers have been flocking to some of the fruit and vegetable carts the city is helping to place along the sidewalks of poor neighborhoods, it is too early to know if there will be enough demand to keep them in business. 
 Avi Kaner, a co-owner of Morton Williams, which operates 12 supermarkets in New York and New Jersey, including two in the Bronx, praised the new proposal as a ''very worthy endeavor to improve nutrition,'' but said the city should focus on education in attacking the root causes of obesity and diet-related illness.
 ''If you force distribution of product to a population that's not interested in it, or not educated in it, and the grocery stores can't make a profit,'' he said, ''they'll eventually leave.''
 City officials, who have mounted several public education campaigns to improve nutrition, point to the rising use of food stamps at farmers' markets and the crowds of shoppers at the enormous Pathmark on 125th Street in East Harlem as proof of the pent-up demand for locally grown cauliflower and packages of boneless chicken breasts in the so-called food deserts that lack them. 
 The Pennsylvania program, for instance, has, over the last four years, financed 74 supermarkets across the state, about a quarter of them in Philadelphia; relatively few have gone out of business. In addition, the markets have created or preserved thousands of jobs and stimulated economic development around them, supporters of the approach say. New York officials said they expected to help create 15 new stores and upgrade 10 existing ones.
 The plan appears to be as much about economics as it is about changing unhealthy habits. Supporters say that more supermarkets will bring sales tax revenue to the city and sorely needed jobs to poor communities, while encouraging gentrification to continue its sweep across the boroughs. 
 ''If you're thinking of moving your family to the Lower Concourse,'' Ms. Burden said, referring to a large manufacturing area in the South Bronx that the commission recently rezoned to include residential construction, ''you're going to say, like, 'Wow, there is no grocery store here. I'm not going to move here.' ''
 The new stores' primary business must be selling groceries, and the zoning proposal is explicit about just what they must sell: Of a minimum of 6,000 square feet devoted to grocery items, at least 3,000 square feet must be reserved for food.
 The proposal would also require store owners to display signs at the entrances that include a special ''Fresh'' logo from the planning department and the statement, ''This store sells fresh food.''
 Many supermarket chains, from bargain to upscale ones, said they hoped to take advantage of the incentives.
 ''It's definitely enticing for us,'' said Christina Minardi, president for the Northeast region at Whole Foods. She said that the chain, which has half a dozen stores in Manhattan, had been sporadically looking to open a store in Harlem, an area it might not typically move into, but where ''an incentive might help.'' 
 Generally, she said, Whole Foods stores need a certain concentrationof ''people that live our lifestyle,'' which includes a concern for ''what they're putting into their bodies.'' Santino Montalbano, the director of real estate for Western Beef, which operates a number of large warehouse-style stores in mixed-income New York neighborhoods, also praised the proposal, which he said would make it easier to compete with stores like Rite Aid.
 ''They're just making more on their drugs than we are'' on groceries, he said. ''We're just making pennies on our cans of corn.''

HEADLINE: Green and De Blasio Focus on Attacks and Endorsements in Public Advocate Debate

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
Mark Green, seeking to return to his former position as public advocate, unleashed a barrage of attacks on Bill de Blasio in a debate on Wednesday night, trying to cast doubt on his opponent's trustworthiness and independence before the Democratic runoff. 
 Mr. de Blasio, a city councilman from Brooklyn, calmly dismissed the criticism as the modus operandi of a politician who has unsuccessfully run for office many times. 
 The tense, hourlong debate, held at the NY1 television studio in Manhattan, was dominated by exchanges over private consulting fees, political contributions and endorsements.
 From the beginning, Mr. de Blasio found himself answering questions about the accounting practices of the Working Families Party (which has endorsed him), and the $33,000 that he was paid in 2006 as a consultant to the Progressive America Foundation (Mr. de Blasio said it had been preapproved by the city's Conflicts of Interest Board). 
 ''I'd love to talk about positive issues, but he has to answer questions about his pattern of misconduct when it comes to money before the Council,'' Mr. Green said in the opening minutes of the debate. 
 ''That's Mark again, throwing a bomb for his own purposes,'' Mr. de Blasio answered. 
 Mr. de Blasio kept up a familiar line of attack on his opponent, reminding the audience that Mr. Green has not been in public service in years. (He has been an author and a lecturer at New York University, among other things.) 
 ''I truly respect what Mark did in the '70s, '80s and '90s,'' Mr. de Blasio said. ''I'm trying to focus on what's happening in this decade.''
 As he has done for weeks, Mr. de Blasio painted Mr. Green as out of touch, suggesting that he was not aware of issues important to residents. 
 When Mr. de Blasio was prompted to ask Mr. Green a question, he quizzed him on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposal last year to overhaul the city's senior centers and reduce their funding. 
 ''I'm interested to know what you thought of that proposal, your analysis of it, and what you did as a result of your view of the mayor's proposal,'' Mr. de Blasio said. 
 ''Thank you, Bill,'' Mr. Green said, before stumbling for a second or two. ''The issue of senior centers is vital, in this bad economy, with real income down and seniors threatened. It's vital that they -- that we maintain the senior centers as is, which the City Council did do.'' 
 It was the third time Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Green met for an official debate. The previous two were crowded affairs, with four candidates behind lecterns (and jostling for their chance at 45-second rebuttals). The Democratic primary last week eliminated Eric N. Gioia, a city councilman from Queens, and Norman Siegel, a civil rights lawyer. 
 In this debate, which was broadcast on NY1 and the radio station WNYC, the candidates were seated side by side, holding clipboards and scribbling notes. They rarely looked directly at each other, one often glancing off to the side as the other talked.
 No one watching the debate would come away with much insight on the candidates' positions on the issues, for they were rarely asked about them. 
 They were asked, however, if they had ever fired a gun, visited a strip club or used an illegal drug other than marijuana. (No, no and no, they both said.)
 And they spent plenty of time name-dropping the endorsements they had collected during the campaign. 
 ''Robert F. Kennedy Jr., when he endorsed me,'' Mr. Green said in one answer.
 ''The corrections officers endorsed me just today,'' Mr. de Blasio said a minute later, not to be outdone. 
 There were signs that some questions in the so-called lightning round, when candidates were asked to respond with a simple yes or no, had become a little tired. 
 At least one of the questions posed by the moderator, Dominic Carter of NY1, had been asked in a previous debate. 
 ''Have you ever been arrested?'' Mr. Carter said. 
 ''You asked me that 10 days ago,'' Mr. Green said, impatiently. ''Since then I haven't been arrested, and so, the answer is still no.'' 
 Turnout for the Democratic primary on Sept. 15 was at a record low, and political analysts said they expected the turnout in the runoff election on Tuesday to be even lower. 
 Yet a poll released on Wednesday by Quinnipiac University suggested that the public advocate race could be close: Both candidates had 46 percent of the vote, with 7 percent undecided. The poll had a small sample size, 358 likely Democratic primary voters, and a 5.2 percent margin of error.
 Whoever wins will face the Republican candidate, Alex T. Zablocki, in November.

HEADLINE: A Regulator Of Banks Gives Them A Scolding

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.; Julia Werdigier contributed reporting.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
''Crackers.'' ''Insulting.'' ''Stupid.''
 Those epithets and more have been hurled at Adair Turner, the blue-blooded scold of City of London, Europe's Wall Street. 
 But after the financial debacles of the past year, Mr. Turner, Britain's chief financial regulator, refuses to back down. He insists on posing some uncomfortable questions for London financiers -- and he is raising a bit of a ruckus in the process. 
 Mr. Turner is daring to ask the very question that many Britons, and indeed, many Americans, are asking themselves: What good are banks if all they do is push money around and enrich themselves? As he sees it, the City takes too much from British society and gives back too little. It has grown too big and too powerful. And, he contends, the bankers have co-opted many of the regulators who watch over them. 
 So Mr. Turner is proposing a few changes, none of which would make the bankers very happy. Tax financial transactions. Increase capital requirements. Shrink the financial industry, which, at its peak, accounted for roughly 11 percent of the British economy. Only then, he argues, can banks' excessive profits -- and bankers' pay -- be curtailed. 
 Mr. Turner, 54 years old, took up his banner again on Tuesday night, lecturing City financiers and lawyers about the dangers of reckless banking at an industry dinner held at Mansion House, the grand Georgian residence of the Lord Mayor of London. He said his agency, the Financial Services Authority, would recommend to leaders of the Group of 20 nations, who are meeting this week in Pittsburgh, that banks use their new profits to strengthen their finances, rather than to pay out lavish bonuses or stock dividends.
 Banks ''need to be willing, like the regulator, to recognize that there are some profitable activities so unlikely to have a social benefit, direct or indirect, that they should voluntarily walk away from them,'' Mr. Turner told the group. When the dinner broke up and the crowd spilled out into the foyer, many bankers shook their heads. 
 Mr. Turner's critique of modern finance is turning heads on both sides of the Atlantic. His central thesis -- that banking has assumed an outsize role in economic life -- is anathema to many of his establishment peers. And his proposed tax, known as a ''Tobin tax,'' after James Tobin, the economist, strikes many of them as downright dangerous. Such a tax would siphon jobs and business from the City, his detractors say. 
 Labour and Conservative politicians seem to have finally found a point on which they agree: The City is vital to Britain, and imposing the kind of tax that Mr. Turner suggests would threaten London's status as a premier financial center. 
 But to Mr. Turner, the point has been less about his proposal -- a pragmatist, he realizes that there is little chance such a tax would win international support -- than the reaction to it. The uproar shows that the ''quasi-religious'' dogma of finance -- that the markets are always right and that governments should let money flow freely around the world -- is as ingrained as ever, he said. But now more than ever, given the events of the past year, regulators must challenge such notions, he said. 
 ''We have begun to accept this idea that liquidity is the new God,'' Mr. Turner said in an interview earlier this month. 
 ''The ideology of efficient markets became deeply embedded within the regulatory community,'' he continued. ''And if you are of the belief that we have to challenge this, then you can't help not to make speeches about it.''
 And that is exactly what Mr. Turner has done, almost from the day that he took over as chairman of the Financial Services Authority during the very week that Lehman Brothers collapsed.
 Part Cambridge don, part moralist, he has, in effect, been running a tutorial on the origins of the crisis, and what must be done, to a class consisting of his fellow regulators, politicians, bankers and the broader public.
 In March, he published the Turner Review, a 126-page report that combined eye-catching charts, intricate economic analysis and an overlay of thinly veiled disgust. It became required reading in the City, as well as on Wall Street and in Washington. On Capitol Hill, Mr. Turner has established a working rapport with Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. 
 Mr. Turner is certainly an unlikely rebel. He became wealthy working at McKinsey, the consulting company, and in 1995 became head of the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's main business lobby.
 Chairmanships to high-level policy panels followed, covering topics from the minimum wage, pensions and climate change -- all sandwiched between a job as vice chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe from 2000 to 2006.
 Some suspect that Mr. Turner -- who was nicknamed Red Adair in the 1990s after he wondered aloud if British workers had an adequate share of the economy -- takes a dim view of free markets in general and enjoys railing against them. 
 Asked about Mr. Turner's views, a top civil servant in the Treasury smirked and rolled his eyes. Prime Minister Gordon Brown has played down Mr. Turner's tax proposal. Such a tax would be impossible without international cooperation, the prime minister maintains. He made it clear that the British government would not be pushing for the tax at the Group of 20 meeting.
 And if, as expected, the Conservatives win this spring's general election, the Tories will end the F.S.A.'s autonomy and squeeze the agency into the Bank of England.
 Even Mr. Turner's peers in the academic community remain skeptical.
 ''The Tobin tax is an old and bad story,'' said Richard Portes, a professor of economics at the London Business School. ''It wouldn't curb speculation, and it would have no effect on the size of the banking sector.''
 Mr. Turner, in the interview, conceded that the odds for his tax were slim. But he said bankers and regulators should not be so quick to dismiss it. ''I can understand if you have really looked at it. But they are saying it will never work,'' Mr. Turner said. ''And sometimes there are things that may not work that are quite worth investigating.''

HEADLINE: Nonprofits Paying Price For Gamble On Finances

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Homeowners and businesses were not alone in taking on piles of debt over the last decade. Nonprofits of all sizes did the same, and now they, too, are paying the price.
 Far from being conservative stewards of their assets, many nonprofits engaged in what some experts call risky financial behavior. ''They did auction-rate securities, interest-rate arbitrage, complex swaps -- which backfired on them the same way it would backfire on any hedge fund or asset manager,'' said Clara Miller, chief executive of the Nonprofit Finance Fund, which has experienced a huge increase in organizations turning to it for assistance with soured bonds. ''Organizations got to be all fancy-pants with their financial management.'' 
 Those struggling now include the full range of nonprofits, including museums, colleges, orchestras and small local social service providers.
 For example, Brandeis University, with $208 million in tax-exempt bonds outstanding, plans to close its art museum and sell off the collection to raise money. The Orange County Performing Arts Center, with $265 million in bonds, has laid off staff members. Copia, a culinary center in Napa, Calif., went bankrupt in December with $78 million in bond-related debt that its lawyer blames for its failure. 
 Even Harvard, with some $2.5 billion in tax-exempt bonds at the end of fiscal 2007, and Yale, with $1.6 billion, are cutting jobs, freezing salaries and delaying dormitory and lab construction.
 While debt is the not primary reason for these institutions' woes, the need to service it eats into their dwindling financial resources, forcing near Faustian choices. ''Debt is the fourth horseman of the nonprofit apocalypse,'' Ms. Miller said. ''Add it to the failure of governments to fulfill contracts, declining donated revenues and a surge in demand for nonprofit services, and suddenly a lot of nonprofits are faced with some very hard choices.''
 Much of the nonprofits' debt is in the form of tax-exempt bonds. The number of charities issuing such bonds more than doubled from 1993 to 2006, according to figures compiled by the Internal Revenue Service, and the amount of debt linked to those bonds rose to $311 billion from $98 billion (adjusted for inflation to 2006 dollars).
 In many cases, charities used the money from bonds to buy real estate and build facilities. Prep schools added golf courses, pools and observatories. Colleges bought entire neighborhoods and put up labs and sports facilities. Museums erected new wings, and symphonies added thousands of seats to their concert halls.
 These nonprofits gambled that income from donations and investments would more than cover their debt service. But the recession turned that logic inside out. 
 Norman I. Silber, a law professor at Hofstra University who has done extensive research on the problem, calls the rising debt of nonprofits a ''calamity.''
 ''If my analysis is correct,'' said Professor Silber, who is also a member of several nonprofit boards, ''over the next several years nonprofits across the country will have to renegotiate bond covenants, reduce services, cut staff or actually default and face foreclosures, repossessions, and in some cases, even bankruptcy.''
 Before 1986, only nonprofit hospitals were allowed to float tax-exempt bonds, which they used to build new facilities. Then Congress amended the tax code to allow all charities access to the credit markets, and now even the tiny Family Service of Greater Boston has tax-exempt bond liabilities.
 To be sure, the assets at nonprofits grew faster than bond-related debt. In the dozen years that ended in 2006, the value of assets held by nonprofits grew to $1.37 trillion from $347 billion (adjusted for inflation to 2006 dollars), thanks to more large gifts, increased property values, rising stock prices -- and the explosion of tax-exempt debt.
 ''I think one could make a good argument that the greatest contributor to the enormous growth in university endowments and other endowments is not some wealthy person or persons,'' said Robert L. Culver, chief executive of MassDevelopment, a state agency that supports nonprofits' floating bonds, ''but the federal government making available low-cost, tax-exempt debt that allowed endowments to remain invested and earn rates in the market as high as 25 percent.''
 Traditionally, projected income determined how much debt an organization could handle, but Professor Silber suspects that as assets grew, lenders began extending credit based on how much money a nonprofit had in its endowment. 
 ''Now, those assets have dropped in value by 20, 30 percent, but the amount of debt hasn't changed,'' he said.
 Consider the case of New York Law School, which floated $135 million in auction-rate securities in 2006 in a deal that won an award for the creative use of structured finance.
 The school had sold its library, on prime Manhattan real estate, for $136.5 million, but instead of building a library, it added the money from the sale to its endowment and borrowed for construction. Interest on the securities was just under 4 percent, the dean, Richard A. Matasar, said, compared with the 5.5 percent the school would have paid using ordinary fixed-rate bonds.
 The Tax Code bars nonprofits from taking money raised with tax-exempt bonds and investing it in higher-yielding investments, a form of arbitrage. But it does not prohibit the strategy used by New York Law School, which many tax experts regard as a major flaw in the law. 
 ''Congress's intent in allowing charities to use bonds is to help them achieve their missions -- build a health care center or a preschool,'' said Dean Zerbe, former tax counsel to the Senate Finance Committee, ''not to engage in fast and loose financial games.''
 Mr. Matasar said the school did not engage in arbitrage. ''The fact that we were fortunate enough to be able to sell a building to raise additional funds was a separate and distinct transaction,'' he said.
 When the credit market began souring last year, interest rates climbed sharply, hitting 12 percent in one week as buyers failed to show up for auctions of the school's securities. 
 In December, New York Law School refinanced its debt, converting its securities into variable-rate notes secured by a letter of credit, Mr. Matasar said. Its endowment had fallen 20 percent to $186 million.
 The Culinary Institute of America ramped up its use of tax-exempt bonds to finance construction of facilities. By the end of 2007, it had $104 million in debt, about 70 percent of which was auction-rate. Charlie O'Mara, the institute's chief financial officer, figured it saved about $750,000 in financing costs that way. ''It would have been a great strategy,'' he said, ''if our credit markets did not blow up.''
 Like New York Law School, the institute saw its cheap financing evaporate when its bond insurer was downgraded and the auction market vanished. The institute was able to refinance its debt. But experts predict that many charities, particularly cultural organizations that are seeing declining revenues, will have a harder time.
 Soliciting donors to pay off debt ''would be like me going to my husband and saying, 'Give me money because I spent too much at Saks Fifth Avenue,' '' said Naomi Levine, a former star fund-raiser for New York University who now teaches at the university's Heyman Center for Philanthropy. ''It would be very, very difficult.''

HEADLINE: Brown to Offer to Cut British Nuclear Sub

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS; Liz Robbins contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Gordon Brown will use a speech at the United Nations Security Council on Thursday to offer the possibility of Britain's reducing its fleet of ballistic nuclear missile submarines as part of a new global pact on nuclear weapons, aides to Mr. Brown said on Wednesday.
 The British proposal envisions cutting back on a $33 billion, 20-year program to replace the Royal Navy's Trident missile fleet, which has constituted Britain's nuclear deterrent force since the mid-1990s. Instead of replacing all four Vanguard-class submarines in the fleet, the Downing Street aides said, Mr. Brown will suggest that Britain build only three. 
 If effected, the reduction would be Britain's first move in decades to reduce its nuclear force. But Downing Street aides were quick to say the cut was not part of a plan to revert to the 1980s Labour policy of unilaterally dismantling Britain's nuclear force, a policy that contributed to the party's political decline. The scrapping of that policy in the 1990s was an important step toward returning the party to power in 1997.
 In a speech on Wednesday afternoon to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Mr. Brown offered a preview of his proposal, calling on the world's leaders to ''accept that we are at a moment of danger.'' He described the plan as a ''grand global bargain'' between nuclear and nonnuclear states. 
 ''If we are serious about the ambition of a nuclear-free world,'' Mr. Brown said, ''we will need statesmanship, not brinkmanship.''
 Earlier, in a BBC interview in New York on Wednesday, Mr. Brown cast his proposal as a step toward increasing Britain's influence in a new round of international negotiations on nuclear weapons. President Obama gave his own push to that effort in a speech on Wednesday, telling the General Assembly that the United States would move ahead with a broad effort to curb nuclear weapons, including a ''nuclear posture review'' aimed at achieving deep cuts in the American nuclear arsenal.
 Downing Street aides said Mr. Brown's proposal would depend, among other things, on progress in persuading other nations that have nuclear weapons or are seeking to acquire them to accept cuts and constraints of their own. One focus is Iran, which has so far resisted international pressure to abandon elements of a nuclear program that Western intelligence experts believe to be aimed at producing weapons.
 In the BBC interview, Mr. Brown said that nuclear weapons powers, including Britain, ''have to make some contribution to the reduction of nuclear weapons'' as part of the process of revising and extending the 1970 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which will culminate in a review conference next year that is seen as central to efforts to curb nuclear arsenals.
 His aides said a watershed for the British proposal would come before the end of this year, when a powerful national security council, including the heads of the country's armed forces, makes its own assessment of the proposal. Crucial to that decision, the aides said, will be a judgment on whether a fleet of only three submarines will be enough to ensure that Britain can maintain one submarine on deep-sea patrol at all times, as it has for the past 40 years.
 One important political hurdle appeared to have been crossed when the opposition Conservatives endorsed the Brown proposal, virtually assuring it would not become a contentious issue in the next general election, which must be held by June 2010. For months, opinion polls in Britain have pointed to the strong possibility that the Brown government will be defeated by David Cameron's Conservatives.
 Liam Fox, the Conservatives' shadow defense minister, said in another BBC interview that Mr. Brown's proposal seemed ''reasonable and sensible,'' as long as experts determined that a three-submarine force would be enough to keep one vessel at sea at all times. The Trident submarine fleet, based at Faslane in Scotland, near Glasgow, commonly has three of the four vessels in or near home port, undergoing maintenance or sea trials, at any time. The vessels carry a total of 160 nuclear warheads, making Britain the world's fifth largest nuclear power, after the United States, Russia, China and France.
 Mr. Fox also noted a factor that Downing Street aides played down in flagging Mr. Brown's proposal: the possibility of Britain's achieving significant defense savings. The need has been accentuated by two separate developments. One is the economic pump-priming undertaken by the Brown government to ease the current recession, which has plunged the country into the heaviest levels of debt since World War II. The other is a defense review that has concluded that Britain must devote more resources to the war in Afghanistan.
 But many in Britain's defense establishment doubt that the Brown proposal for a one-vessel cutback will be either operationally practicable or a significant source of savings. Some experts said on Wednesday that cutting one vessel might save as little as $4 billion, perhaps less, and that is not counting the possible social costs of cutting the 5,000-member work force that would build the submarines at the Barrow-in-Furness yards in northern England, with the first submarine scheduled to enter service in 2024 and the fourth two years later.
 John Hutton, a senior Labour Party figure who quit as defense minister this summer, sounded his own note of caution, saying that the submarine deterrent worked like an insurance policy, and that previous reviews had shown that four submarines were the minimum needed to keep one permanently at sea. If cutting the force to three vessels meant that Britain would be protected ''for only three-quarters of the day,'' he said, it would be tantamount to having no deterrent at all.

HEADLINE: A Modified Bill Inches Regulatory Plan Ahead

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In a step toward overhauling the nation's financial regulation, a senior Democrat on Wednesday announced a plan that preserved the core of the White House's proposal for a new consumer financial protection agency, while jettisoning a smaller though symbolically significant provision that had posed political obstacles.
 The announcement by Representative Barney Frank, of Massachusetts, comes after weeks of consultations with other members of the fractious financial services committee that he heads. 
 By slightly modifying the administration's plan, Mr. Frank appears to have found a middle ground to support the creation of a robust new consumer financial protection agency over the vigorous objections of the banking industry. The agency's core mission would be to protect consumers from deceptive or abusive credit cards, mortgages and other loans.
 Mr. Frank also announced an ambitious schedule to complete the House's work on the legislation over the next two months. Recognizing that the revisions increased the odds of the bill's passage, the Obama administration quickly embraced the changes.
 ''Media reports that it is dead for the year are inaccurate,'' Mr. Frank said. ''This will be a very busy schedule.''
 Consumer groups offered a measured response to the changes, expressing some relief that a stand-alone consumer-protection agency had not been scrapped altogether. ''I don't think anything here is intended to weaken or eviscerate this in any way,'' said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director at the United States Public Interest Research Group. ''The agency will still have a primary role of protecting consumers, and it will still have authorities.''
 The legislation still faces major hurdles in Congress, where bankers hold considerable political sway. President Obama has asked lawmakers to approve a comprehensive bill this year, mindful that if the economy continues to mend, the political impetus could evaporate. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and head of the Senate banking committee, is soon expected to file his own version of a comprehensive bill. 
 That legislation is likely to include a measure introduced this week by Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, to impose tighter regulations on derivatives dealers. Mr. Reed's measure would require that credit-default swaps -- a form of insurance against bond defaults -- be traded through clearinghouses. Top officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have called for tougher regulation of the derivatives market than the White House has.
 An Obama proposal that Mr. Frank rejected would have required banks and other financial services companies to offer so-called plain vanilla products, like 30-year fixed mortgages and low-interest, low-fee credit cards. 
 That proposal set off criticism by Democrats and Republicans, some with close ties to the banking industry, that it was the first step toward having government bureaucrats approve and disapprove an array of products. 
 At a hearing on Wednesday before the financial services committee, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said: ''There has been a lot of concern that if you invest the government with the ability to decide what's appropriate here and there, that will lead to less competition and choice. The chairman's proposals, which I've had a chance to read quickly, provide a better balance of choice and protection.''
 Mr. Frank said his measure would exempt various businesses -- like merchants, retailers and providers of retirement plans -- from oversight by the consumer financial protection agency. 
 Both Mr. Frank and Mr. Geithner emphasized that the legislation would be intended to limit the ''too big to fail'' policy of bailing out the nation's largest institutions. That policy, which has provoked widespread voter anger, was central to the bailouts of Bear Stearns and the American International Group and led to big loans to the largest banks in the nation.
 ''We will be putting a package of legislation together that will substantially diminish that problem,'' Mr. Frank said. ''We will be providing for mechanisms for putting financial institutions out of their misery. There will be death panels enacted by this Congress, but they will be for large institutions that are seen as too big to die. We are talking here about dissolution, not resolution. We are talking about making it unpleasant for these institutions to die.''
 Mr. Geithner said those institutions whose problems could shake the financial system would face far greater regulatory scrutiny and higher capital standards. But under questioning from Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the committee, he refused to rule out the possibility of more bailouts of big companies.
 ''You can't have a system, how shall I say it, where you abolish the fire station, or lock the doors to the fire station,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''That's not a system that works.''

HEADLINE: Ford Unveils Small Car To Compete in India

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
Ford Motor executives introduced a new small car in India on Wednesday as the company increased its focus on the fast-growing car markets of the Asia-Pacific region.
 The new Figo, a four-door hatchback with expansive side windows and cat's-eye headlights, was designed with the help of Indian engineers and will be built in India. It will be sold in India and exported to nearby countries. Ford's top executives said the car was emblematic of Ford's new emphasis on the region. 
 ''Asia-Pacific is a really important market for us,'' Alan R. Mulally, chief executive of Ford, said. ''We will accelerate our presence'' in the region, Mr. Mulally said, and India will play a large part in that effort. 
 The Figo will be available in India in 2010. Ford did not provide any details on its likely price or fuel consumption. Nor did Ford say what other countries would be target markets for the model. 
 Unlike its big American peers, Ford Motor soldiered through the global recession without seeking bankruptcy protection or aid from the United States. But Ford suffered as car sales declined in North America and Europe, losing $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2009. 
 A focus on Asia would be a big strategic shift for Ford. In 2006, 87 percent of its net sales and revenue, about $127.7 billion, came from North America and Europe. Ford trails General Motors and Toyota in China and has a tiny presence in India. 
 The Figo represents the first product of Ford's $500 million investment to transform its manufacturing plant in Chennai, formerly Madras, in southeast India. Ford has doubled the Chennai plant's production capacity to 200,000 vehicles a year and will be able to make 250,000 diesel engines a year by 2010, executives said Wednesday. 
 India is ''going to be a key design and manufacturing hub'' for Ford, Mr. Mulally said.
 Car manufacturers are turning to India's engineering expertise and emphasis on value and fuel efficiency to design hyper-efficient cheap cars. ''Literally, India is designing the small car for the world,'' he said. 
 Late this week, he will go to China, where he is expected to announce a new production plant. Xinhua, China's state-run news agency, said the plant, with an annual capacity of 300,000 cars, would be in Chongqing, in southwestern China, and would produce expensive sedans and sport utility vehicles. 
 ''India and China are going to be the game-changers in the next decade, so it is natural for the major manufacturers to focus on them,'' said Neeraj Bandhu, director for India at CSM Worldwide, an automotive consulting business. 
 India and China will lead the world's car-buying recovery, CSM Worldwide predicts. Car sales in India will be 45 percent higher in 2011 than in 2007, CSM said, followed by 39 percent growth in China and 26 percent growth in Brazil. In contrast, car sales in North America and Europe will not have returned to their 2007 levels by 2011. 
 Like Renault-Nissan and Toyota, Ford is integrating its global operations and moving manufacturing and research to low-cost areas like India. CSM predicts that Ford's production in North America, its home market, will decline to 35 percent of global production by 2015 from 54 percent in 1997. 
 Last year, General Motors introduced a small car called the Spark in India, and it plans a mini-car this year, developed with local engineers. Volkswagen and Toyota plan to sell small cars in India. 
 Ford also faces formidable competitors among Indian carmakers. This year, Tata Motors began selling the Nano, promoted as the world's cheapest car, starting at about $2,200 including taxes and fees. 
 Ford's approach to the Indian market suggests that it is new here, analysts say. For example, Figo is Italian for ''cool'' but means nothing in Hindi, the most widely spoken language of India. 
 While developing the Figo, Ford created a fictitious target customer in India: Sandeep, a man in his mid-20s. While the name is a common first name in India, the concept created the impression that the Indian market was a mystery to Ford executives, the analysts said. 
 Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Tata Motors dominate the Indian market, and a version of Honda's Civic, called the City, sells well.
 Ford is the seventh-largest manufacturer here, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. American automakers have struggled in India because they came to the market with midsize cars, analysts said.
 Ford's new approach has won praise. In the past, ''they did not target the mass market, or refresh their product,'' Mr. Bandhu said. But, he said, ''there is a lot of interest'' in hatchbacks like the Figo.

HEADLINE: Senator Tries to Allay Fears on Health Overhaul

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senator Bill Nelson of Florida desperately wants to expand health insurance coverage because one in five Floridians is uninsured. As a former state insurance commissioner, he wants to crack down on insurers. And as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, he can shape legislation to achieve both goals.
 But Mr. Nelson, a Democrat, has a big problem. The bill taken up this week by the committee would cut Medicare payments to insurance companies that care for more than 10 million older Americans, including nearly one million in Florida. The program, known as Medicare Advantage, is popular because it offers extra benefits, including vision and dental care and even, in some cases, membership in health clubs or fitness centers.
 ''It would be intolerable to ask senior citizens to give up substantial health benefits they are enjoying under Medicare,'' said Mr. Nelson, who has been deluged with calls and complaints from constituents. ''I am offering an amendment to shield seniors from those benefit cuts.''
 Similar concerns exploded into public view on Wednesday as members of the Finance Committee slogged though a mammoth health care overhaul bill for a second day. 
 To help offset the cost of covering the uninsured, the Senate and House bills would squeeze roughly $400 billion to $500 billion out of the projected growth in Medicare over 10 years.
 Republicans on Wednesday accused Democrats of using Medicare as a piggy bank to pay for coverage of the uninsured. Democrats countered by saying they were eliminating overpayments to insurance companies and extending the life of the Medicare trust fund, which could run out of money in 2017.
 Senator Nelson said Republicans were waging a ''scare campaign,'' but he shares some of their concerns. His predicament highlights the political risks for Democrats eager to reassure older Americans who vote in large numbers.
 There are risks for President Obama as well. He cannot afford to lose Mr. Nelson's vote. White House officials have offered to work with him to address his concerns. Mr. Obama has said repeatedly that ''if you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep it.'' 
 The cost of Mr. Nelson's proposed fix -- to preserve benefits for many people enrolled in the private Medicare plans -- could total $40 billion over 10 years, and that could also be a problem for the White House. Mr. Obama has promised not to sign a health bill that increases the deficit, and so far Mr. Nelson has not said precisely how he would pay for his amendment. 
 Approval of the amendment could invite other Democrats to ask for similar deals that might make the bill more palatable to their constituents, but more costly as well.
 The legislation moving through Congress would make other huge changes in Medicare -- raising premiums for some higher-income beneficiaries, cutting payments to hospitals and nursing homes, and trimming payments for many ''overvalued services'' provided by doctors. The legislation includes provisions to measure the quality of care provided by doctors and hospitals and to reward those who cure patients or keep them healthy.
 ''It's disingenuous to say that Congress can cut this much spending from Medicare without having an adverse affect on seniors' access to health care,'' said Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate. ''Seniors should not foot the bill for the uninsured. Medicare should not be the piggy bank for new non-Medicare spending, a new entitlement.''
 But the committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said no money would actually be taken out of the Medicare trust fund.
 ''It's true that, under this legislation, there are savings in Medicare payments to providers,'' Mr. Baucus said. ''But the effect is to extend the life of the Medicare trust fund by four or five years. We are improving Medicare benefits, decreasing prescription drug costs for seniors and eliminating out-of-pocket costs for recommended preventive care.''
 Mr. Nelson said he had received 56,000 telephone calls, letters and e-mail messages on the legislation since June.
 Some of those callers have been mobilized by insurance companies.
 Humana, one of the nation's largest insurers, has urged subscribers to contact their members of Congress and register their opposition to the cuts. ''Millions of seniors and disabled individuals could lose many of the important benefits and services that make Medicare Advantage health plans so valuable,'' Humana said in a recent letter to beneficiaries. 
 On Monday, the Obama administration told Humana to ''end immediately all such mailings to beneficiaries.'' It said the materials were ''misleading and confusing.'' Insurers have contracts with Medicare, and under Medicare rules, many of their communications with beneficiaries need to be submitted to the government for review, administration officials said.
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said the administration was trying to ''squelch free speech'' by Humana, which is based in Louisville. But Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, said Humana had ''scared a lot of seniors unnecessarily.''
 The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent federal body, says payments to the private plans are, on average, 14 percent higher than what the government would spend for the same people in traditional Medicare.
 Mr. Baucus's bill would cut payments to Medicare Advantage plans by $123 billion over 10 years. Under a companion bill approved by three House committees, the cuts would total $156 billion. Mr. Obama proposed cuts totaling $175 billion. Insurers, he said, are getting ''unwarranted subsidies'' that ''pad their profits but don't improve the care of seniors.''
 Mr. Baucus and House Democrats would save nearly $200 billion over 10 years by permanently reducing annual inflation adjustments in Medicare payments to hospitals and other providers. They would also cut special Medicare payments to hospitals serving large numbers of low-income people, on the assumption that more patients will have insurance.
 Some of the Democrats' other proposals have drawn fire from groups that support the overall push for a health care overhaul.
 AARP, the lobby for older Americans, objects to the proposal that could increase premiums for some beneficiaries. In 2003, Congress stipulated that any Medicare beneficiaries with more than $80,000 of income would have to pay higher premiums. The income threshold rises with the Consumer Price Index.
 Senator Baucus has proposed freezing the current income threshold for 10 years. That would raise $23 billion, as more people would have to pay the higher premiums.
 David M. Certner, legislative counsel at AARP, said, ''It's unfair to single out seniors to pay more for their health benefits when other high-income people are not being asked to pay more.'' 
 Throughout it all, Mr. Nelson said he would remember advice he once received from Claude Pepper, a Florida congressman and champion for the elderly: ''Bill, I want you to look out for our seniors. Someone has to look out for them.''

HEADLINE: Panel's Battles on Health Highlight a Broader Split

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and JACKIE CALMES; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senate Democrats swatted down Republican attempts to make fundamental changes in their health care legislation on Wednesday as the Finance Committee voted on a wide range of amendments that highlighted the deep partisan divide over the bill.
 The committee rejected an amendment offered by Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, that would have deferred a final committee vote until the panel had actual legislative language and a complete cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. The vote was 13 to 10.
 Mr. Bunning's proposal would have required the text of the bill and the cost estimate to be posted on the Internet for 72 hours before the committee voted on whether to send the bill to the full Senate. 
 ''This bill will impact every American,'' Mr. Bunning said. ''It is too big and too important for us to rely on conceptual language and a preliminary estimate of cost.''
 Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, the one Republican who might eventually vote for the bill, supported Mr. Bunning's proposal. ''The American people are nervous about our attempt at health care reform and overhauling 17 percent of the economy,'' Ms. Snowe said. ''If it takes two more weeks, it takes two more weeks. What is the rush?'' 
 The committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, agreed that a detailed summary of the bill, in plain English, and a complete cost analysis would be publicly available before a final committee vote.
 Much of the debate Wednesday focused on the question of whether the bill would help or hurt older Americans in the Medicare program.
 Over Republican objections, the committee voted to keep a provision of the bill that would establish an independent federal commission to help rein in the growth of Medicare, the insurance program for 45 million people who are 65 and older or disabled. The commission's recommendations could take effect automatically unless Congress acted to achieve equivalent savings in other ways.
 Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, accused the Republicans of ''delay tactics.'' Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, said, ''There is a substantial slow-walk taking place in this committee.''
 Mr. Baucus said he hoped the committee would approve the bill this week, so it could be merged with a separate bill approved in July by the Senate health committee. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said the full Senate could start debate early next month. 
 The White House is pressing Congress to speed action so President Obama can sign a major health care bill this year.
 Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, tested the patience of Democrats by peppering the committee staff with questions about the bill.
 ''If this were some itty-bitty bill, I could back off very easily,'' Mr. Hatch said. ''But this is not some itty-bitty bill. It could wreck the country.''
 By contrast, Democrats described the bill as a long-overdue effort to guarantee Americans access to affordable health care.
 The committee has yet to wrestle with some of the biggest, most contentious issues: whether to create a government insurance plan to compete with private insurers; whether to impose a new tax on high-cost insurance policies; whether to require individuals to carry insurance and employers to help pay for it; whether to provide additional subsidies to low-income people to help them buy coverage.
 Senators have proposed amendments to address those issues and others, including abortion, illegal immigrants and medical malpractice.
 Three Republican senators -- John Ensign of Nevada, Jon Kyl of Arizona and John Cornyn of Texas -- proposed several amendments to limit awards in malpractice lawsuits. Mr. Baucus ruled them out of order, saying the issue was not in the committee's jurisdiction. His rulings were upheld on party-line votes.
 The Finance Committee is meeting in a large hall, but most of the space is taken up by Congressional staff members and journalists. Just four rows at the rear, about 90 seats, are reserved for an audience, and a number have been empty. 
 For major legislation that could affect every American, the audience in the hall and milling outside has been smaller than might have been expected.
 One reason is modern technology. Many lobbyists, journalists and others are watching the gavel-to-gavel proceedings on C-Span. And they can communicate with staff members and even senators by BlackBerry or other devices.
 Technology has ''taken the circus-like atmosphere away,'' said John Jonas, a lobbyist with the Patton Boggs firm, which counts a variety of health care provider groups among its clients. 
 As a former employee of a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Jonas contrasted the current scene with the crowds of lobbyists who filled that panel's oversize hearing room and spilled into the halls.
 Mr. Jonas said he continued to show up because the Finance Committee room was ''still a good place to catch key staff'' -- and he was fresh off a conversation with a committee lawyer. 
 But he added, ''A good lobbyist has done most of his work by now and doesn't have to be clinging to the pant legs or the skirts of whomever they want to get time with.''

HEADLINE: 4-Month Streak of Rising Home Sales Is Over

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Sales of previously owned homes fell unexpectedly last month, an industry group reported Thursday, showing that a budding recovery in the housing market remained weak.
 A four-month streak of improvements in sales of existing homes gave way to a seasonally adjusted 2.7 percent dip in August, according to the National Association of Realtors, as prospective buyers of condos and single-family homes pulled back in the Northeast, the South and the Midwest.
 Economists said it was too soon to say whether the drop represented a hiccup in the market or a sign of deeper problems for the housing market. Despite the monthly decline, sales in August were still 3.4 percent higher than a year earlier, when the collapse of the housing market was rapidly dragging down the economy. And they marked the second-highest sales figures of the year. 
 ''I'm not alarmed by the softening in sales,'' said Celia Chen, a housing economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''The trend is still very strongly up.''
 In Portland, Ore., a real estate agent, Melvin Broadous, said he was detecting signs of a thaw, especially at the low end of the market, where homes priced near $200,000 were drawing multiple bids and cash offers.
 ''The market is moving,'' he said. ''I liken it to putting popcorn in a microwave. You're hearing it pop a little more every week.''
 Home sales have been edging higher over the last few months as lower prices, affordable mortgage rates and a tax credit for first-time home buyers have drawn buyers back to open houses. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 5.04 percent last week, down from 6.09 percent a year ago, the mortgage underwriter Freddie Mac reported Thursday.
 Housing and real estate groups like the National Association of Realtors have called on Congress to extend or expand the tax credit for first-time buyers, saying that sales could slide back once it expires at the end of November. While the program has helped to drive sales higher this summer, some economists say its effects are waning because most interested buyers have already taken advantage of the $8,000 credit.
 The Realtors' group estimated that 30 to 40 percent of all buyers were first-time homeowners. In August, median home prices across the country fell by nearly $4,000, to $177,700, and were down 12.5 percent from a year earlier. Inventories of homes for sale fell to a supply that would take 8.5 months to burn through, the lowest levels all year.
 The drop in sales puzzled economists, in part because pending sales of homes had risen. Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors' group, attributed the slide in August to an especially strong performance a month earlier.
 ''Some of the giveback in closed sales appears to result from rising numbers of contracts entering the system, with some fallouts and a backlog contributing to a longer closing process, but the decline demonstrates we can't take a housing rebound for granted,'' Mr. Yun said in a statement. 
 Other economists said the fluctuations in home sales could reflect rising unemployment across the country. About 15 million people are now out of work and economists expect the unemployment rate to hit 9.8 percent when the government reports its monthly employment figures next week.
 ''The job market is the biggest thing that's going to keep sales down next year,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight. ''When people can't find a job, they don't move. They can't buy or sell a home.''
 On Thursday, the Labor Department offered a bit of good news about the job market, reporting that first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell by 21,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 530,000. States where jobless claims fell said there had been fewer layoffs in manufacturing, construction and service sector jobs.

HEADLINE: Tough on Crude Oil, Soft on Ducklings

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH cause-related marketing usually entails a company selecting a nonprofit in need of money and exposure, when it comes to Dawn dishwashing liquid, it was not the brand that chose the charity but the other way around.
 In 1978, Alice Berkner, founder of the International Bird Rescue Research Center, which helps birds harmed by oil spills, secured a small grant from Chevron to test all major dish soaps for cleaning birds.
 ''The one that worked better than anything else was Dawn,'' Jay Holcomb, executive director of the group, said in a telephone interview from California, where the center operates outside San Francisco and Los Angeles. ''It cut the oil faster than anything else.'' 
 The organization informed Dawn's parent company, Procter & Gamble, which initially ignored requests to donate cases of the product, then finally agreed to do so in 1988, according to Mr. Holcomb. (P.& G. said in a statement that because Dawn had made its debut only in 1973, ''In these early stages it was important for Dawn to solidify its fundamentals before pursuing opportunities the brand felt passionate about.'')
 In 1989, during the Exxon Valdez spill, volunteers used Dawn on crude-covered birds, and the brand figured prominently in media accounts of the disaster, as it has in animal-rescue coverage since. In recent years, Dawn also has donated as much as $100,000 annually.
 Now Dawn is championing animal-rescue efforts in a television spot -- by Kaplan Thaler Group, New York, part of the Publicis Groupe -- that shows a baby duck, penguin and seal being washed in sudsy tubs. There is no voiceover, just the song ''Wash Away'' by Joe Purdy, and text stating that Dawn helped save thousands of animals caught in oil spills. Lastly, it reveals that the company will donate $1 to wildlife groups each time a consumer buys a bottle of Dawn and visits a Web site.
 Dawn has highlighted wildlife in advertising campaigns intermittently since 2002 but never tried so actively to engage consumers. For Dawn to make a donation, consumers must go to dawnsaveswildlife.com -- which features the bird rescue group and another beneficiary, the Marine Mammal Center -- and enter a sequence of numbers printed on the back of bottles. So far, more than $89,000 has been raised. 
 A Facebook page, Everyday Wildlife Champions, features volunteering opportunities and has more than 14,000 fans. Dawn also chose a spokeswoman, the actress Minnie Driver, who has appeared -- with penguins -- on ''The View'' and the ''Today'' show. Dawn is the leading American dish soap brand, with 36 percent of the category, according to Information Resources, a market research firm whose data does not include Wal-Mart Stores. Revenue for dishwashing liquid in the 52 weeks that ended Sept. 6 totaled $623 million, a 5 percent increase over the previous year, owing perhaps to the recession driving more people to eat at home. 
 The contest between Dawn and Palmolive, the Colgate-Palmolive brand whose original formula ranks second, historically has been one of power versus mildness, with Palmolive saying how gentle it is on hands -- in the iconic 1970s television spots a manicurist, Madge, had clients soak their hands in it -- and Dawn asserting that it powers through grease. Both brands secondarily claim to beat their rival at its own game, with Palmolive promoting its efficacy and Dawn its mildness.
 For Dawn, sullied birds help with that secondary claim.
 ''Some of our competitors have owned mildness, but Dawn has proved also to be gentle on hands, and this commercial demonstrates that in a different way,'' said Susan Baba, a P.& G. spokeswoman. ''This is really a great way of highlighting our messaging of being tough on grease but gentle on hands.''
 Linda Kaplan Thaler, chief executive of Kaplan Thaler Group, said the Web site and Facebook group were inspired not by an advertising campaign but by a political one. 
 ''Instead of a getting a few people to contribute a lot of money, the Obama campaign got a lot of people to give a little, and kept telling them they were stewards for their country,'' she said. ''People don't want to be lectured to; they want to really participate.''
 Not all participation in the Dawn campaign has been positive, however: several comments on Facebook -- and on YouTube, where the commercial is posted -- have noted that Procter & Gamble conducts tests on animals.
 ''Go ahead and support animal testing!'' wrote Janina Miranda Laffitte on Facebook. ''Dawn donates $1.00 yes but they test their products on many animals to this day!''
 Kathy Guillermo, vice president for laboratory investigations at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said, ''The bottom line is that Procter & Gamble is really good in some ways and bad in others.'' 
 The company severed ties with an animal testing laboratory after a PETA investigation revealed that dogs had been mistreated, and it says that it has invested more than $250 million developing alternative testing methods, but it has not declared it will cease animal testing. (Among the top 25 dish soaps, only Seventh Generation and Method do not test on animals, according to a ''cruelty-free company'' compilation on PETA's Web site.)
 Asked if Dawn itself is tested on animals, Ms. Baba of P.& G. responded in an e-mail message, ''We do not test finished products, which includes Dawn, on animals,'' adding that ''at some time over the 30-year history of Dawn, an ingredient may have been tested on an animal because the law required it or there was no alternative test at that time.''
 Ms. Guillermo of PETA said of the current Dawn campaign: ''Anything a company does to help animals we applaud even if we have issues with their policies in their entirety. It sounds like they may have figured out the marketing advantage of helping -- but in any case they're helping.''

HEADLINE: House Votes to Block Increase In Medicare Part B Premiums

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Millions of Medicare patients would not face increases in their monthly premiums next year under a bill passed by the House on Thursday. 
 The House voted 406 to 18 to eliminate all premium increases for people who use Medicare Part B, which pays for doctor visits. The bill now goes to the Senate. 
 Lawmakers said older Americans should not have to pay higher Medicare Part B premiums because they were not expected to get a cost of living increase from Social Security. Most people have their Medicare premiums deducted from their Social Security payments.
 About three-fourths of the 42 million Medicare recipients are already exempt from Part B premium increases whenever there is no increase in Social Security payments, a decision that is based on the inflation rate. Still, without Congressional action, several million others who are older or disabled would face monthly premium increases of $8 to $23. The standard monthly premium is $96.40 this year.
 Most of the 11 million or so patients who are not exempt from premium increases are low-income people who also qualify for Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for the poor. Medicaid pays their Medicare premiums, meaning states would bear some of the costs.
 The bill would not affect scheduled increases in premiums for the Medicare prescription drug program, known as Part D. Average monthly premiums for the drug program will increase slightly, to $30 in 2010 from $28 this year.

PERSON: Milton Meltzer 

HEADLINE: Milton Meltzer, Prolific Author, Dies at 94

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Milton Meltzer, a historian and prolific author of nonfiction books for young people who helped start a movement away from the arid textbook style of the past, died Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 94.
 The cause was esophageal cancer, his daughter Jane Assimacopoulos said.
 ''Meltzer was one of the first in a new wave of nonfiction writers who brought lively and passionate writing, grounded in original source material, to middle-grade students and young adults, without talking down to them,'' Lisa Von Drasek, the children's librarian at the Bank Street College of Education in New York and an expert in the field, said in an interview on Wednesday. 
 ''In the old days, it was those dry volumes with their buckram covers, crowded gray type and no reproductions that kids had to use for school assignments,'' Ms. Drasek added.
 In 2001, Mr. Meltzer, who wrote nearly 100 books for children, received the American Library Association's Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal for his contribution to children's literature. Five of his works were National Book Award finalists.
 Mr. Meltzer was a self-trained historian. The fact that he never graduated from college (he quit school during the Depression to help support his family) proved no barrier to his vast and varied writing. In fact, it was an impetus. Much of his work is infused with a call for social justice. 
 In vivid, concise prose, Mr. Meltzer wrote about slavery, witch hunts, the immigrant experience, the Depression, the Holocaust, the civil rights era and the labor movement, among many other subjects. 
 In 1968, when he published ''Bread and Roses: The Struggle of American Labor, 1865-1915,'' (Knopf), The New York Times's labor reporter at the time, A. H. Raskin, wrote in a review, ''Mr. Meltzer's pages, prickly with eyewitness accounts of unionism's birth pains in the sweatshops, the factories, the railroads and the mines, are a goad to revitalized activity in defense of industrial democracy and higher economic standards for those who remain on the outskirts of American affluence.''
 Mr. Meltzer also wrote about piracy, ancient Egypt, the Seminole War, the Mexican-American War, the cotton gin, how the railroad changed the world and the impact of horses on history. In ''The Amazing Potato'' (HarperCollins, 1992), he chronicled its influence through the centuries. 
 Mr. Meltzer also wrote biographies of, among others, Ferdinand Magellan, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Frederick Douglass, Theodore Roosevelt, Edgar Allan Poe, Mark Twain, Henry David Thoreau, Carl Sandburg, John Steinbeck, Albert Einstein and Betty Friedan.
 In books like ''In Their Own Words: A History of the American Negro'' and ''The Jewish Americans: A History in Their Own Words'' (Crowell, 1965 and 1982), Mr. Meltzer gave his young readers insight into the role of ordinary people in the making of history. 
 Born in Worcester, Mass., on May 8, 1915, Mr. Meltzer was one of three sons of Benjamin and Mary Meltzer. His parents, immigrants from Austria-Hungary, were semiliterate. His mother was a seamstress and his father washed windows.
 Milton was the only son who finished high school. He went to Columbia University in 1932, paying his way by working in the dining hall and selling shoes in a store. But he dropped out after his father died of cancer. He then went to work as a writer for the Work Projects Administration, which provided jobs for millions of people during the Depression.
 Mr. Meltzer married Hildy Balinky in 1941; she died last year. Besides his daughter Jane, he is survived by another daughter, Amy Meltzer; his brother Marshall; and two grandsons. 
 After serving in the Army in World War II, Mr. Meltzer was hired as a writer by CBS. Later, he worked as a public relations executive for a pharmaceutical company. 
 ''At age 38 or 39 I began getting that midlife crisis feeling,'' he told The New York Times in 2000. ''I figured I was halfway through my life and what did I have to show for it?'' 
 Growing up ''on the wrong side of the tracks'' during the Depression, he said, made him aware of social injustice. A book about blacks in America was a worthwhile project and could attract readers, he decided, especially if it was full of photos. While traveling the country for the drug company, he did research at historical societies, local archives and museums and collected nearly 1,000 illustrations. 
 Mr. Meltzer felt he needed a black co-author; an acquaintance put him in touch with the renowned Harlem Renaissance writer Langston Hughes. Together they wrote ''A Pictorial History of the Negro in America'' (Crown, 1956). It was one of just a handful of Mr. Meltzer's books not specifically for children. Updated six times, it remained in print into the 1990s. 
 ''You may ask, what is the relevance of all this history to the young?'' Mr. Meltzer wrote of his body of work in a 1969 article for the Wilson Library Bulletin, a trade magazine for librarians. 
 ''Ours is not a past of sweetness and light, no matter what the textbook tells us,'' he continued. ''Textbooks avoid conflicts and the disorders that have taken place in our past. No wonder they bore students.''

HEADLINE: Moscow Team Thrived Under Nets' Prospective Owner

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ and ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Moscow's CSKA basketball club was nearly bankrupt when a young banker and metals magnate named Mikhail D. Prokhorov came to the rescue. After a decade of Prokhorov's financial tutelage, the club has become one of the best in Europe, winning the European championships twice while reaching the final four in each of the last seven seasons. 
 Now Prokhorov is hoping to use his rubles to bail out another struggling basketball team, this time in New Jersey. 
 Prokhorov agreed to a $200 million deal this week that would give him ownership of the Nets. He also signed on to underwrite almost half of the team's proposed $800 million arena in Brooklyn, making him the first person from overseas to acquire such a deep stake in a major American sports team. 
 For Prokhorov, the deal continues his rebound from an incident in 2007, when he was detained on suspicion of providing prostitutes to wealthy guests at a party in Courchevel in the French Alps. He was not charged, but analysts of the Russian oligarchy say the Kremlin used the arrest as a pretext to compel Prokhorov to sell his stake in Norilsk Nickel, the largest nickel company in the world. 
 That sale, in April 2008, came just before the financial crisis struck the Russian stock market, pummeling Prokhorov's oligarch brethren while leaving him with billions in cash. He is now considered to be Russia's richest man, and appears to be largely back in favor. 
 ''He's worked very hard to get back in with the government,'' said Rob Edwards, a mining analyst at Renaissance Capital, an investment company partly owned by Prokhorov. The Courchevel arrest, Edwards said, ''was pretty embarrassing for him.'' 
 ''He's desperate to be taken seriously again,'' Edwards added.
 As with other Russian oligarchs who have become involved with foreign sports teams, Prokhorov's Nets deal could raise his international profile, which would be an intriguing development for a man known for being cautious among foreigners. The son of Moscow academics, Prokhorov, 44, parlayed a privileged education in the Soviet system into a job at a private bank after the collapse of the Communism, making him a millionaire in his 20s.
 But his true riches came during the privatization of government property that followed in the contentious loans-for-shares auctions of 1995. As with all the Russian oligarchs, remaining on positive terms with the Kremlin has been key to his survival and success in the years that followed.
 He has done this in part through his patronage of Russian athletics, a high priority for Vladimir V. Putin, a black belt in judo, who has acted as athlete-in-chief throughout his decade in power. 
 Prokhorov is president of the Russian Biathlon Union, financing the popular winter sport that combines skiing and sharp shooting. He also sponsors amateur athletics. He is fit enough to do back flips on a jet ski, a video of which he recently posted on his blog. And basketball clearly is a passion. 
 As for an indication of what Prokhorov could mean for the Nets, fans need look no further than CSKA. Founded as the basketball team of the Soviet Red Army's powerful athletic franchise, it was on the verge of collapse before Prokhorov's Norilsk Nickel purchased the club in 1997. 
 ''CSKA was, as we say, a club of heroes who played without pay,'' said Zurab Chitaya, a basketball reporter for the Russian newspaper, Sport Express. ''The club was dependent on holdovers from the Soviet era.'' 
 Flush with Prokhorov's cash, the team went on a shopping spree, purchasing the best players and coaches available from Europe and the United States. Last year's team had only 6 Russian players out of a total of 14, prompting criticism that Prokhorov was neglecting to invest in Russia's athletic future by developing native talent. Still, the result has been a team that has been nearly unbeatable in Russia, and hugely successful in Europe. The club won the Euroleague championships in 2006 and 2008, and came in second in 2009. 
 ''The CSKA of the last seven years is a completely different club, a super club,'' Chitaya said. 
 Prokhorov lost control of CSKA when he relinquished his stake in Norilsk Nickel. But his deal to purchase the Nets is a chance to expand on his Moscow successes while planting a Russian flag in the birthplace of basketball. 
 ''In a statement accompanying the Nets deal, Prokhorov spoke of how important it was to him that the deal ''give new impulse to the development of Russian basketball.''
 Basketball watchers in Russia said that Prokhorov's words injected some optimism into a sport that is still eclipsed in Russia by soccer and hockey and remains underfunded. But many here are skeptical that the Nets deal will do anything more than increase Prokhorov's wealth. 
 ''Of course we want to believe that Russian basketball will soon get up from its knees,'' said Lev Savari, the basketball editor for the online sports site Championat.ru. ''But for this we need to change a lot, and believing that the acquisition of an N.B.A. club would instantly create improvements would be naive.'' 
 The purchase has already angered some in Russia, who say Prokhorov's cash would be better invested at home. In fact, the women's CSKA team recently announced that it could soon face bankruptcy. 
 The newspaper Novye Izvestia wrote on Thursday, ''Apparently, saving CSKA is not as charitable a project as building a stadium in Brooklyn.''

HEADLINE: Fed Reducing 2 Programs For Emergency Lending

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve said on Thursday that it was further scaling back two emergency lending programs as the economy improved.
 The Fed will reduce the amount of money available to banks in short-term loans under a program called the Term Auction Facility. 
 For 84-day loans, the Fed will provide a total of $50 billion in loans in October, and $25 billion each in November and December. For 28-day loans, the Fed will continue to make $75 billion available monthly through January.
 The Fed also is cutting back on a program in which investment firms can temporarily swap risky securities for Treasury securities.
 The Fed said $50 billion worth of Treasury securities would be made available for October, down from the current $75 billion. Operations in November and December will be trimmed to $25 billion each.
 The actions respond to ''continued improvements in financial market conditions,'' the Fed said in a statement. The Fed announced earlier steps in late June to pare down the two programs.
 With the economy moving from recession into recovery, the Fed is pulling back on some of the extraordinary support it has provided to banks and other companies to cope with the worst financial crisis since the 1930s.
 The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and his colleagues decided on Wednesday to slow the pace of a $1.45 trillion program intended to force down mortgage rates and shore up the housing market. And in August, the Fed signaled that it would wind down a $300 billion government debt-buying program aimed at lowering rates on all kinds of consumer debt.
 The Fed's support has caused its balance sheet to jump to just over $2 trillion, more than double the level before the crisis struck.
 Weaning companies and the economy off the support will be a high-wire act for the central bank. Fed policy makers need to leave the special programs intact long enough to support the recovery -- but not so long as to fuel inflation later.

HEADLINE: Don't Reward Wall Street

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''City Jobless Rate Climbs to 10.3%'' (front page, Sept. 18): 
 After the federal government spent billions of dollars to bail out Wall Street, it is especially galling to hear that the same people who participated in the reckless scramble for profits are now receiving government subsidies in the form of a special grant to change careers.
 People who worked on Wall Street in speculative investment firms do not deserve to receive special funds any more than the rest of us who are struggling through this economy. Since most had received compensation that far surpasses other fields, they should have saved their money.
 Many of us have struggled for years to establish our own careers in the lower half of New York's hourglass economy, without special subsidies. Poor New Yorkers are forced to cope with the recession by going to food pantries, attending night school and going into debt. Let the affluent do the same.

HEADLINE: In Need of Cash, Arizona Puts Offices on Sale

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
Here in one of the most embattled real estate markets in the country, 1700 West Washington Street stands out, even beyond its nearly $40 million price tag. 
 It has 205,901 square feet, terrazzo floors, a big chunk of chrysocolla displayed in the lobby and a long-term tenant who wants to stay put for 20 years -- leasing the building back from a buyer for more than its assessed value. Bonus feature: There is a nifty gun locker for any potential buyer or their guests who arrive packing heat.
 The office building houses most of the State of Arizona's government and was recently put on the market to help this broke state close its budget deficit. 
 It is looking like a pretty good deal, if the state can prove it is credit worthy.
 ''People are calling from all over the country,'' said Alan Ecker, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Administration, who estimates that his office has taken 60 calls of inquiry since Gov. Jan Brewer approved the sale on Sept. 3 as part of a still-unresolved budget plan. ''The balls are rolling.'' 
 Selling a building that the owner wishes to continue to occupy -- known as a sale and lease-back -- is an oft-used strategy for businesses looking to shore up cash flow, but it is less common for governments to do so. But these are uncommon times for states gasping under piles of Medicaid bills, unemployment claims and pension payouts, and fewer tax dollars rolling in. 
 ''Everything is on the table for a lot of states right now,'' said Robb Willis, a lobbyist for H&W Development, a developer in Mableton, Ga., that is considering buying the executive office building here. ''Arizona just seems to be a hotbed right now.'' 
 If the people of the proudly independent state of Arizona would be the least bit despondent to have the owners of their state buildings hail from the Peach State, that may just be the cost of doing business right now.
 To help close a $3.2 billion revenue shortfall, lawmakers allowed the sale and lease-back of the executive office tower, the buildings that house offices for both chambers of the State Legislature, as well as 10 prison complexes, a state mental hospital and other buildings. (For now, the historic Capitol, with its grand dome and aging interior, is not for sale, though state officials continue to ponder the possibility.)
 All told, the assets are valued at $735 million. They are expected to cost the state $1.5 billion in lease-back fees over the next two decades, after which ownership of the buildings would revert to the state. It is sort of like renting to own new furniture. Except the state already owns the furniture. 
 For a state looking to preserve its credit rating and in need of a quick infusion of cash, and for an investor looking for a modest but easy return on an investment -- better than treasuries, say, but not as exciting as equities -- it could be a convenient marriage. 
 ''There are a lot of empty buildings around these days,'' said Lee Hunter, a principal of H&W, the Georgia firm. ''So a fully leased building in this environment is attractive, and it is going to be extremely competitive.''
 The centerpiece of the sale plan is the executive office tower, which holds the executive functions of government as well as the secretary of state, the state treasurer and the state mine inspector, and is valued at $39,511,240.
 State lawmakers have cut their way through the rest of the budget, which remains unsolved months after the fiscal year ended because of an impasse over a sales tax increase sought by the governor but disliked by her fellow Republicans, who are a majority in the Legislature. Yet more cash is still desperately needed to get through this year and next. So prisons, historical societies, a visitor's center at a revered state park and the Legislature building all must go.
 Democratic lawmakers have little fondness for any of it.
 ''It's a bad loan that makes no fiscal sense for the state,'' said Kyrsten Sinema, the ranking Democrat on the State House Appropriations Committee. ''We have to start paying interest in the very next fiscal year, when we'll still be stuck in a massive deficit. So it's definitely a penny-wise, pound-foolish plan.''
 As real estate goes, the property surrounding the executive office tower is not quite as exciting as the visitor's center attached to Kartchner Caverns, the state's famous limestone caves at the base of the Whetstone Mountains near Tucson, which is also on the market. But a buyer of the building would get a display box of the state's minerals, including the big chunk of chrysocolla, and that might beat an extra half-bath.

HEADLINE: Siemens Fills Need for High-Speed Trains in Russia

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Russia 

 BODY:
In the last years of the cold war, the ultrasecret research institute that had designed the Soviet Union's nuclear submarines received an unusual request: could it build a high-speed train? 
 The Soviet Union, despite its dependence on railroads, had fallen far behind Japan and Western Europe on high-speed transport. That the order came to the Rubin design bureau suggests that Moscow viewed catching up as a matter of national security.
The result of the little-known program was a slate-gray, round-nosed locomotive called the Sokol, Russian for falcon, that petered out soon after the Soviet Union did. The prototype achieved a top speed of only 143 miles an hour -- hardly breaking a sweat by high-speed standards. 
 But the fall of the Falcon created an opening for Siemens.
 This December, high-speed trains designed by the German conglomerate and adapted for Russian winters will ply the rails between St. Petersburg and Moscow. But Siemens hopes their final destination will be the last laggard of the high-speed age: the United States. 
 For years, businesspeople and politicians have dreamed about America entering the high-speed era, but Amtrak has been plagued by budget and service problems and the closest Americans have come to high speed is the Acela, which rarely runs at what Europeans call high speed.
 Now Siemens and its competitors are hoping all that has changed. The economic stimulus passed by Congress in April includes a five-year, $13 billion high-speed rail program. Siemens is one of four makers of high-speed trains, none of them based in the United States, that hopes to take advantage of it. 
 Siemens executives said the tilt toward political acceptance of high-speed rail in the United States presented a remarkable business opportunity -- assuming the systems get built. 
 The United States ''is a developing country in terms of rail,'' Ansgar Brockmeyer, head of public transit business for Siemens, said in an interview aboard the Russian test train, as wooden country homes and birch forests flickered by outside the window. ''We are seeing it as a huge opportunity.''
 To position itself to compete in the United States, Siemens has placed employees from its high-speed train division at its Sacramento factory, which produces city trams.
 Siemens's new train -- the Sapsan, Russian for peregrine falcon -- is a candidate for the high-speed link planned between San Francisco and Los Angeles that may open in 2020. Alstom, the maker of the French TGV trains, and Bombardier are also contenders. Japanese bullet train designs by Hitachi, which are lighter but less secure in a low-speed crash, the only type of collisions survivable, are another option.
 The technological breakthrough of the Sapsan is that the train has no locomotive. Instead, electric motors are attached to wheels all along the train cars, as on some subway trains. (Passengers sit in the first car too.) Its top operating speed is 217 miles an hour, though in tests this model has reached 255 miles an hour, or about half the cruising speed of some jet airplanes.
 In Russia, it took a decade of on-again, off-again talks before Siemens signed a deal with the state railways in 2006 amid a general thaw in relations between Germany and Russia.
 Here as elsewhere, high-speed trains will compete with airlines. The 401-mile trip from downtown Moscow to downtown St. Petersburg will be 3 hours and 45 minutes. The average flying travel time is five hours, including the trips to and from the airport, check-in and security clearance. 
 The four-times-a-day service will trim 45 minutes from the fastest train service now. To achieve this, the Russian state railway spent $485 million upgrading the track and $926 million for eight Sapsan trains and a 30-year service agreement, at today's exchange rates. 
 In other countries, high-speed trains have roundly beaten planes on price, overall travel time and convenience at ranges up to 600 miles between major cities. After high-speed trains between Paris and Lyons became well established, for example, commercial flights all but disappeared. And in the first year of operation, a Madrid-to-Barcelona high-speed link cut the air travel market about 50 percent. 
 In the United States -- where the Department of Transportation has identified 11 high-speed corridors, including Los Angeles to San Francisco -- high-speed rail would also compete with intercity car travel. 
 In Russia, it has a more peculiar competitor. With its vast distances and dismal roads, Russia has a long tradition of train travel, but Russians prefer to travel on overnight sleeper trains. (The highway between St. Petersburg and Moscow is at places a potholed, two-lane track.) Tea cups rattle on their saucers in the coal-heated compartments and beds are made with fresh linen. 
 The German trains, in contrast, are sleek strings of self-propelled, aluminum-skinned cars. But they will travel far below their 217 m.p.h. operating speed. 
 Pulling out of the St. Petersburg station on the test run, the Russian conductor kept the Sapsan throttled back at a modest 90 miles an hour as it rattled over older track in the city, making the typical clickety-clack noise of a train. High-speed rails are welded together and silent. It was like driving a new Porsche over a rutted road. 
 Out on refurbished track, the train accelerated to 150 miles an hour, the threshold until additional track improvements are made. As yet, not all the ties are as rigid as they should be, and the overhead electrical wires wobble as the train speeds by underneath. Sometimes electricity arcs in fire bolts. 
 Still, Russia has arrived in the high-speed club that includes Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Spain, Taiwan, Korea and China, which joined in 2007. 
 On the test run, over a stretch of the St. Petersburg-Moscow track, a birch forest blurred outside the window as the train revved. In one village, an old woman in a kerchief stopped in her tracks and pointed in surprise as the silver, rocket-shaped train sailed past at 150 miles an hour.

HEADLINE: Investors Are Skittish Over Slowing Home Sales

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The housing market, a source of so many of the country's economic problems, caused more headaches for Wall Street on Thursday.
 Stocks fell after a real estate group reported that sales of existing homes dropped 2.7 percent in August. The figures disappointed economists and investors, who had been expecting a fifth consecutive month of gains. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average declined 41.11 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 9,707.44. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 10.09 points, or 1 percent, to 1,050.78, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 23.81 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,107.61. 
 The selling ran through many sectors of the market. Big banks and regional lenders that offer mortgages and construction loans were down. Shares of major home builders like Lennar and D. R. Horton sank, as did big industrial companies like Caterpillar and manufacturers that make the materials used to build homes and offices. 
 And energy companies like Chevron and Marathon Oil fell as the price of crude oil slid $3.08, to $65.89 a barrel, the lowest in more than a month. Oil prices have swung between $65 and $70 a barrel for much of the summer as traders have tried to determine whether a strong rebound will spur demand for oil, or whether a faltering one will keep consumption low.
 For many investors, the dip in sales of existing homes reflected broader worries about how the economy would perform as a panoply of support programs from the government slowly wind down. They worry that consumers and markets have become so dependent on public lifelines that the process of withdrawing them could be painful, at least in the short term.
 A tax credit of up to $8,000 for first-time buyers has driven home sales higher this summer, and some investors and real estate groups are worried that home sales will pull back once the credit expires at the end of November. 
 On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said it would gradually slow down a $1.45 trillion program to buy mortgage-backed securities, which was aimed at keeping interest rates low, stretching it out through the end of March. 
 The Fed said on Wednesday that inflation remained a remote concern, making safer investments like Treasuries more attractive to investors worried about swings in the economy or in the stock market. 
 In a sign of robust demand, prices of Treasury securities rose. The benchmark 10-year note was up 10/32, to 102 1/32, and the yield fell to 3.38 percent, from 3.42 percent late Wednesday, as investors considered the prospect of a slow recovery in the housing market. 
 ''Auctions all week went very well,'' said James Combias, head of United States government bond trading at Mizuho Securities. ''There's been a lot of buying of Treasuries. It will dry up. The question is when.''
 Following are the results of Thursday's auction of seven-year notes:

 Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.comart. 
 Museums
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: PATRICIA CRONIN: 'HARRIET HOSMER, LOST AND FOUND,' through Jan. 24. The contemporary New York artist Patricia Cronin channels the life and art of the 19th-century American sculptor Harriet Hosmer (1830-1908) in a show of watercolor depictions of Hosmer's works, both those that survived and those no longer traceable. Ms. Cronin has also published the watercolors -- including her ghost images of missing works -- in a scholarly book that stands as a Hosmer catalogue raisonne. The result is a complex package: a total work of art that is a historical document of the careers of two artists and a homage by one woman to another. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20090924 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'REFLECTIONS ON THE ELECTRIC MIRROR: NEW FEMINIST VIDEO,' through Jan. 10. Q: What is feminist video? A: A good way to reduce overcrowding in museums. Unless, that is, you are referring to this entertaining exhibition of recent videos by nine artists featuring the creators themselves as performers. Works by Klara Liden, Kate Gilmore, Cathy Begien and the team of Harry Dodge and Stanya Kahn are variously funny, dark and poetic. Starring in antique-looking, silent-movie-style commercials, Shannon Plumb is a wonderfully agile physical comedian. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20090924
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'KANDINSKY, ' through Jan. 13. The Guggenheim is not exactly thinking outside the spiral with this sleek retrospective, but then the pioneering abstractionist Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944) is more than just its foundational artist. He is the angel in the architecture. His swirling, unanchored abstractions are implicit in Frank Lloyd Wright's great circling rotunda, and now they fill it, bottom to top -- a sensational sight that is as much Kandinsky-Wright reunion as retrospective. One of the fullest, clearest views of Kandinsky's achievement in decades, it certainly unmoors the conventional wisdom of precipitous decline after 1921, if not 1914. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)20090924
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20090924
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'VERMEER'S MASTERPIECE ''THE MILKMAID,'' ' through Nov. 29. This small contextual show surrounds ''The Milkmaid'' (1657-58) with all five of the Met's Vermeers and a smattering of domestic scenes by other 17th-century masters, among them Pieter de Hooch, Gabriel Metsu and Nicolaes Maes. The 18-inch-high ''Milkmaid'' is one of Vermeer's strangest and best works. In this arresting treatment of a prosaic subject -- a young woman laboring in the kitchen -- Vermeer forsakes his well-known optical sensations for earthier pleasures. And in unprecedented fashion, he endows this domestic worker with traits typically reserved for higher-class women: virtue, diligence and a rich interior life. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090924
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'CINNABAR: THE CHINESE ART OF CARVED LACQUER,' through Feb. 21. The exhibition's approximately 50 carved lacquer dishes, platters, boxes, vases and other domestic objects -- including a spectacular folding screen -- are as engrossing for their formal beauty as for their amazing craftsmanship. The pigment cinnabar gives them a rich, dark red color, and intricate patterns, ornamental animals and pastoral vignettes carved and incised into their lustrous surfaces make every object a pleasure to behold. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090924
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROXY PAINE ON THE ROOF: MAELSTROM, through Nov. 29. An awesome spectacle awaits visitors to the museum's roof garden: a gnarly thicket of trees and branches extending from one end of the open-air deck to the other. It looks as if a tornado had ripped through Central Park and deposited its gleanings here -- except that it is all made of shiny metal pipe, as if all that wood had been transformed by someone with a stainless-steel Midas touch. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090924
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'RON ARAD: NO DISCIPLINE,' through Oct. 19. The first large American survey of this Israeli-born, London-based designer proves some of the virtues but many of the vices of its subtitle. Rambunctious, installed to poor advantage and ultimately inconclusive, it demonstrates with only mediocre results Mr. Arad's ambition to extend the design discipline into architecture and sculpture. There are too many toys for rich people here, along with evidence that when Mr. Arad sticks closest to functional design, he also comes closest to art. You have to set limits to transcend them. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090924
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMPASS IN HAND: SELECTIONS FROM THE JUDITH ROTHSCHILD FOUNDATION CONTEMPORARY DRAWINGS COLLECTION,' through Jan. 4. The Modern's largest gift of drawings -- a windfall of 2,500 works by 650 artists -- started out as a kind of stunt and matured without becoming a triumph. Initially a yearlong shopping binge in pursuit of a ''cross section'' of drawing at a certain moment, it also tried to fill decades-old gaps in the Modern's drawing collection, often with works by familiar names. These dominate the sampling of the gift: a lackluster exhibition of 354 works by 177 artists that emphasizes the Modern's ambivalence about moving beyond the Minimalism/Post-Minimalist canon, and its tendency to pick big or hot names over truly great drawings. The bottom line? Connoisseurship matters. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090924
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WHAT WAS GOOD DESIGN? MOMA'S MESSAGE, 1944-1956,' through Nov. 30. With 102 objects and excellent labels, the Modern explores its role as arbiter of postwar American design, when, channeling the Bauhaus, it deemed good, affordable design a human right. Its campaign included exhibitions titled ''What Is Good Design?,'' design competitions and use of the MoMA seal of approval by selected department stores. Signature items like the Eames storage unit and the Chemex coffee maker mingle with surprises like a back-to-basics chair of string and wood by, of all people, Alexey Brodovitch, Harper's Bazaar's influential art director. The prevailing sense of beauty, restraint and economy is an implicit rebuke to today's inane material excesses. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090924
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MONET'S WATER LILIES,' through April 12. Devotees of late Monet can rejoice. The Museum of Modern Art has hung its three ''Water Lilies'' together for the first time since 2001, along with a relatively recent acquisition and two guests. That's six waterlily paintings, all completed in the last dozen years before the artist's death in 1926. In addition, these canvases are isolated from the onward march of Modernism according to MoMA, and their separateness emphasizes their meditative, immersive quality. But it also confirms their radical achievement. While bringing Monet's Impressionism to a grand conclusion, they also open the path to Abstract Expressionism. It can still stop you in your tracks. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090924
 NEUE GALERIE: 'FOCUS: OSKAR KOKOSCHKA, WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through Oct. 5. More a taste whetter than a substantial introduction, this exhibition presents six of the Expressionist portraits that made Kokoschka's reputation in the pre-World War I era and about 40 works on paper. The early paintings of eminent Viennese citizens still pack a considerable psychological punch. The gaunt, hollow-eyed ''Martha Hirsch (Dreaming Woman)'' projects an eerie, erotic charm, while her male counterparts resemble zombies and mad professors. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)20090924
 NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'DOROTHY IANNONE: LIONESS,' through Oct. 18. High priestess, matriarch, sex goddess: the self-taught American artist Dorothy Iannone has been called all these things and more. Now, at 75, Ms. Iannone is having her first solo show at an American museum. It includes just a smattering of early work: four paintings, one sculpture, an artist's book and a series of wooden cutouts. It is complemented, however, by an exhibition at the Anton Kern Gallery in Chelsea that spans the 1960s to the present. Both shows deliver an invigorating shock to an art world lulled, as of late, by the tasteful, conservative and blue-chip. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090924
 NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'INTERSECTIONS INTERSECTED: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF DAVID GOLDBLATT,' through Oct. 11. Celebrated internationally for his socially engaged photography, Mr. Goldblatt has been producing deceptively understated photographs in South Africa since the early '60s. His landscapes, urban scenes and portraits do not show the kinds of horrific images you might expect of witness-bearing photography in the land of apartheid and its violent aftermath, but their reticence speaks volumes. The 114 subtly elegant pictures in this slow-burning show cast a spell of love and mourning. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090924
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'NOGUCHI REINSTALLED,' through Oct. 24, 2010. In anticipation of the museum's 25th anniversary in 2010, this show presents about 200 of Isamu Noguchi's works from the 1920s to the 1980s. They include sculptures in stone, wood, metal and clay; maquettes and models for parks and playgrounds; and props for Martha Graham dance productions. Though unfailingly suave, Noguchi's polished abstraction no longer has the urgency it once had, but the museum as a whole is a wonderful time capsule, and the sculpture garden he designed is utterly blissful. Noguchi Museum, 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Johnson)20090924
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through spring 2010. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20090924
 STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: HURVIN ANDERSON: 'PETER'S SERIES, 2007-2009,' through Oct. 25. These deft, photo-based oil paintings focus on an attic barbershop in London that caters to Caribbean immigrants like the artist's father. Seen from an unchanging perspective, this unassuming setting is subjected, from painting to painting, to a formal process of subtraction and addition. Isolated walls approach abstraction or sometimes resemble abstract paintings. Then furniture, mirrors and clients are reintroduced. The thinly painted images suggest a fragile, transient realm -- an immigrant's world, perhaps, or a place, shot through with a gentle melancholy, where we have all been at one point or another. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Smith)20090924
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'DAN GRAHAM: BEYOND,' through Oct. 11. This beautifully installed retrospective pays tribute to an influential artist who doesn't necessarily call himself that, and it tends to bear him out. Most impressive are a series of early Conceptual artworks involving surgically precise uses of language and magazines; a series of deadpan, Minimalist-inspired photographs of New Jersey architecture; and ''Rock My Religion,'' an imaginative video about the roots of rock 'n' roll. The video installations and walk-in glass-and-mirror pavilions -- admired because they are interactive -- quickly grow tedious or gimmicky. The many artists who claim Mr. Graham as precedent may surpass him, but there is more than one way to be important. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090924
 Galleries: Chelsea
 JOANNE GREENBAUM: 'HOLLYWOOD SQUARES,' through Oct. 31. Combining aspects of graffiti art, doodling and children's drawings, these intensely colored, uningratiating paintings make the eyes spin. Their jagged pinwheel compositions turn in on themselves, as if one hue were battling another for supremacy, and in the best canvases black wins, adding a weight and density that works well against the thinness of the paint. Less like big, goofy drawings than they once were, all of them push further into the vicinity of painting without succumbing to its usual seductiveness. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street , (212) 352-9460, damelioterras.com. (Smith)20090924
 'PHASE TWO,' through Oct. 17. For a glimpse of the future of contemporary art, or at least a slice of that future, spend some time with the second round of exhibitions at X Initiative. Each of the three largest provides immersion in the work of a young, promising European artist working in time-based mediums. Luke Fowler's films about artists and eccentrics push the documentary form into art. Keren Cytter's visceral videos wreak havoc with numerous cinematic genres and a few from television. Tris Vonna-Michell combines slide projections and recordings of his rapid-fire spoken-word performances to trace his experiences in ways both random and crazily obsessive. X-Initiative, 548 West 22nd Street , (917) 697-4886, x-initiative.org. (Smith)20090924
 REBECCA WARREN: 'FEELINGS,' through Oct. 24. A surprise awaits viewers who know this British artist for her lumpy, erotically suggestive clay sculptures of female figures. Along with five examples of that work, this exhibition includes seven abstract sculptures made of rectilinear pieces of dark steel. The play between the feminine and the implicitly masculine is amusing, but it is the raw, comic expressionism of her clay sculptures that is most compelling. Matthew Marks, 522 West 22nd Street , (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Johnson)20090924
 Galleries: SoHo
 TAUBA AUERBACH: 'HERE AND NOW/AND NOWHERE,' through Oct. 17. The two big dot paintings in this young artist's beautiful exhibition look like giant sheets of crumpled paper; up close they atomize into buzzing fields of black spots. Another series creates the illusion of creased and wrinkled pieces of single-color fabric. The main attraction, however, is an eccentric wooden pipe organ with half a keyboard at either end. At 5 o'clock every evening, two performers play a transporting duet. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, SoHo , (212) 343-7300, deitch.com. (Johnson)20090924
 Galleries: Other
 MIKE KELLEY AND MICHAEL SMITH: 'A VOYAGE OF GROWTH AND DISCOVERY,' through Nov. 30. This entertaining and thought-provoking exhibition features a six-channel video followingMichael Smith, dressed as Baby Ikki in droopy diapers, bonnet and dark glasses, as he wanders around Burning Man, the weeklong celebration of all things psychedelic in the Nevada desert. With jungle-gym-like structures in the gallery and a towering junk-metal sculpture of Baby Ikki looming over all, the whole project represents Burning Man as a festival of infantilism. SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Johnson) 20090924
 SARA GREENBERGER RAFFERTY: 'TEARS,' through Oct. 25. Pursuing her interest in popular culture, Ms. Rafferty has carved out some new ground in the crowded turf of appropriated and manipulated photographs. Her technique involves splashing water onto scanned and printed images of well-known comedians and actors -- Goldie Hawn, Vicki Lawrence, Bill Cosby and Madeline Kahn -- until the color runs. The results are mysterious wisps of personality and painterliness that hover on the brink of familiarity while also seeming tinged with violence. Despite their slightness, the best have an unexpected emotional force. Rachel Uffner Gallery, 47 Orchard Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side , (212) 274-0064, racheluffnergallery.com. (Smith)20090924
 CARAGH THURING: 'ASSEMBLY,' through Nov. 1. In her first New York solo show, this young artist, born in Brussels and based in London, scatters seemingly random shapes and marks across unprimed linen. Each work is kind of a situation, like a sentence parsed, diagramed and awaiting reassembly by an interested reader. This isn't too hard, especially if you keep Manet's ''Luncheon on the Grass'' in mind. Parklike settings emerge, along with reclining or possibly fallen figures. The unhinged look and ambivalence toward painting appeal, as does the use of the tobacco-toned linen as backdrop.

 JACK TWORKOV: 'AGAINST EXTREMES -- FIVE DECADES OF PAINTING,' through Oct. 27. The painter Jack Tworkov (1900-82) made his name at the height of Abstract Expressionism, but he was never really comfortable with the angst-filled, tortured aspects of that movement. A noted intellectual and a sharp-eyed critic, he held his art to high, self-imposed standards of clarity and coherence. And, as this small survey confirms, he did more soul-searching on paper than on canvas. The 26 paintings on view are supplemented by journals, jottings and works on paper. Among the highlights are ''Pink Mississippi'' and ''Watergame,'' late-1950s abstractions that pit vertical against horizontal strokes and roseate pinks against steely blues.

 Out of Town
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'THE ART OF POWER: ROYAL ARMOR AND PORTRAITS FROM IMPERIAL SPAIN,' through Nov. 1. Drawn from the Royal Armory in Madrid, one of the oldest and greatest repositories of armor in the world, this exhibition presents full suits of armor, as well as individual helmets, shields, swords and armor for horses. There are portraits of 16th- and 17th-century Spanish kings in armor, too, and three spectacular tapestries. But it is the sumptuous metalwork, produced not for warfare but for ceremonial occasions, that is the main attraction.

 Last Chance
 'PAUL JENKINS IN THE 1960S AND 1970S: SPACE, COLOR AND LIGHT'; closes on Friday. While seriously overhung, this exhibition affords a rare, extensive look at the work of an artist who borrowed from Abstract Expressionism and then Color Field painting to devise flowing, billowing veils of color that dazzle with their formal acrobatics and luminous, jewel-toned hues. Working with his well-known ivory knives, Mr. Jenkins makes his colors leap, overlap and splinter, pitting them against whiplash lines and stark white backgrounds that increase their luminosity. His paintings have frequently been too gorgeous for their own good, which means that they can verge on slick. But the selection here shows him at the height of his powers. D. Wigmore Fine Art, 730 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street , (212) 581-1657, dwigmore.com. (Smith)20090924
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THEY CALLED ME MAYER JULY: PAINTED MEMORIES OF A JEWISH CHILDHOOD IN POLAND BEFORE THE HOLOCAUST'; closes on Thursday. Introducing the reluctant painter and accidental memoirist Mayer Kirshenblatt, now 92, who has devoted the last two decades to documenting life between the wars in and around the provincial city of Opatow (Apt in Yiddish), Poland. Wrought with irresistible detail and folk-art dispatch, the paintings begin with his mother's kitchen and reflect an omnivorous curiosity about everyday everything, aided by an apparently photographic memory. Labels pick up where the paintings leave off; words and images combine in a marvel of a book accomplished in collaboration with the artist's daughter, a folklorist whose career choice was shaped by her father's stories. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Smith)20090924
 MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'SCRIPTURE FOR THE EYES: BIBLE ILLUSTRATION IN NETHERLANDISH PRINTS OF THE 16TH CENTURY'; closes on Sunday. Abounding in sex, violence and supernatural happenings, the Bible has been a great source of inspiration for visual artists. This superb show features pieces by some of the biggest names in the history of Western printmaking. Woodcuts and engravings by Lucas van Leyden and Hendrick Goltzius alone would make a visit to the museum worthwhile, but among the 79 works on view there are lots more wildly imaginative and technically amazing feats of printmaking. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street , (212) 408-1500, mobia.org.

HEADLINE: Behind the Furor Over a Climate Change Skeptic

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Alan Carlin, a 72-year-old analyst and economist, had labored in obscurity in a little-known office at the Environmental Protection Agency since the Nixon administration.
 In June, however, he became a sudden celebrity with the surfacing of a few e-mail messages that seemed to show that his contrarian views on global warming had been suppressed by his superiors because they were inconvenient to the Obama administration's climate change policy. Conservative commentators and Congressional Republicans said he had been muzzled because he did not toe the liberal line.
 But a closer look at his case and a broader set of internal E.P.A. documents obtained by The New York Times under the Freedom of Information Act paint a more complicated picture. 
 It is true that Dr. Carlin's supervisor refused to accept his comments on a proposed E.P.A. finding, since adopted, that greenhouse gases endangered health and the environment, and that he did so in a dismissive way. 
 But the newly obtained documents show that Dr. Carlin's highly skeptical views on global warming, which have been known for more than a decade within the small unit where he works, have been repeatedly challenged by scientists inside and outside the E.P.A.; that he holds a doctorate in economics, not in atmospheric science or climatology; that he has never been assigned to work on climate change; and that his comments on the endangerment finding were a product of rushed and at times shoddy scholarship, as he acknowledged Thursday in an interview.
 Dr. Carlin remains on the job and free to talk to the news media, and since the furor his comments on the finding have been posted on the E.P.A.'s Web site. Further, his supervisor, Al McGartland, also a career employee of the agency, received a reprimand in July for the way he had handled Dr. Carlin. 
 Dr. McGartland, also an economist, declined to comment on the matter. But top officials of the agency said his decision not to forward Dr. Carlin's comments to the E.P.A. office that would be writing the final report had been his own and not directed by anyone higher up in the agency.
 Adora Andy, the agency's chief spokeswoman, called the accusation that Dr. Carlin had been muzzled for political reasons ''ridiculous.''
 ''There was no predetermined position on endangerment, and Dr. Carlin's work was not suppressed,'' Ms. Andy said in an e-mail response to questions. ''This administration has always welcomed varying scientific points of view, and we received much of it over this process.''
 Dr. Carlin said he was concerned less about how he had been treated than about what he described as the agency's unwillingness to hear the arguments of climate change skeptics. He said there was an obvious ''imbalance'' between the billions of dollars the government had spent building a case for dangerous climate change and the lack of attention to a handful of skeptics like him.
 The affair began in March as the E.P.A. was rushing to document the scientific justification for its proposed finding that emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases endangered public health and the environment. The finding was largely an updated version of a similar report, prepared last year under the Bush administration, that came to the same conclusion. But the Bush administration never acted on the research or issued an actual finding.
 The agency's officials were acting in March under severe time constraints to prepare the finding for the E.P.A. administrator, Lisa P. Jackson, who was planning to issue it in mid-April, fulfilling a presidential campaign pledge by Barack Obama. The finding set the stage for the government to regulate greenhouse gases for the first time, an initiative that will resonate through the economy for decades.
 Dr. Carlin, long known as a skeptic on global warming, was not invited to submit comments on the document. But he was determined that his views be heard.
 He rushed out a 93-page report that cited a variety of sources in raising questions about global warming and the usefulness of government action to combat it. In an accompanying e-mail message to superiors, he said the belief in global warming was ''more religion than science'' and warned that regulating carbon dioxide would be ''the worst mistake that E.P.A. has ever made.''
 Agency officials and outside experts who reviewed his report as a result of the outcry over the episode have said they found it wanting in a number of ways. It included unverified information from blog posts, they found, quoted selectively from journal articles, failed to acknowledge contradictory information and may have borrowed passages verbatim from the blog of a well-known climate change doubter.
 In the interview Thursday, Dr. Carlin admitted that his report had been poorly sourced and written. He blamed the tight deadline.
 ''There are numerous problems with it,'' he said. ''I wouldn't dream of sending it to a journal in its current form. It is totally unacceptable for that type of thing. But it was either do it in four and a half days or don't do it. I had to take some shortcuts.''
 According to e-mail messages that were among the documents obtained this week under the Freedom of Information Act, Dr. McGartland had earlier tried to discourage Dr. Carlin from filing comments on the proposed finding and told him that whatever he submitted was not likely to affect the final report, implying that the decision had already been made. After receiving Dr. Carlin's comments, Dr. McGartland told him that he would not forward them to the office preparing the final report. 
 ''The time for such discussion of fundamental issues has passed for this round,'' he wrote on March 17. ''The administrator and the administration has decided to move forward on endangerment, and your comments do not help the legal or policy case for this decision.''
 A few minutes later, he instructed Dr. Carlin to ''move on to other issues and subjects.'' He also told Dr. Carlin not to discuss climate change with anyone outside his immediate office.
 The e-mail messages most embarrassing to the E.P.A. came to light in late June, when someone sympathetic to Dr. Carlin leaked them to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative group that regularly produces studies critical of research that advances a case for climate change and government actions to address it. The institute distributed the material widely, and a number of conservative commentators and Republican lawmakers seized on it as an example of what they called Democratic suppression of science.
 Dr. McGartland was ''counseled'' by his superior ''to assure that professional differences are expressed in appropriate and considered ways,'' according to one of the newly released documents.
 Dr. Carlin said he and Dr. McGartland had not spoken to each other since June.

HEADLINE: Global Economic Challenges

 BODY:
Leaders of the Group of 20 are in Pittsburgh this week for their third meeting since the financial crisis erupted a year ago. It is likely to be a positive gathering, with the leaders from the developed and large emerging economies sharing credit for avoiding the economic abyss. It will take a lot more than that, however, for the meeting to be a real success.
 The previous two meetings were about projecting the ability and willingness to work together, which was a laudable goal last November when the markets were paralyzed and the global economy was in a tailspin, and, in April, when economies worldwide were still slumping badly. To quell panic generally, the G-20 leaders needed to show a united front. To ease specific fears that they would repeat the mistakes of the 1930s when protectionism prolonged the Great Depression, they needed to assert a commitment to open trade. 
 They succeeded in ensuring that conditions did not worsen because of actions they took or failed to take, but they did not confront the causes and cures of the financial crisis. In fact, they were successful largely because they stuck to the side effects of the crisis, like the harm to emerging markets, while avoiding the thorniest issues, like the dangers posed by too-big-to-fail institutions. Serious disagreements, like the proper size and role of fiscal stimulus, were papered over. 
 The question now is whether the G-20 can start to reach consensus on such vexing and divisive issues. If not, regulatory reform efforts of individual nations will be hobbled because nearly every pressing matter -- cleaning up toxic assets, regulating derivatives, downsizing large and interconnected firms -- has an international component. If reform efforts are hobbled, there is little hope of avoiding a repeat of the financial crisis.
 The signs, so far, have been mixed at best. The leaders are likely to agree on the need to impose higher capital requirements on banks and other financial firms. That is important as a general statement, but real reform will require an agreement on substantial increases in capital levels, as well as on how capital will be measured and how the new rules will be enforced. 
 A consensus is also expected on how to regulate pay for financial industry executives. Skewed compensation incentives clearly drove some of the reckless risk-taking that led to the crisis. But pay reform is just a stopgap. It's more important to enact reforms to ensure that banks can no longer engage in primarily speculative activities or other excessively risky transactions that lead to outsize paydays. Such reforms would include curbing the use of leverage and of opaque derivative trades to boost gains.
 The G-20 is also expected to reach an agreement on ways to correct the crucial long-term issue of global imbalances that created the conditions for a global upheaval. In brief, the United States must reduce its budget deficit and boost household savings. China must invest its reserves in its own social safety net and thereby increase consumption, which would inevitably involve revaluing its currency.
 But the leaders must not allow that to obscure more pressing concerns: The United States must clarify where it stands on open trade, having shaken faith in its stance by its recent imposition of tariffs on imports of Chinese tires. Large nations in the G-20 must commit themselves to continued government support of the world economy, including investment in poor countries and more stimulus spending for their own economies.
 The United States appears to have little appetite for more stimulus spending, even though unemployment is rising. The commitment to stimulus in Europe, particularly Germany, has long been too weak, putting undue pressure on economies that have been willing to do more to boost demand. 
 The time has passed for consensus for the sake of consensus. It's time for reform.

HEADLINE: N.B.A.'s Outreach Returns To U.S. Shores

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
In a long and illustrious European coaching career, Ettore Messina has worked for a fair amount of professional basketball owners. None of them, he said, were quite like Mikhail D. Prokhorov, a Russian tycoon who seemed destined to play moneyball in America.
 ''The guy has a way about him, a vision,'' said Messina, who coached for Prokhorov for four years at CSKA Moscow, a top Russian club. 
 From across the Atlantic and then some, can the Russian billionaire see a prosperous professional basketball future in Brooklyn, before a shovel has gone into the ground for the long-delayed arena and centerpiece of a 22-acre downtown development project known as the Atlantic Yards?
 Legal challenges and N.B.A. vetting hurdles remain before 80 percent ownership of the Nets shifts from Bruce C. Ratner to Prokhorov. Then it would take at least two years for them to move from New Jersey and become the Brooklyn Nets. If and when, the Nets will matter in a way they have only dreamed of since they were born in 1967 as the New Jersey Americans of the American Basketball Association, cash-poor and attention-starved.
 Suddenly, the team that has been slumming in the shadows of the Manhattan skyline is a few notarized documents from initiating a fierce intracity rivalry with the Knicks. The franchise that has long symbolized suburban sterility could become a central player in Commissioner David Stern's global basketball crusade.
 In Cleveland, a make-or-break mandate to retain LeBron James seemed a prime motivation for the Cavaliers to partner up with Chinese investors, who agreed to purchase 15 percent of the team last May. In northern New Jersey, Ratner's dire team finances and inability to raise capital during the recession were jeopardizing the Brooklyn arena and vast housing development. 
 Whatever the circumstances, Stern's march on the world appears to have developed a free-flowing reverse commute.
 ''I'll make the statement that I'm surprised this hasn't happened sooner, and I expect this is just the beginning,'' said Jerry Colangelo, the former Phoenix Suns owner and a Stern ally who is the national director for USA Basketball. ''Was David seeking to have foreign ownership of a team? I don't think that's necessarily the case. But it probably was inevitable, given everything that's gone on in the last 20 years.''
 Doors have opened. Barriers have fallen. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, James calculatingly said he would consider offers from Europe when his contract expires after next season if an offer were too good to refuse. Now here comes Prokhorov, 44, considered to be the richest man in Russia, right to American shores, with the deepest of pockets and fastest of lifestyles. 
 He is sure to speak a language that doesn't sound like Russian to your basic N.B.A. megastar.
 Standing tall (estimates are between 6 feet 7 inches and 6-9), Prokhorov knows what it's like to breathe rarefied air. Stern's vetting and interview process will at least make sure Prokhorov understands that the N.B.A. salary cap places limits on what owners can lavish on their players besides a paycheck.
 But while Prokhorov may sound like Mark Cuban on growth hormones, Messina said he had not attached himself to his teams in the way Cuban has become a staple around his Dallas Mavericks -- and a behavioral thorn in Stern's side.
 ''Never saw him in the practice gym, only at Euroleague games, where he'd be in the first row with a CSKA jersey and his name on the back,'' Messina said in a telephone interview from Spain, where he will coach Real Madrid for the 2009-10 season.
 Messina resigned from CSKA after losing in the Euroleague final last spring, after winning two championships in four years. With Prokhorov having relinquished his controlling stake, Messina said he has heard from his contacts in Moscow that the team's operating budget had already been cut by 30 percent.
 Under Prokhorov, he said, no expense was spared in the pursuit of a championship.
 ''Everything we did was like an N.B.A. team,'' Messina said. ''We always had one of the top two budgets in the Euroleague. We were chartering 99 percent of our flights all over Europe. The arena was built for the 1980 Olympics, but he made it really nice, locker rooms just like the N.B.A.''
 Nor was Prokhorov an owner predisposed to participating in daily operations, according to Messina.
 ''There was only one time when he got involved in a personnel decision, and that was when there was a chance to bring Andrei Kirilenko back to Moscow,'' Messina said. ''It was after Russia had won the European championship in 2007. It would have been a big patriotic thing for Kirilenko to come back, but he had a contract with the Jazz and they wouldn't let him go. 
 ''But Prokhorov's philosophy is very simple. He says, 'I select the specialists, they do their job and at the end I evaluate.' In the four years I was there, he never made a call on basketball.''
 In New Jersey, Prokhorov will have front-office decisions to make; he has commented on his blog that he intends to use his N.B.A. forum to grow Russian basketball. Given the Russian oligarch's reported ties to the government, and after already hearing criticism of his intentions to invest millions in America from members of the Russian parliament, Prokhorov will most likely crash more administrative barriers, bringing with him those he knows and trusts.
 He might even start with Messina, who has been mentioned as a candidate for a couple of N.B.A. jobs, although he said ''that never really went anywhere.'' 
 Along the way, Prokhorov might even make the more xenophobic folks in Basketball America chafe at cold war memories, particularly one when an American Olympic victory in a gold-medal game suddenly wasn't. Prokhorov was 7 years old in 1972 when the Soviet Union won a contested 1-point decision in Munich.
 ''A Russian billionaire owning an N.B.A. team -- it just shows you how everything has changed,'' Mike Bantom, one of the members of that American team, said Thursday.
 Now Bantom, a senior vice president for player development, is part of Stern's basketball-without-borders team. Any others bleeding like Ratner, take note: no more borders in America for ownership, either.

HEADLINE: Transparent New Home For Poetry

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
WERE Walt Whitman still haunting the cobblestone streets of Lower Manhattan -- ''If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles,'' he wrote -- he might be surprised to find, in this fast-moving Internet age, a tranquil new place devoted to reading and hearing verse. 
 For nearly 25 years Poets House has been an anchor for poets and poetry lovers. It lodged first in a home-economics room at the High School for the Humanities in Chelsea before settling in on the second floor of a loft building at 72 Spring Street in SoHo. On Friday, Poets House opens its spacious new home in Battery Park City hard by the Hudson River at the corner of Murray Street. 
 ''The goal of the place is to make everyone feel that poetry belongs to them,'' said Lee Briccetti, who has been executive director for 20 years. ''Anyone can come and experience poetry in a new way that will deepen their relationship to language.'' 
 In its new location Poets House has a rent-free lease through 2069 from the Battery Park City Authority. Poets House raised the money for construction of the interior, $11 million, from public and private sources, including $3.5 million from the city. 
 ''There has been an upswing in the appetite for poetry,'' said Kate D. Levin, New York City's cultural affairs commissioner. With the advent of poetry slams and spoken-word events, she added, poetry has ''moved away from an association with a rarefied crowd to a more populist world and the Poets House folks are tapped into that.'' Poets House is among the first cultural organizations to open downtown since 9/11. 
 ''It's part of an effort to make Lower Manhattan an arts community,'' said David Emil, president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Mr. Emil brought Poets House programming downtown years ago in his former role as president of the Battery Park City Authority.
 ''It gives us an anchor in the creative arts,'' said Warrie Price, the founder and president of the Battery Conservancy. ''Melville lived here, Eugene O'Neill -- our landscape has hosted great writers. To have Poets House create a center is in a sense going back to that history.''
 Poets House loyalists were attached to the former space, but are also excited about building audiences in the new location and about the stability of a long-term home. ''Poets House always felt a little provisional because it always seemed they might lose their lease,'' said Edward Hirsch, a poet and the president of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, which awards fellowships to artists, scientists and scholars. ''Now there is the sense that something solid and permanent is there.'' 
 Marie Howe, a poet and professor at Sarah Lawrence College, said she planned to bring her students to Poets House. ''They should have a huge sign outside: 'Rest is here. Safety is here. Nourishment is here,' '' she said. ''It's the water of life, but so rarely do we get to drink from it. It's the song of the human soul.''
 In the preface of his ''Collected Poems,'' Stanley Kunitz, a founder of Poets House in 1985, said, ''I dream of an art so transparent that you can look through it and see the world.'' Ms. Briccetti said the new Poets House, with interiors designed by the architect Louise Braverman, evokes that transparency. (Polshek Partnership designed the building.)
 Glass walls surround the entryway -- in which a Calder mobile floats -- and enclose the second-floor exhibition space. The blocklong second-floor reading room offers views of trees and water and is punctuated by nooks and a quiet reading space -- no talking aloud -- with photographs on the walls of contemporary poets taken by Lynn Saville. 
 The center -- which expects to achieve LEED gold certification from the United States Green Building Council -- features a beechwood floor from a Pennsylvania sustainable forest in the public programs room. It seats 105 and opens onto a courtyard designed by the landscape architect Michael Van Valkenburgh, which can accommodate additional seating.
 The children's room -- named by a donor, Laura Baudo Sillerman, in honor of her friend Constance Laibe Hays, a reporter for The New York Times who died in 2005 -- contains old card catalogues with poems in the drawers, and is to feature special programming, beginning in April. 
 The staircase is wired for sound, so when people pass, a motion sensor might trigger a spoken line from a poet like Robert Frost.
 But on a recent afternoon before Poets House had officially opened, the pristine space was missing something. ''It needs a human presence,'' Mr. Hirsch said. ''It's only a building, and it's only an organization. It needs the warmth of poetry itself, and it needs the warmth of people who come together in the spirit of poetry.''
 Ms. Briccetti said she hoped to animate the space with an expanded roster of programs, including the coming discussion on the psalms by the poet Norman Fischer and the performer Meredith Monk; series on Latino and Polish poetry; and John Felstiner's seminars, ''Can Poetry Save the Earth?'' 
 ''The bricks and mortar are beautiful,'' Ms. Briccetti said. ''But what's really important is what happens here.''
 Mr. Kunitz, who became the United States poet laureate at 95 and died at 100 in 2006, is a huge presence in the new space. The conference room bears his name. His library was donated to Poets House and fills the shelves. His collection of paintings by the Abstract Expressionist painter Philip Guston -- many featuring lines from Kunitz poems -- hang on the walls. 
 Poetry has a history in Battery Park City. Poets House has held outdoor poetry readings there. New York Waterway has adorned a handful of its ferries with verse from the poets featured in those readings. On either side of the lily pond in Rockefeller Park, just a few yards south of Poets House's entrance, poems are engraved on the stones: Seamus Heaney's ''Death of a Naturalist'' and Mark Strand's ''Continuous Life.''
 In nearby North Cove lines from Whitman and Frank O'Hara are welded into the fencing that surrounds the harbor. And lines from Marianne Moore and Claude McKay are etched at Stuyvesant Plaza. ''Poets need a refuge -- they need a hideout, a clubhouse,'' said the actor Bill Murray, who gave the lead gift to create a catalog for Poetry House and participates in its annual Poetry Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. (Whitman's ''Crossing Brooklyn Ferry'' is among the poems read aloud.) 
 Some people may never recognize the literary treasure trove in their midst, Mr. Murray added, just as most people walk by St. Patrick's Cathedral ''or use it as a place to light a cigarette or make a phone call.''
 But those who find themselves in the vicinity of Poets House will ''be right next to this sort of human church,'' he added. ''There's a possibility. That's all you can do is create a possibility.''

HEADLINE: Protesters at G-20 Meeting Are Greeted by Tear Gas

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA; Sean D. Hamill and Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
As the two-day Group of 20 meeting brought leaders of the world's industrialized nations here Thursday, the police were out in force, patrolling on bicycles, foot and horseback, by river and by air.
 In the afternoon, protesters trying to march toward the convention center where the gathering is being held encountered roaming squads of police officers carrying plastic shields and batons. The police fired a sound cannon that emitted shrill beeps, causing demonstrators to cover their ears and back up, then threw tear gas canisters that released clouds of white smoke and stun grenades that exploded with sharp flashes of light. 
 City officials said they believed it was the first time the sound cannon had been used publicly. ''Other law enforcement agencies will be watching to see how it was used,'' said Nate Harper, the Pittsburgh police bureau chief. ''It served its purpose well.'' 
 The protesters, who did not have a permit to march, rolled a large blue metal trash container down 37th Street. It stopped short of police vehicles and in front of a women's clothing and shoe boutique called Pavement.
 ''It was scary,'' said Alissa Martin, the shop's owner. ''You feel like you're living in a war zone.''
 About 20 people were arrested, and city officials said no serious injuries were reported. 
 On Thursday night on Forbes Avenue, hundreds of police officers carrying long batons fired smoke canisters that trailed in high arcs before landing among buildings at the University of Pittsburgh, including the one called Cathedral of Learning.
 The city had locked down its business district, known as the Golden Triangle, in preparation for possible clashes. Riot fences lined the sidewalks. Police helicopters, gunboats and Humvees darted to and fro. City officials announced they had up to 1,000 jail cells ready after county officials freed up additional space last week by releasing 300 people who had been arrested on minor probation violations.
 Many local residents stayed away from downtown Thursday, fearing clashes. 
 But the intermittent conflicts that did occur were well outside the security perimeter surrounding the G-20 meetings. 
 Much of the afternoon involved a cat-and-mouse game in which protesters, many in all black, evaded large forces of heavily armed police officers in the streets near Liberty Avenue. 
 The police repeatedly announced over loud speakers that the crowd had assembled unlawfully. 
 ''You must leave the immediate vicinity,'' the voice over the loud speaker said, adding that if the protesters did not, they would be subject to arrest and would face ''the use of riot control agents'' and ''less lethal munitions,'' which police later said were soft bean bags fired at protesters. At that point, the police fired tear gas and stun grenades. 
 Trevor Griffith, 21, was part of the march after driving 16 hours from Pensacola, Fla., with three fellow students from the University of West Florida.
 ''The fact that 20 or so individuals right now are determining economic trade policies for four to five billion people just isn't right,'' Mr. Griffith said. ''That's why we're here.''
 The turbulence downtown was in sharp contrast to smaller and less confrontational rallies and parades earlier in the day.
 Melanie White, 53, from Freemont, Ohio, said she was marching to bring wider attention to the conflict between the authorities and religious leaders in Myanmar. On Thursday, she joined a rally of about 100 people led by Burmese monks in saffron robes and chanting. The group went from the north side of the city over the Sixth Street Bridge, ending up in Point State Park in downtown Pittsburgh. 
 ''It was very important to be there,'' Ms. White said, adding that her group was commemorating the second anniversary of the so-called saffron revolution in Myanmar.
 ''I think it is important to give voice to the Burmese problem because they are not getting their own voice at the G-20,'' Ms. White said.
 Just blocks away, a row of vans filled with police officers escorted several cars carrying meeting attendees past a police barrier to the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, where the meeting officially began Thursday evening with a welcoming ceremony.

HEADLINE: Rubles for Clunkers? Russian Buys the Nets.

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
In the N.B.A., there's a new sheriff in town, a dashing Russian oligarch who arrived at the buzzer to save the Nets' Brooklyn dreams. Does it matter that he got ridiculously rich in the shady post-Soviet economy, is known as the Nickel King and could, for roughly a hundred reasons, knock Mark Cuban down N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern's nightmare list? For $200 million, apparently, nyet.
 (Oh, and Mikhail Prokhorov signed his deal with the soon-to-be minority owner Bruce Ratner at midday Wednesday, making the joke about renaming them the Brooklyn Nyets officially a day too old.) 
 This being New York, speculation instantly escalated to possibility of the billionaire bringing LeBron James to the Nets when he becomes a free agent in 2010. Yahoo.com's Adrian Wojnarowski believes that is a reason the rest of the N.B.A. should be worried. CBSsports.com's Ray Ratto believes Stern should be worried about creating a club that includes Cuban and Prokhorov, and a New Jersey congressman is calling on Stern to investigate his new oligarch friend thoroughly. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., however, did not get off to a good start by addressing the letter to ''Daniel Stern.'' Of course, considering the Nets' track record with potential saviors (paging Jay-Z...), the Bergen Record's Ian O'Connor may be wise in considering Prokhorov just another long shot in that department. Steve Politi of The Star-Ledger believes it only confirms the Nets lead the N.B.A. in crazy.
 Prokhorov's news was so big -- not just because he's 6-foot-9 -- that it all but drowned out Bobby Cox's announcement that he is retiring after the 2010 season after 358 seasons as the Atlanta Braves' manager. In Atlanta, however, it was big news and The Journal-Constitution's Jeff Schultz argues that it is good news for Braves fans, even the ones that like to blame Cox for everything, including this week's flooding.
 Perhaps he was just trying to pump some news into a sport with ridiculously few playoff races and the running sideshow that is the former star Lenny Dykstra, recently caught by a Japanese film crew pawning his memorabilia.
 In Detroit, though, people are giddy about the Tigers, writes Lee Jenkins on SI.com, although not giddy enough to buy all the tickets. Their attendance falling to 78 percent (from last year's 98) is one of baseball's economic woes detailed by Forbes magazine. And should the Tigers win the World Series, it still might not make up for the fact that Detroit still has the Lions and they might just be worse than last year's 0-16 calamity.
 There are a bunch of 2-0 teams in the N.F.L. and Foxsports.com's Alex Marvez decides which ones are for real, while Clark Judge of CBSSports.com wonders how 300-yard passing games became more plentiful than Detroit Lions fans. To get to the bottom of a true mystery, read how Chad Ochocinco recruited the fanswho greeted his Bengal-friendly Lambeau Leap.
 College football has its share of mysteries, including what appears to be Oregon's endless supply of uniform styles and why Texas-El Paso's football team was eating turkey legs out of New Mexico State's concession stands. On the more heartwarming side, consider the story of Coach Randy Shannon's rise from tragedy to success at Miami, as chronicled by Dave Hyde on SI.com.
 For a look back at one of college basketball's great tragedies, a documentary on Len Bias is being released soon, chronicling his family's struggles.
 Soccer's latest kerfuffle is more along the lines of an annoyance, especially to those who root against Manchester United, which the Guardian says gets more ''extra time'' to pull out games than any other team. This, however, does not even come close to making WSJ.com's hall of fame of cheating incidents (hint: intentionally crashing your race car boosts you to the top).
 Like the Nets, Nascar is looking for a financial savior, especially now that liquor companies seem to be abandoning it, and the Islanders have a dwindling group of people who believe they are worth the price of a ticket.
 Perhaps they can all find their own Russian oligarch.

HEADLINE: It's Easy Being Green

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
So, have you enjoyed the debate over health care reform? Have you been impressed by the civility of the discussion and the intellectual honesty of reform opponents?
 If so, you'll love the next big debate: the fight over climate change.
 The House has already passed a fairly strong cap-and-trade climate bill, the Waxman-Markey act, which if it becomes law would eventually lead to sharp reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. But on climate change, as on health care, the sticking point will be the Senate. And the usual suspects are doing their best to prevent action. 
 Some of them still claim that there's no such thing as global warming, or at least that the evidence isn't yet conclusive. But that argument is wearing thin -- as thin as the Arctic pack ice, which has now diminished to the point that shipping companies are opening up new routes through the formerly impassable seas north of Siberia. 
 Even corporations are losing patience with the deniers: earlier this week Pacific Gas and Electric canceled its membership in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in protest over the chamber's ''disingenuous attempts to diminish or distort the reality'' of climate change.
 So the main argument against climate action probably won't be the claim that global warming is a myth. It will, instead, be the argument that doing anything to limit global warming would destroy the economy. As the blog Climate Progress puts it, opponents of climate change legislation ''keep raising their estimated cost of the clean energy and global warming pollution reduction programs like some out of control auctioneer.''
 It's important, then, to understand that claims of immense economic damage from climate legislation are as bogus, in their own way, as climate-change denial. Saving the planet won't come free (although the early stages of conservation actually might). But it won't cost all that much either. 
 How do we know this? First, the evidence suggests that we're wasting a lot of energy right now. That is, we're burning large amounts of coal, oil and gas in ways that don't actually enhance our standard of living -- a phenomenon known in the research literature as the ''energy-efficiency gap.'' The existence of this gap suggests that policies promoting energy conservation could, up to a point, actually make consumers richer.
 Second, the best available economic analyses suggest that even deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions would impose only modest costs on the average family. Earlier this month, the Congressional Budget Office released an analysis of the effects of Waxman-Markey, concluding that in 2020 the bill would cost the average family only $160 a year, or 0.2 percent of income. That's roughly the cost of a postage stamp a day. 
 By 2050, when the emissions limit would be much tighter, the burden would rise to 1.2 percent of income. But the budget office also predicts that real G.D.P. will be about two-and-a-half times larger in 2050 than it is today, so that G.D.P. per person will rise by about 80 percent. The cost of climate protection would barely make a dent in that growth. And all of this, of course, ignores the benefits of limiting global warming.
 So where do the apocalyptic warnings about the cost of climate-change policy come from? 
 Are the opponents of cap-and-trade relying on different studies that reach fundamentally different conclusions? No, not really. It's true that last spring the Heritage Foundation put out a report claiming that Waxman-Markey would lead to huge job losses, but the study seems to have been so obviously absurd that I've hardly seen anyone cite it. 
 Instead, the campaign against saving the planet rests mainly on lies.
 Thus, last week Glenn Beck -- who seems to be challenging Rush Limbaugh for the role of de facto leader of the G.O.P. -- informed his audience of a ''buried'' Obama administration study showing that Waxman-Markey would actually cost the average family $1,787 per year. Needless to say, no such study exists.
 But we shouldn't be too hard on Mr. Beck. Similar -- and similarly false -- claims about the cost of Waxman-Markey have been circulated by many supposed experts. 
 A year ago I would have been shocked by this behavior. But as we've already seen in the health care debate, the polarization of our political discourse has forced self-proclaimed ''centrists'' to choose sides -- and many of them have apparently decided that partisan opposition to President Obama trumps any concerns about intellectual honesty.
 So here's the bottom line: The claim that climate legislation will kill the economy deserves the same disdain as the claim that global warming is a hoax. The truth about the economics of climate change is that it's relatively easy being green.

HEADLINE: Bedbug Problem Closes Building at John Jay College, Postponing Classes

BYLINE: By JOEL STONINGTON and JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
John Jay College of Criminal Justiceshut down one of its buildings on Thursday because of bedbugs. 
 The college said it hoped to reopen the building, at 445 West 59th Street, by Monday morning after it is treated by an extermination service. Meanwhile, all classes in the building, North Hall, were postponed and rescheduled. 
 ''The college is taking it seriously and moving as quickly as possible to treat the building,'' said Jim Grossman, a spokesman for John Jay. John Jay is calling the situation a bedbug ''condition.'' Mr. Grossman said, ''Infestation is when you can see them swarming.'' 
 At an information session held Thursday afternoon, college officials said that rashes among staff members were reported in mid-August and that the reports grew in numbers as time went on. Most staff members affected with skin rashes were from the financial aid and registrar's office. A deep cleaning was ordered on Sept. 14 and one bedbug was found. Soon after, a second was caught. The college brought in an inspection team with bug-sniffing dogs on Tuesday that confirmed the bedbug problem on the first floor of North Hall.
 The crowd of about 200 faculty, staff members and students gasped when officials showed a map of affected areas. Evidence of bedbugs was found in about half of the rooms on the second floor. The inspection had not been completed on the third or fourth floors of the building, though evidence was found on the third floor. Officials said other buildings would also be inspected.
 The president of the college, Jeremy Travis, said no bites had been reported, only skin rashes, but a forensic psychology student said she and a co-worker had been bitten in the last two weeks. The student, Deirdra Assey, 24, of Brooklyn, said she and the coworker checked their homes and spoke with landlords about bedbugs, but she said they concluded the bites were happening during the day.
 ''As soon as I figured out that campus had been infected, it all made sense,'' said Ms. Assey, a second-year master's degree student. ''I had no idea they could be infecting offices.''
 Despite the ''bed'' descriptor, the bugs can survive in many locations, like buses, trains and movie theaters. Last year they were reported at Fox offices.
 Bedbugs, once nearly eradicated, have spread across New York City, in part because of the decline in the use of DDT. In March, the city set up a bedbug advisory board. 
 Meanwhile, on Thursday, students expressed glee at the interruption in classes. Rudy Pamphile, 18, a freshman, walked past the yellow tape blocking the entrance to the building, laughing and joking with a friend. ''No test today!'' he said.
 Though Mr. Pamphile said he had stayed up until midnight studying, he was not unhappy to be relieved of the burden, adding he would probably hang out with friends until his next class.
 Faris Khalaf, 21, a student who is also on the admissions staff in North Hall, said he had talked to fellow employees who had rashes because of the bedbugs. The rashes were mostly on forearms and exposed areas of skin, like legs, he said.
 Bahar Kocyigit, 20, a law student from Queens, said she was relieved to hear that the building was closed because she had been late for her economics class. ''I'm surprised they do have bedbugs,'' she said. ''I heard about it on Facebook, but I didn't know if it were a rumor or not. I figured it would be in the dorms.''

HEADLINE: A Bright Idea

BYLINE: By ERIC A. TAUB and LEORA BROYDO VESTEL

 BODY:
The ubiquitous but highly inefficient 60-watt light bulb badly needs a makeover. And it could be worth millions in government prize money -- and more in government contracts -- to the first company that figures out how to do it.
 Right now, that company could be Philips, the Dutch electronics giant. The company announced on Thursday that it had submitted the first entry for the L Prize, an Energy Department contest that will award up to $10 million to the first person or group to create a new energy-sipping version of the most popular type of light bulb used in America. 
 As the first entrant, Philips will win the prize if its claims hold up. Testing of the Philips lamp will take close to a year to complete as the department independently evaluates the company's claims. 
 ''Philips is confident that the product submitted meets or exceeds all of the criteria for the L Prize,'' Rudy Provoost, chief of Philips Lighting, said in a statement.
 The $10 million is almost beside the point. More important, the contest winner will receive consideration for potentially lucrative federal purchasing agreements, not to mention a head start at cracking a vast consumer marketplace.
 The L Prize has garnered significant attention in the lighting industry because 60-watt incandescent lamps represent 50 percent of all the lighting in the United States, with 425 million sold each year. The Energy Department says that if all those lamps were LED equivalents, enough power would be saved to light 17.4 million American households and cut carbon emissions by 5.6 million metric tons annually.
 For decades, incandescent light bulbs continued to bear a strong resemblance to Thomas Edison's creations, but new energy standards that go into effect in 2012 -- and would effectively outlaw today's incandescent bulb -- have brought about a period of fertile innovation in the lighting industry. 
 One of the first attempts at greater efficiency was the now-maligned compact fluorescent bulb, but there have also been efforts to modify incandescent technology to conform to the new standard. LED bulbs are now available in stores, but those models have limited output and high prices. A faithful reproduction of an incandescent bulb's light from an inexpensive and efficient source has been the industry's ultimate goal.
 Philips has delivered 2,000 prototypes of its bulb to the Energy Department for testing. The company says the bulbs meet all the criteria of the contest, which specifies a bulb that reproduces the same amount and color of light made by a 60-watt incandescent bulb, but uses only 10 watts of power. The bulb must also last for more than 25,000 hours -- about 25 times longer than a standard light bulb. In a nod to economic concerns, at least 75 percent of the bulb must be made or assembled in the United States. 
 If the new bulb passes the department's testing regimen, it will be an even more efficient, longer-lasting lighting device than today's compact fluorescent bulbs. The department considers the introduction of compact fluorescents, today's alternative to standard bulbs, to have been a debacle.
 At first, the department set no standards for compact fluorescent bulbs and inferior products flooded the market. Consumers rebelled against the bulbs' shortcomings: the light output from compact fluorescent bulbs was cold and unpleasant, their life was much shorter than claimed, many were large and undimmable, they would not work in cold environments and they contained polluting mercury.
 By setting rigorous criteria for the L Prize, the department hopes LED bulbs can avoid a similar fate. That also means rejecting current LED bulbs that can claim some technical similarities, but fall far short of the L Prize's goals.
 ''We've probably eliminated almost 25 products that were horrible,'' said James R. Brodrick, manager of the Solid State Lighting Program of the Energy Department. ''We test LED bulbs today that claim on the package that they're equivalent to 40 watts, but are really like 20-watt bulbs.''
 ''This will be the most publicly tested bulb ever,'' Mr. Brodrick said.
 The Philips LED lamp represents ''a significant energy savings,'' said Nadarajah Narendran, the director of research at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. ''This has now leapfrogged what C.F.L.'s can do.''
 The Energy Department will also award $5 million to the creator of an LED reflector lamp (no entries have yet been made) and a new, ''21st-century lamp,'' the specifications of which are yet to be defined.
 General Electric -- along with Philips and Osram Sylvania, one of the world's biggest lighting suppliers -- said that it would introduce a new LED module next month that would make it easier to replace traditional light sources with LEDs. Osram had no comment about its plans.
 The first certified products, due in about a year, will not be cheap. Today's LED-based bulbs cost up to $100 each, and while there is plenty of optimistic talk about reducing that price, a clear path to affordability remains elusive.
 To lower the cost, Mr. Brodrick has enlisted 27 utility companies around the country as L Prize partners, with the hope that utility subsidies, along with mass production, will help cut the cost. One such utility, Southern California Edison, will both test the bulbs and offer rebates to consumers, according to Gregg Ander, the company's chief architect.
 ''There's a potential for LED lamps to be much more acceptable to the consumer than compact fluorescents,'' Mr. Ander said. He said he expected that eventually, an LED substitute for a 60-watt bulb would cost the same as its compact fluorescent equivalent, factoring in its longer life.
 Kevin Dowling, vice president for innovation at Philips Solid State Lighting Solutions, is confident that the LED light bulb can become an affordable option. ''Over the long term, we can absolutely get the cost down to the $20 to $25 range,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Jeff Koons Tries Hand as Guest Curator

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
A white foam-core model of the New Museum's gallery spaces arrived at Jeff Koons's Chelsea studio on Wednesday morning. Its appearance there doesn't mean that Mr. Koons is creating a painting or sculpture for the building, on the Bowery on the Lower East Side. The model is a visual aid -- a kind of blank canvas -- to help him start thinking beyond his own work. 
 For an artist who seems to have been everywhere and done everything for nearly three decades, Mr. Koons is taking a new direction. He is trying his hand as a curator, agreeing to organize an exhibition of the Greek industrialist Dakis Joannou's contemporary-art collection when it comes to the New Museum in February. 
 Mr. Koons is no stranger to Mr. Joannou's holdings: they just happen to include seminal examples of Koons pieces from every period, like the sculptures ''Balloon Dog,'' ''Michael Jackson and Bubbles'' and one of his first ''Equilibrium Tanks'' (a basketball suspended in a container filled with water). 
 But the Joannou collection, which contains thousands of artworks, also includes in-depth holdings of paintings, sculptures, drawings and installations by other celebrated artists like Maurizio Cattelan, Urs Fischer, Robert Gober, Chris Ofili, Charles Ray and Kiki Smith. 
 The show will take up the entire museum, something that is becoming a trend at the New Museum. Its show ''The Generational: Younger Than Jesus,'' which ended in July, occupied the whole building, as will a show opening in October dedicated to work by Mr. Fischer. Like Mr. Koons, Mr. Fischer, who used a jackhammer to pummel a Chelsea gallery floor to smithereens awhile back, will double as curator and creator, installing giant sculptures made of unusual materials like bread or giant teddy bears. 
 Lisa Phillips, director of the New Museum, said she had been talking to Mr. Joannou, a trustee there, about the possibility of an exhibition of his holdings since 2000. ''He especially wanted artists to be involved,'' she added.
 Mr. Joannou has been showing his collection since the 1980s at the Deste Foundation, his public space in Athens. ''It's been seen in Paris and Vienna,'' he said. ''This will be the first time it has been shown in the United States.'' 
 The New Museum project will inaugurate an exhibition series called ''The Imaginary Museum,'' which will showcase the best private collections of contemporary art from around the world that are rarely seen by the public. 
 That Mr. Koons should be an integral part of this exhibition is not surprising. He and Mr. Joannou have been close friends since 1985, when Mr. Joannou first saw ''Equilibrium,'' a show of Mr. Koons's work at the International With Monument gallery on the Lower East Side. Since then Mr. Joannou has been a passionate Koons collector. He even asked Mr. Koons to decorate the exterior of Guilty, his 114-foot yacht. 
 ''In the summer my family and I spent 10 days with Dakis in Corfu,'' Mr. Koons said. ''And in the afternoons we would go through the collection. He has books with printouts of everything, so I'm pretty familiar with it.'' 
 ''I plan to work on the project for a few hours every day,'' Mr. Koons added. ''I'm curious to see what it will look like at the New Museum.'' 
 Just how many examples of his own work -- and how prominently they will be displayed -- is likely to be a challenge. ''I'm sure there are going to be artworks that I will become engaged with and learn from,'' Mr. Koons said of his colleagues' creations. ''I can assure you, the show will not revolve around my work.'' 
 Filling a New Wing
 After abandoning their controversial idea of building their own museum in the historic Presidio park in San Francisco, Don Fisher, the art collector and Gap store founder, and his wife, Doris, have settled on a new location. They will lend their collection to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, where it will be in a new wing that will also incorporate art from the museum's holdings. 
 The expansion is part of a plan announced in April to triple the institution's gallery space. 
 The Fishers' art -- 1,100 works by major contemporary figures like Calder, de Kooning, Diebenkorn, Warhol and Lichtenstein, as well as by living artists like Cy Twombly, Ellsworth Kelly and Brice Marden -- dovetails with the museum's collection.
 Under the agreement, the Fishers, who have long been trustees at the museum, will create a trust to oversee the care of the collection; the trust will be renewable after 25 years. The couple are also planning to make a significant contribution toward building the galleries, as well as a separate donation to the museum's endowment. 
 Art Basel Gets Creative
 Between the sagging economy and the proliferation of competitors, the organizers of art fairs have to shake things up continually to make sure that collectors keep coming back. So when Art Basel Miami Beach opens on Dec. 3, visitors will find the main exhibition floor reorganized. There will also be additional programs and an array of new dealers, many replacing those who decided not to return. 
 With 15 percent of the dealers dropping out of the fair, Art Basel Miami Beach had little choice but to get creative. ''We're finding that a lot of galleries are doing fewer fairs, and those that are participating want better spaces,'' said Marc Spiegler, the fair's co-director, who said the redesigned space would give exhibitors larger booths. 
 Along the waterfront, where a row of shipping containers once featured the work of emerging artists, there will now be a large-scale architectural space designed by the multimedia artist Pae White. Creative Time, the nonprofit arts organization known primarily for presenting public art around New York, is overseeing Ms. White's project. And the emerging artists who occupied the shipping containers there will now move inside, to the middle of the main exhibition hall. 
 Creative Time's involvement at Art Basel Miami Beach is a first. ''Two years ago we started working nationally when we did a project with Paul Chan in New Orleans,'' Anne Pasternak, Creative Time's president and artistic director, said. So when Art Basel approached her about collaborating on a project along the beachfront, she jumped at the chance.
 ''Initially we went to 12 artists,'' Ms. Pasternak said. ''Pae seemed as though she had a great design sense.'' 
 Ms. White is creating a three-dimensional environment the organizers are calling a ''social space.'' It will include piazzas and a performance platform, along with a series of scrims that change in appearance from day to night. Within the space the fair will present discussions, concerts and performances.

HEADLINE: Twitter Appears Set to Raise $100 Million, Valuing It at $1 Billion

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Twitter has trained people to compress their thoughts into 140 characters and given a public stage to both dissidents in Iran and voluble stars like Shaquille O'Neal. 
 Now the start-up appears to have chalked up another achievement. Twitter, which has no discernible revenue, is set to raise about $100 million of new funding that would value the company at around $1 billion, a person briefed on the company's plans said Thursday. 
 For context, that is almost double the market capitalization of Domino's Pizza, which has 10,500 employees and had $1.4 billion in sales last year. Twitter has some 60 employees, and although it is experimenting with running advertisements on its Web site, Biz Stone, a Twitter founder, said this week at an industry conference that the company had no plans to begin widely running ads until 2010. 
 But Twitter's cash infusion and exospheric valuation are not easily reduced to the level of the blind bets of past dot-com bubbles. In its three and a half years, Twitter has become a magnet for media attention, and its Web site now attracts 54 million visitors a month, according to comScore, the tracking firm. Along with Facebook, it is helping to remake the Web as a forum for the perpetual sharing of even the most trivial bits of information about people's lives.
 ''There have probably been less than five examples of companies that have grown like Twitter has,'' said John Borthwick, the chief executive of Betaworks, which created the link-shortening service Bit.ly. (Betaworks also invested in Summize, a Twitter search engine that Twitter acquired last year, and it now owns a small stake in the company.) 
 Mr. Borthwick lists Google and Facebook as other examples. Twitter ''represents a next layer of innovation on the Internet,'' he said. ''This investment is happening because it represents a shift.'' 
 The new investors include Insight Venture Partners, a venture capital firm based in New York; T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund company, which is not normally known for placing such bets; and the current Twitter backers Spark Capital and Institutional Venture Partners.
 The investment is likely to kick off more discussion about the heady valuations investors are assigning to some Internet start-ups, even as the United States economy struggles to emerge from a deep recession and the window for initial public offerings remains weak. 
 Twitter is what insiders charitably describe as pre-revenue, and the service has become known for going down periodically, although its reliability record has been improving lately.
 To some, Twitter's new valuation makes sense. Facebook, Google and Microsoft have all reportedly made entreaties to acquire the company, and its desirability to the Internet giants elevates its value.
 Then there is the nonstop media attention, with everyone from Oprah Winfrey to local radio stations increasingly using the service to communicate with fans. ''There is so much media hype around them, it was probably easy to go to mainstream investors and find someone who would be interested,'' said Jeremiah Owyang, a social media analyst at the Altimeter Group.
 Twitter has not yet commented on the investment, so it is not clear how it will use the new cash. The company does not appear to need the capital. It previously raised $55 million and has said it still has $25 million of that in the bank. But it is known to have wide aspirations to ultimately reach one billion users and become ''the pulse of the planet,'' according to internal documents that were illicitly obtained by a hacker and published on the blog TechCrunch earlier this year. 
 Twitter could use the investment to build the technology infrastructure required to grow to that scale. It also might use the cash to acquire one or more of the companies that are writing Twitter programs for mobile phones and computer desktops.
 Twitter could even find a business model for itself if it were to buy one of the several start-ups devoted to helping companies manage their Twitter presence and monitor how their brands are being discussed. 
 But close followers of Twitter do not sense that the company is in any great rush to prove itself as a profitable venture. 
 ''It would be trivially easy for them to turn on a revenue source today,'' said Steve Broback, founder of the Parnassus Group, which runs conferences on Twitter and other business topics. ''I don't see that they are in a big hurry to start generating revenues, mostly because they want to minimize any sort of negative effect on their community.''
 Twitter's newly lined pockets may have the biggest impact on its chief rival, Facebook. Executives from the two companies often claim that their services do not quite overlap and can peacefully coexist. But both firms are essentially on the same mission: to allow people to share with friends and fans what they are doing now, in real life and on the Web. 
 Despite their protestations, the companies appear, especially recently, to be taking swipes at each other. Last week, when Facebook announced that it had signed up its 300 millionth member and that its finances were strengthening, executives used the occasion to play down any threat posed by Twitter. Chamath Palihapitiya, a Facebook vice president, told the technology blog VentureBeat that Twitter was now in ''the rearview mirror.'' 
 Even more pointedly, earlier this year Facebook redesigned the stream of updates from friends that each user sees to be more of a constant flow of information, similar to Twitter. And earlier this month, Facebook began allowing users to ''tag'' messages about particular friends with the @ symbol, a familiar convention on Twitter. 
 For its part, Twitter has previewed a new way to allow people to see when other Twitter users have ''retweeted'' or relayed their messages. The feature looks eerily similar to the display of friends who have commented on, or indicated that they liked, an update on Facebook.
 Twitter's ascension has clearly clouded Facebook's aspirations to dominate the market for sharing over the Web, said Keith Rabois, an Internet entrepreneur and vice president of strategy at Slide, a Web social entertainment firm.
 ''Twitter is so likely to be successful at this point, it is almost impossible to envision a way in which Facebook can truly monopolize online content-sharing,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Global Forum Will Expand, Permanently

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
President Obama will announce Friday that the once elite club of rich industrial nations known as the Group of 7 will be permanently replaced as a global forum for economic policy by the much broader Group of 20 that includes China, Brazil, India and other fast-growing developing countries, administration officials said Thursday. 
 The move highlights the growing economic importance of Asia and some Latin American countries, particularly since the United States and many European countries have found their banking systems crippled by an economic crisis originating in excesses in the American mortgage market. 
 For more than three decades, the main economic group was the Group of 7 -- the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. 
 During the Clinton years, Russia was gradually added, not because of the size of its economy, but to help integrate it with the West. Administration officials said the group would still meet twice a year to discuss security issues. But for practical purposes, the smaller group will become more like a dinner club that defers to the broader group on the economic issues that have dominated summit meetings for nearly three decades. 
 The development, as Mr. Obama was hosting a summit meeting here for leaders of the Group of 20 -- 19 countries and the European Union -- also highlighted the lingering disparity between the elite group of mostly Western powers and the mass of poorer nations. 
 For all of Mr. Obama's talk about greater inclusiveness for countries like Brazil and China, the meeting in Pittsburgh remains dominated by the financial crisis that began in the United States and has preoccupied the old boys' club. 
 The issue that many developing countries feel much more strongly about -- knocking down barriers to trade, especially in politically sensitive sectors like agriculture -- is barely likely to be part of the official discussions. 
 Rather, the packed agenda includes proposals to raise capital requirements for financial institutions, rein in executive compensation and reduce imbalances between shop-till-you-drop countries like the United States and export behemoths like China, Germany and Japan.
 Even as Mr. Obama participated in his first Group of 8 meeting in July in L'Aquila, Italy, he seemed to have doubts about its suitability as a forum for solving the world's problems. At the time, his aides characterized the session as merely a way station between Group of 20 meetings. 
 ''We view this meeting and this discussion as a midpoint between the London G-20 summit and the Pittsburgh G-20 summit,'' said Mike Froman, the president's chief negotiator. 
 The merits of the different sizes of gathering -- 8 nations, 19 or sometimes something in between -- have been vigorously debated. 
 Proponents of the smaller group say the friendships it fosters are important when friction arises in the group or outside it in one-on-one policy disputes between nations. 
 They also point to complications that arise when 20 countries with vastly different economies try to reach agreement on setting exchange rates or other complex financial questions. 
 Supporters of the larger group say the emerging nations, and the huge slice of the world's population that they represent, must have a seat at the table to debate not only economic issues, but also environmental issues like climate change.
 Though the huge expansion of global trade has been at the heart of ''global imbalances'' that Obama officials say they want to address, European and Asian officials gathering here say they cannot tell whether Mr. Obama really wants to push for more open trade. 
 He and his economic advisers have repeatedly warned against responding to the economic crisis by erecting barriers to imports. 
 But global leaders, noting that Mr. Obama's words are not always in sync with his actions, wonder if the president is a free trader or a protectionist.
 Less than two weeks ago, he set off a dispute with China when he approved hefty new tariffs on imports of Chinese automobile and truck tires. 
 Chinese leaders denounced the move and threatened to retaliate with barriers against American chicken exports. 
 The Chinese are not the only ones who are unhappy. European officials are quietly grumbling that the United States has yet to become engaged in an effort to revive work on a new global agreement to knock down barriers in areas like agriculture and business services. 
 That effort is also a top priority for fast-growing countries like Brazil, whose leaders have become important new players on the world stage.
 ''With Obama's move on the tire tariffs, the hypocrisy on trade pledges is really quite apparent,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ''I would expect the other countries to beat up on the U.S., and they deserve it.''
 Notwithstanding Mr. Obama's decision on Chinese tires, administration officials have strenuously avoided economic quarrels with China. For years, American officials have complained at international meetings that China was deliberately undervaluing its currency to give its exports a price advantage. 
 On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner did not even mention the issue. He went out of his way to praise China for responding to the financial crisis by increasing domestic spending with one of the world's most aggressive economic stimulus programs.
 ''If you look at what has happened in China, you will see they have made a very substantial effort to increase domestic demand,'' Mr. Geithner said. 
 But Mr. Obama has been largely silent about what he would like to accomplish on trade, especially when it comes to politically charged issues like American barriers to agricultural imports.

HEADLINE: Burmese Opposition Supports New U.S. Approach

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: BANGKOK 

 BODY:
The decision by the United States to engage the ruling junta in Myanmar drew the endorsement Thursday of the nation's most high-profile dissident, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, but analysts cautioned that the change would not have a significant effect in the near term.
 On Wednesday, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said that the United States would pursue engagement but maintain the economic sanctions that have been put in place to punish the government of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, for its human rights abuses and restrictions on political freedom. 
 ''Engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion,'' she said. ''So, going forward we will be employing both of these tools, pursuing our same goals. To help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with Burmese authorities.''
 The shift in policy was the result of a review that was first announced by Mrs. Clinton in February when she said neither the sanctions imposed by Western countries nor the ''constructive engagement'' of Myanmar's Asian neighbors had succeeded in affecting the government's behavior.
 It represented the most significant modification of administration policy toward Myanmar in decades. But analysts said it was likely to face opposition in Congress, where many members strongly support an unflinchingly antagonistic approach to the junta.
 Analysts and activists said the new policy entailed a difficult balancing act between carrot and stick, and they said they did not expect it to produce significant effects in the near term.
 Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has been a long-time advocate of sanctions but has also tried to engage the ruling generals in a dialogue and has said any future government would have to include the military.
 ''She said she accepts direct engagement but it must be on both sides,'' said her lawyer, U Nyan Win, after visiting her Thursday. By both sides, he said she meant both the government and the opposition.
 Speaking at the United Nations, Mrs. Clinton did not provide specifics and some analysts voiced concern that the new policy would be only cosmetic, while others said it could undermine the pressure that the West has brought to bear on the ruling generals.
 ''I think we have to keep our short-term expectations fairly low,'' said Thant Myint-U, a Burmese historian who is the author of ''The River of Lost Footsteps.'' 
 ''I don't think talking to the generals will influence much their plans for next year's elections or will lead anytime soon to dialogue between them and Aung San Suu Kyi,'' he said. ''But we have to look at the long-term picture, and the more engagement there is from the outside world, especially from the United States, the more quickly we're going to see the country move in the right direction.''
 Debbie Stothard, coordinator of Altsean-Burma, a regional human rights group, said many Burmese activists were concerned that the junta could take the new policy as a tacit endorsement of its current behavior, giving it ''a honeymoon in terms of moving forward with reform.'' 
 ''It's a very tough balancing act if you want to moderate between a big carrot and a big stick,'' she said. ''It requires a lot of mindfulness and a lot of finesse, and, speaking to the generals, a clear sense of principle.'' 
 She pointed to the failed policy of engagement by Myanmar's neighbors in Southeast Asia who, in their desire to maintain a working relationship, had allowed the junta to ''deliver token gestures instead of genuine and irreversible reform.'' Over the years, the junta has carried out a policy of promises and gestures toward the outside world while maintaining a strong grip over its own people, crushing pro-democracy demonstrations by force.
 The generals have not been moved by ever-tighter economic restrictions and diplomatic pressure, which have been undermined by continuing trade from Myanmar's neighbors and have pushed the country into a closer embrace with its biggest trade partner, China.
 The generals clung to power in 1990 after losing a parliamentary election to the National League for Democracy and since then have jailed thousands of political opponents, including the monks and their supporters who demonstrated in the streets two years ago. Washington imposed additional sanctions at that time, to little evident effect.
 Most recently, the regime convicted Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi of violating the terms of her house arrest after an American intruder spent two days at her villa. She was sentenced to house arrest for the next 18 months, a period that will ensure that she is out of the public eye during a parliamentary election scheduled for early next year.
 Josef Silverstein, an expert on Myanmar who is an emeritus professor at Rutgers University, has grown skeptical over the years as he has watched the world try one futile policy after another to influence the junta.
 ''How are you going to engage and whom are you going to engage and, if they can say it, what subject are they going to take up first?'' he said.
 He added: ''We are not going to go to war with them. And if we are not going to war with them, we haven't figured out a peaceful means, not only to get them to listen to us but to get them to respond in a positive way.''

HEADLINE: Debate on Economy Muted As Germans Prepare to Vote

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
The global financial crisis knocked Germany and the rest of the world badly off course this year. Yet as the country grinds toward national elections on Sunday, the campaign's most notable absence has been a debate over the direction and future of Europe's largest economy. 
 Neither Chancellor Angela Merkel nor her challenger from the center-left, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, has delved deeply into policy matters, preferring to focus on personality and politics. And neither is temperamentally inclined to attack the other. 
 But the most important reason for the absence of any real economic debate, many analysts say, is that the stark choices Germany faces are bound to polarize a country that so deeply values consensus.
 Many economists see Germany as settling into a phase of slow growth or stagnation in the coming months and years. The export-oriented economy is struggling to find its place in a new global economic order in which other countries, notably the United States, will not have such a voracious appetite for Germany's high-value industrial products, at least not anytime soon.
 For all the risks, however, a debate over possible corrective measures -- revamping the German welfare state, changing tax policies or deregulation -- offers little political benefit to either camp. ''If one of them tries to break out of the mold, they don't know whether they simply energize the other side without winning,'' said Kurt Lauk, a former conservative member of the European Parliament who has advocated a more forceful discussion of economic issues. 
 Mrs. Merkel seems likely to secure another term on the strength of her image as a kind of mother-protector. Her future coalition partner is in doubt, however. Her Christian Democrats are hoping to wiggle out of the ''Grand Coalition'' with Mr. Steinmeier's Social Democrats that they reluctantly embraced four years ago. But that depends on whether Mrs. Merkel's Christian Democrats, together with its preferred partner, the Free Democratic Party, clinches a narrow majority. Analysts broadly agree that a coalition with the Free Democrats would encourage Mrs. Merkel to embrace some traditional center-right policies, like tax cuts.
 But a serious debate over the shape of Germany's economic order never got started during the campaign. In broad brush, economists and analysts said, that debate would have focused on the question of how to stimulate domestic consumption and the growth of the services sector after a long period of dependence on muscular manufacturing, whose bread and butter is exports.
 Although Germany edged out of recession over the summer, it exported 23.5 percent less in the first six months of this year than it did in 2008, when global growth was already slowing. Almost unanimously, economists expect a sharp increase in unemployment, now at 8.5 percent. 
 So far, a combination of government programs and retraining has masked what is an increasingly idle work force. 
 On a broader level, leaders at the Group of 20 meeting in Pittsburgh on Thursday and Friday will be preoccupied with how to rebalance the global economy so that some countries, notably the United States, spend less and save more, while others, like Germany and China, move in the opposite direction.
 The German contribution to the debate could have a center-right flavor to it, with calls for tax cuts that would reduce the heavy social insurance charges that make labor so expensive and stimulate employment in sectors like health care. But left-leaning politicians and economists argue that the years of meager wage settlements for German workers, which helped make the country's exports so competitive, need to give way to fatter paychecks, so households can spend more.

HEADLINE: Meanwhile, Next Door, It's Team Obama for Corzine

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER and DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI; Adam Nagourney contributed reporting.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
While President Obama's political team seeks to nudge David A. Paterson out of the New York governorship, they are fully engaged in trying to get Gov. Jon S. Corzine re-elected here.
 Every TV ad that Mr. Corzine puts on the air is being screened by the president's team. The governor's aides are giving daily briefings to the White House. Mr. Obama's pollsters have taken over for Mr. Corzine's polling team, and White House operatives are on the ground for everything from internal strategy sessions to obscure pep rallies with Latino supporters.
 On Thursday, Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, promoted Mr. Corzine in meetings with Democratic women in the morning and black ministers in the afternoon.
 In addition, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and a parade of cabinet secretaries are coming to the state to try to boost Mr. Corzine's dismal poll numbers. 
 The state is one of only two nationwide holding governor's contests this year. And Mr. Obama's aides acknowledge that a loss in this deep-blue state would be interpreted as a rebuke of Mr. Obama, affecting his ability to pass major legislation and the public's perceptions of his party's power.
 The attention has brought an added intensity to what is already an expensive, high-stakes and almost relentlessly negative battle between Mr. Corzine and his Republican challenger, Christopher J. Christie, a former United States attorney.
 The two sides are spending heavily for TV advertisements featuring ominous images of the opposing candidate and narrators intoning darkly about his misdeeds and character flaws.
 Adding to the gloom is the state's battered economy. Unemployment here has risen to 9.7 percent, the highest in three decades, and the riches that once flowed from Wall Street are evaporating. With refugees from the financial industry crowding unemployment offices, home values plunging and budget deficits stretching to the horizon, Mr. Corzine and Mr. Christie hack away at each other over each new bit of dreary economic news.
 Just a year after Mr. Obama inspired Americans to vote their hopes, the two rivals seem to be appealing strictly to the electorate's fears. Mr. Christie blames Mr. Corzine for the state's choking tax burden, housing crunch and population exodus. Another four years of the ''out of touch'' Democrat will drive the state and its residents to financial ruin, he says, adding, ''We can no longer afford Jon Corzine.''
 Mr. Corzine counters by cautioning New Jersey's moderate voters that with no end to the economic crisis in sight, Mr. Christie, who was a Bush appointee, would choose conservatism over compassion and slash the educational and social programs that are vital to their quality of life. ''Wrong when it matters most,'' his TV ads say of Mr. Christie.
 The tone, all gritted teeth, slashing attack and grim-faced defense, seems to be discouraging voters, who are desperate for signs of economic brightening. 
 ''New Jersey's economy has been hit worse than almost any place in the country, so people are already worrying about whether it will get worse,'' said Eddie Punte, a Democrat who was working in a flower shop in the Ironbound section of Newark last week. ''And when the politicians keep talking about how bad it is and how bad it's going to get, it just makes people nervous.''
 Neither man bothers to say much about what he would do if elected. Mr. Christie mouths gauzy goals about fiscal responsibility, spending cuts and ethics and regulatory reform, but refuses to get pinned down; he would rather let his forceful personality and record of locking up corrupt politicians stack up against what he sees as Mr. Corzine's fecklessness and unfulfilled campaign promises.
 Mr. Corzine, meanwhile, is not asking voters to stay the course; he is trying to convince them that he is the lesser of two evils. So his commercial warn that Mr. Christie would eliminate insurance coverage for mammograms, reject billions in federal aid and drive property taxes -- already the nation's highest -- through the roof.
 Mr. Christie, 47, whose only other elected office was as a Morris County freeholder, has held a healthy lead in the polls for months, remarkable in a state that has not elected a Republican statewide since Christine Todd Whitman was re-elected governor in 1997. Mr. Christie withstood a flurry of tough reports last month that dented his incorruptible image, most notably his admission that he extended a loan to a subordinate in the federal prosecutor's office and did not report it on his financial disclosure forms or tax returns, as required.
 But he has come this far by saying little more than that New Jersey is broken and he will fix it, and he appears reluctant to complicate that message with proposals that have price tags. He has vowed to cut spending even if it means titanic conflicts with the Democratic-controlled State Legislature. Speaking to a crowd in Paramus, he vowed to use the line-item veto like someone ''standing at the checkout counter declining their credit card.''
 The final six weeks are unlikely to see a change in tone. 
 Mr. Corzine, a former Goldman Sachs chairman, is prepared to spend upward of $40 million to hold on to the office, and plans to flood the airwaves with TV and radio commercials assailing his Republican challenger as a bogus change agent and a hypocrite with ''one set of rules for himself and another for everyone else.'' 
 Mr. Christie, whose resources are far more limited, plans to briefly hold his fire, then unleash a barrage of ads reminding voters that change in Trenton begins with hiring a new governor. He also hopes to maximize the impact of two televised debates, where his easy volubility is more than a match for the often tongue-tied governor. 
 Underscoring Mr. Corzine's shaky standing, the frontlines in the coming weeks may well be in the cities, areas any Democrat would be expected to dominate. Billing himself as a new kind of Republican who can work with the president on issues like education, Mr. Christie has been appealing to blacks and Latinos in urban areas, in hopes of eating into Mr. Corzine's margins.
 But the governor and his allies in the teachers', public workers' and trade unions are already gearing up for a get-out-the-vote effort that could see record spending and as many as 16,000 canvassers on the streets before Election Day.
 Harnessing the enthusiasm for Mr. Obama will be a big part of that effort, which is why the governor is grabbing at the president's lapels like a lifeline. He warns that a defeat in New Jersey could undermine the administration's agenda in Washington and even presage another Republican comeback like the one in 1994, which came a year after Ms. Whitman unseated a Democratic incumbent.
 ''This election is not about me,'' Mr. Corzine told a Latino audience recently. ''It's important for your president. It's important for your children and your grandchildren.''
 Still, predicting the role Mr. Obama may personally play in the race is tricky. Mr. Corzine is hoping that the president appears with him in the final days of the campaign for a major rally; the president's advisers say no decision has been made and are wary of tying Mr. Obama too closely to the governor, in case he loses.
 ''You can bet Obama doesn't want this to be seen as a referendum on him,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of The Rothenberg Political Report. ''But he's going to do everything he can to defend a Democratic office, because win or lose, in politics, people are going to read it how they want.''

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Frustration on War And Confusion on Health Plan

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and DALIA SUSSMAN; Megan Thee-Brenan, Marjorie Connelly and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
President Obama is confronting declining support for his handling of the war in Afghanistan and an electorate confused and anxious about a health care overhaul as he prepares for pivotal battles over both issues, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 But Mr. Obama is going into the fall having retained considerable political strength. At 56 percent, his approval rating is down from earlier in the year but still reasonably strong at this point compared with recent presidents.
More Americans are starting to credit his stimulus package with having helped to revive the economy. And Mr. Obama retains a decided advantage with the American public over Republicans on prominent issues, starting with health care.
 The poll found that an intense campaign by Mr. Obama to rally support behind his health care plan -- including an address to Congress, a run of television interviews and rallies across the country -- appears to have done little to allay concerns. 
 Majorities of respondents said that they were confused about the health care argument and that Mr. Obama had not done a good job in explaining what he was trying to accomplish.
 ''The Obama administration seems to have a plan, but I'm not understanding the exact details,'' Paul Corkery, 59, a Democrat from Somerset, N.J., said in a follow-up interview. 
 But the poll suggests that Mr. Obama is in a decidedly more commanding position than Republicans on this issue as Congressional negotiations move into final stages. Most Americans trust Mr. Obama more than Republicans to make the right decisions on the issue; 76 percent said Republicans had not even laid out a clear health care plan.
 And by a lopsided margin, respondents said that Mr. Obama and not Republicans had made an effort to cross party lines and strike a deal that has the support of both parties. Two-thirds of respondents said they wanted Congress to come up with a bill supported by both sides.
 At the same time, there has been a slip in confidence in Mr. Obama's handling of the war in Afghanistan. There is tepid support for maintaining troop strength there, much less increasing it, as his top commander in Afghanistan prepares to submit a request for additional forces. A majority of Americans do not want troops there for more than two years.
 Taken together, the poll reflects the crosscurrents buffeting the president on every major issue. Americans still trust Mr. Obama and seem willing to follow him, particularly in contrast to Republicans. But he is not quite the commanding figure he was in the spring, and his policies do not enjoy the support they once did.
 At 56 percent, Mr. Obama's job approval rating is similar to what President Ronald Reagan's was at this point in his first term (53 percent); President Bill Clinton's was at 43 percent. Still, Mr. Obama's approval is down from 68 percent in the spring. 
 The percentage of people who approve of the way he has dealt with Afghanistan has dropped to 44 percent from 56 percent in April. The percentage of Americans who approve of his handling of the economy, at 50 percent, has dropped from 61 percent since April. In April, Mr. Obama had a 43-point advantage over Republicans in terms of who would make the right decisions on the economy; that has dropped to a 26-point advantage. 
 Americans think the economy is on the mend, and there has been a 15-point increase, to 36 percent, in the percentage of Americans who said Mr. Obama's stimulus package has improved the economy.
 The poll of 1,042 adults was conducted by telephone from Saturday through Wednesday. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. 
 There is evidence of public distaste with Washington that washes across both parties. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said they believed that Republicans in Congress were opposing Mr. Obama's bill only for political gain; just over half said Democrats in Congress backed the bill for political reasons.
 Just 30 percent said they had a favorable view of Republicans in Congress. By contrast, 47 percent said they had a favorable view of Congressional Democrats.
 ''What I hear from the Republicans is that they're just against anything the president has to say,'' said Matt Lee, 48, a Republican from Kona, Hawaii. ''There is just too much division along party lines right now. I don't think the president wants to hear anything the Republicans want to say, but I trust him more because we need change.''
 Mr. Obama was not spared from this sense of jadedness; 56 percent of respondents said they did not expect Mr. Obama to be able to keep his promise not to raise taxes on households making less than $250,000. 
 The poll reflects the challenges facing the White House as it is consumed by two issues, Afghanistan and health care. By a margin of 52 percent to 27 percent, Americans said Mr. Obama has better ideas about overhauling health care than Republicans. And the percentage of Americans who approve of how Mr. Obama has handled health care has gone from 40 percent in August to 47 percent, about equal to where it was earlier in the summer.
 On one of the most contentious issues in the health care debate -- whether to establish a government-run health insurance plan as an alternative to private insurers -- nearly two-thirds of the country continues to favor the proposal, which is backed by Mr. Obama but has drawn intense fire from most Republicans and some moderate Democrats. 
 The poll suggested that Mr. Obama's effort to deal with concerns about the health plan has enjoyed, at best, mixed success. In the poll, 55 percent said Mr. Obama had not clearly explained his plans for changing the health care system, and 59 percent said they thought the health care changes under consideration in Congress were confusing. 
 The fact that so many Americans say they do not know enough about the plan to offer an opinion -- 46 percent -- shows the risk of the White House's strategy of not putting forward its own specific bill. 
 And there is abundant evidence that critics of the bill made progress over the summer while the White House stayed largely silent: about one in four respondents said they believed that health care legislation would create organizations to decide when to stop providing medical care to the elderly -- so-called death panels -- despite an all-out effort by Mr. Obama to debunk the claim, which is false. Three in 10 say the bill would use taxpayer money to provide health care benefits to illegal immigrants.
 In fact, Mr. Obama has specifically rejected any effort to have the bill cover health insurance for illegal immigrants.
 On Afghanistan, more than 50 percent said the war was going somewhat or very badly.

HEADLINE: The Subject Was Nuclear Weapons

 BODY:
With President Obama chairing the session and 13 other leaders around the table, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution on Thursday intended to strengthen the fraying rules that are supposed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. 
 It was a good-news moment. But also a reminder of the past limits of the Security Council's will and effectiveness. In defiance of its orders, North Korea has tested two weapons and Iran continues to churn out nuclear fuel. 
 The resolution commits all member states to a long list of worthy goals, including ratification of the test ban treaty and adoption of stronger national controls on nuclear exports. But some of the countries around the table will have to do a lot more to prove that they mean it. 
 The resolution commits all United Nations members to enforcing current sanctions on Iran and North Korea. But those measures were seriously watered down -- for political and economic reasons -- by Russia and China. Russia's president, Dmitri Medvedev, now says that he might be open to tougher measures on Iran if negotiations fail to bear fruit. China continues to oppose tougher penalties that may be the only chance for constraining Tehran's nuclear ambitions. 
 The resolution set a practical target by urging states to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials within four years. The Security Council broke some new ground by warning that any member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty that secretly develops a weapon and then withdraws from the treaty -- North Korea's route -- will still be held responsible for its violations.
 We wish the Security Council had called for states to end rather than minimize the use of highly enriched uranium -- a potential bomb fuel -- in medical research. And the resolution only encourages, rather than requires, governments to consider whether a state seeking to buy nuclear technology has accepted intrusive United Nations monitoring. 
 Fortunately, there will be opportunities to fine-tune these goals. A conference on nuclear security is scheduled for next April, and two weeks later the United Nations will review the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which has been weakened by Bush-era neglect and Iranian and North Korean violations. 
 We applaud Mr. Obama for highlighting the nuclear dangers out there and pressing the world to address them. He still has a tough sell at home. He is far from the votes he needs for the Senate to ratify the test ban treaty. Some 150 countries have ratified it. But the treaty cannot take effect until other major holdouts -- including China, India, Pakistan and Israel -- also ratify it. 
 Washington's failure gives them an all-too-convenient excuse. Mr. Obama will have to work hard to rally broader support.

HEADLINE: Hyatts Face Protests After Layoffs in Boston Area

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Hyatt Hotels is facing a wave of anger and protests as a result of its decision to lay off 98 members of its housekeeping staff at three Boston area hotels and replace them with lower paid workers. 
 Upset by the layoffs, Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts has called on state employees to boycott Hyatt hotels unless the company reinstates the workers.
 In a letter sent Wednesday to Hyatt's chief executive, Mr. Patrick called what happened ''the worst nightmare of every worker in today's weak economy.'' 
 He added, ''Surely there is some way to retain the jobs for your housekeeping staff, as other hotels have done, and to work with them to help the company meet its current challenges, rather than tossing them out unceremoniously to fend for themselves while the people they trained take their jobs at barely livable wages.''
 The housekeepers generally earned $14 to $16 an hour with health benefits, while their replacements, union and Hyatt officials say, are being paid around $8 an hour without health benefits. Hyatt said it was ''very disappointed'' by Mr. Patrick's boycott threat, saying it endangers the jobs of 600 Hyatt employees in the Boston area.
 ''The difficult decision to outsource the housekeeping function at our Boston properties was made in response to the unprecedented economic challenges those hotels are facing in the current business environment,'' Hyatt said in a statement. ''A precipitous drop in revenues at our Boston hotels has made major cost-cutting measures necessary.''
 The company laid off its housekeeping staff at the Hyatt Regency Boston, Hyatt Regency Cambridge and Hyatt Harborside at Logan International Airport. Hyatt subcontracted the housekeeping work to Hospitality Staffing Solutions of Georgia, which says it provides 4,500 workers to hotels in more than 30 cities.
 Lucine Williams, who had worked at the Hyatt Regency Boston for 22 years, said that when management told the workers they were being laid off late on Aug. 31, they were told that was their last day. 
 ''Everyone was shocked,'' she said. ''A lot of people were crying.'' 
 Ms. Williams also said management had told the housekeepers to train the Staffing Solutions workers because those workers might fill in for them when they were on vacation or out sick. 
 Serandou Kamara, a refugee from Sierra Leone who worked at the Hyatt Harborside for five years, said that several days before the layoffs, management told the housekeepers to empty their lockers because the lockers were going to be cleaned.
 ''They kick us out without notice on our last day of work,'' Ms. Kamara said. ''The way they treat us was like animals.''
 Hyatt executives called accusations that its employees were deceived ''absolutely false'' and said ''the hotels in Boston have treated their housekeepers with fairness and dignity.'' 
 The company has extended the laid-off workers' health benefits to the end of the year and has set up a task force to help them in other ways.
 Although the three Boston-area Hyatts are nonunion, the hotel workers' union Unite Here has become involved in the dispute, saying several laid-off workers had asked it for help. 
 To step up pressure on Hyatt, the union arranged for a laid-off housekeeper, Angela Norena, to fly to Chicago on Thursday and appeal to Penny Pritzker, who was national finance chairman of President Obama's campaign last year and whose family is Hyatt's principal owner. 
 More than 150 hotel workers and their supporters were arrested on Thursday afternoon in front of the Park Hyatt in Chicago as they demonstrated in support of the workers in Boston.

HEADLINE: Billionaires at Play: Mike Versus Mikhail

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON; C. J. Hughes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
New York's reigning billionaire, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, cares little for most sports but plays a lot of golf. He likes discreet dinner parties at Gracie Mansion or his own mansion. He wants his private life kept private.
 New York's latest billionaire, Mikhail D. Prokhorov, loves basketball, kickboxing and skiing. He probably wishes his private life could be kept private: Consider the four days he spent in custody in an Alpine ski resort in 2007 when investigators suspected call girls were being brought in. He was quoted as saying they were students and models, not prostitutes. 
 So maybe the incumbent billionaire Mike and the new billionaire Mike, the Russian oligarch who is poised to become the principal owner of the New Jersey Nets and a major investor in the team's proposed arena in Brooklyn, will feast upon New York in different ways. 
 Billionaires will be billionaires. Both men have their own private jets and their own charitable foundations. 
 Mr. Bloomberg is richer, Mr. Prokhorov taller. Mr. Prokhorov's height has been reported as being anywhere from 6-feet-6 to 6-feet-9. Mr. Bloomberg's height has been reported as being anywhere from 5-feet-6 (in news articles) to 5-feet-10 (on his driver's license). 
 Mr. Prokhorov may be the richest person in Russia, but Mr. Bloomberg is ahead of him on the Forbes list of the world's billionaires. In March, Forbes ranked the mayor at No. 17, with a net worth of $16 billion. Mr. Prokhorov was No. 40, with a net worth of $9.5 billion.
 Mr. Prokhorov is sometimes referred to as ''Russia's most eligible bachelor.'' Mr. Bloomberg has been divorced since 1993.
 On his first job at Salomon Brothers, Mr. Bloomberg stripped to his underwear. He was working in a sweltering bank vault, counting stock and bond certificates, and it was hot.
 By some accounts, Mr. Prokhorov's early career involved selling jeans in Moscow in the late 1980s. He was also led the management board of the International Bank for Economic Cooperation. Later he moved into metals. 
 He has the cash to buy the Nets because he unloaded his stake in the world's largest producer of nickel and the silvery metal palladium in the spring. And Mr. Prokhorov could be a good fit for the Nets, according to players at the courts at West Third Street and Avenue of the Americas in Greenwich Village. For one thing, a Russian team he partly owns, CSKA Moscow, is a regular winner, they said. And having someone who knows the game could lead to better hiring decisions for the Nets.
 But could Mr. Prokhorov survive on the West Third Street courts? Maybe. 
 ''Height don't matter here,'' said Eric Chambers, 39, of Hunts Point in the Bronx, who goes by the nickname Butter and says he has played at the West Third Street courts almost every day for 22 years. ''You have to be a gladiator to play here.''
 Jack Ryan, 48, of Park Slope, Brooklyn -- who appears in halftime shows at professional basketball games, spinning balls on his fingertips -- jabbed a thumb in Mr. Chambers's direction and said, ''I would rather have a 6-foot-9 inch guy cover me than him.''
 Off the courts, Mr. Prokhorov likes partying. (Not that Mr. Bloomberg is antiparty. ''I like to go out and party,'' he said in his autobiography, ''Bloomberg, by Bloomberg,'' in explaining why his marriage unraveled.) 
 There are those who say the restaurants that oligarchs frequent in Moscow out-Vegas Las Vegas. This raises a question: Is New York ready for an oligarch like Mr. Prokhorov?
 ''Absolutely,'' said Mark Yackow, the manager of the hosts at Scores New York on West 28th Street. (The hosts look after ''the high rollers.'')
 ''If he said, 'I'd like to have my own area here,' we'd rope it off,'' Mr. Yackow said. ''We'd have a security person by the rope, and that person, his assignment is to make sure he's treated like a king. Hopefully the girls do their job and get him into a private room, and then the security job is a lot easier.''
 He was quick to add that is not what it sounds like: ''All the private rooms have doors; there are no locks on the doors. We send the waitresses in every 15 minutes, make sure everything is good.''
 Mr. Prokhorov could try the National, a nightclub in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. ''The floor show is surreal,'' someone who identified herself as Sadie S. wrote on the restaurant review site Yelp.com. ''Showgirls, drag queens, cover bands, 20 costume changes and a cast of thousands!''
 Or Mr. Prokhorov could head for the Russian Tea Room, on West 57th Street, which serves $25 cavitinis made with vodka, a cucumber and caviar. ''The caviar is, like, floating on the cucumber,'' said Ken Biberaj, the restaurant's vice president.
 How many cavitinis would the bartenders serve Mr. Prokhorov?
 ''That's completely up to him,'' Mr. Biberaj said. ''I don't know the math to calculate how many cavitinis he could afford, but for what he's paying, he could buy everybody in New York one.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 28, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday comparing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, New York's richest man, to Mikhail D. Prokhorov, a Russian oligarch who is about to become the principal owner of the New Jersey Nets, misstated Mr. Prokhorov's net worth. It is $9.5 billion, not $9.5 million.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Increase in Aid For Pakistan

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The United States Senate on Thursday approved legislation to triple nonmilitary aid to Pakistan to about $1.5 billion a year for the next five years as part of a plan to fight extremism. 
 President Obama had urged passage of the measure to promote stability in Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country that is essential to the efforts by NATO to stabilize neighboring Afghanistan, despite concerns that the Pakistan military may support some extremist Islamic groups.
 Mr. Obama got word of the vote while in New York, and he announced it at a meeting of nations that offer aid to Pakistan that took place on the sidelines of the opening session of the United NationsGeneral Assembly. The announcement drew applause.
 ''It was the only spontaneous applause of the meeting,'' said Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, who called the vote ''a big step forward.''
 The bill, approved on a voice vote, had been agreed to by Senate and House sponsors of legislation passed during the summer. The measure is expected to be approved soon by the House.
 Mr. Obama had also proposed creating ''reconstruction opportunity zones'' in border areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan, from which goods could be exported duty-free to the United States. But this was not part of the compromise reached on Thursday.
 Pakistan has been struggling to stem a surge of violence by militant Islamic groups and to bolster an economy that is being kept afloat by foreign donations and a $11.3 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.

HEADLINE: Volcker Says Obama Plan Leaves Opening for Bailouts

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Paul A. Volcker, a top White House economic adviser, said Thursday that the Obama administration's proposed overhaul of financial rules would preserve the policy of ''too big to fail'' and could lead to future banking bailouts. 
 Mr. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress that by designating some companies as critical to the broader financial system, the administration's plans would create an expectation that those companies enjoy government backing in tough times. That implies those financial companies ''will be sheltered by access to a federal safety net,'' he said.
 He urged lawmakers to make clear that nonbank companies would not be saved with federal money.
 Emergency measures by the Fed, Treasury and Congress during last year's financial crisis created the expectation that the government would step in to protect failing companies, their bond holders and stockholders, Mr. Volcker said at a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee.
 Mr. Volcker said he did not differ with the administration on most of its proposals and that he took ''as a given'' that banks would be bailed out in times of crisis.
 But he said he opposed bailouts of insurance companies like the American International Group, the automakers' finance arms and others.
 ''The safety net has been extended outside the banking system,'' Mr. Volcker said. ''That's what I want to change.'' He said the administration's proposal to create a new system for winding down large nonbank companies would make that easier.
 The administration should make it clearer that a ''safety net'' would apply only to commercial banks, not investment companies or others. Investors must understand that if a nonbank company fails, stockholders and bondholders' money will be at risk, he added. He did, however, endorse other options for these companies, including forced mergers or liquidation.
 In recent speeches, Mr. Volcker has expressed little enthusiasm for some of the initiatives under discussion in Washington, including regulating bankers' compensation. He has said there is ''ample justification'' for public anger at pay practices that were ''wildly excessive'' and encouraged risk-taking at the expense of stability. But he warned against too much political involvement.
 In his appearance before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday, Mr. Volcker endorsed a stricter separation between banks that hold deposits and investment banks. He said the ''safety net'' should be limited clearly to commercial banks, while investment banks should be excluded.
 The House committee is leading the effort to pass Mr. Obama's financial overhaul. Its chairman, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, agreed on Wednesday to scale down a pillar of the financial overhaul -- a new regulator to protect consumers from unsafe financial products and activities.
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner endorsed the less ambitious plans, which would exempt retailers and other nonbank companies from oversight.
 Mr. Frank and Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, say they will have a bill on financial regulation ready for the president's signature by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: China Opposes Iran Sanctions Sought by U.S.

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
China will not support increased sanctions on Iran as a way to curb its nuclear program, a government spokeswoman said Thursday. 
 Although China has generally opposed the use of sanctions, the announcement is sure to complicate President Obama's efforts to impose tougher penalties on Iran, should international talks over Tehran's nuclear ambitions, scheduled for Oct. 1, fail to make headway. 
 ''We always believe that sanctions and pressure are not the way out,'' said Jiang Yu, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, during a news conference. ''At present, it is not conducive to diplomatic efforts.''
 On Wednesday, the White House savored success after Russia, a longtime opponent of economic sanctions, said it would consider tough new sanctions against Iran.
 As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, China has veto power over any decision by the body to impose sanctions. 
 Iran has indicated that any discussion of its nuclear program will be off the table during next week's talks in Geneva, which will include the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.
 Although he has pledged to engage the Iranians diplomatically, Mr. Obama has been pushing for a new round of sanctions that might persuade Iran to come back to the negotiating table. 
 Iran has denied that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons, saying its efforts to enrich uranium are for a civilian nuclear energy program.
 Despite its stated antipathy to sanctions, Beijing has shown some willingness to make exceptions. In June, China voted to approve a package of financial and trade restrictions aimed at punishing North Korea for its launch of ballistic missiles and the detonation of a nuclear device. Aside from a ban on arms exports, however, the sanctions, more recommendations than requirements, have been widely seen as ineffective.

HEADLINE: Slyly, Giuliani Says He Feels For Paterson

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
He just could not resist.
 Rudolph W. Giuliani, the subject of fevered speculation about whether he will run for governor, was asked on Thursday what he thought of President Obama's efforts to discourage Gov. David A. Paterson from seeking election in 2010. ''Oh gosh,'' Mr. Giuliani said, a sly grin on his face. ''I don't interfere in Democratic politics when I shouldn't.'' 
 Then he proceeded to do just that.
 ''The president hasn't advised me on what I should do, nor has he told me I shouldn't run,'' Mr. Giuliani went on, a detectible hint of schadenfreude in his voice. ''So I'm free and clear to make my own decision.''
 Mr. Giuliani then observed that Mr. Obama's involvement in the governor's race had certainly put Mr. Paterson in a tough spot: 
 ''That's an awful lot of pressure to put on a governor, the president of the United States telling you not to run for office.'' 
 Mr. Giuliani, who spoke to reporters near the United Nations after delivering remarks at a Jewish Community Relations Council rally, then went on to offer his thoughts on Mr. Paterson's unpopularity. The governor, Mr. Giuliani said, had been reckless with the state's finances and had no one to blame but himself for his political problems.
 ''I think some of the governor's actions have caused this, too,'' he said. ''Increasing spending by 9 percent. I mean, you just don't do that in the middle of a recession. You shouldn't increase spending at 9 percent ever, probably.''
 The possibility that Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor, will run for governor has touched off excitement among state Republicans and generated concern within the Obama administration, which is nervous about losing Democratic governorships and seats in Congress.
 Indeed, the threat posed by Mr. Giuliani was one of the major reasons the administration approached Mr. Paterson to encourage him to bow out of the race for governor next year. Mr. Giuliani said on Thursday that he would decide whether to run in November.

HEADLINE: New Signs That Recovery May Come in Dribs and Drabs

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
New figures on home sales and manufacturing activity suggested on Friday that economic recovery was likely to occur in fits and starts because of high unemployment, a mercurial stock market and shaky consumer demand. 
 ''It's not going to be smooth,'' said Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group, who is expecting a strong rebound. ''We will be moving three steps forward and one step back. But on the whole, I expect this recovery's going to be moving upward.''
 Reports on Friday showed that consumer sentiment rose this week to its highest levels since the start of 2008 and that new-home sales edged up for a fifth consecutive month, but other barometers of the economy revealed uncertainties.
 Orders for goods like airplanes and machinery fell unexpectedly in August, the government reported on Friday, showing that the manufacturing sector was still fragile. 
 New orders for durable goods slid by a seasonally adjusted 2.4 percent from July, reflecting a 40 percent monthly decrease in orders of civilian aircraft. Orders for computers, electrical equipment and transportation equipment all fell, and shipments of all durable goods slipped 1.4 percent for the month. 
 Over all, orders for durable goods were down 25 percent from a year earlier. But excluding the transportation sector, durable goods orders were flat in August.
 Still, the report was the second signal of economic weakness in two days, and fell short of economists' forecasts for a gain of 0.4 percent. On Thursday, a real estate industry group reported that sales of previously owned homes -- which dominate the housing market -- fell in August after several months of gains. Although Friday's report on new-home sales showed a gain, it was less than economists had expected.
 ''We expect a very sluggish recovery,'' said Cliff Waldman, an economist at the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI. ''It's more than just a downturn. You had a collapse in the housing market, and a near collapse in the financial system.''
 Factories and industrial businesses have gradually been ramping up production and hiring part-time workers in some areas as they begin rebuilding their depleted inventories. Most economists say they believe the economy has now technically pulled out of recession, and are expecting businesses to expand in the second half of the year.
 Still, that recovery is likely to be jagged, marked by high unemployment and questions about whether consumer or business spending will bounce back or remain subdued. 
 The Commerce Department reported on Friday that sales of new homes rose 0.7 percent in August, hitting their highest level in almost a year. Sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 429,000, largely because home sales increased the West.
 The median price of a new home fell to $195,200, from $215,600 a month earlier.
 Meanwhile, a Reuters-University of Michigan survey showed that consumer sentiment rose in September as consumers said they were growing more optimistic about the economy's progress and the employment picture heading forward. The index of sentiment rose to 73.5, from 65.7 in August.

HEADLINE: A Rich Uncle Is Picking Up the Borrowing Slack

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris

 BODY:
THE United States government is borrowing money like never before. The national debt rose by more than a third over a one-year period, far more than it ever did at any time since World War II.
 In the past, when the government became a heavy borrower, there was talk about crowding out private borrowers. But this time, interest rates have remained low and no one seems to be worried about that.
 The reason is simple: Rather than crowding out the private sector, Uncle Sam is now standing in for it. Much of the government borrowing went to investments in financial institutions needed to keep them alive. Other hundreds of billions went to a variety of programs aimed at stimulating the private economy, including programs that effectively had the government pick up part of the cost for some home buyers and some auto buyers. 
 This week, the Federal Reserve published its quarterly report on debt levels in the economy. While Uncle Sam borrowed more, others borrowed less. The accompanying chart shows that total domestic debt -- the amounts owed by individuals, governments and businesses -- climbed just 3.7 percent from the second quarter of 2008 through the second quarter of this year. That is the smallest increase since the Fed started these calculations in the early 1950s.
 Moreover, domestic debt declined in the second quarter, falling 0.3 percent to $50.8 trillion. The figures are not seasonally adjusted, making quarter-to-quarter comparisons risky, but it was the first such decline since the first quarter of 1954, when total debt was less than $500 billion.
 Over the 12-month period, nonfinancial businesses increased their debt by just 1.3 percent. Since that number is well below the interest rate most of those companies pay, it indicates that they paid back more in old loans than they took out in new ones.
 Until this recession, the idea that American individuals would ever cut their overall debt levels seemed as likely as an August snowfall in Miami. But that was before the bottom fell out of the housing market, something that Florida condo developers had considered to be equally unlikely.
 Over the year, total household debt fell by 1.7 percent, and mortgage debt -- the largest component of household debt -- fell a bit more, at a 1.8 percent pace. This is the 10th recession since the Fed began collecting the numbers, but the first in which the amount of home mortgage debt fell. Some of that decline, of course, came from foreclosures that canceled debt and left lenders with big losses.
 For most of the last two decades, the biggest increase in debt in America came from financial companies. Much of that debt came from financial innovation rather than actual economic activity. Once, a homeowner took out a mortgage, and household debt increased. But by early this decade, the mortgage could be used to secure a mortgage-backed security, and the mortgage-backed security could be used to secure a collateralized debt obligation. Those last two loans counted as financial obligations. There was no more real economic activity, but there was a lot more borrowing.
 In some cases, the newly created financial debt was guaranteed only by the underlying assets -- like the home mortgage. But other financial borrowing became the equivalent of government debt, at least as seen by the lenders. That was because the money was either borrowed by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae, or guaranteed by them or by government agencies.
 Such debts rose at a 10.2 percent rate over the last two decades. Debt issued by financial companies without such guarantees rose even faster, at a 10.6 percent rate. By contrast, the debt of nonfinancial businesses climbed at a rate of 5.9 percent.
 Twenty years ago, nonfinancial businesses in the United States borrowed $1.70 for every dollar borrowed by the financial sector, government-guaranteed or not. Now the figure is 68 cents.

HEADLINE: Weakness in Housing Puts Investors on Defensive

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Weaker readings on the housing market and manufacturing orders pulled Wall Street lower for a third consecutive session on Friday.
 Investors who previously cheered indicators of an economic rebound got a more measured view this week: sales of previously owned homes fell in August after four months of gains, and sales of new homes edged up less than expected. In addition, new orders for aircraft, computers and other durable goods slipped, defying expectations for another month of gains.
 Taken together, the figures suggested that Wall Street might have bet too heavily that a swift economic rebound would continue to lift stocks. 
 ''We're transitioning from recession into growth, and that growth's going to be very tepid,'' said Stephen P. Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investments. ''It's certainly not going to be a V-shaped recovery. We've seen a little bit of softness in the market, but markets don't tend to move in straight lines in any direction.'' The Dow Jones industrial average sank 42.25 points, or 0.44 percent, to 9,665.19, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 6.4 points, or 0.61 percent, at 1,044.38. 
 The Nasdaq composite index, which has climbed more than 30 percent since the start of the year, slipped 16.69 points, or 0.79 percent, to 2,090.92, on losses in technology companies like Research In Motion, maker of the BlackBerry. Shares of Research In Motion, which has faced stiff competition from Apple's iPhone and the Palm Pre, fell $14.15, or 17 percent, to close at $68.91 after its sales forecast missed expectations. 
 The Dow fell more than 150 points this week and the S.& P. 500 shed 2 percent, as some investors speculated that stocks had raced too far ahead of an economic recovery that was still just beginning. 
 Stocks have surged since early March, when they hit their lowest levels in more than a decade before pivoting into a blazing rally. The Dow is up more than 3,000 points from its lows, and the rally has breathed life into the share prices of struggling companies like Bank of America and the American International Group, the government-controlled insurance giant.
 But with unemployment nearing 10 percent and consumers still restrained, analysts have warned that corporate profits could show anemic growth in the quarters ahead.
 On Friday, investors were playing defensively, buying shares of companies that tend to be more insulated during recessions and walking away from those that rise and fall with economic cycles. Shares of health care providers, basic consumer products and utilities were slightly higher, while industrial producers, retailers and financial shares slipped.
 Investors continued to push the market for Treasury debt higher, choosing a conservative investment that would act as a safe harbor if the stock market took a turn for the worse or the economy continued to struggle. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 17/32, to 102 18/32, and the yield fell to 3.32 percent, from 3.38 percent late Thursday. Analysts say that investors are making cautious bets as the Federal Reserve begins to discuss winding down some of its financial stability programs, like the one to buy $300 billion in Treasury securities, or a $1.45 trillion program to buy mortgage-backed securities. 
 ''The market thinks if the Fed were to start to pull the life support away, the recovery's not going to be all that sustainable,'' said Martin Mitchell, head of government bond trading at Stifel Nicolaus. ''Yields stay low in that environment.''

HEADLINE: Russian's Stake in Nets Seems to Be a Bargain

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Since buying the Nets in 2004 and immediately planning to move them from New Jersey to a new arena in Brooklyn, Bruce C. Ratner has entertained a tantalizing, if risky, vision of marrying basketball to real estate. 
 But after absorbing enormous financial losses and enduring lengthy regulatory and legal delays, Ratner, a real estate developer, needed a safety net to preserve part of that dream. He has found it in the Russian billionaire Mikhail D. Prokhorov, who earlier this week announced his agreement to buy 80 percent of the team and 45 percent of Barclays Center, the Nets' proposed home in Brooklyn.
 Although Prokhorov's cash investment was announced at $200 million, he will also finance future Nets losses, up to $60 million, that are expected to accumulate before the move to Brooklyn, according to an executive involved in the transaction. The team has reported nearly $400 million in pretax net losses for its dozens of investors, including $129 million by Forest City Enterprises, Ratner's Cleveland-based parent company. 
 Prokhorov will also be responsible for 80 percent of the $207 million in debt the team holds if the sale goes forward. The transaction requires the approval of 23 of the 30 National Basketball Association owners, and is contingent on Ratner's obtaining financing for the arena and control of all the land required for it by Dec. 31.
 Prokhorov's arrival helps Ratner do what he ultimately wants most: build the delayed arena, the centerpiece of the $4.9 billion Atlantic Yards commercial and residential complex near downtown Brooklyn.
 He appears to be getting a good deal. Ratner and his investors paid $300 million for the team in 2004 and assumed salary obligations of another $60 million. Prokhorov's purchase of an 80 percent stake in the team values its equity at about $150 million; add the $207 million in debt, and the franchise's value has barely budged.
 The value has not swelled, as it might have for a team in the New York market, because of the huge losses, the team's lack of recent on-court success and its inability to attract big crowds to its home, the Izod Center in East Rutherford, N.J. The Brooklyn arena has not demonstrated its full earnings potential.
 ''The Russian is taking on a lot more risk for the potential of greater reward,'' said Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp, a Chicago-based sports consultant. ''He's getting a good deal on the team, but he's taking on a great deal of risk with the arena and with debt.''
 Ratner is planning to sell nearly $700 million in debt to finance the arena, 45 percent of which Prokhorov will be responsible for. (Forest City, Ratner's company, was the development partner for the Manhattan headquarters of The New York Times Company.)
 Prokhorov, one of the wealthiest men in Russia, came to Ratner's attention in June and arrives at a good time for both Ratner and the N.B.A. 
 The dollar is weak and some team owners stung by the recession have been eager to sell. 
 ''On a macro level, the N.B.A. has a few teams in trouble,'' said Michael Ozanian, national editor of Forbes, who was referring to the Nets, the Charlotte Bobcats and the Memphis Grizzlies, among others. ''The more time went on, the more Ratner was dealing from weakness.''
 The Prokhorov deal could turn out to be good news for other owners trying to sell teams because it could pave the way for more wealthy foreign investors to buy American sports teams, driving up the value of teams. 
 ''As we see more foreign owners, you have enhanced global demand for teams and it bodes well for teams to have more potential suitors,'' said David Carter, an assistant professor at the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California.
 Foreign ownership of franchises is nothing new in Europe, but it is relatively rare in professional sports in the United States. Hiroshi Yamauchi, a former executive at Nintendo, the Japanese game maker, is majority owner of the Seattle Mariners. His purchase of that baseball team more than a decade ago set off alarm bells.
 In May, a group of Chinese investors agreed to buy 15 percent of the Cleveland Cavaliers and Quicken Loans Arena, but because it is a minority stake in a healthy team with a star -- LeBron James -- and a relatively new arena, it raised little attention. The N.B.A. has not yet approved the deal.
 Having a Russian owner also bolsters the N.B.A.'s grander ambitions overseas, where the league is trying to market its licensed goods and television rights, said Rob Tilliss, who helped Ratner buy the Nets before he founded Inner Circle Sports, which advises sports, media and entertainment companies.
 ''Bud Selig has the World Baseball Classic, Roger Goodell wants a team in London, the National Hockey League is playing games in the Czech Republic and Scandinavia, and David Stern is in China,'' Tilliss said. ''This is another step in a natural progression.''
 One potential loser is the Knicks, whose owners at Cablevision are spending more than $500 million to refurbish Madison Square Garden. The team traded away its most expensive players to make it easier to pursue a big-name star like James when he becomes a free agent after next season.
 Prokhorov's presence and cash could stoke a heated rivalry with the Knicks that might not have existed if the debt-laden Ratner still owned the Nets.

HEADLINE: If Not Passion for the Job, At Least Warm Feelings

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND. 
E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IF there is one word I'm rapidly growing tired of, it's passion. Not the sex and love type, but the workplace kind. Lately, it seems, I keep hearing career counselors advising the unemployed to identify and develop their passion. Then they need to turn that passion into paid work and presto! They're now in a career they love.
 I know I'm being somewhat flippant, but I do wonder if passion is being oversold. Are we falling into a trap of believing that our work, and indeed, our lives, should always be fascinating and all-consuming? Are we somehow lacking if we're bored at times or buried under routine tasks or failing to challenge ourselves at every turn?
 Now before I go any further, I know, I know. In these economic times, fewer of us are worried about being fulfilled and more of us are concerned about simply being paid. But as switching jobs and careers becomes increasingly common, as whole professions are disappearing, we're more frequently forced to ask ourselves what we want to do with the rest of our lives. 
 That's where passion comes in.
 So first of all, what is it? I turned to Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the director of the Quality of Life Research Center at Claremont Graduate University in California, who has looked at the idea, though he calls it ''flow.'' 
 ''It's a state of complete involvement,'' said Professor Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced CHECK-sent-me-high), who first wrote about this in his book ''Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience'' (Harper & Row, 1990). It's when we're totally immersed in our activity, not watching the clock, not thinking of what others think, but simply absorbed in the experience. He first studied it, he said, in relation to activities people chose freely, like chess players, rock climbers and musicians, then later in terms of work and everyday life.
 Although Professor Csikszentmihalyi says he does not believe that people can constantly be in a state of flow, he has written a great deal about how it can be encouraged in the workplace and elsewhere. While he outlines a number of factors needed to feel good about your job or life, two of the major ones are a sense of personal control over a situation or activity and a balance between one's ability and potential so the endeavor is neither too easy nor too hard.
 Peter Warr, an emeritus professor at the Institute of Work Psychology at the University of Sheffield in England, builds on this concept. He talks about the ''needed nine,'' or the main external sources of happiness and unhappiness, not just in work but in life.
 These include, he says, having some sense of empowerment, using and expanding your skills, enjoying some variety, having a clear sense of your situation and what is required, and doing something you believe in, as a worker, a parent or a member of your community.
 Professor Warr, who co-wrote the book ''The Joy of Work? Jobs, Happiness and You'' (Routledge, 2009), added three factors for the workplace: supportive supervision, job security and the possibility of promotion, and fair treatment.
 He acknowledges that it is not easy to attain these goals, especially now. But it can still make a difference in your job satisfaction, he says, to examine what your strengths and needs are, and try, as much as possible, to match your work with those attributes. It doesn't always mean getting a new job or career, but perhaps changing some things in your current employment.
 ''You might need to shift a wee bit for more goodies,'' he said.
 It would probably be better, Professor Warr suggested, to think less in terms of passion, and the inflated sense of drama that can go with that, and more in terms of job satisfaction or finding meaning in your work.
 The drive for passion or excitement, or whatever you call it, is deep in our genes. We feel good when the neurotransmitter dopamine is activated, and that's what happens when we accomplish a given goal, said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University. In fact, playing video games may not seem to be much of a passion, but if you've ever watched teenage boys going at it, their intensity and obliviousness to the outside world is the epitome of flow. And that's no accident.
 ''The way to be happy in life is to set a series of achievable goals,'' Professor Marcus said. ''That's why video games are so attractive to human beings -- because they're structured to offer incrementally more difficult goals.''
 So if playing video games offers all that, is it as legitimate a passion as running marathons or taking up the violin or becoming a doctor? (I am not posing this question to my sons, by the way.) 
 Not really, Professor Marcus said, because one has to look at the skills and the knowledge you are gaining, say 10 years down the line. It's not just about short-term gratification, but long-term goals.
 And this is as true in the workplace as anywhere else. Figuring out what you want to do and the steps you need to take -- even if the process will take years -- is ''a conversation you need to have with yourself,'' said Anat Lechner, an associate professor of management and organizations at the Stern School of Business at New York University. 
 Lifetime employment, where the company took care of you and your needs, is pretty much a thing of the past, she said. ''If you don't define yourself and don't have a good sense of self, you're going to get lost.''
 But there is a fine balance between telling people to chase their dreams and encouraging them to set realistic goals. Byron Wolt, who speaks on a variety of topics to high school seniors, said, ''It's false to just throw out there that you should love what you do.'' He added: ''I love what I do, but, for example, I had to drive two hours today to get home, and I don't love that. What I found is that if you love what you do, what you don't love about it isn't so bad.''
 He said it was like telling people that money was not important.
 ''Of course, it's important,'' he said. ''Now if you want to say money's not the only thing, then that's fine.''
 Lawler Kang, who wrote the book ''Passion at Work: How to Find Work You Love and Live the Time of Your Life'' (Prentice Hall, 2005), estimates that ''if 85 percent of what you're looking for is there, that's great.''
 So maybe searching for a passion is not so bad. But it is also important to remember that there is no one way to find it, and someone else's passion may be your idea of drudgery. And sometimes life -- and work -- is simply going to be putting one foot in front of the other. Or as Professor Warr said, ''On the way to happiness, there must be unhappiness.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Helicopter Halts Shuttle Service to J.F.K. and Newark

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Scheduled helicopter service between two heliports in Manhattan and two major airports that serve New York City abruptly shut down on Friday.
 U.S. Helicopter, which started up 3 1/2 years ago, provided the first shuttle service since the 1980s from Manhattan to a commercial airport. It was charging as much as $159 each way for an eight-minute trip between one of the heliports -- the Downtown Manhattan Heliport, near Wall Street, and the East 34th Street Heliport -- and Kennedy International or Newark Liberty International Airports. 
 The company had been struggling financially and borrowing frequently at high rates of interest to cover its costs. In a message on its Web site, U.S. Helicopter said the ''stand-down'' would be temporary.
 ''We're doing a financing, and the financing isn't complete yet,'' Donal McSullivan, a senior vice president of the company, said in a brief interview. ''There's no bankruptcy here. We're just getting our act together.''
 He responded to other questions by referring to the Web site message, which said, ''We are temporarily halting all service as we regroup to add aircraft to our fleet and introduce new routes.'' It added, ''We plan to return to the skies of New York -- a bigger and better airline -- by late November.''
 Last November, the service suffered a costly disruption at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport. That temporary shutdown, which lasted about five months, was caused by the city's decision to hire a small company, FirstFlight, to succeed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as the heliport's operator. FirstFlight's security plan for the heliport was not approved by the federal Transportation Security Administration for several weeks, and a stalemate over a rent increase prolonged the interruption.

HEADLINE: Before German Vote, Qaeda Threatens Europe on War

BYLINE: By SOUAD MEKHENNET

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
In a new recording, the leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, urged European nations on Friday to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan, with a veiled threat of reprisals and an allusion to past bombings in Madrid and London.
 The message came as European nations, and particularly Germany, have come under increasing public and political pressures to reconsider their part in the Afghan war. 
 Germany has 4,200 troops in Afghanistan, and domestic pressure to rethink its mission has mounted since its forces called in a NATO airstrike this month that left scores of Afghans dead. 
 For Germany, the message, which was posted online, was the fourth in recent days purporting to come from Al Qaeda, raising concerns of a terrorist attack and placing German security officials on high alert. 
 The recording released on Friday, though addressed to Europeans generally, seemed directed at Germany, coming before parliamentary elections on Sunday and with both English and German subtitles.
 Its release also coincided with a request from the American commander in charge of Afghan operations, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal for more soldiers and resources. 
 The recording was posted in password-protected jihadist forums and produced by ''as-Sahab,'' Al Qaeda's media arm. A copy was obtained by The New York Times.
 In it, a voice playing over Mr. bin Laden's picture says that it is a matter of justice for Europeans to stop assisting the ''oppression'' of Afghans. 
 Europeans would ''understand the causes of the bloody events in Madrid and London,'' it says, if they were to see what the United States and its allies have done in Afghanistan. 
 A series of bombs on a train in Madrid killed 191 people in 2004, and four suicide bombers on the London mass transportation system killed 52 other people in 2005.
 ''You are aware that oppression topples those who commit it and injustice has unhealthy consequences for the unjust,'' the recording says. It accuses European soldiers of killing women and children under the NATO mandate. ''So on what basis are you violating what you talk about holding in high esteem, like justice and human rights?'' the speaker asks.
 ''If today Europe is suffering the travails of the economic crisis, and the heart of Europe is no longer No. 1 in world exports, and America is reeling from the hemorrhage caused by the economic war,'' he says, ''then how do you think you will fare after America pulls out, Allah permitting, for us to retaliate from the oppressor on behalf of the oppressed?''
 In recent days, a Qaeda operative, Bekkay Harrach, a German citizen of Moroccan descent, released three videos warning Germans of a rude awakening if they do not withdraw from the Afghan war after the elections on Sunday. 
 Mr. Harrach -- clean shaven, with shoulder-length black hair and wearing a suit and tie -- addressed the message to the German people. In previous videos he wore a robe and covered his face. 
 He spoke in German and said that in a democracy people decide who will govern for them and can order soldiers home. ''If the German people choose war, then they have delivered their own sentence,'' he said. 
 He warned Muslims in Germany to avoid public places for the two weeks after the election, if parties in favor of keeping German soldiers in Afghanistan won. 
 On Friday a group that said it belonged to the Taliban released a video in which a German speaker threatened Germany. He accused German soldiers of killing innocent Afghans in the airstrike this month.
 German security officials said they thought the Taliban and Al Qaeda had coordinated their threats. 
 ''We are very worried and all our security forces are on high alert,'' said a senior security official, who did not want to be identified because of the delicacy of the matter. The official said that ''the fact that bin Laden's message was published with a German subtitle is underlining that we have to take it seriously.'' 
 The official added that foreign intelligence agencies, including American, Israeli and Arab, told Germany ''the threat is serious.''
 ''The Germans are very up on Al Qaeda's list because of their troops in Afghanistan,'' an Arab intelligence official said. ''If I were them, I would be very worried.'' 
 In an official travel alert on Wednesday, the State Department warned United States citizens about the threats. 
 Meanwhile, Germany has stepped up security at airports and train stations and in the city centers for the weekend. 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 8, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 26 about a recorded Al Qaeda warning to European nations that they could face violent reprisals similar to the 2004 transit bombing in Madrid and 2005 transit bombing in London if they did not withdraw their troops from Afghanistan misstated the number of trains targeted in the Madrid attack, which killed 191 people. It was four, not one.

HEADLINE: Amid a Citywide Slump, a Local Exception

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
Through the building frenzy that transformed some of the city's long-neglected patches into lustrous new neighborhoods, few frontiers struggled to reap the benefits of gentrification more than working-class Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. 
 Prices of homes rose, but never as much as in Fort Greene. Its long-neglected brownstones attracted renovators from Manhattan, but often only after they were priced out of Park Slope. While cafes and boutiques opened, the pace never matched that of Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg.
 But as progress in more prosperous neighborhoods has halted, Bedford-Stuyvesant is showing signs of the economic life it has longed for: A handful of new upscale shops have appeared along Lewis Avenue in recent months, including a florist shop owned by a former Wall Street worker, which opened in March, and a trattoria run by a Manhattan restaurateur, in June. 
 This month, Bed-Stuy welcomed Therapy Wine Bar, which its owner, Angela Terry, says is the first in the neighborhood. 
 ''This is my life savings,'' Ms. Terry said as she sat in the back garden of the bar, which opened on Sept. 19. A school social worker who bought a brownstone in the area a decade ago, Ms. Terry borrowed from her pension to finance the bar. In addition to the younger wine drinkers who have moved in, she hopes to attract local mothers after story time at nearby Brownstone Books and teachers in local schools. ''This is the hard part,'' she said of the opening. ''This is the test.''
 The catalysts for the sudden influx are complex and overlapping. Store rents are still cheaper than in other Brooklyn neighborhoods, which is especially important now that bank financing is harder to come by. There is also a hunger for new shops and restaurants, especially from many of the new residents.
 Ms. Terry decided to start a business after she found out that the local school where she worked was closing; in the summer of 2008, she rented a storefront on Lewis Avenue and started renovating. 
 She can relate to her neighbors with less job security -- and with less to splurge on luxuries like pinot noir: In the worsening economy, she has also taken a job at another nearby school.
 Meanwhile, Bedford-Stuyvesant has been hit hard by the recession, frequently ranking among the city's top 15 neighborhoods in the number of preforeclosures, according to PropertyShark.com. In July and August, the values of home sales dropped by 14 percent, and the volume of deals dropped by 48 percent compared to the same period last year, according to the HMS Associates, a real estate appraisal and consulting company in Brooklyn. 
 By contrast, Park Slope's sales prices dropped by 8 percent in the same period, and its sales volume decline by 19 percent. 
 Still, Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, points out that because Bedford-Stuyvesant's residents are generally not dependant on Wall Street salaries and bonuses, they have not had to readjust their spending habits as much as residents of the Upper East Side or Brooklyn Heights. The fact that many residents work in ''health care, education and other government-related sectors,'' he said, ''creates stability.''
 Residents also have been starving for new businesses. Michael Amirkhanian, a broker with Massey-Knakal Realty Services, cites a 2008 study by the market research firm LISC MetroEdge showing that Bedford-Stuyvesant residents have been spending more than $30 million in bars and restaurants elsewhere. 
 ''You have real consumer buying power,'' he said, adding that these dollars ''are going to Downtown Brooklyn and the city.''
 Enter the new entrepreneurs. After Estelle Harris was laid off from her job at Credit Suisse in Manhattan, she decided to open a flower shop, Creative Blossoms, on her savings, and chose Bedford-Stuyvesant because rents were half as much as in her neighborhood, Fort Greene, and nearby Clinton Hill. 
 She stays optimistic, though the adjustment from Wall Street to Bedford-Stuyvesant has not been easy. Local churches and funeral homes have largely shunned her displays, having long bought from two nearby florists on Nostrand Avenue. And while wedding business started out strong, she has found that brides are cutting back on expensive flowers like peonies.
 On the positive side, a $99 package she offers for cleaning up the yards of brownstones has been well received by recent arrivals. Local school workers have flooded her shop on secretaries' day and for graduations. A handful of new residents come in weekly to pick up fresh flowers. And at least one former co-worker from Wall Street has talked about opening a designer sneaker store nearby.
 So though business has been less steady in recent months, she views her life as a Brooklyn entrepreneur as permanent. 
 ''Corporate America did a disservice to us,'' Ms. Harris said. ''So people are trying to invest in themselves.''
 For Massimiliano Nanni, who opened the trattoria Saraghina with a partner in June, Bedford-Stuyvesant has given him an affordable home and proximity to his family. In 2006, he bought a brownstone there for $633,000 after living and working in Chelsea, Williamsburg and the East Village for 15 years. He was able to negotiate a cheap rent for space close enough to home that he can have dinner with his family before heading to the kitchen. His daughter, Amelia, 5, and his son, Hercules, 2, can also stop by, just as he used to visit his mother at the two food stands she owns in Rimini, Italy -- though his business is slower.
 ''We can't say we are super busy,'' he said. ''We are happy. We are working.''
 In some ways, the openings are bringing the neighborhood full circle. Ardenia Brown, whose parents have lived in the neighborhood for 60 years, vividly remembers when DeKalb Avenue was lined with meat and candy stores. After working in the music industry for 25 years, Ms. Brown returned home to care for her parents and start a gourmet market. The opening has been delayed -- with an investor pulling out and a space lost because of city licensing requirements -- but after three years of work, she hopes to open the Butternut Market and a neighboring restaurant and bar called Dagio by Thanksgiving. 
 ''It's something that the community has been starving for,'' she said. ''This is the time.''

 Fight Fine Print
 Two state legislators introduced a bill this week that would force cable and satellite companies to disclose early cancellation fees in type the same size as the advertised sales price. The companies would also have to prorate any cancellation fees.
 The bill, being introduced by Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, who represents parts of Westchester County and the Bronx, and Assemblyman Michael R. Benedetto of the Bronx, is a response to complaints about the satellite television provider DirecTV. 
 ''I think people will take a second look before they get into a long-range contract,'' said Mr. Klein, who received a complaint in March from a constituent, John Irving, of Throgs Neck.
 Mr. Irving, 65, a DirecTV customer for over five years, tried for several months to cancel his service, but received different answers about how much he would be charged. One estimate was over $400. Part of the problem, he discovered, was that his two-year contract was renewed whenever equipment was replaced or fixed.
 ''They were saying every time they reinitialize the receiver they would restart the contract,'' Mr. Irving said.
 Robert Mercer, a spokesman for DirecTV, said it was the company's policy to restart the contract when equipment was upgraded, but not when fixing a broken receiver. ''Errors can and do occur from time to time,'' he said in a statement, ''but in the overwhelming majority of the tens of thousands of transactions that our agents and installers handle each week, we believe the proper disclosure process is scrupulously followed and each customer is fully informed of the terms and conditions of their agreement.''

 WALKING THE DOG
 For a Pet Cause
 If you missed Craft Beer Week's pub crawl (also known as the Path of Yeast Resistance), you can still make it to the Pup Crawl: a pet-accompanied march across the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday that is intended to bring attention to the dogs and cats at risk of losing their homes in the economic downturn.
 An estimated 500,000 to 1 million pets may lose their homes because of foreclosures, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
 A news report about that figure inspired Joseph Hassan, 29, of Williamsburg to organize the march, at 7 p.m. Saturday, from City Hall Park in Manhattan across the bridge and back. 
 ''If we could get people to pay attention nationally,'' he said, ''we could reach a lot of those pets.''
 Mr. Hassan said the ideal outcome would be to help families forced to give up a pet to readopt them when they have weathered the storm. In the interim, the pets could stay in a no-kill shelter or with a ''foster owner.'' But the shelters need more money to handle the surge in pets. 
 So far, 150 dogs have been registered for the event, and $1,000 has been donated to three shelters -- in New York, Los Angeles and Florida -- on the Pup Crawl Web site.
 Pet-related sponsors have hopped on the animal crusade, including Bark magazine, LuLu Leash and the Iams pet food company. Eighty boxes of pet food were delivered to Mr. Hassan's apartment last week. His roommate was taken by surprise, he said: ''The look on her face was just priceless.''

HEADLINE: College Officials Brace For Hit From Economy

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG and THEO EMERY

DATELINE: BALTIMORE 

 BODY:
The talk this week at an annual gathering of college admissions officers and high school counselors included the usual topics, like how to deal with ''difficult'' parents and the names of hot student prospects. But the conversations -- in panel discussions, in hallways and over crab cakes -- always seemed to circle around to one subject: the economy. 
 High school counselors said that some parents who in other years worried mostly about whether their children could get into a particular college were now concerned about whether they could afford the price tag. 
 Admissions officers said they feared further price increases and cuts in university budgets, perhaps even in classes. They wondered whether this would create significant dips in yield, the number of accepted applicants who then choose to attend. For those at private colleges, one anxious worry prevailed: Will students even apply?
 ''We're fearful,'' said Paul M. Driscoll, the dean of admissions of the University of Redlands in California, a private college that already had a 3 percent drop in applicants for the new freshman class, and an increase in families seeking financial aid.
 Both college officials and high school counselors here said the full brunt of the economic crisis was not felt in the most recent admissions cycle -- because families had long ago set college plans in motion, and had largely held to that course. In many instances, colleges reported this past spring that they received roughly as many applications in 2009 as they had in 2008, and that there were no significant dips in yield. 
 But as the 5,000 officers and counselors moved among various panel discussions here -- including a packed session on changes in the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa, the government's main financial aid form -- the conferees expressed concern that this latest admissions cycle could be much grimmer, for colleges and some families alike.
 Ann Bowe McDermott, director of admissions at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts, said the economy and its many ripple effects were the main subject of a meeting on Wednesday attended by admissions officers from more than two dozen Jesuit colleges.
 ''Affordability is something everyone is concerned about,'' said Ms. McDermott, whose institution's tuition, board and other fees already exceed more than $50,000 annually for full-paying students. 
 And yet, Ms. McDermott noted that recently in Westchester County, N.Y., 200 high school students and their parents turned out for a Holy Cross information session at a Catholic prep school, far more interest than the college could recall having previously received in the area.
 ''We've had this conversation in past years,'' she said, in reference to concerns about a dip in applications and enrollment, ''and then it didn't happen. I guess I'm an eternal optimist.''
 Among the high school advisers at the conference, which ends Saturday and is formally known as the National Association for College Admission Counseling, was Frank Tatto of Fairfield Ludlowe High School in Fairfield, Conn. 
 Mr. Tatto said that a financial-aid information night at the school in December had drawn 350 people, more than triple the number in past years, and that he was particularly struck by the number of students (some of them juniors, who were included for the first time). ''I think it's an added dynamic that the kids are having to contend with that they might not have had to in the past,'' he said. 
 He added that, instead of asking where they might be admitted or what constituted a good fit, ''Now, it's: 'Will I be able to afford it and what's my debt going to be?' ''
 John Dunphy, a school counselor at Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, N.Y., said he had seen perhaps 20 percent more students this year applying to the State University of New York system, which he called a significant spike. Applications for out-of-state public universities, like Michigan and Delaware, are also on the rise, Mr. Dunphy said.
 ''Chappaqua is an affluent community, and quite a few of our kids look at selective private schools,'' he said, ''but the affordability of public schools is definitely being considered more than ever.'' 
 Not that state colleges are necessarily a refuge. As the conferees huddled here Thursday, thousands of students and faculty members were marching in protest 3,000 miles away, at the University of California, Berkeley. Their quarrel was with steep tuition increases and sharp cuts in offerings throughout the state system.
 On Friday afternoon, in what is always a high point of the conference, representatives from nearly 550 colleges took their places behind long tables draped with their institution's banners. In front of them, several thousand counselors moved past like slow-moving barges, some docking occasionally to chat.
 Representing the University of California, Davis, was Gregory W. Sneed, associate director of undergraduate admissions, who said he felt the protesters' pain. From now until June, he will have 18 unpaid furlough days.
 ''As admissions officers,'' Mr. Sneed said, ''it does make our jobs tougher.''

HEADLINE: A Commitment to Citizenship

 BODY:
Here's a good federal stimulus project: citizenship. Reports this week that the United States citizenship agency was yet again struggling with a budget shortfall, and considering raising fees on the hopeful immigrants who are its main source of revenue, could have led any American to wonder what kind of beacon to the world we are anymore. 
 Congress requires Citizenship and Immigration Services to be self-supporting. For years, the agency languished, its ambitions and effectiveness sorely limited by the principle of economics and government known as You Get What You Pay For. Bureaucratic backlogs built up, as did frustrations. Would-be citizens spent years waiting for paperwork. Their long ordeals were compounded by a notoriously surly, inattentive bureaucracy.
 In 2007, the director of Citizenship and Immigration Services under former President George W. Bush raised fees drastically and declared that the era of bad faith and slow service was over. With the cost for services rising more than 65 percent across the board -- a $400 naturalization now cost $675 -- the agency was going to be re-energized and well financed for the 21st century. 
 Just two years later, in a terrible economy, citizenship applications are down sharply, along with requests for skilled-worker visas. Agency revenue is down by $118 million, reviving talk of budget cuts and higher fees.
 The agency has made strides recently in becoming more responsive and friendlier to the people it serves. It created a thoughtful new citizenship test, abandoning an old emphasis on rote memorization of civic trivia. It has just unveiled an easier-to-use, bilingual Web site that allows immigrants to track their cases, even with e-mails and text messages to their cellphones.
 But the agency is still hobbled by its fee-based revenue stream. It deserves a direct Congressional appropriation to supplement its budget so it can better withstand economic downturns, keep improving services and keep fees from rising too high for the poor and working class.
 The need to properly finance America's citizenship agency -- and to keep naturalization affordable -- is an issue both for now and later. At some point soon, if President Obama and Congressional leaders keep their promise to pass a comprehensive immigration bill, the agency will face a welcome but overwhelming surge of Americans-in-waiting. The machinery of citizenship needs to be ready and humming well before then, not struggling and broken. 
 Turning immigrants into Americans is a mission tied intimately to this country's self-interest and identity, if not its very soul.

HEADLINE: Cuts Ravage California Program as Another Barely Escapes

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY; Erik Eckholm contributed reporting from Fresno, Calif.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
The Riley Center does not advertise its location, in a three-story Victorian in San Francisco's core. The center's address is confidential to protect its tenants: dozens of women and children fleeing abusive relationships. 
 While those who live at the Riley Center are often desperate for help, so is the center itself and dozens like it across California. 
 Because of cuts in state financing, several domestic violence shelters in California have closed in recent months, with layoffs or fewer full-time staff members at many others. Legal services -- like help obtaining restraining orders -- have been curtailed, as has counseling. 
 The Riley Center has eliminated six beds and combined its emergency services with its longer-term transitional program. 
 Shelters have also dropped 24-hour services, cut overnight staff at emergency centers and eliminated more comprehensive services like safe visitation centers, where staff members are posted when children are dropped off or picked up as part of custody agreements. 
 ''Our members are struggling to keep their doors open,'' said Tara Shabazz, the executive director of the California Partnership to End Domestic Violence, which represents the state's nonprofit shelters. 
 In July, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger eliminated the remaining financing for the state's Domestic Violence Program -- some $16 million -- in the face of a lingering budget gap of nearly $500 million. Legislators had closed most, but not all, of a $24 billion deficit.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger has said he regretted the decision but had no choice. ''The governor understands how difficult these cuts are,'' said Aaron McLear, a spokesman. ''But he can't promise money we don't have.''
 Other states, including New Jersey and Illinois, have struggled to find ways to keep domestic violence centers open, but national advocacy groups say no state has gone as far as California in ''zeroing out'' domestic violence money. 
 ''California is by far the most extreme and shocking example,'' said Sue Else, the president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, a group in Washington. ''We're appalled that this is the way that the governor would seek to balance the budget.'' 
 The cuts to the program, which is part of the State Department of Public Health, means that the 94 nonprofit agencies charged with running the state's domestic violence shelters have lost about $200,000 each. For most, that amounts to more than 40 percent of their anticipated annual financing, although agencies have received money for other shelter services from the federal stimulus package and the state's emergency management agency.
 Erik Sternad, the executive director of Interface Children Family Services in Ventura County, near Los Angeles, said his organization had initially believed that it would lose all five of its transitional shelters -- usually multibedroom homes in suburban areas -- where about three dozen women and children could live for up to 18 months. In the end, one was sold, one was transformed into youth services, and the final three were eventually saved by private donations. But of those, two have money assured only through June 30, the end of the fiscal year. 
 ''We know that this money is going to run out about nine months from now,'' Mr. Sternad said. 
 The pain has been most acute in remote areas. The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Coalition in Grass Valley, northeast of Sacramento, is the only such facility in that area. The coalition closed its 12-bed shelter, leaving five families in the lurch. 
 Niko Johnson, the coalition's executive director, said his staff managed to find places for those families to stay, but has since had to turn away 14 women with 8 children. 
 ''We had to give a voucher for a motel,'' he said. ''When women get to that point and are ready to make a change, it's hard to say we can give you three nights in a motel. They ask, 'What next?' '' 
 At the same time, Ms. Else, of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, said the impact of a sour economy, including job losses and foreclosures, added to the need for services. 
 ''I don't know that it causes or creates domestic violence,'' she said of the recession. ''But what happens is that if there is domestic violence happening at home, it exacerbates it.'' 
 The cutbacks come as the movement to fight domestic violence marked the 15th anniversary of passage of both the federal Violence Against Women Act, which established programs and penalties in cases of abuse against women, and California's Battered Women Protection Act, which established financing for the state's shelter system. There have been some signs of help. In August, shortly after the California cuts were announced, the Department of Justice awarded about $2.9 million to six transitional housing programs in California, primarily in rural counties. In the meantime, many shelters are finding ways to cope. 
 Mari Alaniz, director the Riley Center, which is run by the St. Vincent de Paul Society, said that combining the center's emergency services and longer-term transitional program in one building has meant less privacy, with as many as six beds to a room. Still, she said, ''better to have six in a room than not to have a shelter.'' 
 That sentiment is echoed by a 41-year-old woman who was there for months last year when her ex-husband threatened to hurt her two younger children. 
 ''When he was doing stuff to me, I could take it,'' said the woman, whose name is being withheld to avoid disclosing her location. ''But when I saw it was happening to them, I reacted like a lion. And eventually I was a lion, and I left the situation.'' 
 The woman has since moved into her own home with two of her children. 
 She said she had lived in fear of beatings and other kinds of abuse from her ex-husband for more than two decades, but had noticed a change in herself of late. 
 ''Now that I have my own home, it might sound dumb, but I can get up when I want and do what I want, and I think the kids feel the same way,'' she said. ''I ain't scared no more.''

HEADLINE: Curbed in Island Towns, Islamists in Philippines Take to Forests

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: LAMITAN, Philippines 

 BODY:
Early this decade, American soldiers landed on the island of Basilan, here in the southern Philippines, to help root out the militant Islamic separatist group Abu Sayyaf. Now, Basilan's biggest towns, once overrun by Abu Sayyaf and criminal groups, have become safe enough that a local Avon lady trolls unworriedly for customers.
 Still, despite seven years of joint military missions and American development projects, much of the island outside main towns like Lamitan remains unsafe. Abu Sayyaf members, sheltered by sympathetic residents, continue to operate in the interior's dense forests, even as the United States recently extended the deployment of troops in the southern Philippines.
 Last month, Abu Sayyaf guerrillas killed 23 Philippine soldiers in a battle in the south of Basilan. This month, on the neighboring island of Jolo, Abu Sayyaf members, reinforced by a contingent from Basilan, killed eight soldiers in fierce fighting that displaced thousands of civilians. More than 40 insurgents were killed, though at least 10 were believed to have belonged to a different Muslim separatist group. 
 ''We haven't been able to eliminate the root cause of the problem,'' said Maj. Armel Tolato, the commander of a Philippine Marine battalion here, explaining why Abu Sayyaf had not been eradicated. ''It cannot be addressed alone by the military. It's derived from the dynamics here, political and cultural. It's very complex.'' In an interview at a base shared with American troops, he said: ''We're just dealing with the armed elements. We might kill them. But there are young ones to take their place.''
 Basilan, like many other Muslim and Christian areas in the southern Philippines, has a long history of political violence, clan warfare and corruption. Experts believe that Abu Sayyaf has been protected not only by friends and family, but also by friendly political and military officials.
 It received support from Al Qaeda in the early 1990s and is believed to be sheltering leaders of the Indonesian terrorist group Jemaah Islamiah. But as most of its original leaders have been killed or captured, Abu Sayyaf and its new recruits are said to be motivated less by radical Islamist ideology than by banditry, especially the lucrative kidnappings for ransom for which it has become known.
 Last month, after consulting with the Philippine government, the United States decided to extend the operation of its force in the southern Philippines, known as the Joint Special Operations Task Force-Philippines and composed of 600 elite counterinsurgency soldiers. The announcement drew angry responses from left-leaning politicians and news media; American officials declined to be interviewed for this article.
 Since establishing the task force in 2002, the United States has provided the Philippines with $1.6 billion in military and economic aid. Much of that, including $400 million from the United States Agency for International Development, has been funneled into Mindanao in the southern Philippines, where Abu Sayyaf and another Muslim separatist group operate.
 Some 1,300 American soldiers first arrived in 2002 in Basilan, which has a population of less than half a million, to support the Philippine military against Abu Sayyaf. Today, a force of 600 soldiers remains, spread out here and in the region, supplying its Philippine counterpart with intelligence, training and technology. According to the agreement with the Philippines, the American soldiers are prohibited from engaging in direct combat.
 The Americans have also been directing development assistance here, including building roads, bridges and buildings; improving cellphone service and encouraging local businesses; training teachers and wiring schools for the Internet; and providing temporary medical and dental clinics.
 But American troops have typically let their Filipino counterparts deal with the residents, thereby burnishing the image of the Philippines military, which has long been viewed as an occupying force in the south's Muslim areas. ''More people are doing business in Basilan because there's much less fighting and kidnapping now,'' said Wilma Amirul, 30, the Avon saleswoman, who was taking the morning ferry here from Zamboanga, the nearest city on the mainland. ''Before, even the poor were kidnapped for ransom.''
 Ms. Amirul, who has been selling cosmetics in Zamboanga for six years, said she started coming regularly to Basilan five months ago to expand her clientele. Another passenger, Jose Wee, 63, a candle manufacturer, said he now visited Basilan freely to sell his products -- an indispensable item because of the frequent blackouts here. ''The situation is good now, but maybe for the meantime only,'' he said. ''If the Americans leave, the Abu Sayyaf might regroup.''
 Under a deep blue sky with low-lying clouds, the ferry arrived in Lamitan, fringed with white beaches and palm trees, dotted with simple houses made of wood or concrete. Soldiers guarded 30 checkpoints along roads into town.
 Lamitan, along with Isabela, the provincial capital, is the only town on the island with a sizable Christian population. Roderick H. Furigay, 47, the mayor of Lamitan and the only Christian among Basilan's 12 mayors, strongly backed the American presence because he believed the Philippine military lacked ''adequate capability.'' He called himself the ''No. 1 target'' of Abu Sayyaf -- ''threats are like breakfast to me'' -- as he toured the American-financed projects around town, accompanied by bodyguards.
 ''Peace here in Basilan is so elusive,'' Mr. Furigay said, adding that poor governance created an environment in which groups like Abu Sayyaf grew. ''Most of our leaders in Basilan are not really sincere. Most of them are holding their positions just to enrich themselves.'' He said that because Abu Sayyaf's leadership had been decimated, the group's members were now motivated by ''grievances.'' 
 ''There's little ideology,'' he said, estimating that Abu Sayyaf's core members numbered fewer than 20 in Basilan.
 That assessment was shared by other islanders, including those less welcoming of an American presence. Al-Rasheed M. Sakkalahul, Basilan's vice governor, estimated that only 10 were longtime, ideologically driven members. But he said they were able to mobilize about 100 supporters in a conflict. 
 ''All the rest are ordinary bandits, even civilians without any training on how to handle firearms,'' Mr. Sakkalahul, 52, said at his office in Isabela. ''They join Abu Sayyaf so they can divide ransom money from kidnapping victims.'' He said that given those circumstances, he was skeptical of the American force's presence here and complained that he had not been given facts about the mission. ''You are my visitor in my house,'' Mr. Sakkalahul said. ''You just enter my house without even knocking on my door. What is your purpose in coming?''
 Maj. Ramon D. Hontiveros, a spokesman for the task force's Philippine side, said it was trying to ''work through local politicians'' and ''keep the military footprint as small as possible.''
 He said, ''The Americans come with a lot of baggage, but the new roads and buildings they've brought here will outlive any controversy.''

HEADLINE: Tough Love Approach of Detroit's Mayor Proves a Risky Path to Election

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Gone are the cheery promises of earlier city leaders about how Detroit is on the way back. How some new project downtown is surely just the first sign of a renaissance afoot. How things are not so bad.
 Instead, Dave Bing, Detroit's mayor of five months, delivers grim news by the day. 
 Detroit's bus service will be cut, he said, and 230 city workers will be laid off next week. Those layoffs are among more than 400 since he took office, and more are possible. 
 Within a week, he is expected to announce how he will -- through elimination, consolidation, outsourcing -- shrink a city bureaucracy built for an earlier, booming Motor City. 
 ''We've got to focus on being the best 900,000 populated city that we can be and stop thinking about 'We can turn the clock back to the 1950s and '60s,' '' he said, referring to a time when the city, still the 11th most populous in the nation, was nearly twice as big. ''That era is gone.''
 Mr. Bing's drastic measures, coming as he seeks election to a full term in November, are an unconventional and risky election strategy in a city that has endured more upheaval and misery than most any other major city in the country.
 There have been no published polls on the race, but his opponent, Tom Barrow, says Detroiters have already grown exasperated with Mr. Bing, who, Mr. Barrow points out, had for years lived in the suburbs before he moved into a Detroit apartment last year.
 ''Detroiters,'' said Mr. Barrow, an accountant, ''want to get behind somebody who wants to grow the town, not shrink it.''
 The city's unions are furious. This month, the local American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the city's largest union, announced that it was dropping its endorsement of Mr. Bing's candidacy, saying it had been misled by his campaign rhetoric.
 But it is also clear that some people are taking to Mr. Bing's sober, somber approach at a time when the city's political landscape (there have been three different mayors in one year) feels as shaky as its economic one. An August primary was deeply lopsided in Mr. Bing's favor; turnout was low, but Mr. Bing outpaced Mr. Barrow, 74 percent to 11 percent.
 ''I'm with him,'' Bobby Mixon, a resident of a Detroit neighborhood riddled with empty and abandoned homes, said of Mr. Bing. 
 Mr. Bing, 65 and a former basketball star who describes himself as ''not a politician,'' has competed in three elections since February, part of the complicated fallout from the resignation a year ago of Kwame M. Kilpatrick, the former mayor who pleaded guilty to criminal charges of obstruction of justice. 
 Outside Detroit, Mr. Bing is doing something Detroit mayors have rarely done: he is drawing praise from the suburban leaders who have long criticized the city and its leadership. On a clear evening recently, Mr. Bing appeared before the board of commissioners in Oakland County, north of Detroit and where Mr. Bing lived until recently. He told commissioners that ''Detroit, from a structural standpoint, is broke,'' called for regional cooperation and drew a standing ovation. 
 ''I think it's difficult for people to accept the pain that we have to go through,'' he said in an interview. ''But there is no other way, unless we want to go bankrupt.''
 Mr. Bing, who founded an auto parts supplier, The Bing Group, in Detroit, is best known for his years as a basketball player with the Detroit Pistons. People recognize him on the street and stop him for snapshots. Yet his demeanor is not all-star -- more mild-mannered, grandfatherly, even at times dull. With his graying hair, glasses, wiry build and deliberate speeches, he seems the antithesis of his predecessor, Mr. Kilpatrick, whose youth, charisma and imposing personal presence always drew a crowd but did not stop Detroit's slide. 
 So far, Mr. Bing's biggest trouble has been a minor scandal over misstatements about his educational credentials. But the municipal problems he has inherited are staggering.
 More than a quarter of the city's work force is out of work, the highest unemployment since the state began counting such things; mismanagement in the city's school system has led the state to put it under control of an emergency financial manager; and the city, the mayor says, is on track to run out of money before the end of the year.
 Crime, long a problem in Detroit, is worse by some calculations than a year ago. Warren C. Evans, whom Mr. Bing appointed as police chief in July, has found that the department ''undercounted'' crimes in the past. He is trying to make sweeping changes, but admits that the picture, for now, is not desirable. 
 The city's public schools, which have shrunk to about 90,000 students from more than 160,000 nine years ago, are also undergoing big changes. Robert C. Bobb, the emergency financial manager, has closed schools, laid off employees and begun investigating numerous thefts, the system's real estate deals and questions about whether scores of people receiving paychecks are really on the payroll.
 Some 180 computers were stolen from the schools this year alone. ''Some individuals are using the schools like shopping malls,'' Mr. Bobb said.
 And the city -- with 42 city departments and, the mayor says, some 50 separate bargaining units of unions -- is facing an estimated deficit of $275 million, a cold reality that hangs over almost everything the mayor does.
 On the city's west side on a recent morning, leaders, including Mr. Bing, appeared at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a mixed-income development on the site of a former public housing project -- a makeover that had taken more than a decade. ''Detroit's New Beginning,'' a banner read, near the microphone where Mr. Bing spoke of the ''hard decisions'' ahead. 
 Two blocks away, on a street with carefully kept homes, other abandoned houses sat empty, doors open, and weeds grew in a playground. Mr. Mixon, 31, gazed at one of the empty homes; it burned down over summer, he said, but the charred remains had never been removed. 
 Mr. Mixon, who grew up here, left and came back, said he would surely leave again after he finished taking computer science classes. ''If you are already retired or if you've already got a job, I guess you could stay,'' he said. ''But someone like me has no future in Detroit.'' 
 Whether the blunt talk of Mr. Bing, a Democrat, will survive November's nonpartisan election and ultimately change the perceptions of those like Mr. Mixon is anyone's guess. 
 Mr. Barrow, who was born in Detroit and long ago unsuccessfully took on Coleman A. Young, the former mayor, said the weeks since Mr. Bing's victory in the August primary had chipped away at his lead.
 ''He wants to run this like a business, but Detroit's not a business, it's a municipality,'' said Mr. Barrow, who added that laying off city workers and cutting or privatizing services was not the way to go. ''This is a man who thinks people choose to ride the bus as a luxury.''
 If he is worried about November, though, Mr. Bing does not let on. He does not apologize for his personal wealth, and he has chosen to donate his mayoral salary of $176,000 to the Police Department. He also insists that he is comfortable making the choices ahead of him. 
 ''When I look around me and see the hell that everybody is going through,'' he said, ''I don't want to sit on the sidelines and lay blame and point fingers and say: 'That's not my problem. You fix it.' ''

HEADLINE: In Affluent Greenwich, Publicly Supported Housing Has a 50-Year History

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn. 

 BODY:
''This is one of the wows,'' said Tracy Villanueva, a mother of four, as she opened the doors of a spacious closet in the hallway of her four-bedroom apartment here. ''Look at how big this is. You don't even know this is housing.''
 By housing, Ms. Villanueva, 35, meant public housing. Certainly neither her apartment, with its large, bright windows, nor the grounds of the complex, with a new basketball court and neatly mowed lawns, fit the image of public housing. And public housing might be the last thing that springs to mind when thinking about Greenwich, a suburb known for its reserves of wealth and impeccable mansions.
 For more than 50 years, the town has, through its Housing Authority, quietly overseen a growing assortment of low- and moderate-income housing, now scattered across a dozen sites. There are almost 750 units in all, some in buildings within view of multimillion-dollar houses. 
 ''It's not your typical public housing,'' said Anthony L. Johnson, executive director of the authority, which for the last three years has earned a coveted ''high performer'' designation from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
 ''We provide not only a great place to live but also the amenities that come from living in the town of Greenwich: the school system and the services and community involvement,'' he said. ''You have people in public housing who go to school with kids whose parents are hedge fund owners.''
 Greenwich being Greenwich, the tenants are somewhat atypical, too. ''We house a lot of people who grew up here and used to be servants on estates,'' said Mr. Johnson, referring to retired caretakers, nannies and laundresses who are now settled in some of the 300 apartments set aside for the elderly.
 While it's not unusual to find public housing in the New York City suburbs, such buildings tend to be in more struggling towns and cities where tenants grapple with the same issues as their big-city counterparts, from drug-dealing to broken elevators.
 The experience of Greenwich, whose Housing Authority was created at the end of World War II, in part to house returning veterans, may hold lessons for Westchester County, whose legislature approved a landmark desegregation agreement this week. That agreement, the result of a lawsuit filed by an antidiscrimination group, requires the county, one of the wealthiest in the nation, to produce hundreds of houses and apartments for moderate-income people in overwhelmingly white communities.
 Under the agreement, the county would build or acquire 750 homes or apartments, the clear majority of them in towns and villages where black residents make up 3 percent or less of the population and Hispanic residents make up less than 7 percent. The town of Greenwich would barely miss those criteria, with a black population of 1.8 percent and a Hispanic population of 7.2 percent. 
 In many ways, the housing in Greenwich mirrors modern trends in public housing -- low-rise, small-scale structures -- even though most of it was built years ago.
 At Ms. Villanueva's complex, Wilbur Peck Court, one of the larger ones run by the Housing Authority, with 110 units, residents live in one of several three-story buildings arranged in the style of garden apartments. Picnic tables, barbecue equipment, a colorful play set and a new basketball court adorn the well-kept grounds, where smooth boulders emerge from grassy areas that on a recent day were devoid of litter and weeds.
 ''There are a bunch of us who really want this place to be good,'' said Lucy Receendiz, a resident of Wilbur Peck for seven years who before that had lived in Armstrong Court, another subsidized building. ''I give it a 10. Look at it. Have you been to places this calm?''
 As the economy has spiraled downward in the past year, demand for the housing here has risen. About 600 names are now on a waiting list for the family housing, double the number from two years ago. In just the last three months, the number of elderly applicants on the list for senior housing has climbed to 162 from 136.
 The town gives preference to applicants who work or live in Greenwich, but anyone in the country can put their names on the lists. ''Last year we may have turned over 30 to 35 units in our entire portfolio,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''You can wait for years.''
 While the buildings are unusually well maintained and clean, public housing in Greenwich is not immune from the sorts of problems that occur elsewhere. In March, for instance, a melee erupted outside Wilbur Peck Court after the police tried to disperse a crowd of teenagers who were drinking. The confrontation quickly escalated, and when it ended, three police officers had been injured and five men arrested. 
 The Housing Authority initially moved to evict four tenants because of the incident but wound up settling for the departure of individual young men rather than their entire families.
 Jonathan DuBois, the chairman of the Housing Authority, said that while he thought the housing was well managed, some units were in serious need of replacement or renovation, adding that ''the style and size of the apartments is well below the standards that the community expects.'' A plan to greatly expand and rehabilitate two of the senior housing complexes has run into neighborhood opposition, he said.
 ''Any proposed land use in this town is controversial,'' he said. ''It takes a community decision that it's appropriate policy for the town to encourage affordable housing.''
 Ms. Villanueva, a single mother, moved with her four children from the Bronx into a small attic apartment in Greenwich a few years ago. At the time, she was a sales assistant for a brokerage firm in Fairfield County and, as she put it, ''came here for all the perks'' -- in particular the public schools, town beach, libraries and agencies like the local Boys and Girls Club.
 One of her children's teachers suggested that she apply for public housing; a year and a half ago, the four-bedroom apartment in Wilbur Peck opened up. Another family in town agreed to help her and her four children -- Alex, 11; Hannah, 6; and Hailey and Amanda, 4-year-old twins. The family has showered the children with furnishings and gifts, including a sleek black chair with built-in stereo speakers for Alex's bedroom.
 Ms. Villanueva lost her job in April, and she said she sometimes feels the sting of alienation that comes from being at the lower end of the economic spectrum in an affluent world.
 ''That's the double edge,'' she explained. ''You can tell the rich kids from the ones who are not as rich. They don't flaunt it, but they can participate in so much more than we can, like ballet. Hannah wants to do ballet, but I can't afford it. And I can't say that I have people coming over for drinks, whereas I did, of course, in the Bronx.''
 As for the Westchester agreement, Craig Gurian, executive director of the Anti-Discrimination Center, the group that filed the lawsuit that produced the agreement, said some residents of the two dozen communities eligible for the housing had also expressed concerns about cultural disparity. On blogs and in interviews, they worried about how newcomers of more modest means would fare socially.
 Mr. Gurian said the way to resolve such anxieties was more affordable housing, not less. ''The more diversity of various kinds that exists, the more likely those problems of fitting in will fade,'' he said. ''Social pressures are real. They're real for adults and they're real for children. But doesn't most every family make a series of choices in terms of where they live and balancing issues of cost, schools, jobs, friends and safety?''

HEADLINE: From Smiling Coffee Vendor to Terror Suspect

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON; Reporting was contributed by Majeed Babar, Al Baker, Dan Frosch, Kirk Johnson, William K. Rashbaum and Nate Schweber.

 BODY:
This article was reported by Simon Akam, Alison Leigh Cowan, Michael Wilson and Karen Zraick, and written by Mr. Wilson.
For years, he was a fixture in Lower Manhattan, as regular as the sunrise. Every morning, Najibullah Zazi would be there on Stone Street with his pastries and his coffee, his vending cart anchored to the sidewalk.
 For many on Wall Street -- young, old, all in a hurry, the charging bulls of Bowling Green -- his was the first hello of the day. Affable and rooted, he lived for 10 years in the same apartment with his family in Flushing, Queens. His father drove a cab for more than 15 years. 
 He was, in other words, no brooding outcast, no sheltered, suggestible loner raised in a closed community. 
 He was the smiling man who remembered a customer liked his coffee large, light and sweet. He had a ''God Bless America'' sign on his cart. He was the doughnut man.
 But prosecutors say Mr. Zazi, 24, who worked blocks from ground zero, was just as furtive an operative as the Sept. 11 hijackers when he traveled to Pakistan last year for terrorism training and returned to the United States with a plan to build bombs using beauty supplies and backpacks.
 In fact, law enforcement officials, who fret about how to seal the borders of a free society from terrorists, say they find in Mr. Zazi a particularly harrowing challenge: a homegrown operative who travels freely, who is skilled with people, who passed an airport employee background check, who understands the patterns and nuance of American life so well that he gave multiple interviews to journalists for whom access and openness rarely seem like a disguise. 
 ''This is one of the best countries in the world,'' he told a reporter by telephone on Sept. 14 after the F.B.I. had identified him as a terrorism suspect. ''It gives you every single right.'' 
 Mr. Zazi, to date, has merely been charged, not proven guilty. And vast passages of his life remain unexplored, facts and experiences that could help explain his embrace of violence or undercut the government's disturbing portrait of him.
 Even if he is proven to be the aspiring terrorist the government asserts, how and why he became one may not be understood for months, if ever. The suspects who have been charged with terrorism since the Sept. 11 attacks were fueled by a variety of motivations and influences, and often a mix of them: politics, family, economic deprivation, social alienation, the work of a terrorist recruiter. Religion sometimes provides a general framework and sense of identity, but other factors and events frequently drive the transformation.
 For nearly two weeks, though, the story of Mr. Zazi, now one of national interest, has lacked almost any details. A tour of where Mr. Zazi worked and lived, in New York and in Colorado, and interviews with investigators, the Zazi family and friends, provides something of a fuller picture, one filled with the routines of life in Queens but also flecked with hints of his emerging anger, contradictions and puzzles.
 Mr. Zazi is both an Afghan immigrant steeped in the traditions of Islam and a kid from the streets of Queens, where his family moved in the early 1990s. 
 As a teenager, he often carried two things, his basketball and his prayer mat, his friends say. He grew a dark, wiry beard and began wearing tunics several years ago, just as he was applying for his first of two Macy's credit cards.
 He was a janitor and a worshiper at a mosque that split several years ago over the question of its members' loyalty to the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks. He was a devoted fan of gadgets who married, by arrangement, his 19-year-old cousin, who lives with their two children in Pakistan. 
 Last summer, the authorities say, he shopped in Denver for hair supplies to build bombs with. If he did so, he was also engaged in something much more mundane: credit counseling to survive a bankruptcy he had declared in New York.
 It is impossible at this moment to know what it all adds up to. But the details that are being learned create the sense of a far more complicated man than the coffee cart vendor many people saw. Certainly the government's charges have painted the outlines of a man Mr. Zazi's family is having a very difficult time reconciling with the Najib they knew.
 Habib Rasooli, a businessman in Queens and a relative of Mr. Zazi's, said they had no clue to the terrorist leanings, if they were real.
 ''If the guy was involved in all this stuff, I say, 'O.K., bring him to justice,' '' Mr. Rasooli said. ''I'd bring him myself.''
 Early Life
 Mr. Zazi was born on Aug. 10, 1985, in a village in the Paktia region of eastern Afghanistan. He is a middle child with two sisters and two brothers, and his family name is shared by a tribe, one of some 500 in the region. 
 The family moved to the Peshawar area of Pakistan in 1991 or 1992, when Mr. Zazi was about 7, he has said. The broader area has since been identified as ''ground zero in the U.S. jihadist war,'' according to a federal complaint against Mr. Zazi, and home to many Qaeda operatives. 
 Mr. Zazi's father, Mohammed Wali Zazi, came to the United States around 1991, relatives said, and began driving a yellow taxi, working 12-hour shifts so he could afford to bring his family over several years later. The family rented a two-bedroom apartment on Parsons Boulevard, near the home of the younger Mr. Zazi's aunt and uncle.
 In many ways, Flushing must have seemed like another planet to a teenager raised in tribal villages. But several of the family's neighbors came from the same region, and many prayed together at the Masjid Hazrat Abu Bakr, a large Afghan mosque, which was near their house. 
 Najib entered Flushing High School, and played billiards with friends and basketball with other Afghan boys in the yard at Public School 214. He loved video games and all things technological, and that grew into a fascination with cellphones and computers, said a friend, Ahmad Zaraei. He played the lottery.
 Najib was not a strong student, and he dropped out before graduating, friends said. Mr. Rasooli, the elder Mr. Zazi's step-uncle, said it bluntly: ''He was a dumb kid, believe me,'' but one who was dedicated to making money and helping his father.
 Mr. Zaraei said, ''He was basically a left shoulder for his father.''
 The younger Mr. Zazi also spent a lot of time at the mosque, even volunteering his time as a janitor there. He turned 16 a month and a day before Sept. 11, 2001. One acquaintance who gave only his first name, Rahul, recalled discussing the attacks three years later and Mr. Zazi saying: ''I don't know how people could do things like this. I'd never do anything like that.''
 Life at the mosque was disrupted after the attacks. Worshipers there, a large white structure with a turquoise minaret on 33rd Avenue, became deeply divided. When the imam, Mohammed Sherzad, spoke out against the Taliban and Osama bin Laden, pro-Taliban members of the mosque revolted, praying in the basement or the parking lot, and eventually ousted the imam, who opened a smaller mosque nearby.
 It is unclear where, in this heated time, the Zazis fell, though the imam said in an interview that he saw several members of the Zazi family, including Najib, praying in the parking lot with those who opposed him.
 Friends said that Najib later came to love videos on YouTube that featured Zakir Naik, a physician in India and a prominent speaker on Islam. Dr. Naik has been a controversial figure among Muslims and has been criticized for endorsing polygamy and Islamic criminal law, wherein the hands of a thief are chopped off, calling it ''the most practical.'' 
 To Mr. Zazi, ''he was his inspiration,'' his friend Mr. Zaraei said. ''He just loved him.'' 
 Dr. Naik does not preach violence, and neither did Mr. Zazi, ever, said Farooq Jaji, whose brother married the elder Mr. Zazi's sister. He said that he spoke many times with Mr. Zazi about world affairs and that the young man consistently said he found terrorism to be at odds with the teachings of Islam. 
 But prayer was important to him, said Sunwoo Sik, who owned a Flushing food market where Mr. Zazi worked for a year or so.
 He had just walked in one day after seeing a ''cashier wanted'' sign in the window of Mr. Sik's store, the Norion Super Market. 
 ''He said he didn't want to go to college,'' Mr. Sik said. ''He wanted to make money.'' He often came to work with a basketball, and ate halal meat and spicy rice every day for lunch, pausing each evening for his faith. 
 ''Every day at 5, he'd go down to the basement and pray,'' Mr. Sik said. ''He'd lay out cardboard and pray.'' 
 In 2005, he quit. His father now ran a coffee cart, which his sister and brother-in-law had been operating in Lower Manhattan. Now it was Mr. Zazi's turn. He took a 15-hour course in food handling to get a city license.
 Mr. Sik said Mr. Zazi told him he was leaving ''because the coffee cart paid more money.'' 
 The Cart Crew
 The vendors gather before dawn in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, stocking their coffee carts with pastries and rolls that they generally buy from the owner of the Guernsey Street garage, from whom they also rent space. 
 Many of them are Afghan immigrants. Some own their carts. Others lease them. Mr. Zazi was there every morning for years, preparing his father's cart and towing it to the financial district, where he set up shop before the sun rose. 
 ''He was well spoken,'' said John Walters, a customer who works nearby. ''He always said good morning to everyone. He used to memorize what everyone needed in the morning.''
 During this period, around 2006, Mr. Zazi flew to Pakistan and took a wife, whom he hoped to later move to New York. He returned in 2007 for another visit, said his lawyer, Arthur Folsom.
 Each time, he went back to work with his coffee cart. Over time, Mr. Zazi's appearance shifted, customers noted, to that of a devout Muslim. He grew his beard long, started carrying prayer beads and occasionally wore tunics instead of his Western-style outfits, friends and customers said. 
 ''At first he wasn't that much into religion,'' said his friend Mr. Zaraei. ''That changed.'' 
 At some point, several neighbors and customers said, they felt something change. Mr. Zazi was not as friendly.
 A Metropolitan Transportation Authority worker, John Rodes, 53, who bought his coffee from Mr. Zazi, said a co-worker recounted to him that Mr. Zazi had tried to sell her a Koran. ''He did it more than once,'' Mr. Rodes said. 
 Erika Moran, 26, who works in investor relations, was a regular at his cart until last summer, she said. 
 ''I got in an argument with him one day,'' Ms. Moran said. ''You knew he was very religious, to say the least. He asked if I was happy. I said yes. He told me I could not be happy. He was speaking in general. He said, 'You people cannot be happy, with your money.' ''
 The stirrings of a move toward violence, or something much more inconsequential? Either way, money certainly was not making Mr. Zazi happy. He was spending more than he earned, opening new credit cards and not paying his bills. 
 In April 2008, according to bankruptcy records, he began using a Discover card. May 2008: a Shell card. June 2008: five new credit cards. July 2008: three more, including ones from Sony and Radio Shack. August 2008: two more.
 He would later report that his monthly expenses were $1,108, including $450 in rent and $390 for food. His stated income was only $800. 
 Off to Pakistan
 He said he was going to see his wife, as he did every year. On Aug. 28, 2008, Mr. Zazi and some others boarded a plane in Newark and flew through Switzerland and Qatar to Peshawar, according to court records.
 The day he left, he had signed his cart over to another vendor to operate. It was a lease, and the Zazi family would receive payments of some kind. 
 Little is known about his time in Pakistan, except what the authorities say he has admitted: that he was trained in weapons and explosives. Insight into such training camps was gained in July when Bryant Neal Vinas of Long Island described his training in Peshawar to F.B.I. interrogators.
 The first course was an introduction to the AK-47 and other guns, followed by a 15-day course in how to make suicide belts. Then rocket-propelled grenades. Then, graduation. 
 It is not clear precisely when federal authorities first encountered Mr. Zazi or how long they have been tracking his movements. On Jan. 15, after five months away, Mr. Zazi flew back to New York, arriving at Kennedy International Airport.
 His financial woes were waiting for him. Five days after his return, he took part in a telephone counseling session with a representative of GreenPath Debt Solutions. He would file for bankruptcy two months later. 
 Then he abruptly moved to Colorado, where his aunt and uncle lived, in Aurora, a suburb on Denver's prairie-fringed flank, where newcomers find homes new and cheaper than in the city. 
 ''Life is a little bit easier there,'' said Mr. Jaji, his relative. ''The living is cheaper.'' Mr. Jaji said he had spoken to the elder Mr. Zazi about two months ago and was told: ''We are happy. The children are happy.'' 
 Mr. Zazi hit town hungry for work, again drifting toward a job generally filled by immigrants: driving a shuttle van at Denver International Airport. His shuttle carried 15 passengers.
 He applied for a limousine license, underwent an airport background check and began driving a van for a company called Big Sky, then for a company called ABC Transportation.
 Mr. Zazi quickly drew three tickets for moving violations, but his coffee-cart training paid off: drivers competing with him for passengers said he was friendly and hard-working as he jockeyed to fill his van. ''He talked to everyone,'' said Rachid Zouhair, who worked with him.
 In March, Mr. Zazi filed for bankruptcy. He said on the application that he was unmarried and listed $51,000 in debts. 
 Several months later, his uncle said he kicked him out of their house, amid tiny stick trees on East Ontario Drive, for not paying rent. Mr. Zazi moved to an apartment complex two miles away, where his parents would join him at the end of July. 
 Federal agents, who have tracked Mr. Zazi for weeks, perhaps longer, provided their version of how he spent some of that time in their court filings. The work with bomb materials would not take place at Mr. Zazi's home, according to federal investigators, but in a hotel suite he rented in Aurora. They say chemical residue they found in the kitchen there indicates he tried to heat up the beauty supplies to help convert them into a bomb.
 He had bought some bomb ingredients in beauty supply stores, the authorities said, after viewing instructions on his laptop on how to build such a bomb. When an employee of the Beauty Supply Warehouse asked about the volume of materials he was buying, he remembered Mr. Zazi answering, ''I have a lot of girlfriends.''
 As he was completing his purchases, he was also completing his credit counseling, a requirement to have his bankruptcy discharged. A counselor signed the certificate for GreenPath on Aug. 13. Four days later, the bankruptcy case was closed. 
 He would return to the Aurora hotel on Sept. 6, apparently frantic for advice on how to complete the bomb-building, investigators contend. Then he rented a car from Hertz on Sept. 8. The next day, he packed his laptop into the car and started the ignition. 
 F.B.I. agents were watching. New York was 1,800 miles away. He drove through the night, arriving on Sept 10. Investigators say he may have hoped to set off bombs here. But he flew home on Sept. 12, perhaps alarmed to learn that the authorities were tracking his movements. 
 Mr. Zazi explained his trip to New York differently, telling reporters he had come back to clear up issues regarding his coffee cart.
 He was certainly there, at the cart, on the morning of Sept. 11, eight blocks from the hole that had once been the World Trade Center. Old customers saw him. ''He was standing behind his friend,'' said Imran Khan, a transportation authority worker. 
 Mr. Zazi was joking and laughing, they said, the doughnut man once more.

HEADLINE: Fed Up With War

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Most Americans, looking at a globe, would be hard pressed to find Afghanistan. Americans on the whole know very little about the land or its people -- and care even less. They know we're at war over there, wherever it is, but if you were to ask what a Pashtun is or mention the name Abdullah Abdullah you would most likely get a blank stare.
 Americans' minds are on other things, like trying to figure out why, if the Great Recession is over, as Ben Bernanke seems to believe, the employment landscape still looks like a toxic waste dump. 
 A New York Times/CBS News poll found that eight years after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, there is a general feeling of disenchantment with our military involvement there and a desire to bring it to an end. About half of all Americans believe that the war has had no effect on the threat of terrorism, and a majority want the troops out of there in two years.
 Americans are tired of the war. Some of the young people currently being outfitted for combat were just 10 or 11 years old when Al Qaeda struck the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. They are heading off to a conflict that most Americans are no longer interested in. The difference between the public's take on this war and that of the nation's top civilian and military leadership is both stunning and ominous.
 A clash is coming. President Obama may be reconsidering his idea of substantially increasing the number of American troops, but no one at the higher echelons of government is suggesting that anything other than a long, hard, tragic and expensive campaign lies ahead -- with no promise of ultimate victory, or even a serious definition of what would constitute victory.
 The two broad options being explored and argued about at the White House, the Pentagon and elsewhere are an all-out counterinsurgency strategy, which includes an emphasis on protecting and wooing the Afghan population, and a more narrow focus on counterterrorism. This is a distinction that is not nearly as clear cut as it sounds. President Obama says our goal in Afghanistan is to defeat Al Qaeda and its extremist allies. That's counterterrorism, and it's a goal with which few Americans would argue. 
 But the administration also argues that it is impossible to defeat Al Qaeda and eventually bring American troops home if we don't fight the Taliban on the ground and simultaneously work to establish an effective government in Afghanistan with an armed force capable of protecting its own population. That's classic counterinsurgency and nation-building.
 The president's goals, however you characterize the strategies under consideration, may or may not be achievable. But they are definitely not achievable in a short period of time, without the loss of a great deal of lives, and without a tremendous continued expenditure of American dollars.
 The public has not been prepared for a renewed big-time, long-haul effort in Afghanistan. And if American casualties increase substantially, support for the war will diminish that much more. There is very little tolerance in the U.S. for the reality of war, which is why the images in the media are so sanitized. The public's concept of warfare, for the most part, is the product of Hollywood movies about the heroics of the so-called Greatest Generation, and video games. 
 This disconnect between what the public is expecting, or willing to accept, regarding the war in Afghanistan and what the White House and the Pentagon are in fact planning is vast. Americans want their politicians to concentrate on the economy here at home. After the long, sad experience in Iraq, and the worst economic shock since the Depression, they are not up for extended combat and endless nation-building in Afghanistan. 
 The armchair generals, in full popcorn mode, are enthusiastically debating the merits of this strategy or that, and speculating on the political implications for President Obama. It's an exhilarating intellectual exercise. But the American public has other priorities in mind. 
 What we need to be assessing are the implications of forcing still more conflict on a public that is broke, dispirited and fed up with eight years of continuous warfare that have not yielded a victory parade or a sense that the nation is reasonably secure.
 If the conflict in Afghanistan is as crucial to American national security as President Obama has said, then he needs to make that case to the public, clearly and compellingly. A presidential call to arms to meet a threat of that magnitude should surely overshadow the national debate on health care. 
 Otherwise, let's explore creative alternatives to endless warfare and start bringing the weary troops home.

HEADLINE: Stress Tests In Europe Show Risk Of Big Loss

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Twenty-two large banks in Europe may have accumulated credit losses of close to 400 billion euros for this year and next, according to officials who have seen a draft of conclusions of ''stress tests'' conducted by European regulators. 
 At a meeting next Thursday and Friday in Sweden, European Union finance ministers are planning to publish a report on banking health based on the results of the tests, the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said Friday. European finance ministers are also planning to initiate a stress test soon for European insurance companies, with the results to be assessed in the spring, the officials said. 
 The bank tests were conducted by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, a pan-European regulators' panel based in London, which was assigned the matter by governments. The committee did not reply Friday to requests for comment. 
 The figure of almost 400 billion euros ($590 billion) covers assumed bank credit losses rather than total bad assets under assumptions in which macroeconomic forecasts, like growth in gross domestic product for this year and next, are lower than the forecasts of the European Commission, the officials said. 
 Other assumptions and elements of the process will not be released publicly, according to the officials. Unlike a similar exercise carried out in the United States this year, the release of the European results will not include assessments of further action required by individual banks to bolster their balance sheets. 
 Regulators in the United States released their results in May, saying that 9 of the 19 largest banks in the country were adequately protected. The other 10 were ordered to raise a combined $75 billion as a buffer against potential losses. The process added pressure on Europeans to disclose their results. 
 In a brief statement in May, the committee confirmed that it was ''carrying out an E.U.-wide forward-looking stress testing exercise on the aggregate banking system'' based on common guidelines and assumptions. It said it would not identify individual banks that might need recapitalization, and that it was the responsibility of national governments to name such banks. 
 ''In terms of the better visibility of the fiscal costs of the bailouts, it will be positive to publish the results,'' said Hans-Joachim Dubel, a banking analyst at Finpolconsult in Berlin. ''But we know that the problem is with certain banks, and a global figure doesn't help us with that.'' 
 Peer Steinbruck, the German finance minister, had previously signaled his reluctance to release findings of stress tests. One reason, according to Mr. Dubel, is that German politicians are worried about the extent of the troubles at the German Landesbanken, or state lenders. 
 One European regulator, who had a central role, said on Friday that the exercise of conducting the stress tests -- a first on this scale in Europe -- had been positive. ''It was a big learning process,'' said the official, who was unauthorized to speak publicly. ''But we now know better how to do this in future. There is a centralized command.'' 
 The International Monetary Fund will publish its own forecast of bank health on Wednesday as part of its Financial Stability Review. The fund estimated in April that European banks still required $375 billion in capital to cover losses, compared with $275 billion for United States lenders. That forecast caused some consternation among European officials, who had not been informed of its release and were unclear on the methodology.

HEADLINE: Democrats Preserve Essence of Health Proposal

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senate Democrats on Friday preserved the guts of their proposal to reinvent the health care system, but Republicans scored political points on several issues, like the effects of the bill on older Americans.
 The Democrats beat back Republican attacks on the legislation as the Senate Finance Committee deferred some of the most contentious issues to next week.
 By a vote of 14 to 9, the committee rejected an amendment by Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, that would have prohibited the federal government from defining the specific health benefits that insurers must offer. The government would prescribe a minimum package of benefits under all health bills pending in Congress. 
 On the other side of the Capitol, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that Democratic leaders were considering a tax on high-cost health insurance policies to help finance coverage of the uninsured.
 The bill pending in the Senate Finance Committee would raise more than $200 billion over 10 years by imposing such a tax on health plans with premiums exceeding $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families.
 House Democratic leaders and committee chairmen showed no interest in such a tax earlier this year. They have drafted a sweeping health care bill that would impose a surtax on families with incomes of more than $350,000 a year. Ms. Pelosi has said she would like to raise the threshold to $1 million.
 That would reduce the amount of revenue raised. To make up the difference, House leaders are examining the idea of a tax on high-end insurance plans.
 But many Democrats have reservations about the idea, in part because they believe that insurers would pass on the cost to employers and employees.
 Representative Joe Courtney, Democrat of Connecticut, said some teachers in his state could be affected.
 ''A tax on health benefits in the name of reform will punish middle-class residents from states with high medical costs who have no control over medical inflation,'' Mr. Courtney said. ''It would be a bitter pill for these working families to pay a tax on benefits that were preserved through wage and salary concessions for the last two decades.''
 Three House committees approved comprehensive health care bills in July. Ms. Pelosi met for three hours on Friday with her leadership team and with chairmen of the three committees, who are trying to reach a consensus before they take a bill to the House floor this fall.
 When the Finance Committee resumes work next week, it will tackle dozens of proposed amendments.
 The committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, had said the panel on Friday would take up the explosive question of whether to create a government-run insurance plan, to compete with private insurers. But he decided to put the issue off until Tuesday.
 ''This was a good week,'' Mr. Baucus said. ''It was a productive week.''
 Republicans did not prevail on any amendments to which Democrats objected. But Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming said he and other Republicans had effectively publicized two messages: that the bill would do little to bring down the cost of insurance and that it would, in effect, tap Medicare to help pay for coverage of the uninsured.
 A new report from the Congressional Budget Office analyzes possible effects of the legislation on premiums in the individual insurance market. Such premiums, it said, ''would tend to be higher'' because ''the new policies would have to cover pre-existing medical conditions and could not deny coverage to people with high expected costs for health care.''
 However, the report noted that some people with serious illnesses did not buy insurance now because they could not afford the premiums.
 Mr. Kyl said that federal benefit mandates would increase the cost of insurance. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, said such requirements were needed because many insurance policies did not cover important services like maternity care.
 Mr. Kyl insisted, ''I don't need maternity care.''
 But Ms. Stabenow said, ''Your mom probably did.''
 Public access to the text of the legislation has emerged as an issue in the Senate and the House. Ms. Pelosi said the legislation would be posted on the Web for lawmakers and the public to read and review for at least 72 hours before the House votes. Mr. Baucus agreed that a detailed summary of his bill, in plain English, would be publicly available before a final committee vote.

HEADLINE: The Fight Over Your Flex Account

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER; Tara Siegel Bernard contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The tumult at the town hall meetings has mostly died down and the debates over socialized medicine have gotten a bit old for everyone. But the fate of a benefit that puts hundreds of millions of dollars in Americans' pockets each year remained unresolved this week, with senators pitching in with suggestions to keep as much money as possible in the hands of their constituents.
 Who would have thought that so many people would go to the mat over the lowly flexible spending account?
 Flexible spending accounts allow people to take money out of their paychecks before paying taxes on it and to set it aside to use for health care expenses that insurance doesn't cover. There is no legal limit on how much you can set aside each year, though employers generally set a cap around $4,000 or $5,000. 
 Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and author of the Senate health care bill, would like to place a much lower $2,500 annual limit on what people can save, among other restrictions. The House-Senate Joint Committee on Taxation figures this will allow the government to take in $14.6 billion from 2011 and 2019. So far so good right? We have to pay for the health care bill somehow.
 The problem, however, is that to people who put more than $2,500 away each year, this looks an awful lot like a tax increase. After all, if they can't put as much money aside, they'll pay more in income and payroll taxes. And President Obama, when he was running for office, promised that no family earning under $250,000 would see higher taxes. 
 Now, a not-quite grass-roots effort has sprung up, led by companies that administer flexible spending accounts and others. At savemyflexplan.org, the group encourages individuals to write their representatives in Washington and sound off. 
 The question, however, is whether this is something worth fighting for.
 Flexible spending accounts are great in theory. They can cover co-pays and deductibles, birth control and abortion, Lasik and glasses. Orthodontists love them, since braces are eligible, too. 
 In practice, however, the accounts are a hassle. You take money out of your paycheck once to finance the account. Then you reach into your wallet for the health care expenses themselves, effectively fronting the money for a second time. Finally, you gather all your receipts and send them in for reimbursement. While there are now debit cards that allow you to pay for expenses directly from the spending account, not every practitioner accepts them. And the card companies often demand receipts anyway to prove you bought aspirin and not candy at the drugstore. 
 This isn't the real reason the accounts are in senators' sights, though. One factor is this: If you don't use the money in your account within a year (or during the two-and-a-half-month extension that the government also allows), you lose it and your company keeps it. This inevitably leads to the annual goofball ritual of people running around town buying glasses or loading up on contact lens solution before the deadline. 
 And that's if you're lucky. Uwe E. Reinhardt, an economics professor at Princeton who is not a fan of the accounts, wrote a post earlier this year on the Economix blog at NYTimes.com noting that his wife once scheduled year-end, his-and-her colonoscopies to spend their funds.
 Drugstore.com even has a flexible spending account mini-store on its site, so that no one should be confused about what they can spend their money on. All of these spending sprees with leftover funds may well encourage more health care spending than is necessary.
 Detractors also complain that wealthy people benefit the most from the accounts. After all, the more you earn, the higher your income tax rates. And the higher your income tax rates, the more you stand to save by putting pretax money in the accounts. And people who earn more usually have an easier time setting aside money in the first place. 
 John Hickman, an Atlanta lawyer who heads the employee benefits practice for Alston & Bird, is quick to point out that employers have to satisfy federal tests to make sure that the benefits of a flexible spending account plan are not going only to the fat cats. One existing rule keeps a company's owners and officers from deriving more than a quarter of the plan's benefits, while another new rule makes sure that the highly paid in general don't benefit disproportionately.
 Meanwhile, Jody Dietel, the chief compliance officer at WageWorks, which helps companies administer about 1.5 million accounts, notes that the average salary of its participants is about $55,000. She also says there are about 35 million people covered under health care flexible spending accounts. They can't all be rich, right?
 Even if they aren't wealthy, however, the people who have these plans are certainly privileged. First of all, they have to be employed (and not self-employed, since soloists aren't eligible unless a spouse has access to a plan and can cover the whole family). Then, they have to work for an employer willing to set up the accounts and deal with their continuing management. Most employers willing to do this probably already offer decent health insurance. 
 So you can start to see why a $2,500 limit on these accounts looks like a ripe target for legislators hoping to pay for health insurance for people who have none. ''Today, only a minority of workers have access to these accounts, and most of those contributions are already well below this limit,'' Erin Shields, press secretary for the Senate Committee on Finance, said in an e-mail message. 
 The problem with this line of reasoning, however, is that there are plenty of middle-class people who do put aside more than $2,500 to pay for diabetes or asthma medication or treatment for other chronic conditions. Large families also often set aside much more than the proposed limit. They will lose out if the $2,500 cap stays in place, especially if it doesn't rise with inflation.
 This part of the health care bill would be a lot more palatable if it achieved its savings by capping the household income of people who can participate. So if your household income is under, say, $100,000 on the 2009 tax return that you file in 2010, you could participate in a plan in 2011. 
 But that option isn't on the table, and it isn't clear why. One possible explanation is that the $100,000 figure could provide even more political ammunition for anyone trying to claim that those who earn between $100,000 and $250,000 would then be facing a tax increase -- and that President Obama broke his promise. 
 It's probably too late for a more sensible solution to emerge, but one can always hope. In the meantime, be aware that the days of setting aside $4,000 each year to pay for designer prescription sunglasses and therapeutic massages are probably numbered. 
 Use that tax break before you lose it, because many of you probably don't deserve to have it in the first place.

HEADLINE: Gov. Paterson's Choice

 BODY:
Americans are never sure when to take politicians at their word. One good time is when they tell the world that they don't really want the office they are seeking. Or in the case of Gov. David Paterson of New York, the office he is holding.
 Earlier this week, Mr. Paterson suggested that he never really wanted to be governor. ''I did not sign up for this,'' he said. When he ran for lieutenant governor, it seems, he had a ''grand plan'' that involved then-Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton becoming president and Gov. Eliot Spitzer appointing him to her seat. 
 Joking or not, Mr. Paterson put into words what has been increasingly clear in the 18 months since he became governor following Mr. Spitzer's resignation: As well meaning as Mr. Paterson has been, he is not the right person for New York over the long haul. 
 Now the best thing he can do for his state is to announce that he will not seek a full term next year.
 The governor of New York has to lead one of the nation's biggest states during a time of economic turbulence, when the economy requires cutting the state budget drastically. The governor of New York also has to wrangle a cantankerous Legislature, including a Senate that has become astonishingly self-absorbed, erratic and ineffective -- even by Albany-standards.
 That does not, by the way, make the White House's attempt to shove him out of the election next year any less unwelcome and amateurish. But it does provide a focus for what Mr. Paterson ought to be doing in coming months.
 With Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch now at his side, he should let his Democratic Party get about the business of choosing a strong gubernatorial candidate. Freed from the political distraction of a campaign, he and Mr. Ravitch could focus on two critical jobs: passing a solid, balanced budget that maintains a good credit rating for the state and trying to get the Legislature to clean up its seedy act.
 In a series of recent interviews, Mr. Paterson has laid out the challenge he wants to address. Mainly, the state has a growing deficit steadily moving up from $2.1 billion at last count, with an even bigger gap possible next year. The easy cuts and the one-time infusions of money are gone.
 No one gives him good odds of doing that, but he will have a better chance if he gives up the idea of staying in office after 2010.
 Mr. Paterson likes to say that any governor can become ''vastly unpopular'' by cutting budgets and raising taxes, even on the rich. It has happened in California to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, and in Pennsylvania to Gov. Edward Rendell, a Democrat. And both were actually elected. But Governor Paterson's approval rating is far worse, hovering at a historic low of about 17 percent.
 Dealing with the budget properly would certainly make him more unpopular with the Legislature, the interest groups and the unions, but if he's not running for election, he wouldn't have to worry about that. Freeing himself from the need to raise money from favor seekers would give him extra credibility in trying to make the State Legislature less of a national embarrassment. 
 Instead of the sub rosa political competition now going on between Mr. Paterson and Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who is clearly looking to run for governor next year, the two offices could work together to produce major reforms in campaign financing, ethics, budgeting and redistricting.

HEADLINE: Bank In Atlanta Becomes 95th Failure This Year

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Regulators closed Georgian Bank in Atlanta on Friday, an institution that catered to wealthy property developers and became the 95th bank to fail this year. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said Georgian Bank, with five branches, had about $2 billion in assets and $2 billion in deposits. First Citizens Bank and Trust Company of South Carolina has agreed to assume all of the deposits of Georgian Bank. Georgia banks have been especially hard hit by the financial crisis, where home building outstripped demand. Nineteen of the 95 banks that have failed this year have been based in Georgia. 
 The F.D.I.C. said the failure was expected to cost its dwindling insurance fund about $892 million.

HEADLINE: Leaders of G-20 Vow to Reshape Global Economy

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Sharon Otterman contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
One year after a financial crisis that began in the United States tipped the world into a severe recession, leaders from both rich countries and fast-growing powerhouses like China agreed on Friday to a far-reaching effort to revamp the economic system.
 The agreements, if carried out by national governments, would lead to much tighter regulation over financial institutions, complex financial instruments and executive pay. They could also lead to big changes and more outside scrutiny over the economic strategies of individual countries, including the United States. 
 ''We have achieved a level of tangible, global economic cooperation that we've never seen before,'' President Obama said shortly after the summit meeting of 20 leading economies concluded here. ''Our financial system will be far different and more secure than the one that failed so dramatically last year.''
 The leaders pledged to rethink their economic policies in a coordinated effort to reduce the immense imbalances between export-dominated countries like China and Japan and debt-laden countries like the United States, which has long been the world's most willing consumer.
 The United States will be expected to increase its savings rate, reduce its trade deficit and address its huge budget deficit. Countries like China, Japan and Germany will be expected to reduce their dependence on exports by promoting more consumer spending and investment at home.
 The ideas are not new, and there is no enforcement mechanism to penalize countries if they stick to their old habits. But for the first time ever, each country agreed to submit its policies to a ''peer review'' from the other governments as well as to monitoring by the International Monetary Fund.
 That in itself would be a big change, given how prickly national leaders have often been toward outside criticism of their policies. American officials, who pushed for the plan during weeks of negotiations before the summit meeting, argued that governments were so shocked by the economic crisis that they were willing to rethink what was in their self-interest.
 ''I'm quite impressed,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, an economist at Cornell University who had initially been skeptical about the proposed ''framework'' for stable growth. ''A commitment by the U.S. to take the process seriously is a potential game-changer that would give the framework some credibility.''
 The outcome was revealed the same day the leaders formally announced that discussions about global economic issues would shift permanently from the Group of 7 big industrial nations -- the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Italy, Germany and Japan -- to the Group of 20, which includes China, India, Brazil, South Korea and South Africa, reflecting the increased clout of fast-growing developing nations in the global economy.
 The decision reflected both symbolic and practical needs. Poorer but fast-growing nations have long complained that their influence on global policy has lagged behind their economic role. As a practical matter, China and other developing countries played a central role in fighting the global downturn by undertaking aggressive stimulus programs in concert with the United States and Europe.
 American officials had been negotiating with their foreign counterparts for months before the summit meeting, and the agreements endorsed on Friday were mostly pledges rather than binding commitments.
 One of the most important elements of the agreement calls on the Group of 20 countries to require higher levels of capital at banks and other financial institutions. The goal is to reduce risk-taking by forcing institutions to keep bigger reserves as a buffer against unexpected losses or disruptions in credit markets. 
 The Group of 20 communique outlines a long set of principles for tougher rules, and governments pledged to develop ''internationally agreed'' regulations by the end of 2010.
 But the communique includes no specific numbers on how high capital reserves should be, and there are big disagreements over that issue. 
 French and German banks generally have lower capital reserves than their American rivals, and European officials have complained that their banks could be at a disadvantage because they would have to set aside more money to meet new requirements. Japanese officials have warned that they need to pursue their own approach, contending that Japanese banks are inherently more conservative than American banks.
 Similarly, American and French officials disagreed before the summit meeting on how to clamp down on executive pay. Officials on both sides agreed that executive bonuses contributed to the financial crisis by rewarding short-term performance without regard to longer-term risks. But French officials wanted to impose specific caps on bonuses, perhaps based on a percentage of a bank's profits.
 American and British officials thought specific caps were too rigid, and pushed for rules that would defer the payout of bonuses for several years and reduce the incentive for people to take short-term gambles. The American view prevailed, but that does not preclude governments from imposing tighter restrictions.
 For all the unanswered questions, the final communique covered an extraordinary number of complex financial issues. The leaders agreed, for example, to devise policies by the end of 2010 for closing troubled financial institutions that were considered ''too big to fail.'' They also agreed on the need to regulate financial derivatives, endorsing the approach proposed by the Obama administration in its bill to overhaul the regulatory system.
 They also renewed their vow to give China and other Asian nations a bigger share of the vote at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Asian countries have long complained that their stakes no longer reflect their financial contributions. 
 In another nod to developing countries, the leaders agreed to revive talks to reach a new global trade agreement by the end of 2010 that would, among other things, reduce barriers to agricultural exports. The goal may be optimistic: the Obama administration has shown no enthusiasm for new trade deals, and many Democrats want to see more protections rather than fewer.
 The big question is whether the Group of 20 will be more effective because it includes important new players like India and Brazil, or whether it will simply be more unwieldy.
 American officials acknowledged that the economic crisis crystallized priorities of countries with normally conflicting agendas in ways that occur only rarely in normal times. But they said they were betting that individual governments would see their self-interest as more tied than before to the stability of the rest of the world.
 ''The announcement today is more than symbolic,'' said Robert M. Kimmitt, who served as deputy Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush. ''The fact that leaders are turning to the strategic challenge and doing it in a coordinated way at the level of the Group of 20 is significant.''

Good morning, Nicolas. Did you sleep well, Angela? Wasn't that a good dinner last night, Gordon? Pittsburgh is such a great city; I'm so glad we're holding our G-20 summit here. It was Michelle's idea, you know. I think she would have lobbied for Pittsburgh even if the city hadn't swung for me in the election. O.K., maybe not.
 So let's get down to business. We made great progress on Thursday, didn't we? Jintao, you agreed to push for more domestic demand in your Chinese economy. That's exciting. My good friends in Europe agreed to seek more investment from the rest of the world, and everybody agreed to be less dependent on American consumers. We even agreed to check up on one another to see if we're all doing what we said we would do.
Wow. Are summits always this productive? 
 I didn't think so. You can stop laughing.
 Now we've got to tackle the subject we've all been avoiding. What are we going to do about capital requirements for the banking system? Please, Nicolas, don't groan. Tim Geithner has convinced me that strengthening capital requirements is the single most important factor to ensure we never repeat last year's financial crisis. I could never say this in public, but all the fuss over executive compensation is a sideshow compared to strengthening capital requirements.
 When I was running for president, I barely knew that banks even had capital requirements. I certainly didn't know the difference between Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. I thought Basel was a city in Switzerland, and not shorthand for a complex international system to regulate bank capital requirements. But I sure know about them now. They helped create the mess we got into last year. And now, because our banks and most of your banks use different capital standards, it is going to be really tough to get us on the same page. But we have to try.
 I'm sure you all saw the proposal for tougher capital requirements that Tim and his folks at Treasury issued a few weeks ago. I know you don't all agree with his proposals, but I think they make a ton of sense. And I am very reluctant to compromise on Tim's plan because I think it offers the best chance to make sure that the banking system survives the next big financial crisis.
 For instance, Tim says that the quality of Tier 1 capital has to be vastly improved. Who knew that not all capital is the same? (Tier 2 capital isn't worth talking about. ''It's the bank equivalent of your brother-in-law saying he'll lend you $5 if you get in trouble,'' somebody told me the other day.) 
 The way Tim explained it to me, the best kind of capital is the kind that is tangible and never has to be paid back -- the kind that comes from either issuing stock, or from putting aside retained earnings. That is the kind of capital bankers can use to plug holes when their banks report losses, or when they have to write down assets. But one of the things I've learned is that the rules allow other instruments to be classified as Tier 1 ''capital.'' Preferred stock, for instance. Or hybrid forms of debt. Or even -- and I hear you do this a lot in Europe -- certain deferred taxes.
 But when you run into trouble, you can't use deferred taxes to replace assets that have just been written down. And you can't use preferred stock either because, ultimately, that money you've raised by issuing preferred stock has to be paid back. In other words, it's not the kind of capital that will act as a safeguard in times of trouble. And that's the whole point of capital. Besides, potential investors don't take those forms of capital seriously, so they wind up running in the other direction when things get tough because they don't trust the bank's capital.
 The second thing Tim's been telling me is that banks need to have more capital. Can anybody really disagree with that? Last year, as banks wrote down their bad loans, their capital levels sank so low that some of them were technically insolvent. Gordon, isn't that why you now own the Royal Bank of Scotland? It's why we had to shore up our banks with money from taxpayers -- the banks hadn't put enough capital aside to cover all the losses from their toxic securities. 
 Right now the rules say banks must have, at a minimum, Tier 1 capital that amounts to 4 percent of their assets. Tim hasn't unveiled a new number yet, but I've been hearing 8 percent. I like the sound of that.
 Tim's got other good ideas too. He wants banks around the world to have tougher leverage ratios, so they don't borrow against their assets to the insane degree that Lehman Brothers and others did. And he wants a system that forces banks to increase capital during good times so there will be plenty in reserve for the bad times. 
 What I really like about Tim's ideas about capital is that even without other reforms, they have the potential to change bank behavior. If a bank wants to be so large that it is too big to fail, it can do so -- but it will have to put up much more capital than a smaller competitor. If a bank wants to dabble in derivatives, it will have to pay a price in higher capital requirements. If a bank wants to invest in risky assets -- ditto. 
 Banks hate higher capital requirements because they depress profits. So they'll have to make a choice: risky assets or lower capital requirements. They won't be able to do both. Oh, and here's the best part, at least for us: we don't have to go to Congress to impose new capital requirements. Tim can do it by snapping his fingers tomorrow.
 Given how sensible this all sounds, why are we arguing about capital requirements? Yes, I know why. Tim's explained that too. It goes back to that Basel thing. Most of your banks, in Europe and Asia especially, use capital standards based on a set of rules called Basel II, which came into force a few years ago. The point of Basel II is to have banks put aside capital based on the riskiness of their assets. 
 But I have to tell you, when Tim told me that under Basel II the banks themselves got to use their own internal models to gauge the riskiness of their assets, and that Basel II gave huge weight to the now-discredited rating agencies, I almost fell off my chair. Talk about a recipe for disaster! Basel II essentially allowed your banks to game their capital requirements. I still can't believe, for instance, that your banks were able to use the American International Group's credit-default swaps to avoid putting up capital for your mortgage-backed securities portfolio. But Basel II made it possible.
 I freely admit that our banks gamed our regulatory capital requirements as well. They used off-balance sheet vehicles to tuck away assets, for which no capital was required. But thanks to the objections of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, our regulators lagged in adopting Basel II. Our problems would have been much, much worse if we had implemented Basel II. I guess this is one of those times when the paralysis created by all our overlapping bank regulators saved us. And you wonder why I don't want to have a single regulator, like you have in England. Right, Gordon?
 So even now, your banks have much less capital than ours do, and much poorer quality capital. And you've never had leverage ratios, either. And now you're saying that if you have to adopt the standards Tim plans to impose on our banks it will be devastating to your banks, which will have to either dilute shareholders to raise new capital, or take capital from the government -- or both. And you've got a point. It sure won't be fun.
 Tim keeps telling me that it's important for all the world's big banks to operate with one set of capital standards, to keep one country's banks from being able to take advantage of the capital constraints of another country's banks. I agree with him. That's why we're starting this debate today. Besides, any country that has lower capital standards than other countries is creating precisely the kind of systemic risk we are working so hard to prevent.
 Look, I'm not trying to say our banks are better than yours. Our banks made terrible mistakes during the housing bubble. They inflicted pain on the world, and I'm really sorry that our regulators were so lax that they let our banks go astray. We've all paid a price. 
 But let me remind you of something else. We have spent somewhere around $150 billion saving one company, A.I.G. One the reasons we did so was to prevent many of your banks from collapsing. By having the American government back those A.I.G. credit-default swaps -- the very ones your banks used to game Basel II -- we upheld the illusion that those swaps represented genuine capital. If those swaps had disappeared during the crisis last year, many of your banks could well have failed.
 I hope that in coming months, Tim and your finance ministers can come to an agreement on what a new capital regulatory regime should look like. But I've encouraged him to stick to the tough principles he articulated earlier this month, and that's what he is going to do. Even if means that you wind up going your way, and we wind up going ours.
 And if that happens? The next time there's a crisis, you're on your own.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Allies Press Iran Over Nuclear Plant 'Deception'

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD; David E. Sanger reported from Pittsburgh, and William J. Broad from New York. Reporting was contributed by Nazila Fathi, Sharon Otterman, Mark Landler and Liz Robbins from New York; Mark Mazzetti from Washington; Michael Slackman from Cairo; and Alan Cowell from Paris.

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
President Obama and his allies raced Friday to use their revelation of a secret Iranian nuclear enrichment plant as long-sought leverage against Tehran, demanding that the country allow highly intrusive international inspections and propelling the confrontation with Tehran to a new and volatile pitch.
 In a day of high drama at an economic summit meeting, American, British and French officials declassified some of their most closely held intelligence and scrambled to describe a multiyear Iranian effort, tracked by spies on the ground and satellites above, to build a secret uranium enrichment plant deep inside a mountain.
 The new plant, which Iran strongly denied was intended to be kept secret or used for making weapons, is months away from completion and does nothing to shorten intelligence estimates of how long it would take Iran to produce a bomb. American intelligence officials say it will take at least a year, perhaps five, for Iran to develop the full ability to make a nuclear weapon.
 But the finding so cemented a sense of what Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain called ''the serial deception of many years'' that it led to a rare Russian rebuke of Iran, and a milder warning from China, two countries crucial to Mr. Obama's efforts to back up diplomacy with far tougher sanctions. 
 Mr. Obama's aides and a raft of intelligence officials argued that the small, hidden plant was unsuitable for producing reactor fuel that might be used in a peaceful nuclear program. Moreover, its location, deep inside an Iranian Revolutionary Guards base about 20 miles from the religious center of Qum, strongly suggested it was designed for covert use in weapons, they said.
 Late Friday afternoon, preparing to return to Washington, Mr. Obama issued a stark warning about the nuclear negotiations that are to begin next week, the first direct talks between the two countries in 30 years. 
 ''Iran is on notice that when we meet with them on Oct. 1 they are going to have to come clean and they will have to make a choice,'' he said. The alternative to giving up their program, he warned, is to ''continue down a path that is going to lead to confrontation.''
 It seemed unlikely that by ''confrontation'' Mr. Obama meant military action. While the president said that option was still on the table, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said on CNN on Friday that ''the reality is that there is no military option that does anything more than buy time -- the estimates are three years or so.''
 Mr. Obama said he had withheld making the intelligence public for months because it ''is very important in these kind of high-stakes situations to make sure the intelligence is right''-- a clear allusion to former President George W. Bush's release of intelligence on Iraq seven years ago this month that proved baseless. Mr. Obama's hand was forced, however, after Iran, apparently learning that the site had been discovered by Western intelligence, delivered a vague, terse letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency on Monday disclosing that it was building a second plant, one that it had never mentioned during years of inspections. 
 By today the Iranians were aggressively arguing that the plant was a ''semi-industrial fuel enrichment facility'' and that they had voluntarily made its existence public. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, on his annual visit to he United Nations, insisted that the effort was entirely legal, even if Iran had failed to declare its existence to international inspectors until days ago.
 ''We have no fears,'' he said. ''What we did was completely legal. The agency will come and take a look and produce a report and it is nothing new.'' He added: ''What business is it of yours to tell us what to do or not?''
 But to the West, there was a sense that Iran had stumbled. ''They have cheated three times,'' one senior administration official said of the Iranians. ''And they have now been caught three times.'' The official was referring to information unearthed by an Iranian dissident group that led to the discovery of the underground plant at Natanz in 2002, and evidence developed two years ago -- after Iran's computer networks were infiltrated by American intelligence agencies -- that the country had sought to design a nuclear warhead. American officials believe that effort was halted in late 2003.
 Mr. Obama said the secret plant ''represents a direct challenge to the basic foundation of the nonproliferation regime.'' President Nicolas Sarkozy of France was more blunt, giving Iran two months to meet international demands, and Mr. Brown said, ''The international community has no choice today but to draw a line in the sand.''
 By all indications, that line will be drawn Thursday, when the members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany meet with Iranian officials, the long-awaited ''engagement'' that Mr. Obama promised in his campaign. But American officials said that they would seize the moment to impose ''crippling sanctions'' if Iran blocked inspectors or refused to halt its nuclear program. 
 For years, American intelligence agencies have been searching Iran for evidence of the kind of plant that Iran was accused on Friday of building: an enrichment unit big enough to make enough material for one bomb a year, but small enough to hide. At its much larger enrichment complex at Natanz, the country already has produced enough low-enriched fuel to build one or two weapons, though it would need to be further enriched to weapons-grade material. 
 But diverting any of the fuel produced at Natanz for weapons would be difficult: International inspectors would almost certainly detect a diversion, and throwing those inspectors out of the country -- as North Korea did in 2003 -- would set off an alarm that Iran was headed to what experts call ''nuclear breakout.'' 
 ''They needed another place to enrich, and we were looking for it,'' one of Mr. Obama's top advisers said Thursday evening. ''And this time, we found it.''
 Senior administration officials said their break came this spring. They saw equipment being placed into the underground plant, which they said was evidence that Iran was planning to build a secret complex filled with 3,000 centrifuges -- old, slow but reliable centrifuges, called ''P-1'' because of their Pakistani heritage. 
 A senior intelligence official said Friday that Western spy agencies had ''excellent access'' to the site, suggesting human spies had penetrated it. The official said that ''multiple independent sources'' had confirmed that it was intended for nuclear use. The intelligence official and other officials declined to be named because they were discussing intelligence matters. 
 The plant's size, secrecy and location on a Revolutionary Guards base all point to a covert plant for making weapon fuel, analysts said Friday. They called it too small for any commercial use, but a good size for the much easier task of making bomb fuel.
 By contrast, Iran's sprawling enrichment plant in the desert at Natanz currently houses more than 8,000 centrifuges and is designed to hold at least 54,000 of the spinning machines. The plant's underground bunkers, ringed by barbed wire and antiaircraft guns, are roughly half the size of the Pentagon.
 Iran says Natanz is meant to produce the large volumes of low-enriched fuel that are needed for commercial nuclear reactors and making electricity.
 While a large reactor needs tons of uranium fuel, a small nuclear bomb, by the most conservative estimates, requires just 55 pounds of highly enriched uranium. That big difference helps explain the inherent menace of a small enrichment plant.

HEADLINE: Iran's Leader Mocks West's Accusations, but His Difficulties Are Unlikely to Disappear

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS 

 BODY:
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran was all bluster on Friday afternoon as he made light of the Western accusation that the Islamic republic had been caught hiding another crucial piece of its nuclear development program. ''They probably thought they had some winning card here,'' he said dismissively at a Midtown Manhattan news conference. 
 Despite the bold facade, Iranian officials are probably less sanguine: The revelations accented the problem Mr. Ahmadinejad and his government already faced in gaining acceptance months after a messy presidential election. 
 Accusations that the June election was stolen have lingered, along with continuing demonstrations and serious allegations that arrested protesters were murdered, raped and tortured.
 While Mr. Ahmadinejad always seems to revel in the spotlight at the United Nations General Assembly, this year it must have seemed more important to counter the domestic turmoil. 
 Then came the revelation that Iran had been hiding nuclear centrifuges in a mountain near the holy city of Qum. Suddenly Washington and its allies had added leverage to their demand, previously spurned, that Iran accept a tougher inspections regime. 
 The great powers appeared lined up against Mr. Ahmadinejad with the dramatic revelation, seeming to recruit Russia among their ranks and forcing him into spin mode. 
 Seated at a green dais and flanked by red bouquets, Mr. Ahmadinejad said that with the new accusations, the outside powers thought that with their winning card ''they could kind of make some noise and start commanding, 'Iran must do this and that.' '' 
 He asserted that Iran was fully in compliance with the reporting regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency and invited the agency to inspect the nuclear enrichment plant. 
 Tehran's stance hinges on different interpretations of the agency's regulations, said Graham Allison, the director of Harvard University's Belfer Center and an Iran nuclear expert. 
 For two decades, the agency required Iran to report only when nuclear material was introduced to a facility. By 2003 it rescinded that, in line with the guidelines for most countries, demanding reporting when construction began, Mr. Allison said. But the agency never declared Iran out of compliance when Tehran claimed the old agreement was still in place. 
 The political difficulty for Mr. Ahmadinejad, deepened by the domestic crisis, is to keep three plates spinning in the air simultaneously. Signs of ending Iran's isolation might placate some protesters. But if he wanders away from the Islamic republic's longstanding confrontational stance toward the West, he could alienate his conservative base. 
 Yet he has to offer enough to quiet Western demands for transparency to prove that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons. 
 ''This is the contradiction,'' said Mohsen Sazegara, a founder of the Revolutionary Guards living in exile in the United States. ''They need the international community, especially the United States, to say we are established, we are legitimate,'' he said. 
 But the Americans are likely to insist on stricter adherence to inspections established under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, including an additional protocol that allows for more intrusive inspections of possible nuclear facilities. 
 If the Iranians sign the protocol they will look even weaker domestically because they have been railing against it for years, Mr. Sazegara and other analysts said, but if they do not sign it they will face further economic sanctions and lose the chance to gain international approval. 
 Western leaders, particularly President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, demanded during a special Security Council session on nonproliferation that Iran provide solid assurances that its nuclear program was not for weapons. Top officials said the revelation would help. ''It's like further grist in the mill that they have a long way to go to regain the credibility of the international community,'' David Miliband, the British foreign secretary, said in an interview. 
 Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, added a rare rebuke of a member state in a statement issued after meeting with Mr. Ahmadinejad late Friday. He expressed concern about the new uranium enrichment facility, the human rights situation and the president's repeated denials of the Holocaust. Iran should accept a visit by a human rights rapporteur, he said. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad was dismissive at his news conference, although he said several times that he hoped the American president would stick to his vision of a United States that consults rather than confronts. 
 ''Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Brown are not very important to us,'' he said. When a reporter quoted President Obama as saying the new centrifuge site seemed inconsistent with a peaceful program, Mr. Ahmadinejad shot back, ''I don't think Mr. Obama is a nuclear expert.''
 Asked if Iran had yet more hidden nuclear sites, Mr. Ahmadinejad repeated his position that Iran complies with reporting to the I.A.E.A. The reporters called on did not press Mr. Ahmadinejad -- none asked whether Iran tried to make a pre-emptive revelation because it learned that the United States was about to, nor what transparency measures Iran was prepared to bring to next week's talks. 
 The revelation will make the talks, the first in a year, even more fraught. Expectations of any breakthrough became even more muted as no Iranian government, and particularly not this one, can seem to cave to outside pressure. 
 ''Expectations ought to be pretty low,'' said one Iran analyst, speaking anonymously because he still travels there. ''The best outcome for the first meeting is that there is a second meeting. If the vulnerability gets them to a second meeting, that is success.''

HEADLINE: Did Bankers' Pay Add to This Mess?

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com

 BODY:
 PROPOSALS to cap the compensation of bank C.E.O.'s have gained traction lately as a means of heading off another financial crisis.
 World leaders at the G-20 summit meeting last week in Pittsburgh agreed in principle to reform executive compensation, with the goals of reducing risk-seeking behavior and avoiding a future global credit shock. 
 But will these measures work? And did C.E.O. compensation really play an important role in the recent crisis? Unfortunately, there is no consensus among academic experts. 
 There is certainly some support for the broad assumptions behind this argument, notably in a working paper by Lucian A. Bebchuk and Holger Spamann, both professors at Harvard Law School, that began circulating earlier this year. It argues that compensation for bank C.E.O.'s is asymmetrical -- that they often stand to make much more money when their banks succeed than they could lose if their banks fail.
 The professors pointed to the large proportion of C.E.O. compensation that often comes from options, and to the huge leverage implicit in many banks' operations. In short, Professor Bebchuk said in an interview, bank chief executives generally have an incentive for ''excessive risk-taking.''
 Still, Rene M. Stulz, a finance professor at the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State University, says he has been unable to find empirical evidence that incentives encouraging excessive risk-taking played a large role in the credit crisis. Professor Stulz and a co-author, Rudiger Fahlenbrach, a finance professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, examined the relationship between bank performance during the crisis and C.E.O. pay incentives.
 Their study has circulated since summer as a working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research. The study found few significant correlations one way or the other, but to the extent it saw patterns, they generally ran counter to what's often assumed. Instead of performing worse, the banks whose C.E.O.'s had the greatest incentives for excessive risk-taking fared better, on average, than others.
 Professor Bebchuk, via e-mail, said he and Professor Spamann had not tried in their study to assess the evidence presented in the Stulz-Fahlenbrach study. But even if one accepted that evidence at face value, he added, it wouldn't mean that bankers' incentives were inconsequential. 
 Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, concurs. Mr. Frank, whose committee is considering pay reform legislation, said in an interview that it is entirely possible that in something as complex as the credit crisis, any one factor taken in isolation can seem insignificant even when it plays a large role.
 In any case, Professor Stulz says he agrees that it is important for C.E.O. pay incentives to reward long-term performance and to discourage excessive risk-taking. Still, based on his study, he says that ''it is not right to blame the credit crisis'' on C.E.O. pay incentives. 
 And he says there is little evidence that compensation reform would have helped head off the crisis. For example, he says, ''neither bank C.E.O.'s nor regulators thought that banks were taking excessive risks.'' So if the risks were viewed as small, he adds, ''compensation incentives would not induce them to avoid those risks.''
 He points out that in 2006, a collateralized-debt obligation with a triple-A rating didn't look like a huge risk. ''On the contrary, it looked like an extremely low-risk asset,'' he says. ''Yet, banks incurred extremely large losses on such C.D.O.'s.'' 
 Regulations that would have encouraged executives to take on less risk, he adds, might have made matters worse because executives ''might well have chosen to invest even more in AAA-rated C.D.O.'s and other asset-backed securities.'' 
 PROFESSOR STULZ also notes that bank C.E.O.'s lost a lot of their own money during the credit crisis. 
 He and Professor Fahlenbrach studied 98 banks that were part of the Standard & Poor's 1500-stock index at the end of 2006, relying on the government's Standard Industrial Classification system to determine which companies to consider as banks. 
 They found that the C.E.O.'s of these banks lost more than $30 million, on average, of their investments in their own banks in 2007 and 2008, and that the executives who headed Bear Stearns and Lehman at the onset of the crisis lost close to $1 billion each.
 ''If the prospect of losing those amounts was insufficient to induce the firms' C.E.O.'s to pursue different policies,'' Professor Stulz says, ''it's extremely difficult to imagine any compensation reform package that contains incentives that would do the trick.'' 
 In short, then, we may want to change executive pay practices for a variety of social, political and moral reasons. And it's plausible that compensation does generally affect risk-taking behavior. But so far, the evidence doesn't show a specific link between that pay and the recent debacle. 
 So we may be fooling ourselves if we think that compensation reforms, by themselves, will prevent another crisis.

HEADLINE: The Promotion That Got Away

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN. 
E-mail: ccouch@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Q.You were just passed over for a promotion that you believe you deserved. You are shocked but don't want to mishandle the situation. What should you do?
 A. First, calm down. You may feel as if you've just sustained a body blow, but you need time to put this decision into perspective and analyze it.
 If you are feeling emotional, try to say very little at first because you could end up doing something counterproductive, said John Beeson, founder of Beeson Consulting in Manhattan. 
 ''Your boss is probably feeling guilty and is not prepared to give you good reasons for the decision,'' Mr. Beeson said. ''Just say: 'I am disappointed. I am not challenging the decision, but I would like to come back to you in a few days and get some feedback that would help me manage my career.' That tells your boss you're not giving up and you want more information.'' 
 Q.After you've calmed down, what's the best way to find out why you didn't get the promotion? 
 A. First, answer some basic questions. Were you aware of the possibility that someone else would get the promotion? How important was this promotion to you? And how is the company doing over all -- were you the only person who didn't get a promotion this year?
 ''The answers to these questions will allow you to understand the decision in a very pragmatic way,'' said Ana Dutra, C.E.O. of Korn/Ferry International's Leadership and Talent Consulting group in Chicago. 
 Talk to a mentor if you have one, or find one or two people who understand the organization and will speak candidly to you about why they think you weren't promoted, said Rick Maurer, president of Maurer & Associates, a change management consulting firm Arlington, Va., and author of ''Why Don't You Want What I Want?'' 
 Be willing to just listen and not interrupt, he said. ''If you start defending yourself,'' he said, ''you won't get any more information.''
 Q. When you meet with your boss to discuss the decision, should you try to convince him or her to reconsider?
 A. No. The outcome may not seem fair to you, and it could be that you really were the best person for the job. Maybe office politics played a role. But you need to consider the decision as final.
 What you want now is feedback, said Jane S. Goldner, a management consultant and author of ''Driven to Success: A 10-Point Checkup for Achieving High Performance in Business.'' 
 Asking why you didn't get the promotion will only put your boss on the defensive. ''It's far more productive to ask what you need to do to be the best-qualified person next time,'' she said. 
 Unfortunately, managers can be vague when it comes to this kind of feedback, so press for specifics. ''If they say you need to work on communication skills, for example, ask what needs work -- written communication, group communication, one-on-one? You need to know what to focus on,'' Ms. Goldner said.
 Convey your desire to learn what skills you need to develop, Mr. Beeson said. If possible, speak not only with your boss, but also with senior executives you work with.
 ''Ask them for examples of how you have fallen short,'' he advised. ''At the end of the meeting, ask what two things above all others would most build their confidence in your ability to succeed at a higher level. It is usually one or two things holding someone back, and you want to know what those two things are.'' 
 Be aware of your body language during the meeting, Mr. Maurer said. Your boss is watching you to see how you are taking the information. ''Don't get defensive,'' he said.
 Q.How do you demonstrate to your boss and other senior executives that you are working to develop the skills necessary for a promotion? 
 A. After the meeting, send your boss an action plan that reiterates your discussion and the goals that have been set, and that tells your boss what you need from him or her in order to be successful -- perhaps periodic meetings to assess performance, Ms. Dutra said. ''Mangers love the fact that someone is saying 'I need your help,''' she said.
 Q. How do you manage your anger and frustration while working toward the next promotion opportunity?
 A. Managing those feelings is vital, because negativity in the office can be a career killer, said Shawn Achor, a teaching fellow in psychology at Harvard and C.E.O. of Aspirant, a management consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.
 Mr. Achor studies the effects of positive and negative attitudes on job performance. He says that people who have a sour attitude begin to deconstruct their social support systems at work and lose their connection to co-workers. ''Then they become the toxic person on the team,'' he said.
 A positive attitude, however, brings more intelligence to a task, allows you to see more possibilities and work longer and better with those around you, he said.
 Instead of dwelling on the disappointment, he said, write down a list of the things that are outside your control, like the economy or office politics -- and focus your energy and time on what you can control, like your performance.

HEADLINE: Smuggling Europe's Waste to Poorer Countries

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: ROTTERDAM, the Netherlands 

 BODY:
When two inspectors swung open the doors of a battered red shipping container here, they confronted a graveyard of Europe's electronic waste -- old wires, electricity meters, circuit boards -- mixed with remnants of cardboard and plastic.
 ''This is supposed to be going to China, but it isn't going anywhere,'' said Arno Vink, an inspector from the Dutch environment ministry who impounded the container because of Europe's strict new laws that place restrictions on all types of waste exports, from dirty pipes to broken computers to household trash. 
 Exporting waste illegally to poor countries has become a vast and growing international business, as companies try to minimize the costs of new environmental laws, like those here, that tax waste or require that it be recycled or otherwise disposed of in an environmentally responsible way. 
 Rotterdam, the busiest port in Europe, has unwittingly become Europe's main external garbage chute, a gateway for trash bound for places like China, Indonesia, India and Africa. There, electronic waste and construction debris containing toxic chemicals are often dismantled by children at great cost to their health. Other garbage that is supposed to be recycled according to European law may be simply burned or left to rot, polluting air and water and releasing the heat-trapping gases linked to global warming. 
 While much of the international waste trade is legal, sent to qualified overseas recyclers, a big chunk is not. For a price, underground traders make Europe's waste disappear overseas.
 After Europe first mandated recycling electronics like televisions and computers, two to three tons of electronic waste was turned in last year, far less than the seven tons anticipated. Much of the rest was probably exported illegally, according to the European Environment Agency. 
 Paper, plastic and metal trash exported from Europe rose tenfold from 1995 to 2007, the agency says, with 20 million containers of waste now shipped each year either legally or illegally. Half of that passes through this huge port, where trucks and ships exchange goods around the clock. 
 In the United States, more states are passing laws that require the recycling of goods, especially electronics. But because the United States places fewer restrictions on trash exports and monitors them far less than Europe, that increasing volume is flowing relatively freely overseas, mostly legally, experts say. Up to 100 containers of waste from the United States and Canada arrive each day, according to environmental groups and local authorities in Hong Kong.
 ''Now we are collecting far more, but they can't prevent it from going offshore. People talk about 'leakage,' but it's really a hemorrhage,'' said Jim Puckett, director of the Basel Action Network, a Seattle-based environmental nonprofit that tracks waste exported from the United States.
 The temptation to export waste is great because recycling properly at home is expensive: Because of Europe's new environmental laws, it is four times as expensive to incinerate trash in the Netherlands as to put it -- illegally -- on a boat to China. And the vast container ships that arrive in Europe and North America from Asia filled with cheap garments and electrical goods now have a profitable return cargo: garbage like steel cables, circuit boards and leftovers from last night's pasta meal.
 ''The traffic in waste exports has become enormous,'' said Christian Fischer, chief consultant on waste to the European Environment Agency, which released its first study on the topic this year, ''but we need much better information about it.''
 The Dutch have taken a lonely lead in inspecting waste exports and curbing the traffic, providing a rare window into the trade. They estimate that 16 percent of the exports are illegal. But in most ports where customs inspectors typically check imports far more thoroughly than exports, much probably passes through unnoticed. 
 In July, a shipment of 1,400 metric tons of British household garbage that was illegally sent to South America -- labeled as clean plastic for recycling -- was apprehended only after it landed in Brazil. 
 Rotterdam uses X-rays and computer analysis of shipping documents to pick out suspicious containers. But other countries need to do more, said Albert Klingenberg of the Dutch environment ministry, adding: ''When they can't get it out in Rotterdam, they go to Antwerp or Hamburg.''
 The European Union's laws governing waste disposal require more recycling of paper and plastic each year, and generally prohibit dumping in landfills. Incineration is now heavily taxed in most European countries.
 The regulations also prohibit exporting waste to poorer parts of the world unless the receiving country accepts that kind of waste and it is going to a certified recycler. The guidelines fully ban the export of certain hazardous materials and so-called ''problematic'' waste, defined as waste that is not amenable to recycling and so would be harmful to the environment at its destination, for example, waste that is soggy or mixed household garbage. 
 The European laws generally follow the guidelines of the 1992 Basel Convention, the treaty that regulates dangerous exports of waste, and a proposed 1998 amendment. 
 The United States, during the Bush administration, was one of the few countries that did not ratify the convention. And much of the trash trade banned by Europe is still legal in the United States, where laws focus on only the most hazardous waste.
 That may change. A State Department official, who insisted on anonymity because the new administration had not formally reviewed its policy, said, ''We'll be grappling with that in this administration.''
 Some types of waste exports are environmentally sound, experts say. If products and packaging used in Europe are manufactured in Asia it may make sense to ship them back for recycling. The waste trade -- legal and illegal -- is partly propelled by the fact that fast-growing economies like China's and India's need the raw material. From Rotterdam, paper, plastic and metals tend to be sent to China. Electronic waste tends to go to African countries, in particular Ghana, Egypt and Nigeria.
 But companies in Africa and Asia are ''highly variable'' in their recycling capabilities, dependability and safety records, said Mr. Fischer, the consultant to the environment agency. 
 In Rotterdam, inspectors uncover endless ploys to subvert the system: Containers are packed with legal goods in front to hide illegal material. TVs and computers are labeled as secondhand goods, which can be legally shipped, even though they are destined for dismantling.
 The inspections office here is filled with plastic bags containing evidence; grease-covered pipes, fluid from toner cartridges and a mix of paper and plastic scraps share space with more traditional trafficking fare like cocaine, weapons and fake Croc clogs.
 Despite fines of up to $22,000, traffickers feel it is worth the risk to send trash abroad, although repeat violations can lead to criminal prosecution.
 Last year, the Dutch returned 80 illegal shipments to their countries of origin, their usual policy. But that is not always possible. 
 In one case, inspectors seized an American container carrying old paint cans and other material to Nigeria. They could not send it back, because the United States is not a party to the Basel Convention. Anyway, the hazardous contents were leaking, and the Dutch were left to dispose of them properly.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 29, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about illegal shipments of electronic waste from European Union nations to poorer countries misstated both the amount of waste turned in legally last year for recycling within the European Union and the amount it had expected to receive. Two million to three million tons was turned in -- not two to three tons -- and seven million tons had been anticipated, not seven tons.

 BODY:
Rocky economic times have a way of sending us back to basics -- local tomatoes over imported foie gras, for example. Travel is no exception. Nowadays just having a nice time matters more than get-there-first bragging rights. 
Despite, or perhaps because of, the recession, ''people are deciding to treat themselves,'' says Barbara Gallay of the Linden Frosch agency. ''They want the excitement of travel, but they don't want risk.'' Call it blue-chip travel: erstwhile globe-trotters are getting back on planes and boats headed for classic destinations like London, the Caribbean and Napa, Calif. They're going for Tuscany because they know it delivers -- not Tirana because they heard it's interesting. And there's nothing wrong with what Gallay calls ''the cozy choice.'' That's what's readibly available now that people are increasingly planning trips on the fly. Lanie Fagan of the Cruise Lines International Association says she's seen her industry's booking window cut in half, and Stacy Small, from Elite Travel International, says clients sometimes call ''only a couple of weeks in advance. It's logistically easier to book Mexico than India at the last minute.'' And maybe, just maybe, the trend is cause for optimism. ''We're seeing people who were affected by Wall Street and canceling in October now coming back to book a trip to the Caribbean, because things didn't get as bad as they thought,'' says Malaka Hilton of Admiral Travel International. If the view from the bottom is of St. Barts, how bad could things be? ANDREA BENNETT

HEADLINE: Ornamentalism

BYLINE: By MAURA EGAN

 BODY:
At 6 a.m. on a recent Thursday, in front of a nursery school on Le Loi Street, the boulevard that runs along the Perfume River in Hue, Vietnam, 50 or so women were dancing to music blasting from a loudspeaker. Some performed an approximation of the electric slide, while others waltzed with the few men present. This would be an odd sight at any hour, and I found myself searching for hidden cameras filming ''So You Think You Can Dance, Vietnam Edition.'' 
 ''Hue women are traditional,'' explained my young guide, Vo Thi Huong Lan. ''They know how to cook and run the house. The rich ones are schooled in the arts like painting and drawing.'' Lan, as she is called, is striving to be a proper Hue woman herself. Her English, which she mastered at the local high school Ho Chi Minh attended, is letter-perfect, and she has started on ancient Chinese. She took me to visit her teacher, Ho Tan Phan, at the tiny house he shares with his wife and an enormous stockpile of ancient pots dredged from the river. His daughter, visiting from California, complained, ''My father spends all his money on these antiques. He should be spending it on vitamins, chicken and meat.'' She shook her head while her father, his legs as skinny as chopsticks, walked away. Lan sees her teacher's obsession as a loftier pursuit. ''He is the grandson of a mandarin,'' she said. In Hue, you are frequently informed of someone's rarefied lineage. 
 Vietnam's current economic boom hasn't yet altered life in Hue as it has in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, allowing the city to focus on preserving its cultural identity. Since the early 19th century, when Emperor Gia Long, the founder of the Nguyen dynasty, moved the seat of government here, in the middle of the country, Hue has been Vietnam's epicenter of scholarship, arts and Buddhism. 
 As you head toward the citadel of Gia Long's magnificent Imperial City, along elegant Tran Hung Dao Street, where vendors sell antiques and birds in Rococo-style cages beside frangipani-dotted riverbanks, you begin to understand why the emperor chose this spot. (The French also became enamored, invading Hue in 1883 and serving as the country's de facto rulers for the next 70 years.) 
 Hue still harks back to the centuries-old way of life depicted in the watercolor paintings hawked as souvenirs: wooden sampans floating in the water, tiny women in conical hats, remote pagodas on hilltops. Yet there is also a new whiff of go-go capitalism: a couple of ''six-star resorts,'' as the locals call the two behemoths nearing completion; vendors burning incense to pray for good business; motorbike drivers as fast and furious as Ho Chi Minh City's Evel Knievels; and, inside the Dong Ba market, scales to weigh yourself. Getting fatter is a sign of health and wealth, I was told. 
 ''We are a city of feng shui,'' said Phan Thuan An, a historian who lives with his wife, a descendant of Emperor Dong Khanh, on a bamboo-shrouded lane. Phan Thuan An methodically explained how the Imperial City, which at one time had 150 temples and royal pavilions, had been built in accordance with the Chinese tradition, in order to maintain harmony between the emperor and his people, architecture and nature. As proud as Phan Thuan An is of Hue's imperial past, he's also concerned about the city losing touch with it. Some of it has been co-opted into a sort of turnstile tourism -- sunset river rides on gaudy dragon boats, restaurants offering imperial feasts, where customers dress up in royal garb and dine on multicourse meals. (Hue is actually an epicurean paradise, with fantastic food even at the most humble-looking pho stalls.) 
 For Brother Phap Dang, a Buddhist monk who lives at the Tu Hieu Pagoda, questions about Hue's past and future hold little relevance. Dang's blissed-out grin, one that most people could achieve only through a serious number of sedatives, is testament to the prevailing Zen attitude. In between their studies and worship, the younger monks scurry up trees to knock down jackfruits, chop wood or kick around a soccer ball. The royal eunuchs retired at Tu Hieu, where Dang, who spent years in the United States, is content to live out his days. ''You should come back for a walking meditation,'' he told me. ''Each step is your destination. You feel alive, to touch the tree. To hear the cricket.'' 
 You could dismiss Dang's promises as New Age mumbo jumbo. That is, until you reach the nearby tomb of Emperor Tu Duc. Most of the Hue kings built extravagant mausoleums, but Tu Duc created nirvana on his plot in 1864. Although a mediocre monarch, Tu Duc excelled in architecture -- his sprawling walled city has elegant pavilions, a royal theater, gardens and artificial lakes, all surrounded by pine forest. Instead of fighting the French colonialists, the emperor spent most of his reign fishing, meditating, entertaining his 104 wives and many concubines, and writing more than 4,000 poems. 
 The kings and the concubines may be gone, but Hue still embodies a kind of heaven-on-earth quality, a place that makes the here and now seem enough. That seemed to be Lan's opinion, as we looked over Tu Duc's spread. ''It's a nice place to die,'' she said. MAURA EGAN

HEADLINE: Tuning In Too Late

BYLINE: By CLARK HOYT.

 BODY:
ON Sept. 12, an Associated Press article inside The Times reported that the Census Bureau had severed its ties to Acorn, the community organizing group. Robert Groves, the census director, was quoted as saying that Acorn, one of thousands of unpaid organizations promoting the 2010 census, had become ''a distraction.''
 What the article didn't say -- but what followers of Fox News and conservative commentators already knew -- was that a video sting had caught Acorn workers counseling a bogus prostitute and pimp on how to set up a brothel staffed by under-age girls, avoid detection and cheat on taxes. The young woman in streetwalker's clothes and her companion were actually undercover conservative activists with a hidden camera.
 It was an intriguing story: employees of a controversial outfit, long criticized by Republicans as corrupt, appearing to engage in outrageous, if not illegal, behavior. An Acorn worker in Baltimore was shown telling the ''prostitute'' that she could describe herself to tax authorities as an ''independent artist'' and claim 15-year-old prostitutes, supposedly illegal immigrants, as dependents. 
 But for days, as more videos were posted and government authorities rushed to distance themselves from Acorn, The Times stood still. Its slow reflexes -- closely following its slow response to a controversy that forced the resignation of Van Jones, a White House adviser -- suggested that it has trouble dealing with stories arising from the polemical world of talk radio, cable television and partisan blogs. Some stories, lacking facts, never catch fire. But others do, and a newspaper like The Times needs to be alert to them or wind up looking clueless or, worse, partisan itself.
 Some editors told me they were not immediately aware of the Acorn videos on Fox, YouTube and a new conservative Web site called BigGovernment.com. When the Senate voted to cut off all federal funds to Acorn, there was not a word in the newspaper or on its Web site. When the New York City Council froze all its funding for Acorn and the Brooklyn district attorney opened a criminal investigation, there was still nothing.
 Readers noticed. James Jeff Crocket of New Britain, Conn., spoke for many when he said he was sure he knew why the paper was silent: ''protecting the progressive movement.''
 Finally, on Sept. 16, nearly a week after the first video was posted, The Times took note of the controversy, under the headline, ''Conservatives Draw Blood From Acorn, Favored Foe.'' The article said that conservatives hoped to weaken the Obama administration by attacking its allies and appointees they viewed as leftist. The conservatives thought they had a ''winning formula,'' the article said, mobilizing people ''to dig up dirt,'' then trumpeting it on talk radio and television.
 By stressing the politics, the article irritated more readers. ''A suspicious person might see an attempt to deflect criticism of Acorn by highlighting how those pesky conservatives are at it again,'' said Albert Smith of Chatham, N.J.
 I thought politics was emphasized too much, at the expense of questions about an organization whose employees in city after city participated in outlandish conversations about illegal and immoral activities. (Acorn suggested some videos were doctored but fired or suspended many of the employees.)
 The Times quoted a statement by Bertha Lewis, Acorn's chief executive, saying that the two activists, James O'Keefe, 25, and Hannah Giles, 20, spent months visiting Acorn offices in San Diego, Los Angeles, Miami and Philadelphia before getting the responses they wanted. But the article left out one city Lewis cited: New York. Between the time of her statement and the publication of the article, a new video surfaced, featuring an Acorn worker in Brooklyn advising Giles to bury money from prostitution in a tin.
 Some readers saw a deliberate effort by the paper to help Lewis out of a tight spot. Scott Shane, the reporter, said he had been unable to reach Lewis and felt that including New York among the cities she mentioned would have implied unfairly that she was lying, something for which he had no evidence. He said he thought it was unlikely that employees in New York would inform her of their misconduct before the video appeared. I think he should have included New York. One persistent complaint about Acorn is that it fails to manage its staff. Lewis's statement was removed from Acorn's Web site after a video was posted with an Acorn worker from San Diego suggesting how to smuggle girls across the border.
 Shane said he thought it was correct to approach the Acorn sting as a political story. Absent that aspect, he said, the discussion of prostitution by low-level employees was not compelling news.
 Some conservatives think O'Keefe and Giles were doing work that should have been done by the mainstream media. But most news organizations consider such tactics unethical -- The Times specifically prohibits reporters from misrepresenting themselves or making secret recordings. And the two were sloppy with facts. One Acorn employee who bragged about killing one of her former husbands said she knew she was being scammed and was playing along. The police said they found her ex-husbands alive.
 Dean Baquet, the Washington bureau chief, said, ''We did not ignore the Acorn story, so I don't think it's fair for people to say we blew it off.'' The paper's follow-up coverage has included a profile of O'Keefe, a report on a House vote to deny funds to Acorn, and an article on the Internal Revenue Service's decision to drop Acorn from its volunteer tax assistance program. Baquet said people need to keep Acorn in perspective with other Washington stories: health care, two wars and the deep recession. 
 Jill Abramson, the managing editor for news, agreed with me that the paper was ''slow off the mark,'' and blamed ''insufficient tuned-in-ness to the issues that are dominating Fox News and talk radio.'' She and Bill Keller, the executive editor, said last week that they would now assign an editor to monitor opinion media and brief them frequently on bubbling controversies. Keller declined to identify the editor, saying he wanted to spare that person ''a bombardment of e-mails and excoriation in the blogosphere.''
 Despite what the critics think, Abramson said the problem was not liberal bias.
 Tom Rosenstiel, the director of the Pew Project for Excellence in Journalism, said he has studied journalists for years, and though they are more liberal than the general population, he believes they are motivated by the desire to get good stories, not to help one particular side. Conservatives who believe The Times isn't critical of Democrats forget that the paper broke damaging stories about the personal finances of Representative Charles Rangel and the hiring of prostitutes by Eliot Spitzer.
 But Rosenstiel said The Times has a particular problem with conservatives, especially after its article last year suggesting that John McCain had an extramarital affair. And Republicans earlier this year charged that the paper killed a story about Acorn that would have been a ''game changer'' in the presidential election -- a claim I found to be false.
 ''If you know you are a target, it requires extra vigilance,'' Rosenstiel said. ''Even the suspicion of a bias is a problem all by itself.''

HEADLINE: Through the Flamingo Doors

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE ROSENBLUM. 
E-mail: habitats@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ANDREW HENDERSON, the transplanted Englishman who is a curator in the Institute of Systematic Botany at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, may not be the world's leading expert on palms. 
 He is, however, among the top two or three. His nine-page single-spaced resume indicates that he has traveled to 30-plus countries, written or co-written 7 books and 81 scientific papers, and won 42 grants and awards, including $300,000 from the MacArthur Foundation. Not the so-called ''genius'' award, but still impressive.
 One might assume that a person with such stellar credentials would live in similarly impressive surroundings. Not exactly. 
 When Dr. Henderson, 59, is not studying some of the world's most challenging flora in some of the world's most demanding regions, he is ensconced with his family in a modest two-bedroom apartment in a fading Deco-ish building in the Bedford Park section of the Bronx. Etched on the glass in the front door are a pair of flamingoes, birds that flourish, like the palm tree, in tropical or subtropical climates. It's a nice touch for this particular resident. 
 Dr. Henderson came to the United States in 1982 to study for a doctorate at the City University of New York, and he has worked at the botanical garden, first as a graduate student, ever since. His first apartment was in the building next door to his current residence; he moved here in 1996, after his marriage.
 The location is ideal for anyone who works at the garden -- Dr. Henderson is steps away from his office -- and it is nearly as convenient for his wife, Flor Henderson, a Peruvian-born biologist who teaches at Hostos Community College in the South Bronx.
 And because the Hendersons are distant from the much pricier precincts of Manhattan, they pay just $1,200 for their two-bedroom apartment. ''A real estate broker would call it a huge two-bedroom,'' Dr. Henderson commented dryly. 
 The sixth-floor unit, on East 201st Street, includes a pocket-sized terrace on which the family grow tomatoes, cucumbers and nasturtiums. The terrace is also home to a Latania palm that is native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. 
 ''It was given to me more than 10 years ago when it was a tiny little thing,'' Dr. Henderson said. He can point out the Mascarene Islands on the map of the world that hangs near the dining room table.
 The location that is so convenient for the Hendersons' work has a downside, largely involving the couple's daughter, Lidia, and their son, Alfred.
 ''I don't love it,'' Ms. Henderson admitted. ''Especially with the children.'' 
 Alfred and Lidia, both teenagers, go to school in Manhattan, and while they can now ride the subway alone, there is still considerable to-ing and fro-ing, particularly when it comes to seeing friends. Still, the always complicated equation involving jobs, children and money means that the family is staying put, at least for now.
 This part of the Bronx was once far more troubled; on Dr. Henderson's first day in the neighborhood back in 1982, he saw police cars racing through the streets in search of a dead body, or so he was told. The elevated trains were so blanketed in graffiti, he had no idea what they were.
 These days, the neighborhood is calmer and certainly safer. Even so, the street on which the Hendersons live is home to one after another down-at-the-heels frame house with a dingy facade and an overgrown lawn. And whatever claims a real estate broker might make about the size of the Hendersons' apartment, it offers little elbow room. 
 The couple have generously bequeathed the master bedroom to their daughter, who has filled it with her doll collection and a formidable assortment of costume jewelry. Their son has the second, smaller bedroom, outfitted with a bunk bed and decorated with dozens of little yellow plastic ducks. The parents sleep in what was formerly the dining room, their quarters separated from the galley kitchen by a screen.
 Above their bed is a colorful poster depicting the yellow-eared parrot, an endangered species found in the Andes in Colombia and closely associated with a palm that is also endangered. In one corner is the metal crate to which Lucy, the Hendersons' hyperactive Westie, is relegated when she gets too exuberant for her own good. 
 Even though space is tight, the apartment nonetheless stands as a testament to Dr. Henderson's life's work, and has one great distinction.
 ''It is home to the world's greatest collection of completely useless items made from palms,'' he said one recent afternoon, lounging barefoot on the couch in the living room in front of the coffee table that doubles as his home office. 
 In that assessment, he may be correct.
 On the wall behind him were two tawny items that looked as beautiful as sculptures -- a gracefully hung hammock made from fibers from the leaves of a palm found in Brazil and a matching tablecloth made from fibers from the leaves of a Venezuelan palm. On low shelves against the opposite wall sat an array of brooms and fans fashioned from palm leaves and fibers, along with bowls and a pillow from Vietnam, all made from rattan. Hats and bags made of palm leaves and fibers decorate the bedroom.
 Though palms are often extremely beautiful and endlessly varied, they are among the most demanding flora to study. The leaves of many species, especially rattans, are extremely spiny, making them dangerous to handle, and the regions they call home tend to be hot, wet and remote and populated by snakes, scorpions and wasps.
 But Dr. Henderson clearly has a taste for what others might regard as unlovable items. On display in his living room is his collection of animal skulls, many of which still have their teeth intact. His holdings include a badger, a beaver, a rabbit, a deer from Dartmoor in England and a few rodents from eBay. 
 ''The kids think it's a little strange,'' he said. ''But cleaned up, they don't look so bad. And they last forever.''
 Above the skulls, as if keeping watch, sits a cluster of tall, elongated wooden figures, some wearing tiny hats: a doll collection belonging to his wife. 
 The apartment also represents a shrine of sorts to Dr. Henderson's extensive travels. Decor includes an anatomically correct print of a fish acquired from the Royal Academy of Arts in London, a haunting image of hands from Myanmar, and a tapestry from Haiti.
 Dr. Henderson is working on a project that involves the conservation and use of palms, especially rattan, a material that has considerable economic importance because of its versatility. As part of this work, he is off to Vietnam next month. 
 Do his children share his interest in the subject?
 ''Not really,'' he admitted ruefully. ''When I talk about my work, their eyes glaze over and they change the subject. They think it's of no value to anybody.''

HEADLINE: Enter the Recession's Waiting Room

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

DATELINE: Columbus, Neb. 

 BODY:
 A BUNCH of the guys drove straight to a bar. You get laid off from a job that pays $15 an hour, plus health care and other benefits -- it's Miller time. Time for a convoy to one of the watering holes in this town, 80 miles west of Omaha, where you can buy a beer at 10 in the morning.
 Few of the employees of Katana Summit, a wind-tower manufacturer, saw it coming. On that day in early August, and in another round of cuts a few weeks later, about half of the plant's 195-person payroll was eliminated, a shock that came with one notable consolation: the executives said they hoped to hire everyone back soon.
 They seemed to mean it, too. As Kevin Strudthoff, the chief executive, explained that day, this was a ''temporary layoff,'' but there was a limit to what Katana could promise. The company, privately held, said it landed a multimillion-dollar deal last year to provide 225 wind towers to a turbine maker that it declined to identify. But when the credit crisis hit, wind-farm developers found it all but impossible to raise money, killing demand for wind towers. 
 In June, the turbine maker called Katana and said it was temporarily suspending its order. Layoffs were then inevitable.
 Charles Salak, a burly, 39-year-old welder with an unruly goatee, was among the newly jobless that morning. But instead of commiserating with friends at the Sahara Lounge, he drove directly to the unemployment office, or Workforce Development, as it is called here. He was thinking about his wife and three children and how nuts he would go without a paycheck and something to do. Why not start looking right away?
 ''I was getting these text messages from my friends saying: 'Where are you?' We got a cold one for you,' '' he recalled over lunch at a local fast-food chain called Runza. ''I just wrote them back and said, 'Nah, you guys drink it.' ''
 The question now is whether that order for 225 towers will be scaled back or canceled. If it's canceled, Katana Summit won't operate at even a fraction of full capacity anytime soon and won't need Charles Salak and his co-workers for the foreseeable future -- if, indeed, it ever needs them again.
 It is early September, and Mr. Salak and Mr. Strudthoff -- the semiterminated and the semiterminator -- are living parallel lives. Neither of these men is idle, but each is living in that awkward, immiserating limbo where it's clear, or maybe just clearer than usual, that your future and financial well-being are determined by forces beyond your control.
 That limbo is arguably the quintessential American experience of the moment. When the Great Recession is dissected into its component parts, this might be remembered as the Waiting Phase. It's not as scary as the Plummeting Phase of last year, or as event-filled as the To-the-Ramparts Phase of several months ago, but that doesn't make it any easier.
 A real recovery, we have heard time and again, won't begin in earnest until the jobless rate, now at a 26-year high of 9.7 percent, starts to fall. But what will it take for the rehiring to start? What do companies like Katana need to see before they call back people like Charles Salak?
 What, in other words, are we waiting for?
 Every company has a different answer, because every company is linked to a different piece of the Rube Goldberg contraption that is our economy. In the case of Mr. Salak and Katana, the wait is connected to a broad array of factors: the flow of credit, green power initiatives, dozens of small and large choices in the hands of people who live far from here.
 Ultimately, though, the wait at Katana boils down to a phone call. Under terms of the deal, the turbine maker had until the close of business on Sept. 25 -- last Friday -- to decide whether to scale back its order or walk away from it altogether.
 Stop or go. Wait or get back to work. At the time of this visit to Columbus, nobody knew what would happen.
 ''I hope they call us early in the day,'' said Mr. Strudthoff a couple of weeks back. ''That would be courteous.''
 COLUMBUS, a city of 21,000, has the highest per-capita rate of manufacturing employment of any place in Nebraska. It produces car seats, burger patties, ethanol, bug traps, dog kennels, grain tubs -- the list goes on. A handful of Fortune 500 companies have a presence here.
 With so much manufacturing concentrated in such a small place, Columbus is a laboratory of blue-collar capitalism that, until recently, was remarkably efficient at putting people to work. Jobs were so plentiful that the local Chamber of Commerce sent representatives to towns in Iowa and Michigan where factories were closing, hoping to persuade families to relocate. The local unemployment rate was typically just over 4 percent.
 For decades, civic leaders courted manufacturers with publicly owned land set aside for factories, with a support structure for industrial repairs and with a work force that, like much of Nebraska's, is not unionized. Manufacturers knew that they would have ample latitude in hiring, firing and overseeing their employees, because labor organizers gave up on Columbus long ago.
 ''I think of it as the most anti-union town on the planet,'' says Ken Mass, the president of the Nebraska A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''Back in the late '70s, early '80s, the Machinists International Union went there, handbilling, getting their name out. A patrolman just told them to leave.'' 
 Subsequent union organizing efforts, he says, caused companies to threaten to relocate -- and that was the end of that.
 The management-friendly atmosphere has lured lots of corporations, which in turn lured people like Mr. Salak, who was raised in Arizona and has relatives in Schuyler, a nearby town. The deal was: Manufacturers could make the rules largely as they saw fit, and in return workers got steady jobs in a place where it was relatively cheap to live.
 A sign about 17 miles outside of town says ''Columbus Is Open for Business,'' and the more time you spend here, the more literal those words sound.
 You can see management's unfettered hand in the vaguely Dickensian hours that many here work, and you sense an emphasis on unfettered growth in the just-build-it ethos that governs the stretch of strip malls on the road that bisects the town. It's fast food, a Wal-Mart, a J. C. Penney, check-cashing outlets and dozens of other stores. The traffic to this generic stretch has come at the apparent expense of a fading but picturesque downtown -- a Hopper-esque setting, with a railroad station, some gorgeous early 20th century buildings and a former opera house that is now a minimall. 
 But Columbus is a place with affordable homes, newly renovated schools and very little crime. It has a small-town, rural Midwestern feel but has always been expanding enough to be vital and robust. Layoffs aside, there is very little turnover in the work force at the plants here -- and a major reason is that people like their jobs and like their town.
 ''This is a community,'' says Mr. Salak, ''with a lot of down-to-earth people.''
 Columbus rarely makes national news, though it did in 1997, when a Hudson Foods plant here recalled 25 million pounds of beef, then the largest recall in United States history, in an outbreak of E. coli. (The plant was subsequently sold and is now owned by Cargill.) For the most part, this place hums quietly along.
 Or it used to. Columbus was all but immune to the recession's effects for months after it was upending communities around the country.
 ''We kind of lag the coasts,'' says Mike Moser, the town's mayor, who also owns a musical instrument store. ''We don't have the highs that you see in other parts of the county, and we don't have the lows. But we're feeling it now.''
 ONE of the first places with a recession tremor was the Behlen Manufacturing Company, which makes dozens of farm products, as well as one-story steel buildings. Behlen is the granddaddy of Columbus industry, and in a warren of offices beside its factory floor, the company's history is told in photographs, including an image of one of its steel huts, which was used to test the effects of the first nuclear bomb when it was detonated in New Mexico in 1945.
 By January of this year, orders for the building segment of the business had all but dried up. Behlen tried a number of strategies to cut costs, including layoffs, and eventually the company shed about 200 of its 1,050 jobs. The executives said they hoped to rehire many of those who left as soon as the phones started ringing again.
 Among those laid off was Heather Ziemba, a shy 30-year-old with light blonde hair. She started three years ago at Behlen, working a computer-operated lathe on the factory floor, and then had a desk job, coordinating orders.
 She sat one afternoon on a bench outside Workforce Development, a place she visits once a week to comb through new job listings. She had just returned from an interview with a newly opened hotel looking for an assistant manager.
 ''They offered me the job, but at $8 an hour,'' she says, a little exasperated. That's about what she earns from unemployment checks. And by her calculations, given her expenses -- which include raising five children -- it isn't enough. She told the hotel that she would consider $9 an hour. The hotel said no.
 This the ninth month of Ms. Ziemba's wait, the longest spell of unemployment she has endured since she started working at age 15, commuting to Columbus from her parents' home 30 miles away to work at a medical device plant. By 17, she had moved to town, and by 19 she had her first child.
 The man she is now with brought one child to the relationship, and together the couple have had three more. They are engaged but there are no plans for a wedding.
 ''He's the sixth child,'' she says with a tight grin.
 Ms. Ziemba has been attending Central Community College, part time, for the last two years, and this summer she received a degree in business administration. It was supposed to be a ticket to a different pay scale, but her expectations have been trimmed. Her latest plan is to earn enough credits online, through a college in Omaha, to parlay her C.C.C. diploma into an undergraduate degree. But that will cost at least $10,000. It's the kind of expense that a handful of the more generous employers in Columbus help cover -- Behlen among them.
 It's one more reason Ms. Ziemba misses the place. She has always been fond of the Raimondos, the family that owns and runs the business. There is Tony Sr. -- known as T. R. -- and his sons, Tony Jr. and Phil.
 ''You could have a real conversation with them,'' she says. ''And initially, when my job was eliminated, they said, 'Don't worry, we'll find you something else out on the floor.' Then a whole month went by and they didn't say anything. Then one of them said to me, 'Did you decide what you're going to do?' I thought, 'Did you think somebody would take care of this problem for you, because nobody talked to me about it.' ''
 TONY JR. is offering a golf cart tour of the Behlen factory floor. It is 850,000 square feet, large enough for 17 football fields.
 You think of a place like this as a hive of loud and well-coordinated action, but little is happening here. It is like driving into a city that is under a hurricane watch, with just a few stragglers left behind. Every minute or two, you come upon a couple of guys who are galvanizing metal or fabricating tubing. Mostly, it's quiet.
 ''We're hopeful,'' says Tony Jr., driving past an unused Wiedematic steel punching machine. ''But it's really strange to see it like this. The other day I looked through this window in a door to the factory floor and it was dark. During second shift.''
 What are the Raimondos looking for as a first sign that it might be time to start rehiring?
 Orders from hobby farmers, says T. R., sitting in his office and looking through the latest numbers. Behlen is a huge seller to Tractor Supply, a retailer beloved by both professional and amateur farmers. The amateurs tend to be fairly wealthy, white-collar types, with a couple acres of crops, some livestock and horses.
 The first sign of a pulse will come from them, with orders for horse stalls, dog kennels and watering tanks. ''That's our lead indicator,'' T. R. says. 
 Before the recession, the company sold $1.8 million a week in its Behlen Country division, which includes hobby farmer sales. That fell to $1.2 million a few months ago.
 ''I just read in our sales figures that it's up to $1.5 million for the week,'' T. R. says. ''That's the best in several months. Now, will it sustain that pace? We need a little time to find out.''
 Ms. Ziemba would go back to her former job if the Raimondos called tomorrow. For Charles Salak, it's more complicated.
 Part of it is pride. Being laid off temporarily, it turns out, is like getting the heave-ho from a girlfriend who might like to get back together, at some point. But not now, and maybe never.
 It kind of makes you feel dangled.
 ''I'm leery of them calling me, and I can't put my finger on it,'' says Mr. Salak, who is wearing a shirt with the words ''Katana Summit'' embroidered on it. ''I guess it's because we poured our heart and soul into this company and they turned around and said, 'Sorry, we don't need your assistance until further notice.' ''
 With his thick arms and loud laugh, Mr. Salak is the kind of guy you would pick first if you were in charge of a tug-of-war team. You would probably win and you would certainly have a good time. The day we met at Runza, he had just come from Katana, the first time he had been back. He and others were asked to swing by and sign up with a new health insurer the company had hired.
 It was the one perquisite they kept -- health insurance. It was a gesture intended to say, ''We're serious about hiring you back,'' and it was supposed to prevent these sort-of ex-employees from taking another job.
 It makes sense for Katana, which would need to spend weeks and a lot of money bringing a new crew up to speed if and when orders pick up. But for Mr. Salak and others, the benefit comes with a cost. The state offers plenty of retraining programs, but won't spend money on someone who is ''attached'' with a company. Mr. Salak would like to learn more sophisticated, better-paying welding techniques, but the programs on offer are not available to him on the state's dime.
 As for his own savings, well, he is running low on dimes: ''I'm approaching mac-and-cheese broke, as Jeff Foxworthy would say.''
 Later that evening, Mr. Salak is back in his home, with his wife, Lisa, and their three children. The 4-year-old twins, Riley and Lacey, take turns leaping from the sofa onto their father's back. A pair of poodles, Shadow and Chewy, take turns barking.
 Mr. Salak, now in a different ''Katana Summit'' shirt, walks outside of the three-bedroom house to show off the home improvement projects that have kept him busy in recent weeks -- new gutters, as well as a ramp for his mother, who has multiple sclerosis. Occasionally, he will work with a relative who owns a farm, repairing equipment.
 ''I'm not the sort of guy who can just sit around,'' he says. ''I could watch Nascar all day, but I'd go crazy if I did that.''
 His wife, fortunately, has a job in town, at BD Medical, where she operates a machine that makes glass syringes. Her shift starts at 6 a.m. and ends at 6 p.m, with a half-hour for lunch and one 15-minute break. She works three of these 12-hour days one week, then four the next.
 She would love to move to a shift of 8 a.m to 4 p.m., five days a week, but those openings rarely come up, and if one did, there are dozens of people at BD Medical who trump her 10 years of seniority. On days off, she cooks meals that her husband can microwave for the children, because she is at work when they want to eat.
 As for vacation, ''I've got to save up those days, so that I can stay home when one of my kids gets sick,'' she says.
 For now, the Salaks have no intention of moving to another town, mostly because they like Columbus. And for all his pique about Katana, Mr. Salak, when pressed, says he'd probably return to work if the company called. He's just tired of waiting for his phone to ring.
 THIS might be of little comfort for Mr. Salak, but the man who laid him off is tired of waiting for the phone to ring, too.
 Kevin Strudthoff has been visiting potential customers for weeks, seeking more wind-tower orders. There have been nibbles. One client is coming by for the plant for a ''quality audit.'' Another is expected to place an order soon, but nothing firm yet.
 Obviously, neither he nor his colleagues predicted anything like the disaster that befell the economy. Midway through 2008, Katana was so bullish that it spent $5 million doubling the size of its Columbus plant. And it has always paid its employees about 25 to 50 cents an hour more than most companies in town, Mr. Strudthoff says, a premium large enough for other Columbus C.E.O.'s to razz him about it in social settings.
 But he thinks wind power is a good long-term bet, and he sees Katana's current travails as a problem that will pass soon enough. Exactly how soon is still unknown. As of Friday evening, the fate of that order for 225 towers was up in the air. ''Unfortunately,'' Mr. Strudthoff wrote by e-mail, ''we're still waiting.''

HEADLINE: Insurance Mandate: The Legal Issues

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
The requirement that everyone buy health insurance moved a step closer to reality last week -- and possibly a step closer to being challenged in court.
 Conservatives and libertarians, mostly, have been advancing the theory lately that the individual mandate, in which the government would compel everyone to buy insurance or pay a penalty, is unconstitutional.
 ''I think an individual mandate will pass, and I think it's going to be very vulnerable because it exceeds Congress's constitutional authority,'' said David Rivkin, a lawyer who served in the Justice Department under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. 
 ''If you say the government can mandate your behavior as far as this type of insurance goes,'' he said, ''there will be nothing the government can't do. They can control every single way in which you dispose of your income.''
 But while Mark A. Hall, a professor of law and public health at Wake Forest University, agrees that the matter could end up in court, he says that a legal challenge is ''extremely unlikely to succeed.'' The power to impose such a mandate is firmly rooted in the Constitution, Mr. Hall said. 
 Existing case law provides lots of guidance, but ''there is not a Supreme Court decision directly on point because this is unprecedented,'' Mr. Hall said. ''Other than serving in the military through the draft or paying your taxes, it's hard to think of anything else that the federal government requires you to do just because you're a citizen.''

 Both Mr. Hall and Mr. Rivkin point to the commerce clause of the Constitution to support their views. 
 Mr. Rivkin says a mandate to buy health insurance goes beyond the scope of that clause because Congress cannot regulate activity that is not economic. But Mr. Hall says it clearly falls under the definition of economic activity.
 All five committees in the Democratic-led Congress that have taken up a health care plan this year have supported an individual mandate, with the Senate Finance Committee upholding the idea last week. The bills grant exceptions for a variety of reasons, including religious objections and financial hardship; they also exempt American Indians.
 Throughout the nation's history, the federal government has imposed its will in various ways, of course, whether through military drafts, the advent of the federal income tax or the requirement that working people contribute part of their earnings to Social Security.
 Still, a health insurance mandate would in many ways be new for the United States. In 1994, during the debate over the Clinton health care plan, the Congressional Budget Office described an individual mandate as ''an unprecedented form of federal action.''
 ''The government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the United States,'' the budget office wrote. ''An individual mandate has two features that, in combination, make it unique. First, it would impose a duty on individuals as members of society. Second, it would require people to purchase a specific service that would have to be heavily regulated by the federal government.''
 Shifting Views
 Those favoring an overhaul of the health care system say that requiring everyone to carry insurance is essential to making insurance affordable, chiefly by broadening the risk pool to include those who are young and healthy and go without insurance now. 
 The insurance lobby would not support overhauling the system without the individual mandate. President Obama supports it too, although during the presidential campaign last year he supported a mandate for children only.
 Objections have been picking up steam since Mr. Rivkin and others began writing op-ed articles against the idea this summer. And some Republicans, like Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who supported the idea earlier this year, now oppose it. Opponents say that compelling people to spend part of their income on something they may not want is an unwarranted intrusion by government. 
 Still others have questioned how the mandate would work and suggested that a government-run insurance plan, including a single-payer system, or a system of tax subsidies could be ''more efficient in containing costs and avoid the slippery slope of unconstitutional mandates.''
 The Congressional Research Service recently grappled with the legal underpinnings of an individual mandate and concluded that Congress ''may have'' the power to enact a mandate ''as part of its taxing and spending power or its power to regulate interstate commerce.''
 Still, it sees potential pitfalls, noting: ''Whether such a requirement would be constitutional under the commerce clause is perhaps the most challenging question posed by such a proposal, as it is a novel issue whether Congress may use this clause to require an individual to purchase a good or service.''
 If the individual mandate were found to be unconstitutional, the health care overhaul as it is now structured by many committees in Congress would almost certainly collapse.

HEADLINE: China's Mr. Wu Keeps Talking

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
AT 79, Wu Jinglian is considered China's most famous economist.
 In the 1980s and '90s, he was an adviser to China's leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. He helped push through some of this country's earliest market reforms, paving the way for China's spectacular rise and earning him the nickname ''Market Wu.'' 
 Last year, China's state-controlled media slapped him with a new moniker: spy. 
 Mr. Wu has not been interrogated, charged or imprisoned. But the fact that a state newspaper, The People's Daily, among others, was allowed to publish Internet rumors alleging that he had been detained on suspicions of being a spy for the United States hints that he is annoying some very important people in the government. 
 He denied the allegations, and soon after they were published, China's cabinet denied that an investigation was under way. 
 But in a country that often jails critics, Mr. Wu seems to be testing the limits of what Beijing deems permissible. While many economists argue that China's growth model is flawed, rarely does a prominent Chinese figure, in the government or out, speak with such candor about flaws he sees in China's leadership. 
 Mr. Wu -- who still holds a research post at an institute affiliated with the State Council, China's cabinet -- has white hair and an amiable face, and he appears frail. But his assessments are often harsh. In books, speeches, interviews and television appearances, he warns that conservative hardliners in the Communist Party have gained influence in the government and are trying to dismantle the market reforms he helped formulate. 
 He complains that business tycoons and corrupt officials have hijacked the economy and manipulated it for their own ends, a system he calls crony capitalism. He has even called on Beijing to establish a British-style democracy, arguing that political reform is inevitable. 
 Provocative statements have made him a kind of dissident economist here, and revealed the sharp debates behind the scenes, at the highest levels of the Communist Party, about the direction of China's half-market, half-socialist economy. 
 In many ways, it is a continuation of the debate that has been raging for three decades: What role should the government play in China's hybrid economy?
 Mr. Wu says the spy rumors were ''dirty tricks'' employed by his critics to discredit him. 
 ''I have two enemies,'' he said in a recent interview. ''The crony capitalists and the Maoists. They will use any means to attack me.''
 Nevertheless, some analysts believe that Mr. Wu's critiques are aiding one government faction in a power struggle with another, and that he is protected. 
 His pro-market ideas have influenced a generation of younger economists who now hold senior government posts, including Zhou Xiaochuan, the leader of China's central bank, and Lou Jiwei, chairman of the country's huge sovereign wealth fund. 
 ''He is like the father of economics here,'' says Laurence Brahm, who wrote several books about China's reform period. ''What he said was the blueprint for reform.'' 
 Critics say Mr. Wu's influence on government is waning. (They note that he is not invited to weekly economics seminars held for top leaders, including Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.)
 Given this, some people say, Mr. Wu is courting danger by speaking out.
 ''You have to remember, China is a dictatorship,'' says Victor Shih, a professor of political science at Northwestern University. ''If they want to shut him up, they can.''
 GIVEN the risks, it's hard not to wonder why one of the architects of China's reforms has turned so negative, so angry and so defiant.
 Mr. Wu's personality and tumultuous life story provide some clues.Even his supporters acknowledge that he has a combative streak and describe him as a stubborn idealist whose verbal jousting skills were honed during years of hardship and political warfare.
 ''He always expressed his ideas in the sharpest way,'' says Zhang Chunlin, who was a student of Mr. Wu. ''He's not diplomatic. Even at close to 80 years old, he argues with journalists.''
 That he has lived such a long life would have surprised his parents, wealthy intellectuals who ran one of the country's largest independent newspapers, in Nanjing. A sickly child with tuberculosis, he was not expected to live past the age of 1. He spent much of his youth confined to bed, reading Russian novels and the works of Lu Xun, an influential Chinese writer from the 1920s.
 One of his earliest memories is arriving in the wartime capital, Chongqing, in 1937, at the age of 7, as his family fled Nanjing and the invading Japanese. The emaciated rickshaw driver stopped for opium; the destitute were everywhere.
 ''In Shanghai or Nanjing, beggars would help you and then ask for money,'' he recalls. ''But in Chongqing, they'd grab food from your mouth.'' 
 Such experiences helped mold him into an idealistic socialist, as many Chinese were during that era. He studied Marxist economics in college and graduated with honors in 1954 from Fudan University in Shanghai. That won him a position at the country's elite research institute, the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. 
 Soon after he arrived, however, China was engulfed by political campaigns, like the Great Leap Forward, that required little research. The cruelest was the Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, when intellectuals and the descendants of landlords were identified as ''counterrevolutionaries.'' In Beijing, Mr. Wu says, Red Guards shaved half the head of his wife, Zhou Nan, and ransacked his mother's home.
 Mao Zedong wanted intellectuals sent to the countryside to be ''re-educated.'' So in 1969, virtually the entire Academy was sent to Henan Province to learn to farm and to build houses in remote villages.
 Ms. Zhou was ordered to work as a peasant in Shanxi Province; their two children, ages 4 and 6, were left with relatives in Beijing.
 ''When I left, I was prepared never to return home again,'' Mr. Wu says solemnly. ''We were told we'd farm for the rest of our lives.''
 Mr. Wu says the hardships included sessions in which he was denounced as an anti-Maoist. When pressed to confess, or to denounce others, he says he refused, and then was beaten and placed in solitary confinement. 
 ''They sent me to the stage to confess, then they started beating me,'' he says. ''Of course I felt extreme anger. But I realized it wouldn't last for long; it was too absurd.'' 
 This didn't shake his faith in socialism, but he began to distrust the people around Mao who were calling believers like him enemies of the people.
 His only solace, he later said, was the friendship he developed with a scholar named Gu Zhun, who was an early critic of central planning, and an advocate of market reform. Mr. Gu encouraged him to learn English and to explore the outside world, which Mr. Gu said was the only hope for China to develop.
 When Mr. Wu returned home three years later, in 1972, his daughter said he was still ''under the spell of Communism,'' partly because of the guilt he felt for having grown up in a wealthy home. 
 ''He said a person should have just one shirt,'' recalls his daughter, Shelley, 46. ''And he didn't like my sister and I to write our names on our personal property.''
 AFTER the Cultural Revolution ended with Mao's death in 1976, Mr. Wu says he began to see that Mao's economic policies had brought the country to the brink of collapse. 
 In 1978, when Deng Xiaoping began to press ahead with bold reforms aimed at opening up the country, Mr. Wu was heavily influenced by the thought and advice of his colleague Mr. Gu, who had died in 1974. He learned English, and in 1983 went to Yale as a visiting scholar. Much of his time there was spent studying modern economic theory.
 Mr. Wu returned to Beijing in 1984, just as China's economic reforms were gathering momentum under Zhao Ziyang, the party leader and chief economic planner.
 That year, Mr. Wu says he helped Ma Hong, a top government adviser, draft a paper that defined the country's shift from a planned to a market economy. ''This was a very important turning point for China's economy,'' he says.
 Once the proposal was accepted, Mr. Wu was elevated to the Development Research Center, the institute affiliated with the powerful State Council. Soon, he was visiting Zhongnanhai, Beijing's leadership compound, to offer advice and debate economic policy.
 Several research institutes advised Mr. Zhao and Mr. Deng on how to remake the old socialist system with elements of free enterprise. Some who sat in on those meetings say that Mr. Wu was argumentative and prickly when debating economic policy, even with Mr. Zhao. 
 The reforms, though, fueled strong growth and are widely credited with changing the course of the nation.
 But by the late 1980s the reforms also opened the doors to corruption and soaring inflation, feeding public anger that contributed to the 1989 student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.
 Mr. Zhao was removed from office just ahead of the bloody assault on the students and the campaign against dissent and ''liberalization.'' The reforms stalled.
 Not long after, Mr. Wu and other reformers were attacked for favoring a Western-style market system.
 Bao Tong, a former aide to Mr. Zhao, said the reformers faced strong opposition from Soviet-trained economists who were wedded to the ideas of central planning.
 ''For the first guys who advocated a market system, it was pretty dangerous,'' Mr. Wu said in a recent telephone interview.
 He was among them, and so he was derisively branded ''Market Wu.'' For a time, publishers refused to sell his books.
 ''That's when the conservatives came in and said the reforms had messed everything up,'' says Barry J. Naughton, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, and author of ''The Chinese Economy.''
 Mr. Naughton says: ''Wu Jinglian fought against the backlash. He said, 'We need more market reform, not less.' ''
 The reform camp became stronger after Mr. Deng's famous 1992 ''southern tour'' -- in which he called for bolder reforms and encouraged people to get rich.
 Soon, Mr. Wu's influence in government grew. In the 1990s, he served as an adviser to Zhu Rongji and Jiang Zemin, the country's top leaders, helping them speed up reforms and restructure badly run state-owned companies.
 Every step of the way, he fought off opposition, and debated, often publicly, the shape and pace of the reforms.
 ''This debate about the market economy is the most important discussion throughout the 30 years of reform,'' says Liang Guiquan, an economist at the Guangdong Academy of Social Sciences. ''And it's still going on now. Wu Jinglian has always been at the center of that debate.''
 BY most measures, China's economic transformation has been a resounding success. Anyone who travels here can see it: the change in people's living standards, the makeover of big cities -- what has come to be called China's economic miracle.
 But Mr. Wu sees the defects: a government prone to ''meddling'' in the marketplace; a widening income gap; inefficient monopolies; and crony capitalism.
 His critique sharpened considerably after Jiang Zemin stepped down as president in 2003, and Mr. Wu's role was diminished. 
 In interviews, Mr. Wu says he feels compelled to speak out because conservatives and ''old-style Maoists'' have been gaining influence in the government since 2004. These groups, he said, are pressing for a return to central planning and placing blame for corruption and social inequality on the very market reforms he championed. 
 At the same time, Mr. Wu says, corrupt bureaucrats are pushing for the state to take a larger economic role so they can cash in on their positions through payoffs and bribes, as well as by steering business to allies.
 ''I'm not optimistic about the future,'' Mr. Wu said. ''The Maoists want to go back to central planning and the cronies want to get richer.''

 BODY:
Keep the Money Bag 
 At Home, Please
 Q I have always wondered what paying ''cash'' at a closing means. Does that mean a cashier's check, a personal check, or a bag of money? What are the benefits and risks to the buyer and seller?
 A The term ''cash'' in a real estate transaction generally refers to the portion of the purchase price paid from the buyer's own cash reserves, said Douglas Wasser, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. 
 When there is a large cash component, he said, the seller's risk that the sale will collapse is reduced because the deal is less dependent on a bank's appraisal and review. Also, the buyer will have a greater personal investment in the deal and that may make a co-op board more likely to approve the sale, he added.
 The sales contract should specify cash and mortgage components. ''It's rare that a significant component of the purchase price would be payable in actual paper currency,'' Mr. Wasser said, ''though many real estate attorneys have their 'war stories' about parties bringing bags full of cash to closings.''
 He said that all funds required at closing, including ''cash'' that is due from the borrower, are payable by bank check or certified check, with minor amounts at the closing table payable by personal check.
 In the Hot Seat
 Over Air-Conditioning
 Q I am a rent-stabilized tenant in a New York City co-op building that has two separate management companies: one for the co-op, one for the stabilized apartments. Recently, the building's central air-conditioning system failed. Who is responsible for maintaining these services in my unit?
 A Sean A. Altschul, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, says that a typical proprietary lease requires the apartment corporation to keep building systems in good repair. In this case, he said, the co-op corporation is probably responsible for repairs to the central air-conditioning system.
 But the first step for the tenant, he said, is to notify the landlord of the problem in writing and to provide copies of the notice to both management companies. If the problem is not resolved promptly, the tenant may file a complaint with the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal. 
 If the evidence indicates that the air-conditioning has not been restored, the agency can reduce the rent for the apartment and issue a written order directing the landlord to have the service restored. 
 The Aftermath
 Of a Co-op Foreclosure 
 Q A number of shareholders are seriously in arrears in maintenance payments at my co-op, and the building's mortgage payment was not made last month. What happens if the co-op goes bankrupt or is foreclosed on?
 A If a co-op receives a foreclosure notice, it must transmit a copy of that notice to all shareholders under the state's Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act, said Steven D. Sladkus, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. 
 ''This notice is important because if the co-op declares bankruptcy or is foreclosed upon, not only will the shareholder's equity be lost, but all shareholders who have co-op loans would remain responsible to each of their lenders to pay their loans off in full,'' Mr. Sladkus said. 
 In addition, he said, all proprietary leases would be canceled, and the shareholders would become rental tenants.

HEADLINE: Is Happiness Catching?

 BODY:
Someone dubbed the theory of social contagion the ''High-School Cafeteria Theory'': if you hang out with the ''right'' crowd, you'll do O.K.; if you hang out with the ''wrong'' crowd, you won't. The problem is that the idea of social contagion reifies a metaphor. You can catch a virus without free will; you can't ''catch'' smoking without it. Mirror neurons activate feelings and impulses; free will keeps them going. Thank God Copernicus, Freud, Einstein, Columbus and Emily Dickinson were not unduly influenced by this theory. 
 ELIZABETH STRINGER New York
 Clive Thompson writes that Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler ''suspect that as friends around us become heavier, we gradually change our mental picture of what 'obese' looks like.'' In a forthcoming article in Obesity, we find that perceptions of what it means to be overweight became more lenient in the United States from 1988 to 2004, a period during which the population grew significantly heavier. The share of overweight (but not obese) individuals ages 17 to 74 who described themselves as ''overweight'' fell by 6 percentage points between two surveys conducted, respectively, during the periods 1988-94 and 1999-2004.
 The decline in overweight self-perception was roughly equivalent for women and men, and is not explained by changes in population characteristics, such as age and racial composition, between the survey periods. The findings agree with the notion that we judge our weight in relation to others around us rather than according to fixed standards.

 Your article on the research of social-network science brings new meaning to the old saying ''Tell me who your friends are, and I'll tell you who you are.'' Ultimately, we are all products of our environment, some of us more than others.
 As highly social and adaptable creatures, we do conform to our immediate environment as shaped by those we spend lots of time with and thus share similar ideas.
 This is an evolutionary advantage that enabled our early ancestors to cooperate with each other, form immediate communes and collectively survive the natural harshness of their existence. This is indeed a primitive and core behavior and, without it, none of us would be here today.

HEADLINE: It's a New Met. Get Over It.

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
THE METROPOLITAN OPERA opened its 126th season on Monday -- Peter Gelb's third as general manager but the first over which he has had complete control -- with Puccini's ''Tosca,'' one of the sturdiest and most beloved war horses in the operatic stable. This was very good news if you were the sort of traditionalist Met fan who could happily watch the old Italian repertory -- ''Tosca,'' ''Turandot,'' ''Madama Butterfly'' -- over and over again, and are not looking forward to offerings later this season like Janacek's ''From the House of the Dead,'' an almost plotless opera set in a Siberian labor camp, or ''The Nose,'' Shostakovich's adaptation of a story about a man who doesn't have one. 
 On the other hand, the Met's new ''Tosca,'' directed by Luc Bondy and designed by Richard Peduzzi, mothballed the nearly 25-year-old Franco Zeffirelli production, which though baroquely overstuffed was immensely popular with audiences. ''Tosca'' takes place in some of Rome's most famous landmarks, and the Zeffirelli sets made you feel as if you were actually there. By contrast Mr. Peduzzi's version of the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle looks like an enormous brick warehouse and features lots of industrial metal and a big red oil drum. There were boos from the die-hards on Monday at the end of the second act, at the beginning of which Scarpia appears to receive oral sex, and even more, along with a small stampede to the exits, at the end of Act III. Mr. Gelb listened impassively. 
 In his office a couple of weeks ago Mr. Gelb said the decision to open the new season this way, with a brand-new, pared-down production of an opera that was a trademark of the old Met, was ''not an accident.'' His self-proclaimed mission from the beginning has been to revivify an institution whose core audience he thinks is rapidly aging itself to extinction, by re-emphasizing opera's theatricality.
 ''I didn't understand fully how difficult it was going to be,'' he added. ''I don't go into a season hoping that just some things will work. Everything has to work. The stakes are very high. The Met is at a moment when either it will continue to be the leading opera house or it won't. There's no middle ground.'' 
 To that end he has commissioned new productions, some of works seldom seen in New York; signed up new singers, who don't just ''park and bark,'' as he puts it, but actually act; and recruited directors from Broadway, like Bartlett Sher, and the movies, like Anthony Minghella, who died last year. Mr. Bondy is a Swiss director of opera and theater, and though Mr. Zeffirelli recently called him ''third rate,'' his productions have a reputation for braininess and for stripping away clutter. James Levine, the music director of the Met, likened his new ''Tosca'' to a Hitchcock movie.
 Mr. Gelb's program was initially greeted with skepticism, if not hostility, by many opera buffs. In his last job, as president of Sony's classical record division, where he recorded an album of arias by the soft-rocker Michael Bolton and where his greatest hit was the soundtrack for ''Titanic,'' purists saw him as a shameless panderer. Mr. Gelb, who likes to point out that classical music used to be pop music, is unrepentant. ''I haven't really changed,'' he said. ''The only thing that changed was the world I was working in. I've always tried to popularize classical music, and I'm still doing it, only I don't work for a classical record company anymore.''
 And whatever his record at Sony, Mr. Gelb's Met career has by most reckonings been an almost immediate success. The audience has both grown and become more youthful. He has reached out to contemporary visual artists and begun a promising collaboration with Andre Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, to develop new work. His program of showing selected operas on live high-definition television broadcasts has been tremendously popular, filling movie theaters both here and abroad. 
 There have been artistic misfires, like Mary Zimmerman's production last year of ''La Sonnambula,'' which set the opera as a play-within-a-play and was also hooted at on opening night. But for the most part the Gelb vision has so won over the opera world that it's hard now to find anyone with something critical to say -- at least on the record. Most of the grumbling one hears these days is not about the merits of the new Met productions but about how expensive they are. Since Mr. Gelb took over, the Met budget has increased by about $60 million. The box office is up, but meanwhile personal and corporate donations, which the Met depends on to balance its budget, are down, thanks to the economy, and so is the value of its endowment. The Met's projected deficit for next year is about $4 million.
 In the spring Mr. Gelb (whose own pay had gone up more than 30 percent since he started, to $1.5 million) asked the stagehands union to take a 10 percent salary cut. Instead its members agreed to forgo a 3 percent raise this season in return for a one-year extension on their contract, which was about to expire. Both the singers' union and the one representing the orchestra, however, have declined to negotiate until the Met agrees to let them undertake a confidential analysis of the opera's business plan. Alan Gordon, the executive director of the American Guild of Musical Artists, the orchestra union, said, ''I'm sure there are problems, but I don't think anybody sees the Met going under, no matter what happens,'' and added: ''We want to do due diligence, just like an investment bank. I'm certain that if our members thought the Met needed help, they'd be willing to give it, but what kind of help needs to be demonstrated.''
 Mr. Gelb, after cutting his own salary and that of his management team, reluctantly scaled back his plans for the new season, canceling or replacing four productions. ''I sweat the budget every day,'' he said. ''We've cut millions of dollars from it. To our labor force and our board we can't seem as if we're spending money irresponsibly. But I'm also trying to explain to them that it's necessary to maintain artistic momentum to achieve the kind of fund-raising and ticket sales we need -- the fuel that runs the engine. If you stop it, the whole thing will collapse.'' 
 In many ways Mr. Gelb is the antithesis of his predecessor, Joseph Volpe. Mr. Volpe, who declined to talk about his successor, began as a carpenter at the Met and rose through the ranks. He was tough, prickly, shrewd about budgets and labor negotiations and had excellent taste in singers. He famously ruled with an iron hand. When the soprano Angela Gheorghiu once complained about a blond wig she was supposed to wear in a production of ''Carmen,'' he told her: ''The wig goes on. With you or without you.''
 Mr. Gelb, who turns 56 in November, comes from cultural royalty. His father, Arthur, was the culture editor of The New York Times back when that job carried even more clout than it does now. His mother, Barbara, is the stepdaughter of the playwright S. N. Behrman and a niece of the violinist Jascha Heifetz. After high school Mr. Gelb, determined to pursue a career in music, decided not to go to college, which can't have pleased his parents, but his father nevertheless arranged for him to get a mailroom job with the impresario Sol Hurok. He got a crash course in dealing with artistic willfulness when he became Vladimir Horowitz's manager at a time when Horowitz was at his nuttiest and most paranoid, demanding during a Russian tour that his food be airlifted and his piano guarded by the Marines.
 At the Met, Mr. Gelb's style is quiet and diplomatic. His spine appears to be made of bendable zirconium, instead of the traditional steel, except that he's such a master of detail that he almost always gets his way. He's a tall, soft-spoken man, charming and awkward in about equal measure. During interviews you can watch him edit himself as he speaks. 
 Unusual for the director of a major opera company, he spends much of his time not in his office but in the opera house itself. He has a temporary desk, with a laptop, set up between Rows Q and R on the left side of the orchestra, and from there he keeps an eye on everything that takes place onstage or in the pit, dashing out every now and then for a phone call or a meeting. He is there to put out fires before they happen, or, as he said, to ''resolve any artistic issues that come up.'' 
 At the first run-through of the new ''Tosca,'' for example, he consulted with Mr. Bondy and Max Keller, the lighting director, about the lighting in Act I; he did not fail to notice that in Scarpia's death scene Scarpia's wig fell off, causing the singer to fling it aside like a diseased rodent; he debated with Mr. Bondy the merits of two stunt doubles who had been hired to undertake Tosca's famous Act III leap. (In keeping with Mr. Gelb's emphasis on realism and theatricality, this production provides no offstage mattress for her to land on; Tosca takes the plunge in full view of everyone.)
 Mr. Sher, whom Mr. Gelb hired for ''Il Barbiere di Siviglia'' in 2006 after admiring his direction of the Broadway musical ''The Light in the Piazza'' and his revival of Clifford Odets's ''Awake and Sing!,'' said of his experience at the Met: ''I was unbelievably impressed by the deeply thought-out, overall vision that Peter had worked out for the Met at every level. I had never seen anyone so totally involved.'' 
 A lot of their conversations, he added, had to do with Mr. Gelb's helping him to navigate through the Met. ''The opera organism really tests you,'' he said. ''Theater works much more efficiently, and opera singers are like really, really gifted athletes who work in horrible conditions. They test you openly. But Peter was out ahead of everything. He paved the way and helped push the organization. He told me, 'If there's a problem, I want you to call me immediately.' ''
 It's not true that you have to be skinny to sing for Peter Gelb, but it doesn't hurt. ''There's no doubt that expectations are much higher now,'' said the soprano Renee Fleming, a Gelb mainstay and enthusiastic supporter. ''Before, you didn't have to be so fit, or move with such athleticism. Peter has put much more focus on the theatrical side, and the audience is happy about it.'' She added: ''I haven't seen yet that an extraordinary talent has been dismissed. The line is moving somewhere in the middle when you have to decide between an attractive performer and someone who has a little better instrument.'' 
 Because singers book their engagements years in advance, the head of an opera company these days needs to be a soothsayer of sorts. Mr. Gelb keeps closely guarded in his office a document he calls the Sheet -- a spreadsheet blocking out what every singer the Met is interested in is doing, here and abroad, for the next five or six years. Not that advance planning necessarily does much good. Singers are always getting sick or dropping out for personal reasons, and Mr. Gelb has been singularly plagued by last-minute cancellations. The Scarpia for the new ''Tosca,'' Juha Uusitalo, withdrew, because of illness, just before the dress rehearsal and had to replaced. 
 But Mr. Gelb has been unusually adept at filling vacancies with talent of almost equal measure, not just backup singers, and instead of waiting for singers to become stars elsewhere, he has been aggressive about signing them up early. We can expect to see a great deal of people like Natalie Dessay and Diana Damrau, who are excellent actors as well as great singers and whom he clearly regards as the future of the new Met.
 Ms. Damrau, a soprano, was a big deal in Europe but hardly known here when Mr. Gelb signed her up as Rosina in ''Il Barbiere di Siviglia'' and has since become an audience favorite. She said of Mr. Gelb: ''He's a fantastic man. It's a wonderful working relationship. He has his eyes and ears open all the time, and you can always go and talk to him. That's what I appreciate most. At a lot of opera houses in Europe there's a distance.'' She added: ''There must be stars, and Peter knows that stars are popular with the audience. But he isn't a populist. He connects the stars with nontraditional roles. O.K., you need 'Traviata,' but he also thinks in different directions.''
 Mr. Gelb is married to the conductor Keri-Lynn Wilson and has two children from a previous marriage. His day sometimes begins as early as 4 or 5 a.m., when he checks his e-mail and gets on the phone to Europe. On Monday he was on the job until well after midnight. Wearing a black shirt and velvet tuxedo jacket, he held between-act receptions in his office for friends, family, people from the art and the theater worlds and even the president of Finland. (Karita Mattila, who played Tosca, wearing brown contact lenses, is a Finn.) After the second act he and Mr. Bondy also fussed backstage over the timing and light cues for Tosca's leap. 
 And then he presided over a dinner for high-rolling Met donors under a tent in Damrosch Park. If he was smarting over the opera's reception, he didn't show it. Referring to the Zeffirelli version, he said to the guests, ''After 25 years we must move forward by offering new productions that will startle our imaginations and will demonstrate that our art is not locked in the past.''

HEADLINE: Texas Two-Step

BYLINE: By JIM LEWIS

 BODY:
Here is something that once happened to me in Austin, Tex., or more accurately, something that didn't happen. This was in the mid-'80s; I'd come down one weekend to visit a friend and ended up staying for a few months -- which is often how people end up living here, I've since discovered. Late one night, I found myself on the sidewalk outside a club called the Continental. I'd been inside drinking and listening to music and it was time to make my way home, but I had no car, so I began to walk, and not so steadily, down South Congress Avenue, a grand boulevard that stretches from the nether reaches of South Austin, across the river, to the Capitol. I hadn't gotten far when a car pulled up beside me. Inside were four kids, about my age, I'd guess, and the one in the passenger seat rolled his window down and asked me if I needed a ride somewhere.
 I was from New York, and I didn't understand. I said, ''What?''
 ''You look tired,'' the kid said. 
 I thought about this for a second, weighing the possibility that I was about to get rolled against the certainty that I'd otherwise face a long stumble across a city that had already closed for the night. Then I said, ''O.K., thanks,'' and got into the car. The driver asked me where I lived, and we started off. I sat in the back, bemused, waiting for something hinky to happen. And then . . . they took me home, making amiable small talk along the way. They dropped me at my door, said good night and drove away; and I never saw them again. 
 In those days, Austin was exactly that kind of town: big enough that it would take a while to walk across but small enough that some passing stranger might offer you a lift. About 400,000 people lived there then, in a drowsy and somewhat faded city, purposeless but for the state government and the University of Texas, neither of which could accurately be described as go-get-'em. You could rent a house for $300 a month or buy one for $30,000. The airport was tiny and located in the center of town. The nice restaurant -- and there seemed to be only one -- was Jeffrey's; otherwise, there were tacos and barbecue, cheap liquor and house parties.
 FOR THOSE OF US WHO LOVED THE CITY, this was pretty much the point of Austin. Fashion meant jeans, interior design meant the nearest Goodwill, transportation meant a $500 beater. But it had its downside. More adult pleasures -- a work of art to look at, a meal that you didn't eat with your hands, an evening that entailed dressing up -- were hard to come by.
 By the time I moved down here permanently, in 2001, that was changing, and these days all bets are off. The South by Southwest festival, which began as a regional music conference in 1987, is now an international event, with film and interactive components. ''Music used to be the monoculture in Austin,'' said Brent Grulke, the music festival's creative director. ''It's still a huge part, but it's far from the only one.'' But if the city has become more cosmopolitan, the attitude remains largely D.I.Y. ''Austin,'' Grulke pointed out, ''has never been a city that valued wealth for wealth's sake.''
 Maybe that's why, despite whatever financial collapse the rest of the world is suffering, Austin is still growing. The boom of the last few years may be on hold, but unemployment is less than 7 percent, the housing market has stabilized, and there's an air of cozy well-being about the place. Suddenly, there are a dozen restaurants worth trying: Uchi for sushi, Perla's for oysters, Wink Restaurant for seafood, Justine's for French. Between Central Market, an enormous gourmet supermarket, and Whole Foods (both of which started here), Austin offers some of the best food shopping in the world. Entire industries that would have seemed out of place just a decade ago are now settled in: film (Mike Judge, Richard Linklater and Robert Rodriguez all live here), television (''Friday Night Lights'' is shot in Austin), specialized health care (the Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas opened in 2007). 
 The cultural life is catching up, beginning with the grand reopening of the renovated Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas, the country's greatest literary archive outside the Library of Congress (36 million pages of manuscripts, as well as a Gutenberg Bible and page proofs of Joyce's ''Ulysses''). The Blanton Museum of Art, which finally got its own building in 2006, has brought a world-class museum to the center of town, and a gallery scene is emerging on the town's east side, cobbled together out of hole-in-the-wall places like Okay Mountain and Art Palace. Last year the Long Center for the Performing Arts opened its own building just off the river, which hosts opera, classical music and ballet. 
 The population now stands at nearly 800,000, with another 900,000 living in the larger metropolitan area. Austin is busy being reborn, which is better, of course, than being busy dying, but not necessarily much better. The columnist Molly Ivins, may God bless and keep her, lived in South Austin -- a neighborhood, she once affectionately suggested, whose slogan might be ''A Great Place to Buy Auto Parts.'' Today South Austin is a great place to buy expensive clothes and gourmet food at stores like By George and Cissi's Market, and an even better place to sit and watch the people who can afford to buy them. You can still get car parts there, too, and cheap Mexican food and cowboy boots and, for that matter, a gun. But the worry is plain: Austin has always been brainy, lazy, eccentric, ornery and both liberal and libertarian. Can we keep from becoming either money-mad or, worse yet, merely bohemian? Can we steer a course between Dallas and Williamsburg, Brooklyn?
 So far, so good: our smart growth has been tempered by just the right amount of stupidity. Some benighted civic booster tried to promote ''SoCo'' as a nickname for the South Congress district; no one bought it. The commission for the new Blanton Museum was originally awarded to Herzog & de Meuron, but the university's regents decided the design was too challenging and it wound up with a conservative Boston firm instead. A light rail project that would link the northern suburbs to downtown is well behind schedule. My power still goes out when it rains.
 This is all just dumb enough to keep people guessing, which in turn makes things interesting. And to be fair, there's been a good amount of intelligence at work, too. We finally have a downtown worth walking around, the city's parks and greenbelts are lush and popular, and gentrification -- where it has occurred -- has been slow and respectful. South Congress has become an ideal mix of old and new: the Continental Club is still open and so is the Austin Motel, but they've been joined by restaurants like Vespaio, which is both a scene and a good place to eat, and hotels like the Saint Cecilia, a converted mansion on a quiet back street that was opened last December by Liz Lambert, whose Hotel San Jose is the emblem of South Austin's renaissance.
 PEOPLE I KNOW COME TO VISIT NOW: that's new, too. Friends from New York or even farther afield, writers, artists, various types on business or vacation. When they come, there are a couple of places that I take them. There's Barton Springs, an enormous, spring-fed swimming pool in a park on the edge of downtown; TC's Lounge, a run-down roadhouse out on the east side; Hoover's Cooking for soul food; and Taco Xpress for breakfast tacos. There are old honky-tonks like Ginny's Little Longhorn Saloon, one of a handful of local bars that still sell setups, a cheerful and civilized tradition: the only kinds of booze they offer are beer and wine, but if you want to bring in a bottle of something harder, they'll sell you a glass of ice for a few bucks, and you can sit there listening to the band and sipping your own whiskey until closing time.
 And if it's the right night, and the right mood, and the right company, I take people to the Broken Spoke, one of my favorite places on the planet. The Spoke is a traditional dance hall on the south side of town. It's been there since 1964, and it hasn't changed much in the meantime. Everyone comes to the Spoke -- sorority girls, 70-year-old couples, children, cowboys, hipsters, artists, auto mechanics -- and everybody dances the two-step. When they do, Austin is Austin again, the city I once found, fell in love with and left New York for. So if you wind up there one night and happen to get separated from your friends, if you should decide to stay late or leave early and find yourself stranded in the parking lot, don't be surprised if some strangers offer you a ride, and don't be afraid to take them up on it. Because for now, at least, Austin is still the kind of city where everyone gets home safe. JIM LEWIS

HEADLINE: A Dreamer's Machine, More Promise Than Reality

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
THE advent of the modern electric car has given rise to a class of entrepreneurs angling to take on the world's major automakers. 
 Despite the repeated failures of similar plans through the years -- Kaiser, Tucker and DeLorean come quickly to mind -- the dreamers behind companies like Tesla, Fisker, Aptera and other start-ups are not intimidated. Like their predecessors, they believe they can succeed by offering the cars of the future. 
 They might, however, look to the cautionary tale of the Davis Divan, another car of the future. 
 The Davis was one of the great oddball cars of American history, alongside such novelties as the Stout Scarab and the vest-pocket Crosley. It has been 60 years since the wave of the Divan's brief celebrity crested and broke; the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles has been highlighting its example of the marque. 
 ''Yesterday's car of tomorrow,'' as Leslie Kendall, the curator at the Petersen museum termed it, the Divan was a rounded three-wheeler that in 1949 appeared on the cover of the popular Sunday newspaper supplement, Parade. With its streamlined body, hidden headlights and wraparound chrome trim, the Davis Divan looked like a bumper car from a carnival attraction (or a Hoover vacuum cleaner of the era, minus its handle). The Petersen museum's Davis, one of about a dozen Divans that were built, is blue and has a removable top. 
 Glenn Gordon Davis, known as Gary, was an entrepreneur who, like his contemporaries Henry Kaiser and Preston Tucker, would attempt to pioneer a different approach to automobile design in establishing his new automobile company. 
 ''It was a seller's market and everyone who had ever wanted to get in the automobile business tried to,'' said Mr. Kendall of that postwar era. ''Davis didn't get any further than Tucker did.''
 But it wasn't for lack of trying. Davis was an avid and tireless used-car salesman when inspiration struck. After the war, he acquired a curious, one-of-a kind three wheeler that had been built for Joel Thorne, the millionaire heir to a Chase bank fortune and fervid auto racer. 
 The car was the work of Frank Kurtis, an accomplished engineer who also built the successful Kurtis-Kraft Indianapolis 500 racecars. The car Davis bought was called the Californian, and he conceived of mass-producing a version of it. 
 By 1946 he was taking deposits from starry-eyed future dealers, raising more than a million dollars to build his dream car. But he turned out to be less of an engineer than a salesman.
 His persuasive talents are on display in a poster hung behind the Divan at the Petersen museum: ''Davis is years ahead! ... Never has there been such a car...Never a car so low and fast and sleek and safe... Never a car so cat quick in traffic!'' 
 ''No, there has NEVER been such a car!''
 Davis claimed to have done a survey that showed customers wanted a car that was stronger, more economical and more streamlined. The Divan was his answer. 
 The Divan was powered by engines from independent manufacturers, Hercules and Continental. The surviving models usually have later, upgraded engines.Davis boasted of how easy a three-wheel car was to park. Its canopy roof meant no blind spots and it turned in a tight circle. (Davis on occasion claimed the car could make a U-turn at 55 miles an hour.) It would get up to 50 miles a gallon, Davis claimed, and with just three wheels instead of four, the Davis also saved the driver 25 percent on tires, he shrewdly calculated. 
 Davis claimed to have borrowed from aviation technology and manufacturing methods to build a better car. ''Its aluminum body blends with the flow of motion to decrease air resistance to a minimum,'' the Davis's brochure declared, ''achieving true beauty of contour.'' That's a wonderful phrase, ''beauty of contour.'' 
 He said the car had a low center of gravity and a great ride ''thanks to aircraft style shock absorbers.'' But the most aircraftlike thing about the Davis was its place of assembly, an airplane hangar in Van Nuys, Calif. 
 Davis also tried to sell the army on the utility of his three-wheeler as a jeep-type vehicle. Prototypes were tested at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, but the Pentagon passed.
 Davis's dream hails back to a more romantic time, when instead of saving auto companies, men founded them -- and marketers could count on people knowing that a divan was a romantic piece of furniture. One Divan advertisement proclaimed, ''They said 'impossible!'--so, Davis did it!'' 
 Fans of the Davis seem to be sustained by similar determination. One of them, Tom Wilson of Ypsilanti, Mich., rescued an abandoned Davis in 1967 and restored it. Wondering how many more examples survived, Mr. Wilson founded the Davis Registry in 1993 and over the years tracked down survivors. 
 Mr. Wilson's Davis is now in the collection of the Lane Motor Museum in Nashville, Tenn. Thanks to Mr. Wilson and other true believers, the oddball Davis has been reappreciated in recent years. A Davis figured in a ''Zippy the Pinhead'' comic strip. Another Davis popped up last year on an episode of the Discovery Channel series, ''Chasing Classic Cars.''
 While the promotional materials for the car promised catlike quickness in traffic, Mr. Kendall, the curator, mentioned a different trait in the fall 2008 issue of the Petersen museum's quarterly publication. ''Driving the Davis is a memorable experience not because of its performance and handling -- which are appalling -- but because of its ability to attract the attention of motorists,'' he wrote.
 Davis was operating in a world of Hollywood fantasies. The literal divan of the Davis Divan was its couchlike single bench seat. Davis, whose photos show a dapper dresser, liked to pose a quartet of comely starlets in that seat, with the caption, ''Four Stars of Tomorrow in the Car of Tomorrow.'' 
 The car's appearance in Parade spurred wide interest in the Davis, but the company was already in shambles. Dealers who had purchased franchises were clamoring for cars and assembly workers owed back wages filed suit. The Los Angeles district attorney investigated and brought charges against Davis. According to the marque's registry, Davis was convicted of fraud and eventually sentenced to two years in prison. 
 He never stopped thinking about cars like the Divan. Before he died in 1973, Davis was talking about a three wheel ''safety car'' with a wraparound bumper. After his release from prison, he had moved into another end of the automotive business, the show business side that he had always excelled at: he helped develop the amusement park dodge 'em bumper cars, which naturally suggested diminutive Davis Divans. 
 ''That is a metaphor for Los Angeles,'' Mr. Kendall said.

HEADLINE: The End of Oil?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL HIRSH. 
Michael Hirsh is Newsweek's national economics correspondent. He is working on a book about the rise and fall of the free-market ideal.

 BODY:
CRUDE WORLD
 The Violent Twilight of Oil
 By Peter Maass
 Illustrated. 276 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $27
 Oil is the curse of the modern world; it is ''the devil's excrement,'' in the words of the former Venezuelan oil minister Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo, who is considered to be the father of OPEC and should know. Our insatiable need for oil has brought us global warming, Islamic fundamentalism and environmental depredation. It has turned the United States and China, the world's biggest consumers of petroleum, into greedy, irresponsible addicts that can't see beyond their next fix. With a few exceptions, like Norway and the United Arab Emirates, oil doesn't even benefit the nations from which it is extracted. On the contrary: Most oil-rich states have been doomed to a seemingly permanent condition of kleptocracy by a few, poverty for the rest, chronic backwardness and, worst of all, the loss of a national soul. 
 We can't be rid of the stuff soon enough. 
 Such is the message of Peter Maass's slender but powerfully written new book, ''Crude World: The Violent Twilight of Oil.'' Unquestionably, by fueling better and faster transportation and powering cities and factories, oil has been critical to modern economies. But oil has also made possible the most destructive wars in history, and it has left human society in a historical cul-de-sac. Despite much hue and cry today, Maass argues, we seem unable to move beyond an oil-based global economy, and we are going to hit a wall soon. 
 Maass, a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine, tends to endorse the predictions of industry skeptics like Matthew Simmons, who argues the earth is about to surpass ''peak oil'' supplies. Even with the recent fallback in prices, the petroleum that's left to discover will be harder and more expensive to extract. Last year's $147-a-barrel oil was just a ''foretaste of what awaits us,'' Maass writes.
 Maass is less interested in crunching oil-supply numbers, however, than in exposing the cruelty and soullessness of humankind's lust for this ''violence-inducing intoxicant,'' as he calls it. His book teaches us an old lesson anew: that the true wealth of nations is not discovered in the ground, but created by the ingenuity and sweat of citizens. It's the same lesson the Spanish learned centuries ago when they discovered gold, the oil of their time, in the New World. They piled up bullion but squandered it on imperial fantasies and failed to build enduring prosperity, while destroying the civilizations from which they seized it. 
 Destruction, or at least a lack of progress, has been the fate of most of the nations unlucky enough to sit on top of large pools of ''black gold'' today. They have grown corrupted by it, their leaders relieved of the need to show accountability as long as they can buy off well-connected foreigners and pay for the security and protection they need from their own angry, disenfranchised citizens. In starkly titled chapters -- ''Fear,'' ''Greed,'' ''Empire,'' ''Alienation'' and so on -- Maass shows how each oil state has found its own way to failure. ''Just as every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, every dysfunctional oil country is dysfunctional in its own way,'' he writes. 
 Equatorial Guinea's savage leader, Teodoro Obiang, plunders virtually every cent of his nation's wealth, aided by Riggs Bank of Washington, which sometimes sent employees to the embassy to pick up bulging suitcases of cash. Locals don't even get the benefit of jobs because the manual labor is supplied by Indians and Filipinos brought in by Marathon Oil. Walking around the capital, Malabo, one night, Maass does manage to find a booming source of local employment: young Guinean girls called ''night fighters'' because they jostle for a chance to sell their bodies to the oilmen from Texas or Oklahoma. ''The men in Malabo might not find jobs in the oil industry, but it is clearly possible for their desperate sisters to earn a few dollars,'' he writes. Traveling to Ecuador, Maass discovers graffiti on one of the pipelines that cut through what was once pristine Amazonian rain forest: ''Mas Petroleo = Mas Pobreza.'' More oil equals more poverty. For him, it sums up the confiscatory approach that Texaco took to that country, leaving it a stripped land oozing with toxic pollutants.
 The major oil producing nations have fared little better. Seventy years after the discovery of its first great reservoir, Saudi Arabia remains a medieval principality with a bare patina of modernity. The country's long reign as the world's No. 1 oil supplier has been good for the Saudi princes but a Faustian bargain for the rest of us, having led to the petrodollar-funded spread of extremism and the rise of Osama bin Laden. Post-Soviet Russia has become a kind of petro-fascist state where the head of Lukoil slavishly keeps a picture of Vladimir Putin on his desk rather than photos of his family. Venezuela is resurrecting socialism, this time as farce, under the buffoonish Hugo Chavez, who hosts a TV talk show called ''Alo Presidente'' while turning his national oil company into a ''development agency with oil wells'' that furthers his hold on power. Iran's whole modern history has been twisted out of shape by its oil riches, starting with the American-British coup that toppled Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh in 1953 and restored Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. 
 The unhappiest countries are those where oil has led to war, none more so than Iraq, even if no one will acknowledge the truth about America's 2003 invasion. ''The refining process transforms this black swill into a clear fluid without which our civilization would collapse,'' Maass writes. ''Quite often a corollary process of political refining occurs to sanitize the truth of what's done to keep oil in the hands of friendly governments. Just as cars cannot run on unrefined crude, political systems choke at the unfiltered mention of war for oil.'' He cites George W. Bush's claims that the invasion of Iraq had nothing to do with oil. Still, the question hangs out there: Why was the Oil Ministry one of the only places guarded by United States troops in the early days of looting? 
 By the end of Maass's long indictment, one wants the horror to end. Let's all move on from oil already. Indeed, it is tempting to imagine what sort of globalization we might have today if Max Steineke and his exploratory team from Standard Oil of California hadn't discovered quite so much petroleum when they pierced Saudi Arabia's first great reservoir in 1938. If less human ingenuity had been applied to finding oil over the last 70 years, and more to developing other sources of energy, the world economy -- and the environment -- might be far healthier. The World Trade Center might even still be standing.
 But Maass doesn't fully deliver on the promise of his subtitle. Is this really the twilight of the oil economy? We still seem utterly drenched in the gunk, and the author's occasional hints at the alternative history that might have been -- if only Ronald Reagan hadn't dismantled those solar panels that Jimmy Carter put on the White House roof! -- are not terribly satisfying. He says that the combined technologies exist to move beyond oil, but he doesn't go into any real detail. In his final chapter, Maass gives us an evocative glimpse of one future alternative he would prefer -- a giant wind farm he discovers along Interstate 10 in California. ''Set against the blue sky and the brown desert, in rows of rotating white arms that glint in the sun, the turbines have the appearance of futuristic totems waving at us, luring us forward,'' Maass observes, before driving on in his car.

HEADLINE: Treat Corporations Like People?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Rights of Corporations'' (editorial, Sept. 22), about the Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission:
 When our Constitution was written, corporations may have had much broader interests in civic matters that might have made them generous toward civic affairs, yet they were not personified. 
 Today, corporations have evolved to have the narrow interest of maximizing returns to their investors and to their executives, often denying the rights of their employees and the small stockholder. To allude to their control, or behavior, as being representative of the stockholders, or the will of the people, is delusional. 
 They aggregate great wealth, and use this exclusively to advance toward more wealth. And, when applied to influence legislation, they are devoid of personhood. To give them new rights would show that they have bought a place in our government, at the deepest level, the Supreme Court.
 Edward Colbert Concord, Mass., Sept. 22, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 Our country was formed on the basis that people are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, some of which are listed in our Bill of Rights. Corporations, however, are purely human creations, instituted by humans for purely human purposes. When corporations become destructive of those ends, or when we see ways to improve them in any way, we should be free to modify them as we see fit. 
 Courts look backward, interpreting old texts; economic regulation, however, needs to be forward-looking. 
 The Supreme Court's ''discovery'' that the Constitution grants rights to business institutions that were not invented until long after the Bill of Rights was written is bad theology, bad politics and an egregious abuse of its proper role.
 Daniel J. H. Greenwood Brooklyn, Sept.
 22, 2009
 The writer is a professor of law at Hofstra University School of Law and was co-author of an amicus brief in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.
 To the Editor:
 If, as Justice Antonin Scalia says, most corporations are ''indistinguishable from the individual who owns them,'' then that individual already has rights to free speech and can donate and participate in the political process as currently allowed by the law. 
 Why should corporations be granted additional rights that their constituents already have? This would allow certain individuals who control the corporations to, in effect, have more influence and sway than others who donate and vote on their own.
 Erik Tkal Leominster, Mass., Sept. 22, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The Times's argument that corporations should have ''limited'' free speech rights, ''far less than those of people,'' was ironic. If accepted, it would gut The Times's own free speech rights, since The New York Times Company is a corporation -- something that didn't stop it from winning the landmark First Amendment ruling New York Times v. Sullivan.
 Giving corporations free speech rights is necessary to protect the rights of the people they employ. If companies didn't have free speech rights, they could be held liable for the constitutionally protected speech of their employees and agents, effectively forcing them to censor such people. 
 That may explain why modern human-rights charters protect corporations. The European Convention on Human Rights, for example, allows ''any person, nongovernmental organization or group of individuals'' to seek redress, leading to many court rulings in favor of companies, like Dubus S.A. v. France. 
 Hans Bader Washington, Sept. 22, 2009
 The writer is a senior attorney at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.
 To the Editor:
 Surely the prevailing doctrine, and the central foundation, of our political system is that of ''one person, one vote.'' As corporations do not vote, they have no rights on the political scene.
 John C. Green Southport, Conn., Sept. 22, 2009
 To the Editor:
 A ruling from the Supreme Court in favor of Citizens United in the ''Hillary: The Movie'' campaign finance case would not expand corporate free speech rights, as your editorial suggests. It would simply reaffirm those rights as they have existed since at least 1964, when the court held in New York Times v. Sullivan that a defamation suit violated the paper's right to speak as robustly as it wished. Surely you are not implying that that case was wrongly decided.
 A ruling against Citizens United would imperil not only the rights of newspapers and media companies, but also those of book publishers, filmmakers, community groups and anyone who voluntarily joined with others to speak out. 
 Indeed, at the root of the Citizens United decision is not a corporate right, but an individual one: the right to associate with others to amplify one's voice. That right is as old as the Republic.
 Steve Simpson Arlington, Va., Sept. 22, 2009
 The writer is a lawyer at the Institute for Justice, which submitted a brief supporting Citizens United to the Supreme Court.
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial stops short of considering that the right wing, now that it has control of the Supreme Court, will probably swing significantly greater power to corporations in the current campaign finance case. This would be the culmination of decades of effort to reach this point, and Champagne will flow in conservative quarters.
 The rest of us will remember Sinclair Lewis's 1935 book, ''It Can't Happen Here.'' Right.

HEADLINE: Letters: The Rich, the Poor and Health Insurance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''Why Health Care Will Never Be Equal'' (Economic View, Sept. 20), N. Gregory Mankiw says the premise that ''everyone should have access to the best health care possible whenever they need it'' clashes with the reality that ''state-of-the-art medicine is expensive.'' 
 The analysis misses two points. First, proposals for universal health care don't assume that Joe Six-Packs will be visiting private concierge doctors or having elective CT scans and the like, the way that today's uber-wealthy do. The rich will continue to enjoy better access to care than the average person; the proposals would simply reduce that huge gulf a bit.
 Second, the cost of health care has gone up dramatically without universal care, and will likely will continue to go up whether or not health care reform passes. Other developed countries have dealt with this problem and have found a way to provide universal coverage while spending less than we do in the United States. Kenneth Krasity
 Beverly Hills, Mich., Sept. 21
 To the Editor:
 The column used a hypothetical ''Dorian Gray pill'' -- guaranteeing immortality, but priced at $150,000 for a year's supply -- to illustrate one quandary of universal health care. 
 But suppose the production cost of the pill in a mass market worked out to $150 a person per year. And suppose the pill prevented diabetes or heart disease, rather than conferring a fanciful immortality. Only a government-issued patent would stand in the way of ''universal coverage'' at a profitable price of, say, $500 a year. 
 Which gets to the deeper question: Does the patent system itself encourage a highly inefficient process of development and approval, with excessive costs to amortize over the patent's life? Would a nonmonopolistic system be an incentive for a leaner process, and lead to affordable prices? 
 David M. Smith
 Plano, Tex., Sept. 20
 To the Editor:
 Yes, the wealthy will always get the most expensive medical care because they can pay for it, just as they also get the best seats at athletic events and concerts. But the most expensive care is not always the best care -- and may even be harmful. 
 In a system where fear of malpractice suits and the profit motive strongly influence practice patterns, the use and abuse of testing and procedures is very significant. By establishing best-practice standards of diagnosis and treatment, and controlling the escalating cost of malpractice suits, we can decisively affect the increasing cost of care, as well as its quality.

HEADLINE: Retro Look, Far-Out Menu

 BODY:
Pumps and signs from old gas stations lend a retro flavor to the Broad Street Filling Station in Red Bank. But the menu is modern, not nostalgic, at this deli, which features creative sandwiches and salads. 
 At lunch, the best time to visit, the eclectic mix of options includes a black Angus cheeseburger on a sourdough roll ($8) and a grilled ahi tuna burger with citrus-wasabi aioli ($11). For lighter appetites, there's an elegant mesclun and roasted pear salad with crisp haricots verts, gorgonzola and spiced walnuts tossed in port wine vinaigrette ($7). 
 But try the meaty lobster B.L.T.; this hefty sandwich, slathered with herb mayonnaise, topped with crisp applewood-smoked bacon and served on a brioche bun, was a delicious treat ($15).
 ''Everything is made fresh daily, by the same people,'' said Peter Burr, one of the owners, who works the counter (there is seating for 44 at tables inside and outside). ''The chef is always here and he's always spot on.''
 He is referring to his childhood friend Glenn Saldarini, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, who manages the kitchen. Both worked extensively in restaurants before opening this spot in August 2008. But as experienced as they were, neither was prepared for the economic downturn.
 ''The economy has forced us to change a bit,'' said Mr. Saldarini. The deli still serves a light breakfast, but no longer offers early suppers. 
 Instead, Mr. Burr and Mr. Saldarini are looking to expand their high-end catering and to transform the deli into a coffee lounge on some evenings. That will mean more ambitious desserts, Mr. Burr said; until then, there are homey treats like chocolate chip cookies ($2 for two) or brownies ($2). 
 Broad Street Filling Station, 128 Broad Street, Red Bank; (732) 450-9090; broadstreetfillingstation.com. Open Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Saturday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Delivery available.

HEADLINE: Glass Half Empty

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
Mel Vader and Bob Henderson figured that martini hour on the terrace of their apartment in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, would grow only more interesting after Richard Meier built his 15-story glass tower across the way. 
 From their sixth-floor perch, the couple have seen a toddler on the eighth floor ride her tricycle around her balcony, and watched a cleaning crew come in after 10 p.m. to sop up after a flood of water poured through six stories. They know which of their neighbors in the Meier building make their beds and which do not, and who wears what while brushing their teeth. On one particularly engaging afternoon, they sat, captivated, as a woman appeared in the living room of a gray-haired bachelor, leading Mr. Henderson to hope for an unfolding romance.
''It's like a stage that they set up for us,'' said Mr. Vader, a retired teacher, who occasionally has turned his deck chair away in embarrassment. 
 But 10 months after the much-publicized -- and much-debated -- Meier building opened, most of that stage remains devoid of actors. On the side of the building facing their terrace, Mr. Vader and Mr. Henderson said, there is not a single person living on the 9th, 10th, 12th, 14th or 15th floors. While the developers say half of the building's 99 units have been sold, the real estate Web site StreetEasy.com documents only 25 closings through public records. When the sun falls, the view from Mel and Bob's terrace -- or, for that matter, from the storied Grand Army Plaza -- is not unlike a Christmas tree stripped of all but a handful of lights.
 ''You see that there are people there,'' Mr. Vader said. ''But you don't see the amount of movement that you would normally see.''
 When Seventeen Development L.L.C. announced in 2005 that Mr. Meier would erect one of his elaborate glass and steel sculptures on a $4.75 million parcel in Prospect Heights, it was seen as a test of New York's real estate boom. Could the starchitect best known for designing Manhattan condominiums for the likes of Calvin Klein and Martha Stewart sell $1 million one-bedrooms in a still-gentrifying zone without a reliable public school? 
 Today, the Meier building -- officially, On Prospect Park -- is a wall of windows into the real estate bust. 
 Faced with anemic sales, the developers have slashed prices by as much as 40 percent. They combined units -- there were originally 114 -- to boost the percentage sold in order to ease the path to mortgages. But potential buyers have walked away from at least $20 million worth of contracts. 
 And the handful of people who moved in have been left exposed not only to the perils of buying at the peak of the market but also to the stifled laughter of their neighbors following their every move.
 These pioneers have formed an Internet chat group to trade information about the building's construction progress and ever-dropping sales prices. They have also organized a book club, a tennis team, basketball tournaments, billiard games and myriad individual play dates and cocktail hours in a campaign to create a community within the glass walls.
 ''Some people would like to see this building fail,'' said Betty Flynn, a California transplant who pressed her lips together tightly as she paused while describing her hopes for weathering the downturn. ''We all have the same goal. We want to be in a great building.''
 At a July meet and greet in the building's fishbowl-like first-floor party room, Ms. Flynn and her neighbors joked about the challenges of living in a Richard Meier building -- about how Mr. Meier, who himself lives in a prewar Manhattan co-op crowded with 5,000 books, hides the microwaves in minimalist kitchens and favors pale walls that quickly grow covered with children's fingerprints. They swapped stories about having food delivery show up across the street at the Brooklyn Public Library, since their building took its address, 1 Grand Army Plaza. 
 One woman said that seeing a unit similar to hers on the market for 30 percent less made her ''heart sink,'' while a couple apologized for negotiating more than $1.1 million off the $2.8 million asking price.
 The residents have tried to maintain a sense of humor about the attention they have attracted for living in a glass tower, especially one that many local residents decried for changing the character of the streetscape. 
 One father sighed that he had probably been spotted chasing his naked toddlers through his apartment before bath time. Alan Fleischer, the bachelor seen with the female guest, clarified that she was there to clean the place, but said he had ordered curtains in case that special someone comes along.
 Sometimes, the residents of the glass house wave at Mel and Bob enjoying martinis on their terrace across the way.
 ''Richard Meier has brought the outside inside for these people, but he's brought their interiors to everyone outside,'' Mr. Vader said. ''I get to see more than they get to see.''
 Like many in their neighborhood, Mr. Vader and Mr. Henderson -- who have lived for 15 years in a grand traditional apartment with a sweeping circular staircase, period paintings and a shaggy-leaved ficus named Tina (as in Turner) -- at first staunchly opposed the idea of a totem of modern architecture being planted in the heart of their beloved Brownstone Brooklyn. They wrote to officials at the neighboring Brooklyn Public Library, botanical garden and Prospect Park, pleading for a design that blended better with the low-rise apartment buildings and the 11-acre oval plaza and arch designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in the 1860s. Their pleas went unheeded. But the couple soon found themselves engrossed in the construction of what looked like a giant erector set in front of their terrace.
 ''It was a ballet,'' said Mr. Vader, 66, arms waving to mimic the dancing cranes. ''That initial opening of the earth with those extraordinary mechanicals.''
 ''Noise, noise, noise,'' piped in Mr. Henderson, 68, and retired from retail. ''But it was fascinating.''
 Ruth Dropkin, who is 90 and has lived nearby for 31 years, was moved to write an ode to the building called ''Narcissus Ascending,'' which she sent, unbidden, to The New York Times.
 ''The naked steel girders go/up in hubris steps,'' she wrote. ''Gone the haven of brick and stone and wood,/gone the primal niche of interiority.''
 As the local residents debated the exterior, the developers and sales brokers were preoccupied with what was not going on inside as potential buyers struggled to obtain mortgages on apartments whose values were rapidly falling. Two Corcoran brokers handling sales at the building have not had an open house for months and repeatedly refused to let a reporter watch shoppers browse the empty units. Information supplied by the sales center to StreetEasy.com shows that even units that have gone to contract are taking extraordinarily long to close. 
 Louis Greco, one of the three principals in the development company, said in an interview that he could afford to wait to sell units because the money he borrowed for the project carried a low interest rate. ''We're prepared to ride the storm,'' he said.
 The person perhaps least affected by the emptiness of the glass house is Mr. Meier. He said that he had never met with the bankers financing the project until he was honored for the building's design this summer at the 2009 Building Brooklyn Awards, hosted by the local Chamber of Commerce.
 At a sunset cocktail reception on the roof of Steiner Studios at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Mr. Meier, 74, said that hewas not affected by the building's sluggish sales because the developer ''cut the prices after it was finished.'' He said that On Prospect Park was hardly unique among new developments being stagnated by the recession, and that he ''definitely'' would be game to build in Brooklyn again.
 ''The people who live there love it,'' Mr. Meier added.
 One of the first to gamble on the glass house were Edith Asibey and John D. Verlander, first-time buyers who signed a contract in March 2008 for a $950,000 one-bedroom on the sixth floor with 1,091 square feet and a 108-square-foot terrace. Three days before Ms. Asibey and Mr. Verlander closed on the apartment, in the back of the building, their bank, Wells Fargo, nearly pulled out -- despite their down payment of nearly 30 percent -- partly because of concerns over how few units had sold. They eventually closed in March 2009, amid new worries about the trouble buyers with less cash or worse credit could face. 
 ''I can see it's going to be very difficult in the near term to get this building filled up,'' said Mr. Verlander, 30, a consultant for a major accounting firm.
 For now they are relishing their relative privacy. Ms. Asibey, 39, a consultant for nonprofit groups, said she does not worry about leaving a pile of clothing before rushing out to appointments. Still, she showed off how much thicker her bedroom blinds were than the ones in the living room, proof that privacy is possible even in the glass house.
 The apartment that caused them so much grief while they were trying to obtain a mortgage has started to feel like a home filled with memories. Ms. Asibey lovingly described the first major meal Mr. Verlander cooked for them in their new kitchen. It was April 11. Spinach salad with applewood smoked bacon, Valdeon cheese and a sherry vinaigrette, followed by braised beef brisket with truffle mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Before a dessert of chocolate and strawberry ice cream from the Blue Marble shop down the street, Mr. Verlander got down on bended knee. 
 There, in full view of the neighbors, the pair of distant figures became engaged. ''All the shades were up,'' Ms. Asibey said. ''But I wasn't looking.''
 Ms. Flynn, 66, a retired school administrator, and her husband, Gary, a lawyer who is 64 and also retired, moved into a $1.45 million one-bedroom on the fourth floor in January after three years in the building where Mr. Vader and Mr. Henderson live (they knew the Flynns well enough to advise Mr. Flynn to shut the bathroom door when brushing his teeth). The Flynns had moved to the neighborhood from California to be closer to their daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren, who live in Carroll Gardens.
 ''It's a little disheartening to think we bought at the height'' of the market, Ms. Flynn said. But, her husband noted, ''we're living here for the rest of our lives. We know there are ups and downs in the market. It's not a time to panic.''
 They have tried to comfort some of their younger neighbors who are more apprehensive about surviving a real estate bust. Through years of buying and selling real estate, Ms. Flynn said, they figure it ''all comes out in the wash.''
 Meanwhile, they have become pillars of the community growing in the building. Mr. Flynn has formed friendships playing pool with neighbors, while Ms. Flynn helped start a book club, which has already read ''Arrowsmith'' by Sinclair Lewis and ''The Defiant'' by Shalom Yoran, who happens to live on the fifth floor.
 Mr. Yoran, an 84-year-old retired chairman of an aircraft company, and his wife, Varda, who is 80, moved into their $3.1 million four-bedroom in December, after deciding they were too old to care for their sprawling home in Great Neck on Long Island. He is a Holocaust survivor who fought as a partisan in the forests of Eastern Europe (his memoir should not be confused with ''Defiance,'' a movie based on a similar story). She is a sculptor who said she was not worried about declining real estate values because her next condo would be a coffin. 
 Like the Flynns, they moved to be closer to their children and grandchildren, who live a few blocks up Flatbush Avenue. The apartment, which feels like a treehouse nestled among the leafy branches across Plaza Street, smells like coffee and has a studio with a cage of 15 chirping finches, and a spare bathroom with a tub lined with toys for a grandchild's sleepovers. 
 Born in China to Russian Jews, Mrs. Yoran moved at age 20 to Israel, where she met Mr. Yoran, whose parents died in the Holocaust, and who, according to his book, spent one winter in ''a freshly dug, carefully constructed, and well-camouflaged hole in the ground secluded deep in the forest.'' 
 Mrs. Yoran said that she did not know how much value her glass house had lost, but that she trusted in her husband's ''sixth sense,'' which had guided them through their lives. Mr. Yoran's eyes still sparkle as he watches his wife of 55 years move among her abstract stone artworks.
 They do not mind if Mel or Bob or anyone else peeks inside the home that took their whole lives to find. 
 ''What I like about this is, the inside out and the outside in,'' said Mrs. Yoran, gesturing toward the glass. ''It's a matter of perspective.''

HEADLINE: Brooklyn, Meet Your Oligarch

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
-- Let's agree that Mikhail D. Prokhorov, the Russian billionaire who is the latest savior for the Nets basketball team and its ballyhooed move to Brooklyn, is no pushover. After all, oligarchs have their share of occupational hazards: heavily armed rivals, stupendously corrupt bureaucrats and, no doubt, the evil eye of the Kremlin itself.
 Even so, has Mr. Prokhorov ever faced a foe as resourceful, tenacious and just plain ornery as Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, the grassroots group that has fought the plan for a new arena for the Nets in the borough every step of the way? 
 Perhaps Mr. Prokhorov needs an introduction to this place that he hopes will burnish his worldwide reputation (but may instead bring him to tears). And Brooklynites might want learn a little more about the Russian elite, given that Mr. Prokhorov could be as outsize a celebrity owner as George Steinbrenner.
 Allow me to act as an anthropological interpreter. I live in Moscow, not far from Mr. Prokhorov's office on Tverskoy Boulevard, though my home until three years ago was in Brooklyn, not far from site of the proposed Nets arena, Atlantic Yards.
 Yes, there are contrasts. Mr. Prokhorov bankrolled a magazine for Russia's nouveau riche called Snob. Denizens of Brownstone Brooklyn like to pad around in plastic clogs. 
 Yet first, we should highlight what can unite the two sides.
 Both mourn former glory, albeit in not quite the same context. Brooklyn once had its own major league sports team, the Dodgers, who played baseball at Ebbets Field before fleeing for Los Angeles in 1958, leaving the borough bereft. Well before baseball, the borough had a storied past, land of Walt Whitman and other luminaries. The Nets arena is supposed to accentuate its renaissance.
 Russia fell on hard times after the Soviet collapse, and yearns to return to superpower status. The oligarchs, who before the financial crisis were increasingly going international, are considered an engine for restoring the country's might and prestige. If Mr. Prokhorov succeeds, it would be a boon for both Russia and Brooklyn.
 Of course, let's not forget who has helped to drive Brooklyn's revival in recent decades. Russians! The borough has more than 150,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who began arriving en masse in the 1970s and who have made the Brighton Beach neighborhood, a k a Little Odessa, famous in Russia.
 Still, Mr. Prokhorov, who is to control the Nets and a large minority stake in the arena, may have culture shock when he grasps what it takes to complete a project in New York City. Environmental impact statements? Community board input? Appellate court review? Can't we get the thumb's up from the local chieftain and get it done?
 In Russia, where governance has an authoritarian cast and civil society is less than robust, it is unusual for a project to be significantly delayed or killed because of community opposition. (On the other hand, work is often hamstrung by financial malfeasance or bureaucratic incompetence.)
 ''Things are still done in a very simple way in Moscow,'' said Alec Brook-Krasny, a Moscow native who emigrated at age 30 in 1989 and now represents Brighton Beach in the New York State Assembly. ''Whoever is the main person in the neighborhood, the main official in the city, that person makes the decisions. In 99 percent of the cases, it's the final decision, and the community has no say.''
 In other words, Mr. Prokhorov should realize that when it comes to cracking the whip, Marty Markowitz, the bubbly Brooklyn borough president, is no Vladimir Putin.
 Artur Markaryan, head of Russia's developer trade group, said the arena situation might perplex Mr. Prokhorov because such a backlash over sports almost never occurs in Russia. In fact, Mr. Prokhorov was criticized by some Russian commentators last week for not spending his money on sports teams and arenas in Russia.
 ''Stadiums, and facilities like that, are always very welcomed,'' Mr. Markaryan said.
 Russian oligarchs prefer London, and when they come to New York, they hobnob across the river in Manhattan. Here, then, are a few things for Mr. Prokhorov to know about the species inhabiting the neighborhoods near the arena site, especially the ones that have been noisiest in opposition.
 Not to overly generalize, but those residents tend to be a liberal, touchy-feely bunch. (During the 2000 presidential election, I recall, there was a public forum in Park Slope to debate the merits of the candidates. It was titled, ''Gore or Nader?,'' as if the idea of even considering voting for George W. Bush was preposterous.)
 The people like organic food and bicycles. They compost. They fuss over their children. They don't miss living in Manhattan. You get the idea.
 Muscovites don't recycle, smoke heavily, are enamored of big cars and often park them anywhere, including all over the sidewalks. They also fuss over their children, maybe more so. But I have never seen them wear plastic clogs.
 By the way, Brooklyn, with its striking diversity and population of 2.5 million people, encompasses a whole lot more than brownstoners and Russian immigrants (who may be simply the ones who draw more of Mr. Prokhorov's attention).
 Mr. Prokhorov, 44, contributed to the bawdy image of the oligarchs when he was questioned, but not charged, in a prostitution inquiry in 2007 in France.
 Other aspects of his life are more appealing. Earlier this year, he moved his official residence to a village in Siberia, apparently so that he could support the locals by paying taxes there. He is very tall, and enjoys playing basketball, but also has taken up volleyball and kickboxing. 
 But maybe none of this is so important, beyond Mr. Prokhorov's most noteworthy characteristic. He is very, very rich, and for Nets fans, who have had longstanding disappointments, that counts.
 My close friend David Goldberg, a Park Slope resident who roots fiercely for the team, said he has already had visions of Mr. Prokhorov using his fortune to lure a certain superstar to the Nets.
 ''As long as he knows how to write 'LeBron James' on a paycheck -- in Cyrillic or whatever -- we are willing to put up with almost anything else,'' he said.

LENGTH: 1280 words

HEADLINE: Fanfare for the Working Van

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

DATELINE: Bethlehem, N.H. 

 BODY:
 IN Europe, the Ford Transit Connect is common enough to blend into the landscape. But in a small town in the White Mountains of northern New Hampshire, this compact commercial van stops traffic.
 Since 2003 Ford has sold more than 625,000 Transit Connects in 58 countries, but its proportions -- it is a tall but relatively short and narrow utility vehicle -- are startlingly new to Americans. It also heralds a big shift in Ford's approach to business customers, who in the past have been steered toward large vans and pickup trucks.
 Ford's plans for the Transit Connect do not seem to be limited to hauling the tools and supplies of tradesmen, either. A design study for a Transit Connect taxi has been displayed on the auto show circuit, and a battery-electric version of the van is about a year away. 
 And the company has at least toyed with the idea of the Transit Connect for noncommercial uses. It showed a concept called the Transit Connect Family One at the New York auto show last spring, configured to help a family carry all of its recreational gear and outfitted to keep the gear organized. It had twin scooters mounted on the rear doors, a storage area beneath the rear floor big enough to hold a stroller and came with a radio frequency identification system to help track all of a family's stuff. 
 Len Deluca, director for commercial trucks at Ford, hinted that the unfamiliar shape might be headed for the suburbs. ''Down the road it could be in your driveway as a family vehicle,'' he said.
 Parked next to a Dodge Sprinter, another high-roof van marketed primarily to business customers, Ford's little immigrant looks like a cute offspring. But the main shared characteristic is their trans-Atlantic heritage; in Europe, the Sprinter is sold as a Mercedes-Benz.
 While the Transit Connects coming to the United States are built in Turkey, they could become naturalized citizens. Automotive News, a trade publication, has reported that the van will be built in the United States by summer 2012. A Ford spokeswoman, Anne Marie Gattari, dismissed the report as speculation.
 Whatever its manufacturing source, Ford is optimistic about sales. In August, its first full month of sales in the United States, 2,200 Transit Connects were sold. They are selling within 10 days of arriving on dealer lots, which Ford said is significantly quicker than current industry norms.
 Americans aremore familiar with Ford's larger van, the E-Series, built outside Cleveland. That full-size van, commonly known by its former name of Econoline, can be equipped to handle a payload so large that it could, in theory, carry the 3,470-pound Transit Connect, said Rob Stevens, Ford's chief engineer for commercial vehicles. The E-Series is very capable, he said, but people are looking for something lighter.'' 
 While the E-Series comes with V-8 and V-10 engines and rear-wheel drive, the Transit Connect relies on a 4-cylinder motor that puts its power to the road through the front wheels. The result is more space-efficient and more fuel-efficient.
 Ford calls the Transit Connect a billboard on wheels that provides a more professional image for a small business than it would get with a minivan, which is stamped in the minds of someAmericans as uncool family transportation.My bright red test model was a rolling advertisement for itself, emblazoned with self-congratulatory messages that boasted about its mileage (22 miles a gallon in city driving and 25 m.p.g. on the highway), payload capacity (1,600 pounds), cargo volume (135 cubic feet) and a low load floor. 
 The Transit Connect comes in several cargo van models that have just two seats, at base prices from $21,475 to $22,945. The Wagon XL, with a second row that seats two, starts at $21,830.
 The model I tested was the top-of-the line Wagon XLT. It had a second row that seated three, more standard features than the XL and a base price of $23,045.
 The window sticker of the test van totaled $26,170. Of that, $1,395 was for Ford Work Solutions, a navigation system with an in-dash computer that can be linked to a business owner's office or home computer. Using it, a document from the office or home can be opened, modified and printed on a Bluetooth-linked printer. 
 Although the cargo area of the van I tested was bare, Ford has contracted with three suppliers who offer various cargo-management systems.
 The second row seats, which are split 60/40, flip and fold forward against the front seats. Unfortunately, they don't fold flat into the floor and cannot be removed without tools, limiting the utility of the cargo area.
 In models without second-row seats, the cargo floor is just over 6 feet long. With the second row of seats in place, the floor is 3 feet 8 inches long. With the seats folded forward and out of the way, it is 4 feet 8 inches. Surprisingly, the Transit Connect cannot carry a 4-by-8-foot sheet of plywood inside, a task that has become a basic measure of a vehicle's utility -- and one that can be accomplished by most minivans.
 The powertrain uses a2-liter 4-cylinder Duratec engine with 136 horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque and a 4-speed automatic transmission.
 It is the same powertrain used in the Ford Focus but is calibrated to handle the additional 1,000 pounds of the Transit Connect. 
 Some people who looked over my test vehicle had qualms about the engine's ability to handle heavy loads, especially on the mountainroads of New Hampshire. Although I never loaded it down as a business owner would, therewere times when I felt I could have used more power. Worse yet, at highway speeds the transmission can also be slow to downshift for quick lane changes. 
 But realistically, the Transit Connect is best adapted for getting around in cities and suburbs. For urban errands and deliveries, the power seemed adequate. Too, city dwellers are likely to appreciate how easily the van makes a U-turn.
 On a highway drive from Bethlehem to New York City, a bit more than 300 miles, the lightly loaded Transit Connect got almost 28 m.p.g. Early on, in the mountains on Interstate 91 at speeds of 65 to 70 miles an hour, the engine was working its heart out at around 4,000 r.p.m. Farther south, on level terrain, the engine was less stressed, but hardly relaxed.
 Although the Transit Connect looks like a tall tippy box, it handles pretty much like a car. It has a MacPherson strut front-suspension, while the rear suspension uses leaf springs in the time-honored truck tradition. The chassis feels solid and the ride is comfortable even on bumpy roads, which would be pretty much every street in New York City.
 Oddly,for a utilitarian vehicle there is not a lot of storage space in front, not even a cargo bin.And to call the lever that adjusts the steering wheel balky would be a gross understatement. 
 Visibility can be limited. Unlike a typical minivan, the rear cargo area does not have windows, and there is a blind spot at the center of the back end where the cargo doors meet. 
 Another way in which the Transit Connect differs from minivans: I never parked it in our garage, which has standard-height doors. I stopped just short because there appeared to be insufficient clearance.
 That is an outstanding question in my mind, because one of the draws of minivans when they first came out was their ability to fit into the garage, unlike some full-sized vans.
 Still, the Transit Connect has a lot to offer a group of new customers. By being first in the American market with such a sensible vehicle, Ford has shown a degree of innovation and boldness that has often been missing in Detroit.
 INSIDE TRACK: For businesses, this may be the minivan 2.0.

HEADLINE: The New Sputnik

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Most people would assume that 20 years from now when historians look back at 2008-09, they will conclude that the most important thing to happen in this period was the Great Recession. I'd hold off on that. If we can continue stumbling out of this economic crisis, I believe future historians may well conclude that the most important thing to happen in the last 18 months was that Red China decided to become Green China.
 Yes, China's leaders have decided to go green -- out of necessity because too many of their people can't breathe, can't swim, can't fish, can't farm and can't drink thanks to pollution from its coal- and oil-based manufacturing growth engine. And, therefore, unless China powers its development with cleaner energy systems, and more knowledge-intensive businesses without smokestacks, China will die of its own development. 
 What do we know about necessity? It is the mother of invention. And when China decides it has to go green out of necessity, watch out. You will not just be buying your toys from China. You will buy your next electric car, solar panels, batteries and energy-efficiency software from China. 
 I believe this Chinese decision to go green is the 21st-century equivalent of the Soviet Union's 1957 launch of Sputnik -- the world's first Earth-orbiting satellite. That launch stunned us, convinced President Eisenhower that the U.S. was falling behind in missile technology and spurred America to make massive investments in science, education, infrastructure and networking -- one eventual byproduct of which was the Internet.
 Well, folks. Sputnik just went up again: China's going clean-tech. The view of China in the U.S. Congress -- that China is going to try to leapfrog us by out-polluting us -- is out of date. It's going to try to out-green us. Right now, China is focused on low-cost manufacturing of solar, wind and batteries and building the world's biggest market for these products. It still badly lags U.S. innovation. But research will follow the market. America's premier solar equipment maker, Applied Materials, is about to open the world's largest privately funded solar research facility -- in Xian, China. 
 ''If they invest in 21st-century technologies and we invest in 20th-century technologies, they'll win,'' says David Sandalow, the assistant secretary of energy for policy. ''If we both invest in 21st-century technologies, challenging each other, we all win.'' 
 Unfortunately, we're still not racing. It's like Sputnik went up and we think it's just a shooting star. Instead of a strategic response, too many of our politicians are still trapped in their own dumb-as-we-wanna-be bubble, where we're always No. 1, and where the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, having sold its soul to the old coal and oil industries, uses its influence to prevent Congress from passing legislation to really spur renewables. Hat's off to the courageous chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric, Peter Darbee, who last week announced that his huge California power company was quitting the chamber because of its ''obstructionist tactics.'' All shareholders in America should ask their C.E.O.'s why they still belong to the chamber.
 China's leaders, mostly engineers, wasted little time debating global warming. They know the Tibetan glaciers that feed their major rivers are melting. But they also know that even if climate change were a hoax, the demand for clean, renewable power is going to soar as we add an estimated 2.5 billion people to the planet by 2050, many of whom will want to live high-energy lifestyles. In that world, E.T. -- or energy technology -- will be as big as I.T., and China intends to be a big E.T. player. 
 ''For the last three years, the U.S. has led the world in new wind generation,'' said the ecologist Lester Brown, author of ''Plan B 4.0.'' ''By the end of this year, China will bypass us on new wind generation so fast we won't even see it go by.'' 
 I met this week with Shi Zhengrong, the founder of Suntech, already the world's largest manufacturer of solar panels. Shi recalled how, shortly after he started his company in Wuxi, nearby Lake Tai, China's third-largest freshwater lake, choked to death from pollution.
 ''After this disaster,'' explained Shi, ''the party secretary of Wuxi city came to me and said, 'I want to support you to grow this solar business into a $15 billion industry, so then we can shut down as many polluting and energy consuming companies in the region as soon as possible.' He is one of a group of young Chinese leaders, very innovative and very revolutionary, on this issue. Something has changed. China realized it has no capacity to absorb all this waste. We have to grow without pollution.''
 Of course, China will continue to grow with cheap, dirty coal, to arrest over-eager environmentalists and to strip African forests for wood and minerals. Have no doubt about that. But have no doubt either that, without declaring it, China is embarking on a new, parallel path of clean power deployment and innovation. It is the Sputnik of our day. We ignore it at our peril.

HEADLINE: What They're Saying on Main Street

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

DATELINE: Bethlehem, N.H. 

 BODY:
 THE Saturday morning craft and farmer's market here attracts a wide variety of vendors selling everything from lettuce to chocolates to furniture. What better place to gather reactions to a new smaller van, the Ford Transit Connect, designed for just these sorts of small-business people? 
 I had barely parked my Transit Connect test van on Main Street when vendors began converging on it. 
 Jane Storella, who operates a personal-chef service called Tray Bien here, noted that the Transit Connect's projected mileage was far better than that of her Jeep Cherokee. ''I get like 15 miles per gallon,'' she said.But, she said, she would like to do better than the Transit Connect's estimate of 22 miles a gallon in town and 25 m.p.g. on the highway. 
 Still, she immediately startedto consider how she might configure the interior -- with custom metal shelves and a built-in ice chest -- to suit her business. 
 Jennifer Ross of Littleton, N.H., owner of a homemade chocolates business called Confections by Jen, liked the Transit Connect's low floor (a lift-over height of less than two feet) that would make loading easy. Currently, her husband has to load and unload their pickup truck. With the Transit Connect, she mused, ''I could do this by myself.'' 
 The interior space of the Transit Connect appealed to Christina Ferraro and Alecia Loveless, who breed Hovawarts, a large working dog developed in Germany. Right now it is a challenge fitting their three dogs into an Acura MDX. 
 ''And you can fit crates to transport them,'' said Ms. Loveless, who liked the 59-inch interior height, the split rear cargo doors that open to either a standard 180 degrees or, as the option on this van allowed, to 255 degrees.
 While they initially seemed ready to make a deal on the spot, their enthusiasm waned when they noted that there were no rear air vents, and that the second-row windows did not open. The dogs would need more ventilation. 
 Aaron Cockrell, a plumber whose business here is called Plumb Perfect, saw a benefit in the Transit Connect's height. It would be easy to work out of the van, he said, because he would no longer to have to bend over while looking for fixtures and tools.
 Reactions at the market were probably best summed up by Roland Shick, who owns the Mt. Agassiz Trading Company here. After explaining why the Transit Connect wouldn't work for him -- its gas engine can't match a diesel's economy and it didn't have enough interior space -- Mr. Shick said: ''I really think they are onto something.''

HEADLINE: The College Calculation

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is an economics columnist for The Times and a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
The most subversive question about higher education has always been whether the college makes the student or the student makes the college. Sure, Harvard graduates make more money than graduates of just about any other college. And most community-college students will end up making far less than graduates of flagship state universities. But of course these students didn't enter college with the same preparation and skills. Colleges don't help to clear up the situation either, because they do so little to measure what students learn between freshman and senior years. So doubt lurks: how much does a college education -- the actual teaching and learning that happens on campus -- really matter? 
 A recession makes such doubt all the more salient. Last month, National Public Radio ran a segment called ''Is a College Education Worth the Debt?'' in which an economist noted that 12 percent of mail carriers have college degrees -- the point being that they could have gotten the same jobs without the degrees. In January, ''20/20'' ran a similar segment, in which somebody identified as an education consultant and a career counselor summed up the case against college. ''You could take the pool of collegebound students and you could lock them in a closet for four years,'' he said, and thanks to their smarts and work ethic, they would still outearn people who never went to college. I heard a more measured version of these concerns when I recently sat down with a group of college students. They were paying tuition and studying hard, and yet they weren't sure what they would find on the other side of graduation.
 Along with all this skepticism, though, economic downturns also create one big countervailing force that pushes people toward college: many of them have nothing better to do. They have lost their jobs, or they find no jobs waiting for them after high school. In economic terms, the opportunity cost of going to school has been reduced. Over the course of the 1930s, the percentage of 17-year-olds who graduated from high school jumped to 50 percent, from less than 30 percent. Boys -- many of whom would have been working in better times -- made up the bulk of the influx. In our Great Recession, students have surged into community colleges. 
 So who is right -- these students or the skeptics? It isn't too much of an exaggeration to say that the field of labor economics has spent the past 30 years trying to come up with an answer. In one paper after another, economists have tried to identify the portion of a person's success for which schooling can fairly claim credit. One well-known study, co-written by Alan Krueger, a Princeton professor now serving as the Treasury Department's chief economist, offered some support for the skeptics. It tracked top high-school students through their 30s and found that their alma maters had little impact on their earnings. Students who got into both, say, the University of Pennsylvania and Penn State made roughly the same amount of money, regardless of which they chose. Just as you might hope, the fine-grain status distinctions that preoccupy elite high-school seniors (and more to the point, their parents) seem to be overrated.
 The rest of the evidence, however, has tended to point strongly in the other direction. Several studies have found a large earnings gap between more- and less-educated identical twins. Another study compared young men who happened to live close to a college with young men who did not. The two groups were similar except for how easy it was for them to get to school, and the upshot was that the additional education attained by the first group lifted their earnings. ''College can't guarantee anybody a good life,'' says Michael McPherson, an economist who runs the Spencer Foundation in Chicago, which finances education research. ''But it sure ups the odds substantially.''
 Earnings may be a flawed measure of an education's value, but they're about the only tangible measure we have. And the work that labor economists have done suggests that colleges do indeed deserve credit for much of the earnings gaps between their graduates and everyone else. The median earnings of full-time workers with bachelor's degrees was nearly $47,000 in 2007, according to the Census Bureau. The median for someone who had attended college but failed to get a four-year degree was nearly $33,000, and the median for a high-school graduate was nearly $27,000. Compare these numbers with the typical education debt that a college student has on graduation day -- $20,000 -- and it's clear that a college education is worth the debt. McPherson slyly points out that even the pundits and professors who suggest otherwise seem to understand this; they tend to send their children to college, often to quite expensive ones.
 Yet the skeptics do make one crucial point. Nationwide, half of all students who start college don't end up with a four-year degree. Not only do these dropouts spend less time in class, but they also miss out on the signalling benefit of the degree -- a mark of those who, among other things, have the discipline to finish what they start. 
 Some would-be dropouts may stay in school if Congress approves a pending proposal to increase Pell Grants to needy students. Still, college tuitions are rising and resources are being cut -- two factors that affect graduation rates. Federal spending cushions the blow but isn't large enough to make up for state cutbacks. At Dyersburg State Community College, in northwest Tennessee, enrollment rose a staggering 28 percent this fall compared with last fall, but the state cut the college's budget by 16 percent, thanks to the recession, Karen Bowyer, the college's president, told me. For similar reasons, the University of California system plans to enroll fewer freshmen this year than last. Given the current debate in Washington, it's worth noting that the rising cost of health care puts more pressure on state budgets than perhaps anything else. 
 When you look at what's happening at Dyersburg State and dozens of similar places across the country, you're left thinking that students understand that they don't make the college. They need the college. The rest of us would probably say that they do, too. The cliches are familiar enough: the children are our future, I'll be the education president, etc. 
 Yet when you look at our actual policies, you have to wonder. Many colleges and high schools still fail to do a good job, year after year, with little consequence. And in the deepest recession in a generation, at the very moment when education would be of most value, money for it is disappearing. It's almost as if we've been convinced that college isn't, after all, all that different from locking somebody in a closet for four years.

HEADLINE: FIELD REPORT: RAISING STEAKS

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE MUHLKE

 BODY:
In 1950, the editor Judith Jones rescued Anne Frank's diary from the reject pile. Ten years later, she championed a cookbook no other publisher would touch and named it ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking,'' the first of many seminal culinary titles that she shepherded. At 85, she still works as a senior editor and vice president of Knopf. But every girl needs a hobby. So three years ago, she started raising cattle.
 Now when her writers visit her summer home in northern Vermont to test recipes, they can cook with Bryn Teg farm's grass-fed beef.
 ''The only time I had a little twinge was the other day and the cows licked our hands,'' Jones said, recounting when she was hosting the food writer Joan Nathan, who was there to work on her next Jewish cookbook. ''You get that rough texture of the tongue. And the next day, we were peeling it off!'' she said with a shuddering laugh. The brisket proved less troubling. 
 On a rainy late-August evening, Jones was improvising an elegant little supper for two (Bryn Teg burgers, buttered potatoes, salad and cheese course -- always a cheese course) in her lived-in kitchen. Dressed in slim white jeans and a tidy striped shirt, she glugged some red wine into a skillet of hamburger-juice-soaked shallots, then tucked a stuffed beef heart into the oven to braise indefinitely. Even at the stove, her clipped-and-drawled speech evokes a diminished East Coast aristocracy, which clings to certain words in order to underscore their hierarchy in the sentence. ''I just don't understand people who don't love to cook, do you?'' she asked as she zipped around the kitchen, lithe and spry from yoga and twice-daily pond swims. 
 She not only loves to cook; Jones helped America discover it loves cooking, too. The kitchen windowsill is lined with a sliver of her life's work: cookbooks from the likes of James Beard and Jacques Pepin, as well as the three titles she wrote with her husband, Evan Jones, who died in 1996. There are many authoritative works among them: Marcella Hazan's Italian fundamentals, Madhur Jaffrey's Indian food, Middle Eastern fare from Claudia Roden, Edna Lewis's seasonal Southern menus. 
 Candles lighted, napkins removed from family rings, Jones paused above her plate. ''Now. Shall we see how our cows taste?''
 The flavorful, juicy patties on our china were courtesy of a Black Angus that had grazed on the picturesque hills surrounding her modest home. ''It has that character of just beefiness!'' she said. ''I think we've forgotten that. I really had come to never buy hamburger meat because I didn't think it was that good. Every cut has been good. Some have been a little chewy,'' she admitted, noting the characteristic associated with grass-fed beef. ''The chewiness goes with the flavor, you know. I like those extra chews!''
 Jones's Yankee pragmatism and culinary creativity are being drawn upon now that her country and city freezers are filled with random cuts from the 300 pounds of beef she split with her partners, her cousin John Reynolds and her stepdaughter Bronwyn Dunne last year. Talking about what to make with kidneys and stew meat and that giant heart makes her eyes shine. 
 Thrift and enjoyment in the kitchen are also the guiding principles behind the recipes in her second book in two years, ''The Pleasures of Cooking for One.'' Almost every dish begets several sensual meals, none of which have the cat-lady stigma of single suppers thanks to Jones's wisdom and gracious cheer. (''This is apt to be a messy-looking pancake,'' she writes in one recipe introduction. ''But who cares? It's just for you, and it's delicious.'') Attention Julie Powell: leftover boeuf bourguignon makes an excellent beef-and-kidney pie on Day 2, not to mention a meaty pasta sauce when thinned with three or four San Marzano tomatoes. 
 The six pregnant cows that Jones bought for $900 apiece three years ago have multiplied into a herd of 20, which Reynolds moves between fenced pastures, feeding them hay during winters that drag into May. Last year he added Belted Galloways, a heritage breed chosen for its ability to winter better as well as fatten solely on grass.
 Reynolds, who lives on a farm a Subaru-wagon's throw away, has watched the farms around him disappear over the decades. ''The profit center has moved from the farm to the processor,'' he said. Reynolds had just given up on his heifer business before Jones proposed her scheme. ''We thought originally, We'll just sell the heifer calves. And thennnn,'' he turned to Jones and laughed, ''you kind of wanted to go for the beef.'' 
 Jones sees her family's project as more of a hobby than a business. They could make more by selling the meat themselves, but the Bryn Teg partners prefer to let someone else do the butchering and delivery. 
 Sample business discussion: 
 Jones: I think we might break even in another year or two, don't you?
 Reynolds: . . . . 
 Jones: Well, we'll see.
 And so Dunne, who lives in Burlington, Vt., brought in Michael Gourlay, a grass-fed-beef specialist. He packages, sells and distributes their meat regionally under the Hardwick Beef label. (Gourlay noted that they have experienced a 50 percent increase in the availability of grass-fed beef in the last year alone.) Dunne sees potential in creating an online source for their beef and other Vermont products. ''Supporting a local economy is beneficial to everybody,'' she said. It also resonates beyond the quaint trendiness of the farmers' market: ''It may be the future of food security in the world.''
 Watching the cows work their way across the field creates its own sense of security. For Jones, it's knowing that her family is restoring the land and providing what she believes are happy lives for cows. ''I don't mean to sound sentimental,'' she said, ''but you can see: This is a contented herd.''
 They've also provided a return to the true beef flavor that she hadn't experienced since she was in Paris in her 20s. The first time she tasted Bryn Teg's meat last fall, Jones said, she wasn't near tears out of guilt. ''If anything I felt a sort of gratitude,'' she recalled. ''I felt, this is what meat should taste like.''
 Recipe: Boeuf Bourguignon
 Adapted from ''The Pleasures of Cooking for One,'' by Judith Jones. 
 1 2-ounce chunk bacon, cut into small pieces
 1 1/4 pounds beef-stew meat, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper
 1 tablespoon olive oil
 1 medium onion, diced
 1/3 carrot, from the thick end, peeled and diced
 2 teaspoons flour
 1 cup red wine
 1 cup beef stock
 Herb packet of 1/2 bay leaf; 1 large clove garlic, smashed; a handful of parsley stems; 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme; and 5 peppercorns, all tied in cheesecloth
 3 or 4 baby onions or 4 (1-inch) pieces of leek
 4 baby carrots, or the thin ends of larger ones
 2 or 3 new potatoes
 French bread (optional).
 1. Brown the bacon in a heavy 3 1/2-to-4-quart saucepan. When it has lightly browned, use a slotted spoon to transfer it to a medium bowl, leaving the fat in the pan. 
 2. Pat the pieces of beef very dry with a paper towel, then season all over with salt and pepper. Add the olive oil to the pan, and when it's hot, brown half the pieces of beef over medium-high heat on all sides, about 5 minutes total. Transfer the meat to the bowl of bacon. Brown the remaining beef and add to the same bowl. 
 3. Keep the pan over the heat and saute the onion and carrot until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Return the meats to the pot, sprinkle with the flour, season with a pinch of salt and pour in the wine and stock. Tuck the herb packet into the pot and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover and cook at a bare simmer until tender, 2 hours or more.
 4. Add the baby onions, baby carrots and potatoes, bring to a boil and simmer, covered, until tender when pierced with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve yourself 4 to 5 chunks of meat with all the vegetables and a good French bread to mop up the sauce. The dish benefits from sitting overnight in the refrigerator.
 Serves 1 or 2.
 Recipe: A Potato Dish for Julia
 Adapted from ''The Pleasures of Cooking for One,'' by Judith Jones. 
 2 medium new potatoes
 1 small clove garlic
 Salt
 4 teaspoons butter
 Freshly ground black pepper.
 1. Peel the potatoes and slice them very thin, about 1/8-inch thick. Peel and mince the garlic, then with the flat of your chef's knife, mash it with a little salt into a paste. Work about 1 teaspoon of the butter into it and set it aside.
 2. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons of the butter in a small frying pan over medium-low heat, and lay in half the potato slices, overlapping slightly, to fill the bottom of the pan. Salt and pepper them lightly, and smear the garlic paste on top. Add the remaining potatoes, season lightly and set a small cover askew on top of the pan. After about 8 minutes, turn the potatoes by setting a small, sturdy plate on top of the pan and flipping them over and onto it. They won't hold together in perfect shape, but don't worry. 
 3. Heat the remaining butter in the pan and slide the potatoes back in. Let them cook, semicovered, for 5 minutes, then uncovered for a couple minutes more, until nicely browned. Slide them onto a warm plate, season to taste and let them mingle with whatever juicy meat you're treating yourself to for dinner.
 Serves 1 or 2.

HEADLINE: U.S. Job Seekers Exceed Openings By Record Ratio

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
Despite signs that the economy has resumed growing, unemployed Americans now confront a job market that is bleaker than ever in the current recession, and employment prospects are still getting worse.
 Job seekers now outnumber openings six to one, the worst ratio since the government began tracking open positions in 2000. According to the Labor Department's latest numbers, from July, only 2.4 million full-time permanent jobs were open, with 14.5 million people officially unemployed.
 And even though the pace of layoffs is slowing, many companies remain anxious about growth prospects in the months ahead, making them reluctant to add to their payrolls.
 ''There's too much uncertainty out there,'' said Thomas A. Kochan, a labor economist at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management. ''There's not going to be an upsurge in job openings for quite a while, not until employers feel confident the economy is really growing.'' 
 The dearth of jobs reflects the caution of many American businesses when no one knows what will emerge to propel the economy. With unemployment at 9.7 percent nationwide, the shortage of paychecks is both a cause and an effect of weak hiring.
 In Milwaukee, Debbie Kransky has been without work since February, when she was laid off from a medical billing position -- her second job loss in two years. She has exhausted her unemployment benefits, because her last job lasted for only a month. 
 Indeed, in a perverse quirk of the unemployment system, she would have qualified for continued benefits had she stayed jobless the whole two years, rather than taking a new position this year. But since her latest unemployment claim stemmed from a job that lasted mere weeks, she recently drew her final check of $340. 
 Ms. Kransky, 51, has run through her life savings of roughly $10,000. Her job search has garnered little besides anxiety.
 ''I've worked my entire life,'' said Ms. Kransky, who lives alone in a one-bedroom apartment. ''I've got October rent. After that, I don't know. I've never lived month to month my entire life. I'm just so scared, I can't even put it into words.'' 
 Last week, Ms. Kransky was invited to an interview for a clerical job with a health insurance company. She drove her Jeep truck downtown and waited in the lobby of an office building for nearly an hour, but no one showed. Despondent, she drove home, down $10 in gasoline.
 For years, the economy has been powered by consumers, who borrowed exuberantly against real estate and tapped burgeoning stock portfolios to spend in excess of their incomes. Those sources of easy money have mostly dried up. Consumption is now tempered by saving; optimism has been eclipsed by worry.
 Meanwhile, some businesses are in a holding pattern as they await the financial consequences of the health care reforms being debated in Washington.
 Even after companies regain an inclination to expand, they will probably not hire aggressively anytime soon. Experts say that so many businesses have pared back working hours for people on their payrolls, while eliminating temporary workers, that many can increase output simply by increasing the workload on existing employees.
 ''They have tons of room to increase work without hiring a single person,'' said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute Economist. ''For people who are out of work, we do not see signs of light at the end of the tunnel.''
 Even typically hard-charging companies are showing caution. 
 During the technology bubble of the late 1990s and again this decade, Cisco Systems -- which makes Internet equipment -- expanded rapidly. As the sense takes hold that the recession has passed, Cisco is again envisioning double-digit rates of sales growth, with plans to move aggressively into new markets, like the business of operating large scale computer data servers. 
 Yet even as Cisco pursues such designs, the company's chief executive, John T. Chambers, said in an interview Friday that he anticipated ''slow hiring,'' given concerns about the vigor of growth ahead. ''We'll be doing it selectively,'' he said.
 Two recent surveys of newspaper help-wanted advertisements and of employers' inclinations to add workers were at their lowest levels on record, noted Andrew Tilton, a Goldman Sachs economist.
 Job placement companies say their customers are not yet wiling to hire large numbers of temporary workers, usually a precursor to hiring full-timers. 
 ''It's going to take quite some time before we see robust job growth,'' said Tig Gilliam, chief executive of Adecco North America, a major job placement and staffing company.
 During the last recession, in 2001, the number of jobless people reached little more than double the number of full-time job openings, according to the Labor Department data. By the beginning of this year, job seekers outnumbered jobs four-to-one, with the ratio growing ever more lopsided in recent months. 
 Though layoffs have been both severe and prominent, the greatest source of distress is a predilection against hiring by many American businesses. From the beginning of the recession in December 2007 through July of this year, job openings declined 45 percent in the West and the South, 36 percent in the Midwest and 23 percent in the Northeast. 
 Shrinking job opportunities have assailed virtually every industry this year. Since the end of 2008, job openings have diminished 47 percent in manufacturing, 37 percent in construction and 22 percent in retail. Even in education and health services -- faster-growing areas in which many unemployed people have trained for new careers -- job openings have dropped 21 percent this year. Despite the passage of a stimulus spending package aimed at shoring up state and local coffers, government job openings have diminished 17 percent this year.
 In the suburbs of Chicago, Vicki Redican, 52, has been unemployed for almost two years, since she lost her $75,000-a-year job as a sales and marketing manager at a plastics company. College-educated, Ms. Redican first sought another management job. More recently, she has tried and failed to land a cashier's position at a local grocery store, and a barista slot at a Starbucks coffee shop. 
 Substitute teaching assignments once helped her pay the bills. ''Now, there are so many people substitute teaching that I can no longer get assignments,'' she said. 
 ''I've learned that I can't look to tomorrow,'' she said. ''Every day, I try to do the best I can. I say to myself, 'I don't control this process.' That's the only way you can look at it. Otherwise, you'd have to go up on the roof and crack your head open.''

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Unemployed Workers Competing for Limited Job Prospects: In July, there were nearly 14.5 million unemployed workers in the United States, but only about 2.4 million job openings, according to the Labor Department -- or six unemployed people for every job opening.

HEADLINE: Biblical Adversity in a '60s Suburb

BYLINE: By FRANZ LIDZ

 BODY:
THE story goes that during a Sabbath service a rabbi is seized by a sudden wave of guilt, prostrates himself and cries out, ''God, before you I am nothing!''
 The cantor is so moved by this demonstration of piety that he throws himself to the floor beside the rabbi and cries, ''God, before you I am nothing!''
 Watching this scene unfold from his seat in the first row, the chairman of the synagogue's trustees jumps up, flops down in the aisle and cries, ''God, before you I am nothing!''
 The rabbi nudges the cantor and whispers, ''So look who thinks he's nothing!'' 
 This ancient yarn -- known to Talmudic scholars as Jewish Joke No. 73 -- neatly encapsulates ''A Serious Man,'' the new film by Joel and Ethan Coen. ''The joke plays on the hubris of humility,'' says Dan Sklar, a Scarsdale, N.Y., rabbi who consulted on the production. ''The conceit of 'A Serious Man' -- and I mean that in the most literal sense -- is that God would have anything whatever to do with the inanities of human existence.''
 Filled with unfamiliar faces, ''A Serious Man,'' which opens on Oct. 2, is both a Job-like parable of Jewish angst in a 1960s Midwestern suburb and a bleakly antic meditation on divine intent, the certainty of uncertainty and the mysteries of Jefferson Airplane lyrics. (The film opens with the quotation ''Accept with simplicity everything that happens to you'' and ends with the disclaimer ''No Jews were hurt in the making of this motion picture.'') The 14th feature by the Coen brothers, the Oscar-winning writer-directors of ''Fargo'' and ''No Country for Old Men,'' ''A Serious Man'' is also the most personal project yet by two filmmakers sometimes dismissed as smart but bloodless.
 A prologue is set in a 19th-century Polish shtetl, where a neo-Hasidic folk tale plays out entirely in Yiddish. Other than establishing a framework for spirited disputation, the fable doesn't seem to have much to do with the rest of the film. 
 ''We just thought a Yiddish ghost tale would be a good ambassador for what comes after,'' Joel said.
 Ethan added: ''Yeah. We just thought it felt right.'' 
 The heart of ''A Serious Man'' concerns the personal and professional travails of Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a physics professor in desperate need of a metaphysician. His brother is a morose layabout, his son is a scheming pothead, his daughter has annexed the bathroom, his wife has dumped him for an unctuous windbag, a student is trying to bribe him for a grade, and a poison-pen letter writer threatens to ruin his chances for tenure.
 Struggling to make sense of the shambles of his life, Gopnik seeks spiritual guidance from three rabbis to become a person of substance, a serious man.
 ''Larry believes he's been a good enough person, and yet misfortunes keep befalling him,'' said Fred Melamed, the actor who plays Sy Ableman, the aforementioned unctuous windbag. ''He's not a drunk, he's not an adulterer, and he doesn't take his kid out of school to go hunting, like his goyish neighbor.'' 
 Of course the real deities of ''A Serious Man'' are the Coens, and they prove to be cruel gods. ''For us,'' Ethan said, ''the fun was inventing new ways to torment Larry.''
 Ethan, 52, and Joel, 54, have often riffed on Jews since their third feature, ''Miller's Crossing'' (1990), which famously showcased John Turturro as the double-dealing hustler Bernie the Shmatte. In ''Barton Fink'' (1991) and ''The Big Lebowski'' (1998) the Coens created nearly enough overtly Jewish characters to form a minyan.
 The introduction to the published ''Lebowski'' screenplay claims that the script won the 1998 Bar Kochba Award, ''honoring achievement in the arts that defy racial and religious stereotyping and promote appreciation for the multiplicity of man.'' The prize was allegedly bestowed by Rabbi Emmanuel Lev-Tov, author of the memoir ''You With the Schnozz.'' 
 ''The Jewish references in 'Lebowski' derived from stuff we heard in synagogues when we were little,'' said Ethan.
 Joel continued: ''If we grew up Unitarian, would we be writing about Unitarian characters? I mean, probably.''
 Occasionally the Coens are accused of engaging in grotesque ethnic stereotypes and even of being anti-Jewish. One New York critic took them to task over having Bernie the Shmatte whimper and grovel at the feet of a gun-toting gangster ''in a wood as bucolic as any birch grove in Poland.''
 Asked if they had intended to evoke the Holocaust, the Coens reacted with baffled amusement. ''That was even wackier than some of the stuff we get off the French critics,'' Joel said.
 The story of ''A Serious Man'' also came from the memories of their childhood in St. Louis Park, a heavily Jewish enclave that borders south Minneapolis. Their mother, Rena, came from an Orthodox family and kept a kosher house. 
 ''She toed the line in terms of party dogma,'' said Joel. ''My father, Ed, just went along for the ride. We were shocked to learn he ate Welsh rarebit at the Campus Club. I thought, 'Welsh rarebit -- that's made with bacon, isn't it?' It was an early disillusionment. 
 ''To be fair to Ed and put things in perspective, Joel and I would sneak over to a neighbor's house to eat ham. So it was more a situation like, well, he's no better than we are.''
 Though Ed taught economics at the University of Minnesota, Joel and Ethan maintain he was not the model for Larry Gopnik. 
 The same cannot be said with confidence of their older sister, Debbie, and the Gopnik daughter, Sarah. ''Debbie spent her entire adolescence washing her hair in the bathroom,'' Ethan recalled.
 Like the Gopnik son, Danny, the Coen boys went to Hebrew school from second to seventh grade, four days a week after school and on Sundays. And like Danny they were tutored by a Mitteleuropean who, to borrow a phrase from P. G. Wodehouse, was either a man of about 150 who was rather young for his years or a man of about 110 who had been aged by trouble.
 An equally elderly scholar inspired ''A Serious Man.''
 Joel: ''Years ago we considered making a short subject about a bar mitzvah boy who goes to see an ancient rabbi.''
 Ethan: ''The rabbi was loosely based on a sagelike figure we'd seen as kids, a Semitic Wizard of Oz. He never spoke, but he had great charisma.'' 
 As students of Hebrew the Coens were anything but Serious Young Men. They remember going through the motions, performing a sort of karaoke of studying. ''You'd go to class and just wait for it to end,'' said Ethan. 
 Danny Gopnik memorizes his bar mitzvah reading at home by listening to a 33 r.p.m. recording of ''Rabbi Youssele Rosenblatt Chants Your Haftorah Portion, Volume 12.'' Joel and Ethan followed a similar drill. 
 ''Getting bar mitzvah just meant you got presents,'' said Joel. ''In our eyes Judaism was more ethnic than religious.''
 It still is. Neither brother is an observant Jew. Joel jokes than he and his wife, the actress Frances McDormand (the daughter of a Disciples of Christ pastor), have brought up their adopted son, Pedro, as a pagan. 
 Still, Rabbi Sklar calls the Coens modern-day Jewish prophets. ''The role of the prophet is to speak truth to power and to speak truth to the people,'' he said. ''The Coens see right through the foibles of our humanity. They turn their lens on 'normalcy' and make the mundane at once abnormal, beautiful and terrifying.''
 Rabbi Sklar views ''A Serious Man'' as an attempt to reconcile the mystical and the absurd. 
 ''It's the most Jewish movie I've ever seen,'' he said. ''You leave the theater with a host of questions, no easy answers and, frankly, arguing about what it all means.''

HEADLINE: No Rest for the Security Weary

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
LIKE millions of other men, women and children who each day pass through the dizzying maze called the airport passenger screening system, Jim Adams, an executive at a natural gas company in Dallas, has gotten the drill down pat: taking off his shoes, stripping himself of jacket, belt, watch, cellphone and loose change, making sure his 3.4-ounce tubes of toothpaste and shaving gel are safely sealed in a quart-size plastic bag, unpacking his laptop, discarding that half-finished bottle of water -- all while glancing nervously at the clock, wondering if he is going to miss his flight.
 But several weeks ago, a new step was added to that routine: trying to prove to suddenly skeptical security agents that he actually was the person his boarding pass and photo ID said he was.
 A rule that is being phased in this year requires that the names on IDs and tickets match perfectly; it's not permissible to have an ID that reads ''John Smith,'' your legal name, and a ticket as ''Jack Smith,'' the name you use in everyday life. 
 Mr. Adams, 63, says he has routinely had to wait 30 minutes or more for a Transportation Security Administration official to check his ID and enter his name in a logbook. It's happened more than a dozen times, and he has never been told exactly why he is being singled out. 
 ''In the early days it was anything sharp or pointed,'' he said. ''Now it's gotten really personal. It's me. It's not my fingernail clippers or pen knife.''
 Mr. Adams said, however, that he was able to avoid additional security screening and subsequent delays on two flights this month for which he used his full name, James L. Adams Jr. He said he still hadn't received a response from the Transportation Security Administration about his problems on earlier flights.
 Even for people who pass through security with less difficulty than Mr. Adams, the airport security system has made flying increasingly miserable in the eight years since 9/11. Many of the measures instituted the last few years, like the limitations on liquids and the requirement that you take off your shoes, were almost knee-jerk reactions to specific scares and were left in place as a matter of course. 
 As rule upon rule has been added, passengers have learned to cope with the long lines, bag checks, physical pat-downs and carry-on restrictions that border on the absurd. But now there is a fresh opportunity for change. This month, the White House said that President Obama planned to nominate Erroll G. Southers, a former F.B.I. special agent, to head up the Transportation Security Administration, which has been without a permanent head for eight months. 
 Mr. Southers, who is now the assistant chief for Homeland Security at the agency that operates Los Angeles International and several other airports in that region, will, if approved, face the formidable challenge of balancing the yin and yang of airport security -- passenger convenience and safety. 
 Until now, passenger convenience has largely been ignored. After 9/11, a litany of sharp objects was banned from carry-ons. After Richard Reid tried to ignite explosives hidden in his sneaker on a flight from Paris to Miami in Dec. 2001, travelers were told to remove their shoes for screening. And after British officials foiled a plot to blow up planes with liquid explosives in August 2006, liquids, gels and aerosols were banned, though later allowed as long as they were packed in tiny bottles and in plastic bags. 
 And just when passengers think they know the routine, the Transportation Safety Administration adds a twist. Earlier this month, for example, it began screening certain powders in carry-on luggage. And screeners recently started asking passengers to place shoes directly on conveyor belts rather than in bins, giving officers a better view of shoes as they come through. 
 It's hard not to ask: Is all this necessary? Is it making us any safer? And will it ever get better? Based on interviews with a range of security experts, the answers increasingly seem to be no; not really; and not for a while. 
 Giovanni Bisignani, the chief executive of the International Air Transport Association, urged the Obama administration to deliver broad policy changes in security in a speech delivered to airline leaders in February.
 ''I am not convinced that we are much wiser or any more efficient with many of our processes,'' Mr. Bisignani said. ''As travelers, our shared experience is hassle, and as industry players, it is bureaucracy and cost. It is time for both to change.'' 
 Of course, if we look back at the state of security before 9/11, it's clear that we have made progress. People without a ticket can no longer waltz through the airport and up to the gate. Technology, including explosive-detection devices, has gotten better and is more consistently applied to checked and carry-on bags alike. Passengers are more consistently screened by a more stable security work force with less employment turnover. And at times, even the lines seem to be moving a hair faster. 
 A case could also be made that because there have been no successful attacks against a United States commercial flight since 9/11, the system is indeed working. But inconsistencies, contradictory rules and flat out screening failures continue to provoke skepticism among passengers and security experts alike. 
 ''My wife was recently shocked to discover that she had accidentally taken a large pair of scissors in her knitting bag on a recent trip, and they were not discovered in either the outgoing or returning trips,'' said Walt Ciciora, an electrical engineer from Southport, Conn. ''That concerned us.''
 Echoing the opinions of many security experts interviewed, Andrew R. Thomas, editor in chief of the Journal of Transportation Security, said that since 9/11 two things have made aviation safer: reinforced cockpit doors and the conviction of passengers to bring down terrorists, as evidenced by the action taken on United Flight 93. ''Any substantive measures put in place by T.S.A. since 9/11 are effectively window dressing and have done little to reduce the overall risk to the system,'' he said in an e-mail message. 
 ''I think we do a lot of things that are foolish and silly,'' he said in a separate telephone conservation, ''and there doesn't seem to be a mechanism in place to pull back and evaluate what's working and what's not.'' 
 The Transportation Security Administration disagrees.
 ''We are constantly looking at the risks that we see and the procedures we have in place and ensuring the resources we have available to us,'' said the acting administrator, Gale D. Rossides. ''The dollars we are investing, the people we're employing, are focused on the highest priorities.'' 
 And there are multiple layers of security in place so that if one area fails and, say, someone sneaks a knife onboard a plane, there are also locked cockpit doors to thwart hijackers.
 Each week, as evidence that it is getting the job done, the agency posts on its Web site (www.tsa.gov) a tally of passenger arrests and banned items, including firearms, found at checkpoints. For the week beginning Sept. 7, for example, 11 passengers were arrested ''after investigations of suspicious behavior or fraudulent travel documents,'' 40 firearms were found at checkpoints, 6 ''artfully concealed prohibited items'' were discovered, and there were 30 incidents that involved a ''checkpoint closure, terminal evacuation or sterile area breach.''
 ''It would be terrific,'' Ms. Rossides said, if passengers could one day walk through a checkpoint without having to open their bags or take off their shoes and jackets. But she made it clear that those wishes were hers and not necessarily on the government's agenda. 
 ''That's my vision,'' she said, ''not T.S.A.'s or D.H.S.'s vision, but my vision -- where the industry can create the kind of technology where it is much easier on the traveler and still provides T.S.A. with the detection capability. The innovation in the labs and the industry will get us there.''
 Removing any of the security measures, even the most criticized and ineffective, would be a risky political decision for the Obama administration, opening up the White House to second-guessing. Undoing a long-established rule will inevitably provoke skepticism about the reasoning behind the decision. Therefore, if any of the procedures are to be changed, they must be proved to be ineffective or replaced and improved -- not merely eliminated.
 All this takes time and testing, whether it is to demonstrate what little gains in safety come from collecting lip gloss and moisturizers at checkpoints or to develop technologies that make screening safer and more efficient. That means passengers are likely to be stuck with the current airport screening process for several years. 
 Is any relief at hand? Well, you may one day be able to walk through security without having to relinquish your water bottle or your jar of moisturizer, but that day may be at least two years away, at best.
 Advanced X-ray machines now being rolled out to airports could be programmed to distinguish between hazardous and benign liquids, enabling passengers to carry full-size tubes of hair gel and to keep their Gatorade bottles in their bags. Currently, 78 of the more than 450 airports nationwide where the Transportation Security Administration maintains security have the new X-ray machines, which offer multiple views of carry-on luggage as opposed to one top-down look. The agency expects to have contracts in place by the end of fiscal 2010 to buy enough machines to cover the rest. 
 But beyond the rollout of the machines, there is another integral step that must also be completed: software must be developed and installed to differentiate between liquids. And neither the agency nor the software manufacturers will even hint at a timeline.
 Kip Hawley, a former head of the Transportation Security Administration, said Washington needed to make this happen sooner rather than later. ''I don't think they need to make massive changes,'' he said. ''They just need to hit the accelerator.'' 
 BUT speeding things up isn't an easy task, he acknowledged, partly because of resistance from passengers themselves. Take those full-body screening machines, the kind that provide a stark image of the naked body, and which Mr. Hawley said could be the answer to the current jacket, belt and jewelry strip down. Yet, while they might eliminate much of the annoyance of going through security, many passengers have objected to them because they found the machines personally invasive.
 Earlier this year, in fact, the House of Representatives approved an amendment, still making its way through Congress, to limit the use of the machines to secondary screening and to require that passengers be offered a pat-down search in lieu of such screening. 
 If the increasingly cumbersome screening process has proved anything, however, it's that travelers are a highly adaptable species. And when the facts show that the benefits of a particular security method outweigh the privacy issues, many are willing accept it. 
 ''I equate this to E-ZPass for vehicles,'' said Chris Grniet, a vice president at the Kroll Security Group. ''Everyone said this will be an invasion of privacy,'' and certain people still will not do it, he said. But those who embraced the system no longer have to slow down for tolls.
 Another factor that cannot be ignored is that passenger numbers and, consequently, security checkpoint volume are down because of the economy. But as a recovery and passenger traffic pick up, the system will be under enormous pressure. Lines will grow, waiting times will rise, and screeners will face added pressure to speed things along.
 ''The procedures are not being reduced; if anything they're being added,'' said Brian Michael Jenkins, an international expert on terrorism at the Mineta Transportation Institute. ''The number of T.S.A. screeners are not going up, so either the line gets longer or we get smarter. Or we invent the X-ray for a man's soul.''

HEADLINE: Cardinals' Mr. April Set the Table ...

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ

DATELINE: TUCSON 

 BODY:
A dogpile this was not. The people who rushed and hugged Brian Barden on Thursday night were not St. Louis Cardinals on the Busch Stadium turf, but his wife and 2-year-old daughter on his kitchen-floor linoleum. His 20-hour drive home from Memphis -- and one crazy season -- were finally over.
 ''Hey, Boo-Boo!'' Barden said to his toddler, Averie, as she surveyed the father she had not seen since July. ''Do you remember me?''
 That question could be posed to anyone who watched the Cardinals clinch the National League Central title Saturday night. St. Louis will bound into the postseason for well-worn reasons: the bat of Albert Pujols, acquisitions like Matt Holliday, the arms of Chris Carpenter and Adam Wainwright, the coaching of Dave Duncan. Few people would recall Barden, a journeyman infielder who hit .141 after April, was optioned to the minors and was barely heard from again. 
 But teams are not static stat sheets, freeze-dried sums of numbers and games and personalities. They are organic, evolving from April through September, with the old saw holding that games in all months matter equally. But the 2009 Cardinals are glaring proof that games in April can in fact matter much more. Time moves in only one direction, and dominoes do not fall backward.
 ''If Brian Barden doesn't do what he did in April and we don't get off to that hot start, I'm not sure we're in a position to do the things we did this year,'' Cardinals General Manager John Mozeliak said. ''Things could have been a lot different.''
 The logic goes like this: Barden, a 28-year-old rookie who barely made the team as a backup infielder, bats .385 with three home runs in April, during which time he -- and his nondescript third-base platoon partner, Joe Thurston -- deliver several crucial hits to spark the Cardinals' 16-7 start. After bracing for a lull from the economy, the team begins to draw far more fans to Busch Stadium than executives had forecast, by about 5,000 per game.
 When rampant injuries produce a teamwide slump that leaves the Cardinals two games out of first on June 30, the club still has enough potential -- and millions of unforeseen dollars -- to become buyers on the trade front. Mozeliak acquires infielder Mark DeRosa from Cleveland, then the market's prized talent, Holliday, from Oakland for prospects. With Holliday forming a perilous 3-4 punch with Pujols, and other holes patched by shortstop Julio Lugo and pitcher John Smoltz, the Cardinals roar through August at 20-6, pulling away from the Chicago Cubs for good by Labor Day.
 Barden was around for none of it. His .385 April turned to a .132 May, and he soon found himself in Class AAA Memphis. The acquisitions of DeRosa and Lugo assured he would never see St. Louis again. He played out the season and returned home on Thursday, reuniting with his family and unsure where he will wind up next year -- maybe Japan.
 Baseball history is dotted with Hurricane Hazles and Marty Bystroms who emerge from the minors, play out of their minds and put their teams into the playoffs. Their impact is obvious and memorable. Best of all, they get to jump on the dogpile they made possible.
 ''I'll watch it, I guess -- even though I'm not there, I'm still a part of this team,'' Barden said, sitting in his backyard fresh from that 20-hour drive. ''But I'm missing something you grow up dreaming about. We all want to be in that moment.''
 In March, Barden just wanted to be in the Cardinals' consideration for their mess at third base. The veteran Troy Glaus was out with a bum shoulder; David Freese and Joe Mather got top consideration to replace him, but camp broke with Freese and Thurston as Manager Tony La Russa's primary third-base platoon. Barden clawed on as the just-in-case 25th man.
 Thurston actually became the team's first breakout hero. A survivor of 10 minor league seasons making his first opening day roster -- he had even been released by the Washington Nationals -- Thurston drove in 11 runs in his first 40 at-bats and was at times hitting well over .350.
 On April 13, Barden, who had spent five of his seven pro seasons percolating in Class AAA, got a spot start at second base only because, La Russa said, he did not want him ''to rot.'' Barden hit a game-deciding home run in a2-1 victory at Arizona. He entered the next two games as a late substitute but still got hits in each. Then he hit solo shots in two straight starts at third. Just as Thurston cooled off, Barden got hot, finishing the month hitting .385 and being named the National League's rookie of the month.
 ''I had three home runs in a week -- it was surreal,'' Barden said. ''I couldn't believe what was happening.''
 St. Louis was just as entranced. Known as baseball's most supportive city, it embraced the rookie-laden Cardinals -- particularly Thurston and Barden -- as the club ended April with the majors' best record, 16-7. Even after Carpenter and the sluggers Ryan Ludwick and Rick Ankiel were injured and the team slumped, attendance routinely topped 40,000. Mozeliak said that by late May the Cardinals became confident that their ultimate season attendance -- warily projected at 2.9 million because of the economy -- was going to wind up more like 3.3 million.
 With each unexpected ticket generally bringing about $25 in revenue, Cardinals fans had staked the front office with millions to buy reinforcements. DeRosa cost about $3 million for his three months; Holliday, close to $4 million for two. Smoltz and Lugo were inexpensive but integral.
 ''When we were doing our off-season planning and looking at the economy and what we were trying to accomplish, we had a lot of fear,'' Mozeliak said. ''But due to a strong start, we had a momentum with people coming out to the ballpark. That energy allowed us to do the things that we did.''
 Those things included sending Barden to the minors soon after his gruesome May, when he pressed to continue the magic. ''I wanted to be a major contributor every day -- for a month I was that guy,'' he said. 
 Barden came up from Memphis briefly a few more times but went down to stay on July 24 -- to make room for Holliday. Barden hit .267 and helped Memphis win what was, for him, a bittersweet Pacific Coast League championship.
 Meanwhile, Thurston was not faring much better. He hit just .214 after those blistering first two weeks; DeRosa became the third baseman, and Thurston's at-bats became increasingly scarce. Thurston has stuck around all year but still may not make the postseason roster, meaning that in October he may soon join his old locker neighbor, Barden, in watching the Cardinals from afar.
 ''If the help that we were had something to do with getting Matt Holliday and Mark DeRosa, that makes it more beautiful,'' Thurston said of Mozeliak's nod. ''I would never have thought about it that way.''
 Perhaps too distracted now, the Cardinals players will surely remember Barden's contribution when they carve up shares of postseason bonus money. Barden got only a few months' taste of a big-league salary, so it will definitely help to pay off debt. Maybe to kick-start Averie's college fund the way her father did the 2009 Cardinals so many months ago.
 ''I don't know -- I'd rather have a ring,'' Barden said before going back inside and starting his off-season. ''It signifies that you were part of something special. It cements your place in time.''
 If not in October, then in April.

HEADLINE: New Rules Coming Soon

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
STATES have taken the lead in adopting laws to protect consumers from some of the problem loans that helped trigger the home foreclosure crisis, but the federal government is now stepping up its efforts.
 On Oct. 1, new rules adopted by the Federal Reserve will go into effect, requiring greater diligence on the part of mortgage lenders and brokers who make so-called high cost loans for borrowers with weak credit. The interest rates on these loans are at least 1.5 percentage points higher than the average prime mortgage rate.
 Some consumer advocates applaud the new rules but say they come too late to help many borrowers. Mortgage executives, meanwhile, have expressed concern that the changes could further dry up the mortgage market. 
 The regulations -- finalized in July 2008 but only now being put into effect -- bar lenders from making a high-cost mortgage without verifying that a borrower could repay the loan in the conventional way, and not simply through a foreclosure sale.
 During the home lending boom from 2003 to 2006, subprime lenders would often offer loans without requiring borrowers to prove that they could make the monthly payments. With stated-income loans -- or as some called them, ''liar loans'' -- borrowers could easily fabricate annual income figures and even buy a home without a down payment.
 Those lies represented mortgage fraud, but brokers and lenders often overlooked them -- and in some cases even encouraged lying -- in the interest of generating loan fees.
 The new regulations represent one of the most substantial efforts on the part of the federal government to combat such lending practices, at least in the realm of subprime loans.
 In recent years, states like New York and Connecticut have enacted legislation that requires greater underwriting diligence from lenders who make subprime loans. 
 But those laws applied only to state-chartered institutions, like community savings banks, and not the federally chartered banking institutions, like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, that dominate the mortgage industry.
 According to Uriah King, a senior policy associate for the Center for Responsible Lending, a consumer advocacy group based in Durham, N.C., the new federal rules are ''important, and they are good.''
 But Mr. King says the new regulations are ''five years too late.'' Had they been in place earlier in the decade, he said, they would have prevented some of the damage done in the foreclosure crisis.
 Lenders continued to make stated-income loans into 2007, but by that time, the volume of these loans had tailed off sharply. 
 Since then, borrowers who cannot fully document their income -- like restaurant waiters or others who take cash payments -- have largely been turned away by lenders.
 Mr. King said another shortcoming in the new regulations is that they do not cover option ARMs, adjustable-rate mortgages on which borrowers can choose from several monthly payments options during the loan's early years. (Borrowers often chose the minimum-payment option, which usually didn't even cover the loan's monthly interest charge.) 
 JIM PAIR, the president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers, which is based in McLean, Va., says he is pleased that the new rules do not enact a ''suitability standard,'' whereby loan officers are legally responsible for offering loans that best suit the borrower's circumstances. 
 But Mr. Pair said he was concerned that the rules would greatly curtail loan alternatives, especially for those who might qualify only for subprime mortgages.
 ''We're going to have some consumers who are not able to purchase a home because of this, since most lenders don't want to do high-cost loans,'' he said. ''There's too much potential liability for them.''

HEADLINE: Indie Filmmakers: China's New Guerillas

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE; Zhang Jing contributed research.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
 OVER the course of six years Zhao Dayong, an independent filmmaker from Guangzhou, China, spent many months living among the residents of Zhiziluo, an impoverished and forgotten village in the rugged mountains near the Myanmar border, and filming their lives.
 Using his own money and simple digital filmmaking equipment he made ''Ghost Town,'' a quiet, hypnotizing, three-hour documentary that provides an extraordinary and intimate portrait of Chinese life.
 Like independent filmmakers everywhere, Mr. Zhao worked with no guarantee of an audience, or even a place to show his work. By his estimates only a few thousand people have seen ''Ghost Town'' in China since he finished it last year. Several hundred more are scheduled to see it Sunday afternoon when the film has its international premiere at the New York Film Festival.
 But what makes Mr. Zhao's commitment particularly noteworthy is that his project was apparently illegal. 
 The Chinese government has decreed that all films must be approved by government censors before being distributed and screened, including in overseas film festivals. 
 Mr. Zhao, 39, said getting the approval of the censors was never a consideration. ''It's like asking to be raped,'' he said this month in an interview here. ''The government certainly has its own agenda. They want us to stop. But at the same time we know we're doing something meaningful.'' 
 This mixture of defiance and principle defines China's nascent yet highly dynamic crop of independent filmmakers who pursue their art in apparent violation of the law. 
 For decades the Chinese government had nearly full control over all aspects of the film industry, from celluloid filmmaking technology to financing to distribution and screening. An underground filmmaking subculture emerged in China in the late 1980s, but it began to flourish only about a decade ago with the advent of inexpensive digital cameras and postproduction computer programs that helped put filmmaking further out of reach of the government authorities.
 Many of this latest generation of Chinese filmmakers have no formal film training and shoot on minimal budgets, often with small crews, or alone. Ying Liang, whose films have won numerous prizes on the international circuit, shot his widely celebrated debut film, ''Taking Father Home,'' using a borrowed camera. Relatives and friends were his cast and crew. 
 ''Unlike in previous generations, the stars of this generation are not only Beijing Film Academy graduates,'' said Karin Chien, a film producer in New York and president of dGenerate Films, a company she founded last year to distribute this new crop of independent Chinese films outside China. ''They're journalists, they work at television stations, they're painters, they're people who just picked up a camera and made a film for $1,000.'' 
 Output is still small. Several leading filmmakers put the annual production of unsanctioned, independent films at fewer than 200. But this work has provided unusual ground-level views of China that possess an unvarnished authenticity often missing from mainstream, government-sanctioned films.
 ''There's been an extraordinary explosion of young filmmakers -- quite a few of them are quite talented -- who are dedicated to record and tell the real story of what's going on in China,'' said Richard Pena, program director for the Film Society of Lincoln Center, which produces the New York Film Festival. ''That story is really more fascinating than the story that the regime wanted to be told.'' 
 These achievements have come at a price. 
 About 20 filmmakers have been banned from making films for two to five years, according to Zhang Xianmin, an independent film producer and a professor at the Beijing Film Academy. Others have received intimidating phone calls, had tapes confiscated or been detained and interrogated. 
 But according to several filmmakers and film scholars both here and abroad, the government recently appears to have adopted a somewhat hands-off, though highly watchful, posture toward this film vanguard, leaving it to operate in an undefined gray area. 
 It seems that as long as certain incendiary topics are not broached -- among them the Tiananmen Square massacre, Tibet, the Cultural Revolution, the outlawed religious group Falun Gong -- then independent filmmakers are allowed to work.
 Yet no one is absolutely sure where the boundaries are, or whether the government will start to clamp down more fiercely. 
 ''You don't know where that limit is,'' said Zhang Yaxuan, a critic and documentary filmmaker who is organizing an independent film archive for the Iberia Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing. ''You have to try to touch it. In the process of trying, you know.'' 
 Huang Wenhai, a documentary filmmaker in Beijing, said that the process of filmmaking here ''is the process of conquering your fear.'' 
 Despite this pressure and uncertainty, there are now at least four major independent film festivals around the country and at least two theaters, both small, dedicated to showing Chinese independent films. 
 Meanwhile Chinese audiences largely remain out of reach. With cinemas and television off limits to their unsanctioned films, independent moviemakers are mostly restricted to screenings in front of small audiences in art galleries, bars, universities and homes.
 As a result the most accomplished filmmakers have found their largest audiences overseas, especially at international film festivals. 
 ''I feel very frustrated,'' Mr. Zhao said. ''I'm a Chinese filmmaker, and of course my audience should be the Chinese people, especially since my films are about ordinary working Chinese people.'' He added, ''That would be more valuable than winning an international film festival.'' 
 Mr. Zhao began his career in the fine arts. He studied oil painting at an art academy before dropping out and working as a professional artist and advertising director in Beijing and Guangzhou. He eventually founded his own advertising firm as well as a journal for contemporary arts, and he opened a gallery in Shanghai. 
 His first documentary was ''Street Life,'' a portrait of recyclers on the streets of Shanghai, which had its premiere at the Viennale in Austria in 2006. ''Ghost Town,'' his second film, is a series of vignettes and scenes that explore the economic struggles, religious beliefs and relationships of the residents of Zhiziluo, which had once been a local county seat for the Communist Party but was largely abandoned by the government. 
 Mr. Pena said he had heard about the film for some time but finally viewed it in the 11th hour of the festival's film-selection process. ''It's one of those films that, when we saw it, there was little question in our minds that it should be included,'' he said. ''Ghost Town'' is the first documentary from China's new generation of digital independent filmmakers to be included in the New York festival. 
 Mr. Zhao, who continues to support himself by shooting television advertisements, said he had no illusions that his films would ever make him much money. 
 ''For me, making films is a way of life, not the means to it,'' he said. ''And I really enjoy this life.''

HEADLINE: Struggling to Keep Tabs on Paroled Sex Offenders

BYLINE: By SOLOMON MOORE

DATELINE: ESCONDIDO, Calif. 

 BODY:
Darrell Littleton calls them ''his guys,'' but he does not trust them.
 One got drunk and exposed himself to a jogger in a public park. Another was a fire captain until he molested his 13-year-old stepdaughter, went to prison and lost his wife, his job and his home. Now the man sleeps behind a drive-through restaurant.
 Mr. Littleton is a parole agent, and ''his guys,'' about 40 in all, are paroled sex offenders. On a September morning, as he does each day, Mr. Littleton fired up his laptop computer to check on his charges; the signals from their global-positioning ankle bracelets trace dotted trails cutting through a Google satellite map. Mr. Littleton tracks them, calls them frequently and shows up unannounced to make sure they are behaving themselves. But they still struggle to stay straight. 
 One of his parolees recently harassed a teenage prostitute, and Mr. Littleton had to ''violate him'' -- revoke his parole and return him to prison. Another promised Mr. Littleton that once he is off parole in a few months, and no longer subject to random drug testing, he is going to resume his marijuana habit. And before the day was over, another parolee would emerge as a suspect in a sexual assault on a 9-year-old girl. ''Twenty is really the ideal caseload for my guys,'' Mr. Littleton said as he drove a high-riding pickup truck on one of several parolee visits he had planned that day. ''With that kind of caseload, I could spend more time in the field and less in the office. With these guys, you don't want them to know you're coming. You need to watch them when they don't know they're being watched.'' 
 A series of high-profile crimes involving parolees in California highlight the challenges of keeping track of them in a state that discharges more than 120,000 inmates annually, more than any other. 
 Last month, two campus police officers at the University of California, Berkeley, became suspicious of a paroled sex offender named Phillip Garrido and called his parole officer, leading to Mr. Garrido's arrest on charges of kidnapping Jaycee Dugard, now 29, in 1991, raping her and holding her captive in a backyard encampment.
 Like the sex offenders Mr. Littleton supervises, Mr. Garrido had been monitored by GPS and visited at his home at least twice a month by parole agents. But he was still able to keep his secret for 18 years.
 In July, a Los Angeles man on parole was arrested in the kidnapping and murder of a 17-year-old girl, and an Oakland parolee shot and killed four police officers before killing himself. 
 California is the only state that places all released prisoners on parole, no matter the seriousness of their crime. Even at a time of historically low violent crime, critics argue that overloading parole agents compromises public safety. 
 Legislation passed this month will reduce the ''average'' caseloads for parole agents to 45, from 70, and nonviolent, less serious offenders will no longer be returned to prison for administrative infractions like missing counseling appointments, ditching parole agent visits or failing drug tests. Agents handling some of the most violent offenders, like Mr. Littleton's parolees, will also see their caseloads reduced.
 Legislators argued that the law was necessary to reduce chronic prison overcrowding. Packed prisons thwart rehabilitation programs and medical treatment and incite riots on a regular basis, according to findings in federal civil rights cases against the California corrections system.
 The law was hard-won by the Democratic-controlled state legislature. Corrections officer unions, police organizations and prosecutors opposed it, arguing that even parolees convicted of nonviolent crimes were too dangerous to be left unsupervised.
 Mr. Littleton said he thought parolees should be given incentives for early release and reduced supervision inside and outside of prison -- G.E.D. courses, drug treatment programs and psychological counseling, for example. But providing services is one thing the legislation does not emphasize. 
 In fact, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger announced $280 million in cuts this week to educational and rehabilitation programs inside prison. The cutbacks follow an 80 percent cut in Proposition 36, the state's largest drug treatment diversion program, even though most parolees suffer from drug and alcohol addictions, mental illnesses and chronic unemployment. A University of California, Los Angeles, study showed that the program, approved by voters in 2000, treated 30,000 drug offenders a year in lieu of prison and saved $2 in taxes for every $1 invested in the program. 
 Michelle Jackson, a parole agent in Corona, about 50 miles east of Los Angeles, who supervises 40 violent felons, said she would prefer to focus on the social work aspect of her job rather than the law enforcement role but sees few alternatives, even with the new legislation. ''Most programs won't take my guys or they want them to pay, and all my parolees have very low-paying jobs,'' she said. ''They can't afford a month's worth of counseling.''
 When Ms. Jackson visits Faafetai Niusila, 39, a muscular member of the Sons of Samoa gang, she chides him for his lack of chivalry toward his wife.
 ''Really? You're going to let her carry the groceries by herself?'' Ms. Jackson asked as she watched Mr. Niusila's wife struggle to carry bags into their house. Mr. Niusila, who served 12 years in prison for attempted murder, hustled across the lawn to help.
 After Mr. Niusila, Ms. Jackson visited Shelton Miles, 38, who was on parole for shooting a man in 1991. He spent more than 10 years in prison. ''Does someone collect shot glasses?'' Ms. Jackson asked warily as she spied them on a shelf. If Mr. Miles is caught abusing alcohol, his parole could be revoked. 
 ''No, no,'' he said. ''My sons' sports teams give them out.'' 
 Ms. Jackson said that in the absence of appropriate programs, she was more likely to revoke an offender's parole.
 ''If employment doesn't work out, if staying home doesn't work out, and they start using again or getting in trouble -- even if it's not another crime -- we have to violate them to protect the community because we don't know what will happen,'' she said.
 That uncertainty keeps Mr. Littleton thinking about his guys even when he is off the clock. Even a vigilant parole agent cannot keep parolees out of trouble every minute of every day, he said. 
 Around the middle of his shift, Mr. Littleton received an alert that the police here in Escondido, a suburb of San Diego, were looking for a parolee supervised by his office named Ricardo Perez Borbon, 70, in connection with an assault on a 9-year-old girl. Mr. Borbon was on parole after serving 12 years for sexually assaulting a 9-year-old girl.
 The signal from Mr. Borbon's GPS anklet indicated that he had lingered near an elementary school an hour earlier and then had gone to his residential construction job before tampering with the homing device a few blocks away. Mr. Littleton gunned his truck toward the location to meet other agents. They found the anklet under a roadside cactus. Mr. Borbon was now a fugitive. ''We'll be focusing on him now,'' said Lindon Lewis, Mr. Littleton's supervisor. ''He has our full attention now.''
 Mr. Littleton returned to his truck and clipped Mr. Borbon's mug shot -- slicked-back hair, a salt-and-pepper moustache, grim eyes with dark circles underneath -- onto his sun visor. The parolee's face looked down at him.

DANCING IN THE DARK
 A Cultural History of the Great Depression
 By Morris Dickstein
 Illustrated. 598 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $29.95
 When did we start slicing history into 10-year chunks? In 1926, Thomas Beer wrote ''The Mauve Decade,'' his book about the 1890s -- in the midst of what became known as the Roaring Twenties. That era landed us in the Hungry Thirties (or the Red Decade), a grimmer 10-year package. After the curative cataclysm of a second world war, we took up where we left off: the convention-bound '50s, the subversive '60s, the cringe-inducing '70s, the avaricious '80s. Why should our affairs slot into a decimal system? What about long-term trends and the manifest perversity of the human spirit, which guarantees that a significant portion of the population will be zigging while the rest zag? 
 I'd propose a moratorium on decade analysis -- except that Morris Dickstein's ''Dancing in the Dark: A Cultural History of the Great Depression'' proves the value of the exercise in certain special cases. The '30s were neither uniformly red nor universally hungry, but they were undeniably shadowed by economic crisis. This was the decade in which knee-jerk American assumptions about prosperity were knocked sharply back, when the American Dream -- the phrase dates from the early '30s -- took a drubbing. A 25 percent unemployment rate (the grim statistic from the winter of 1932) is bound to tell; so is the failure of more than 5,000 banks in just two years. The numbers were bleak, but not as bleak, perhaps, as the mood: ''There was hardly a man or woman in the country,'' the popular historian Frederick Lewis Allen wrote in 1931, ''whose attitude toward life had not been affected . . . in some degree . . . by the sudden and brutal shattering of hope.'' 
 Dickstein, a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, has organized his engaging and perceptive study around the American response to dire economic conditions and the attendant psychological damage -- as sadly relevant a topic as any author could wish for. Though he argues, for instance, that the cultural shifts during the course of the decade ''parallel the effects of the New Deal,'' he does so without falling into the trap of seeing the '30s as a self-contained unit. He recognizes, crucially, that the modernist flowering of the '20s carried over after the stock-market crash, and that the documentary impulse, so strong during the Depression, stretched back 40-odd years to Jacob Riis's ''How the Other Half Lives.'' Dickstein's worldview can comfortably accommodate the fact that John Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath'' and Nathanael West's ''Day of the Locust,'' two utterly dissimilar and yet equally harrowing accounts of Depression California, were both published in 1939, and that Woody Guthrie broke into radio the same year -- 1937 -- that Partisan Reviewpublished Delmore Schwartz's ''In Dreams Begin Responsibilities.'' Raw, sentimental populism could share the same cradle with mordant, polished modernism.
 ''Dancing in the Dark'' is old-school cultural history, with a whiff of Matthew Arnold and the best that has been thought and said. Well before he gets to Woody Guthrie, Dickstein signals with his title a keen interest in popular song (he's a big fan of Bing Crosby's recording of Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz's ballad). He also looks at photographs and design and mentions dance and painting. But his principal focus is on books and movies, and his bias is in favor of high art. ''I made no effort to cover everything,'' he writes in his preface; he chose instead to concentrate on ''unusually complex, enduring works.'' That's good news for those of us who welcome any reminder of the glories of '30s literature and film. When Dickstein sends us back to Faulkner's ''As I Lay Dying'' or Fitzgerald's''Tender Is the Night'' or ''Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,'' that extraordinary, unclassifiable collaboration between James Agee and Walker Evans, when he prompts us to listen again to the sly screwball banter of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant in ''Bringing Up Baby,'' we can only thank him.
 But he does more than just reintroduce us to old friends; he shows them in a new light. After a fond, lingering look at ''Shall We Dance'' -- Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire in the spotlight, romancing to songs by George and Ira Gershwin -- Dickstein sums up expertly: ''Each number is a miniature of the movie, moving from singing alone, dancing alone, dancing with the wrong person, or dancing to the wrong music to making beautiful music together.'' With his next breath he roughly reminds us of the context: ''It's the music, the dancing, that saves all this from familiar romantic cliche. As photography documents the Depression, dance countermands it.'' And then he takes one more step back to give us an even broader view: ''The culture of elegance, as represented by Astaire and the Gershwins, was less about the cut of your tie and tails than the cut of your feelings, the inner radiance that was one true bastion against social suffering. They preserved in wit, rhythm and fluidity of movement what the Depression almost took away, the high spirits of Americans, young and modern, who had once felt destined to be the heirs and heiresses of all the ages.'' Sheer delight, pure escapism, serves its cathartic purpose -- and it means something, too. 
 Which makes the omission of Walt Disney (his name doesn't even appear in the index) all the more perplexing. Even if one rejects the provocative claim by the historian Warren Susman that ''Mickey Mouse may in fact be more important to an understanding of the 1930s than Franklin Roosevelt,'' it's hard to deny Disney a place in the pantheon of the decade's moviemakers, if only for ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' and ''Fantasia.'' Whether or not the cartoons that delighted '30s audiences are complex works of art, they would have slotted nicely into several of Dickstein's chapters. On the lookout for a cultural artifact that served to ''lift sagging morale and stimulate optimism about the future''? Try any one of the dozens of animated shorts featuring that cartoon collective, Mickey, Donald Duck and Goofy. Every gag is an explosion of energy, and the whirligig of slapstick invention always ends happily, thanks to the orchestrated efforts of our heroes. Mickey, described by Disney as ''a little fellow trying to do the best he could,'' may have been born in the late '20s, but he grew up a pure creature of the '30s.
 One of the paradoxes of ''Dancing in the Dark'' is that despite its laudable ambitions, it's not particularly in tune with the temper of the '30s. As Dickstein points out, this was a period of unprecedented national self-scrutiny -- and our gaze was most often fixed on the things we had in common, on the culture of the people. Whereas Dickstein wants to tell us about Henry Roth's ''Call It Sleep,'' which he hails as ''one of the great novels of the century'' (I'm unpersuaded), or draw attention to the populist elements in Aaron Copland's ballet scores, a contemporary critic might have been more inclined to analyze the wild popularity of Monopoly, the board game patented in 1935, or the ''candid camera'' craze (production of cameras in theUnited States jumped 157 percent from 1935 to 1937 -- no slump there), which Frederick Lewis Allen, writing in 1940, linked to the haunting photographs of ''dismal streets, tattered billboards and gaunt, sad-eyed farm women'' by Walker Evans and others. With every click of the shutter, the documentary impulse was democratized. 
 I only wish Dickstein had taken a somewhat more catholic approach and embraced ordinary things people did, like snap photos and listen to the Lone Ranger on the radio and play pinball down at the drugstore. ''Dancing in the Dark'' is a fine, high-minded survey of the decade's cultural history, but it did leave me hungry for a glimpse of everyday life.

HEADLINE: Taking Health Care Courtship Up Another Notch

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With its swanky wine bar and jazz pianist, the 701 Restaurant is one of those downtown spots where lobbyists woo clients and couples pursue romance. But it was a political courtship -- President Obama's quest for a health care overhaul -- that brought the White House budget director, Peter R. Orszag, and Senator Susan Collins of Maine together for a recent dinner there. 
 Ms. Collins is one of a handful of moderate Republicans who might provide the president a pivotal vote, but she is playing hard to get. Over entrees -- she had lamb loin, he had Scottish salmon -- they talked about cutting health costs and about ''the Mayo Clinic experience,'' Ms. Collins said. Mr. Orszag was so intent on answering her questions that, mid-meal, he took out his BlackBerry to send e-mail queries to the Mayo chief executive.
 The courtship of Ms. Collins offers a glimpse into what White House officials say is an increasingly aggressive campaign to line up votes for a health care bill, which faces a crucial vote in the Senate Finance Committee this week. After months of cutting deals and stroking drug makers, hospitals and doctors, the president's aides are laying the groundwork for a final round of Congressional arm-twisting, with Mr. Obama increasingly in a hands-on role. 
 As the Finance Committee wrestles with the bill, which could form the backbone of an eventual Obama plan, the lobbying effort is already bearing fruit. One Democrat who consults frequently with the White House said that a main goal of the administration has been to prevent any Democrat from publicly declaring opposition to the measure. So far, the only one who has, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, has scaled back his criticism after a private Oval Office session with the president.
 Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff, runs the campaign out of his West Wing office. A former congressman, he knows how to count votes. (It was Mr. Emanuel, for instance, who suggested Mr. Orszag reach out to Ms. Collins.) Aides say he does not host a regular health care meeting, but rather summons his team several times a day, typically with e-mail messages ordering colleagues to drop everything and show up right that minute. 
 Mr. Emanuel oversees two working groups: a policy group, run by Nancy-Ann DeParle, the head of the White House Office of Health Reform, and a political group, run by Jim Messina, the deputy chief of staff. They are deeply engaged in what Chris Jennings, who advised President Bill Clinton on health policy, calls ''intelligence seeking'' -- trying to learn who has problems with the legislation, what those problems are and what it will take to win each member's vote.
 ''We are at the concern-addressing stage,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, Mr. Obama's deputy communications director, adding, ''This is a political and policy challenge of epic proportions, and it takes a lot of effort and attention to achieve it.''
 Everyone who has relationships on Capitol Hill is expected to pitch in. Mr. Messina, a former chief of staff to Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the Finance Committee chairman, is the link to the finance panel. Phil Schiliro, the head of legislative affairs, spent years working for Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who is an architect of the House bill. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who served for 36 years in the Senate, has been making calls to former colleagues, especially those on the Finance Committee. 
 Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, and Gary Locke, the commerce secretary, have also been working the phones. Their notes are passed on to Mr. Schiliro's shop, which catalogs them for future use. The cabinet secretaries have also been doing interviews with select regional news outlets to shore up wavering Democrats in districts where Republicans are attacking Mr. Obama's plans. 
 And the president has been holding more private meetings, aides say, with Democrats like Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, who said she received an invitation to the Oval Office on a recent Friday, when she had hoped to spend the morning at home. She said she told the president the legislation would have to do more to rein in Medicare spending. ''He was, like, 'I'm all for this,' '' Ms. Cantwell said.
 ''He is leaving no stone unturned,'' said Senator Mary L. Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat and Finance Committee member, who received an unsolicited call from Ms. Sebelius last week. She said they spent 20 minutes going over what she perceived as flaws in the bill. 
 The White House is carefully monitoring what senators say. When Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut independent, said on a Sunday morning talk show that health legislation should be delayed until the economy improves, his chief of staff got a telephone call from a worried-sounding Louisa Terrell, the White House legislative liaison assigned to monitor his office. 
 ''She said, 'Does he want to speak to Sebelius, does he want Peter Orszag?' '' the senator said. He said it was not necessary. But last Friday, while Mr. Lieberman was at home preparing for Rosh Hashana, Mr. Locke, the commerce secretary, called. ''He wanted to lobby me on health care,'' Mr. Lieberman said.
 At least one White House official, Ms. DeParle, has gone so far as to make a house call. When Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, expressed misgivings about how expanding Medicaid would affect California's budget, Ms. DeParle gathered some charts and dropped in on a Saturday. They spent nearly three hours talking over coffee in Ms. Feinstein's den.
 Republicans who have been most outspoken about their opposition to the White House say they have been left out of the outreach effort, and some are irked. ''The strategy seems to be like a shooting gallery at the state fair; if you hit one target, you win the prize,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the Republican conference. 
 By ''one target,'' he meant Ms. Collins's colleague from Maine, Senator Olympia J. Snowe, who serves on the Finance Committee and is considered Mr. Obama's sole hope for a Republican vote there. Ms. Collins, who does not sit on the committee, has made clear that she would not get in Ms. Snowe's way by stating a position before Ms. Snowe does. But that has not stopped the White House from working hard behind the scenes to secure her support.
 Two days after Mr. Obama addressed a joint session of Congress, Mr. Emanuel invited Ms. Collins to meet with him in the West Wing -- and conveniently arranged for the president to drop in. When that failed to produce a commitment, Mr. Emanuel urged Mr. Orszag to step in. Ms. Collins is not surprised by the attention.
 ''This is clearly a high priority for the president, and he is deploying all of his troops to try to persuade people like me who thus far are not happy with any of the bills,'' she said. She came away from the dinner sounding impressed -- ''Peter is very expert,'' she said -- but remained noncommittal. And lest there be any suspicions that her vote can be had for the price of a lamb chop, the senator was emphatic.
 ''We split the bill,'' she said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 4, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the Obama administration's efforts to round up votes for proposed health care legislation erroneously included one senator as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which is currently considering the legislation. While Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, is on the Senate Appropriations Committee, among others, she is not on the Finance Committee.

HEADLINE: Rethinking What to Fear

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
-- Eight years after 9/11, the specter of terrorism still haunts the United States. Just last week, F.B.I. agents were working double time to unravel the alarming case of a Denver airport shuttle driver accused of training with explosives in Pakistan and buying bomb-making chemicals. In Dallas, a young Jordanian was charged with trying to blow up a skyscraper; in Springfield, Ill., a prison parolee was arrested for trying to attack the local federal building. Meanwhile, the Obama administration struggled to decide whether sending many more troops to Afghanistan would be the best way to forestall a future attack.
 But important as they were, those news reports masked a surprising and perhaps heartening long-term trend: Many students of terrorism believe that in important ways, Al Qaeda and its ideology of global jihad are in a pronounced decline -- with its central leadership thrown off balance as operatives are increasingly picked off by missiles and manhunts and, more important, with its tactics discredited in public opinion across the Muslim world. 
 ''Al Qaeda is losing its moral argument about the killing of innocent civilians,'' said Emile A. Nakhleh, who headed the Central Intelligence Agency's strategic analysis program on political Islam until 2006. ''They're finding it harder to recruit. They're finding it harder to raise money.'' 
 Marc Sageman, a former C.I.A. officer and forensic psychiatrist, counted 10 serious plots with Western targets, successful and unsuccessful, that could be linked to Al Qaeda or its allies in 2004, a peak he believes was motivated by the American-led invasion of Iraq the year before. In 2008, he said, there were just three. 
 Dr. Sageman has been in the forefront of those who argue that the centrally led Al Qaeda responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks is giving way to a generation of dispersed, aspiring terrorists linked largely by the Internet -- who still pose a danger, but of a lesser degree. 
 ''I said two years ago it was a diminishing problem, and everything I've seen since then has confirmed it,'' Dr. Sageman said of what counterterrorism specialists call Al Qaeda Central.
 Dr. Sageman is not alone in that assessment. Audrey Kurth Cronin, a professor at the National War College in Washington, cites the arcs of previous violent extremist groups, from the Russian People's Will to the Irish Republican Army, that she studied for her new book, ''How Terrorism Ends.'' 
 ''I think Al Qaeda is in the process of imploding,'' she said. ''This is not necessarily the end. But the trends are in a good direction.''
 Yet the question of how much comfort to take from such an assessment, and whether it should change American counterterrorism policy, remain wide open, as shown by the Afghanistan debate and the charges against the Denver man, Najibullah Zazi.
 Even counterterrorism officials who agree that Al Qaeda is on the wane, for example, say the organization might well regroup if left unmolested in a lawless region in Pakistan, Afghanistan or Somalia. Moreover, they point out that even a lone terrorist with modest skills can produce mass carnage. Six years before 9/11, with no aid from a sophisticated network, Timothy McVeigh used a simple fertilizer bomb in Oklahoma City to kill 168 people. And the 2001 calamity was the work of, at most, a few dozen plotters. 
 Nevertheless, some government officials do take quiet, if wary, satisfaction in two developments that they say underlie the broad belief that Al Qaeda is on a downhill slope. One is the success of military Special Operations units, the C.I.A. and allies in killing prominent terrorists. 
 Three days apart in mid-September, American special forces in Somalia firing from helicopters killed Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, a leader of a Somalian organization, Al Shabab, which is allied with Al Qaeda, and the police in Indonesia killed the most-wanted terrorist in Southeast Asia, Noordin Muhammad Top, in an assault on a house in Java.
 In Pakistan, missile strikes from C.I.A. drone aircraft have taken a steady toll on Al Qaeda and its Taliban allies since the Bush administration accelerated these attacks last year, a policy reinforced by President Obama. A count of such strikes, compiled by the Center for American Progress in Washington, found a handful in 2006 and 2007, rising rapidly to 36 in 2008, and another 36 so far in 2009, nearly all in Pakistan's tribal areas.
 In addition to thinning the ranks of potential plotters, the constant threat of attack from the air makes it far harder for terrorists to move, communicate, and plan, counterterrorism officials say. And while the officials say they worry about a public backlash in response to the civilians killed during the air attacks, those officials also say the strikes may be frightening away potential recruits for terrorism.
 The second trend is older and probably more critical. The celebration in many Muslim countries that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks has given way to broad disillusionment with mass killing and the ideology behind it, according to a number of polls.
 Between 2002 and 2009, the view that suicide bombings are ''often or sometimes justified'' has declined, according to the Pew Global Attitudes Project, from 43 percent to 12 percent in Jordan; from 26 percent to 13 percent in Indonesia; and from 33 percent to 5 percent in Pakistan (excluding some sparsely populated, embattled areas). Positive ratings for Osama bin Laden have fallen by half or more in most of the countries Pew polled.
 Peter Mandaville, a professor of government and Islamic studies at George Mason University, says a series of public recantations'' by prominent Islamist scholars and militants in recent years have had an effect. But the biggest catalyst has been bombings close to home. 
 ''Right after 9/11, people thought, wow, America is not invincible,'' Mr. Mandaville said. ''It was a strike against the U.S., and they were for it.'' But when large numbers of innocent Muslims fell victim to attacks, ''it became more and more difficult to romanticize Al Qaeda as fighting the global hegemons -- basically, 'sticking it to the man.' ''
 Support for bombings plummeted in Jordan, for example, after three bombs hit hotels in Amman in November 2005, including one at a wedding party. In Iraq, the slaughter of civilians by the group that called itself Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia prompted Sunni tribal leaders to make common cause with American forces. In Pakistan, proliferating bombings, including the 2007 attack that killed Benazir Bhutto, soured most people of all social classes on Qaeda-style violence.
 In addition, Al Qaeda, for all its talk of global religious war, offered no practical solutions for local problems: unemployment, poverty, official corruption and poor education. ''People realized bin Laden didn't have anything to offer,'' Dr. Mandaville said.
 Weighing the importance of such statistics is tricky, however. Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University who is often consulted by government agencies, is a dissenter from what he acknowledged has become a majority view among counterterrorism specialists about the decline of Al Qaeda.
 Despite the sinking poll numbers, Mr. Hoffman said, ''Al Qaeda's core demographic is young hotheads aged 16 to 28, and I still don't think it's lost its appeal to that demographic.'' 
 He said many terrorist groups kill their compatriots and become unpopular, but still remain in business. ''Terrorism ends, sure,'' he said. ''But with Al Qaeda it may be 50 years, and we're only eight years away from 9/11.''
 Even those who are convinced Al Qaeda is growing weaker offer a cautious prognosis about what that might mean. They say that what is growing less likely is an attack on American soil with a toll equal to or greater than that of 9/11. But they concede that the example of Al Qaeda will continue to produce copycats: ''Bin Laden has given others a narrative, a grand story of struggle, and he's given them tactics as well,'' Dr. Mandaville said.
 Dr. Sageman said the United States should approach the threat not with hysteria, but with a careful analysis of the motives and patterns of people drawn into violent plotting.
 ''Terrorism,'' he added, ''is here to stay.'' 
 The news last week made that crystal clear, but it also made clear a corresponding reality: counterterrorism, too, is here to stay, and is achieving some successes. Al Qaeda has no entirely safe haven today, and the Afghanistan debate is over how to keep it that way. And if the arrest of Mr. Zazi sent a shudder through many Americans, it's worth remembering that it came before any bombs went off.

HEADLINE: On Several Foreign Policy Fronts, Events Force Obama to Turn to Plan B

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS 

 BODY:
For President Obama, the handshakes and hugs during his first visit to the United Nations last week masked a cold reality: nine months into his presidency, he is being forced to retool his most important foreign policy initiatives, from the war in Afghanistan to peace in the Middle East and his diplomatic overture to Iran.
 Mr. Obama's efforts to reach out to adversaries and break political deadlocks are running up against old enmities, insoluble differences and foreign leaders who simply do not see eye to eye with the president. 
 The administration can point to successes: it has marshaled worldwide support for the campaign to pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. And it has put relations with Russia on a firmer footing, with a decision to revamp a missile-defense system that may have paid extra dividends in helping to win Russian support for tougher sanctions against Tehran. 
 Those bright spots, however, come amid a host of troubling developments, the latest of which was the disclosure by the United States and its allies on Friday that Iran was operating another clandestine nuclear facility.
 That revelation came days after the White House's midcourse correction in its push for peace talks in the Middle East, and the leaked, ominous warnings of Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the American commander in Afghanistan, about the direction of the war there.
 ''This is not easy,'' Mr. Obama said Friday, after an economic summit meeting in Pittsburgh. Speaking of Afghanistan, he said: ''I would expect that the public would ask some very tough questions. That's exactly what I'm doing, is asking some very tough questions. And we're not going to arrive at perfect answers.''
 The debate over Afghanistan policy may be the most intense and far-reaching. But the administration also pivoted in its strategy for the Middle East, after it became clear that Mr. Obama would not succeed in one of his other early goals, persuading Israel to agree to a complete freeze in the construction of Jewish settlements on the West Bank.
 Like all new presidents, Mr. Obama has also learned that many events are outside his control. Afghanistan and Iran held deeply flawed elections that produced leaders -- or in the case of Afghanistan, a likely leader -- with credibility problems and who would make for poor interlocutors for the United States.
 In Israel, a right-wing government took power, dealing a blow to Mr. Obama's hopes of securing a settlement freeze to set the stage for renewed talks between Israelis and Palestinians.
 Officials said Mr. Obama's activist diplomacy has paid off in other ways, like the recent United Nations resolution on nuclear nonproliferation, and with Pakistan, where aggressive prodding by the United States pushed the government to confront the threat of Taliban insurgents near its capital. 
 ''Engagement should be judged as a means to an end, not as a policy goal itself,'' said Denis R. McDonough, a senior foreign policy adviser to Mr. Obama in the National Security Council.
 Yet Mr. Obama's highest-profile effort at engagement, with Iran, is clearly shifting into a new phase focused on pressure as much as dialogue. With the Iranian government showing no signs of responding to Mr. Obama's diplomacy, the United States has begun rallying support for tougher sanctions against Iran, should its leaders refuse to negotiate over their nuclear program at a meeting next Thursday.
 Mr. Obama's disclosure of Iran's uranium enrichment facility, hidden deep inside a mountain, was a calculated move by the United States and its European allies to gain leverage over Tehran, by exposing it as dishonest. It was a far cry from Mr. Obama's warm New Year's greeting to the Iranian people early in his presidency.
 These days, when administration officials talk about engagement, they mainly mean American efforts to engage Russia and China to secure their support for further sanctions. And in that regard, Mr. Obama and his aides said their dual-track strategy has worked well, with the news of Iran's nuclear facility earning a rebuke from Russia and a warning from China.
 ''That kind of solidarity is not typical,'' Mr. Obama said Friday. ''Anybody who has been following responses to Iran would have been doubtful just a few months ago that that kind of rapid response was possible.''
 Still, the positive response that the president most wanted, from Iran's leaders themselves, has yet to materialize. Some administration officials said they always believed the odds were slim that the hard-line clerics who run Iran would clasp Mr. Obama's outstretched hand.
 And those slim prospects seemed to vanish entirely after Iran's chaotic elections in June, when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was re-elected amid evidence of flagrant irregularities that brought demonstrators into the streets and prompted a bloody government crackdown.
 Now, as the United States prepares for its first face-to-face meeting with Iranian officials since Mr. Obama took office, analysts said the administration will have to recalibrate its notion of engagement to take account of the country's simmering antigovernment movement.
 ''The Obama administration doesn't have the luxury of shunning contact with Iran,'' said Karim Sadjadpour, an expert on Iran at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''Yet at the same time they don't want to do anything that could demoralize a popularly driven opposition movement whose success could help change the Middle East.''
 Mr. Obama's conviction that events in the Middle East are linked helps explain his determination to rekindle peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Settling that conflict, administration officials say, would hinder Iran's campaign to project its influence through the region.
 But the White House's approach to restarting talks -- obtaining a settlement freeze from Israel and a series of reciprocal, confidence-building gestures by its Arab neighbors -- bogged down when neither the Arabs nor the Israelis appeared willing to move far enough.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Obama urged the two sides to proceed swiftly to talks over the core issues that divide them, implicitly acknowledging a failure to achieve the reciprocal moves he sought in advance.
 Some analysts criticized the administration for pushing such a demand on the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, saying he was never in a position to accept it. Others say the critical failure was failing to obtain commitments from influential Arab players, chiefly Saudi Arabia.
 ''The leverage we thought we could get by jump-starting the Israeli-Palestinian talks turned out to be a mirage,'' said Martin S. Indyk, the director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.
 Mr. Indyk, a Middle East peace negotiator in the Clinton administration, said the lesson of this bumpy period was to keep trying. ''It's not as though he came in with real possibilities and squandered them,'' Mr. Indyk said of Mr. Obama. ''He found a barren landscape and tried to water it.''

HEADLINE: The Devil Wears Crocs

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD. 
Nicholas D. Kristof is off today.

 BODY:
At the end of many Shakespearean dramas, self-destructive leaders are usually strewn dead on stage.
 With modern presidencies, we have to watch the poignant tableau of such leaders realizing that they have squandered their chance for greatness even as they suffer the indignity of rejection by those who once sought their blessing.
 These painful periods for W. and Bill Clinton, falling low after starting with such grand hopes, are recounted in two new books. 
 The pen-and-tell by Bush speechwriter Matt Latimer, ''Speech-less,'' is being denounced by some former Bushies and Republican commentators as a ''Devil Wears Prada'' betrayal. (Except, in this case, the Devil wears Crocs. Preparing to make a prime-time address explaining why the 2008 economic bailout wasn't socialism -- ''We got to make this understandable for the average cat,'' the president tells his speechwriters -- W. pads around the White House in Crocs, an image that's hard to get out of your head.)
 ''The guy is a worm,'' Bill Bennett told Wolf Blitzer about Latimer, adding: ''He needs to read his Dante. He probably hasn't read 'The Inferno.' The lowest circles of hell are for people who are disloyal in the way this guy is disloyal, and at the very lowest point Satan chews on their bodies.''
 Despite all the devilish critiques, the book is not that hard on W., except to state the obvious: that he was a Decider who made bold but bad decisions. And it's positively dewy-eyed about two of the worst decisions, Dick Cheney and Rummy. (Latimer wrote speeches for Rummy at the Pentagon and is now helping the former defense chief with his memoir.)
 My favorite part is when the White House political office suggests that W. go to Monticello and make a speech pointing out that his legacy matched Thomas Jefferson's. ''Jefferson had founded the University of Virginia,'' Latimer writes, describing the aides' reasoning. ''Well, they said, Bush had gotten the No Child Left Behind Act passed. Jefferson had authored the Declaration of Independence. Well, Bush had launched the Freedom Agenda in Afghanistan and Iraq. Jefferson had authored the Virginia statute for religious freedom. Well, that was just like the president's faith-based initiative.'' Latimer balked, noting that ''if Bush actually went to Monticello to proclaim himself the Thomas Jefferson of our day, there'd be grounds to question his sanity.'' 
 His book ends with the downbeat time when Bush supports McCain simply because ''a McCain defeat would be a repudiation of the Bush administration.'' Both Republicans were uncomfortable. McCain was distancing himself from the unpopular Republican president and W. ''was clearly not impressed with the McCain operation.''
 One day, W. was told that a joint appearance in Phoenix with McCain, designed to show the two men could stand to be on the same stage together, was going to be closed to the press.
 ''If he doesn't want me to go, fine,'' W. snapped. ''I've got better things to do.''
 Then the president was informed that the event was going to be closed because McCain was having trouble drawing a crowd. Latimer writes that an incredulous Bush mordantly asked: ''He can't get five hundred people to show up for an event in his hometown?'' 
 Happy he wasn't the only political wallflower, W. drove home the point: ''I could get that many people to turn out in Crawford. This is a five-spiral crash, boys.'' 
 Like W., Bill Clinton had an awkward final act supporting Gore, even though Gore was distancing himself from Clinton, and Bubba was chafing at the misguided Gore campaign. Like W. with McCain, he felt a Gore defeat would be bad for his legacy.
 In his new book, ''The Clinton Tapes,'' Taylor Branch describes an explosive meeting between Clinton and Gore after the election characterized by Clinton as ''surreal.'' Gore said people around him blamed Clinton's scandalous shadow for the defeat. And Clinton, who told Branch that W. was ''an empty suit, meaner than his dad,'' shot back that if Gore had used him more in the last 10 days in places where he was still popular, he could have swung the election. He chastised Gore for not running on bigger themes and for dropping the issue he was most passionate about: the environment.
 Gore asked Clinton for an explanation of Monica Lewinsky; he wanted an apology. Clinton blew up. Focusing on his mistakes, he told his V.P., demeaned voters and ignored the public's business.
 Branch summed up Clinton's bottom line to Gore: ''By God, Hillary had a helluva lot more reason to resent Clinton than Gore did, and yet she ran unabashedly on the Clinton-Gore record'' for the Senate and won handily. Gore, Clinton said, was in ''Neverland.''
 The wrong turns Clinton and W. took made it harder for Gore and McCain to get elected. But in the final analyses, Clinton and W., both clever pols, were right: Gore and McCain tripped themselves up with awful campaigns.

HEADLINE: No Silk Jammies for Her

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: Generationb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
LAST January, when Victor S. Navasky, chairman of the Columbia Journalism Review, was looking to hire a publisher for his magazine, which serves as an arbiter of journalism ethics, he called Christie Hefner.
 Ms. Hefner was retiring as chief executive of Playboy Enterprises after 20 years. And while it's rare to see Playboy and Columbia Journalism Review in the same sentence, it made sense to Mr. Navasky. He had first met Ms. Hefner in 1979. She was heading up promotions for her father's magazine and recruited Mr. Navasky to serve as a judge -- along with Jules Feiffer and Tom Wicker -- for Playboy's new Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Awards.
 Over the years, he has been impressed with her balancing act at Playboy. ''She's certainly a liberal feminist and a liberal Democrat,'' said Mr. Navasky, former editor of the liberal Nation. ''People would say, 'so what's she doing putting out a magazine and running clubs catering to horny men?' But she found a way to make it work consistent with her values, to serve Playboy and her father and give them an opportunity to do socially useful things.'' 
 Ms. Hefner, 56, and her father, 83, formed a true Boomer/Greatest Generation partnership. While Dad helped usher in the sexual revolution, it fell to her to keep his piece of the revolution afloat. While Hef poses with Playmates a quarter his age, Ms. Hefner is a legendary networker who called Warren E. Buffett when she recapitalized the company. While Dad says, ''Picasso had his pink period and blue period, I'm in my blonde period,'' Ms. Hefner says, ''This is what it looks like from 30,000 feet up,'' and, ''I don't want it to look like we're seeking sizzle and not steak.''
 Hugh Hefner created the most successful men's magazine of all time, but by the 1980s, if his daughter hadn't stepped in, it's clear from Steven Watts's 2008 biography, ''Mr. Playboy,'' the bunny empire might have collapsed.
 A pivotal moment: On Jan. 11, 1982, Mr. Hefner testified before a New Jersey commission considering whether to grant the lucrative Playboy Casino in Atlantic City a permanent license. Accompanied by a Playmate, Hef performed so miserably -- he couldn't remember basic details about his company and later acknowledged he hadn't read the state report on his casino -- that Playboy's application was rejected. The casino had to be sold.
 That's when, at 29, Ms. Hefner asked her father to name her Playboy president. He was relieved, she said. ''Hef said, 'I felt like I had this incredible birthday party and you had to come in and clean up the day after.' '' 
 As a child, she hardly knew him. Her parents divorced when she was 6, and she lived with her mother. She and her brother saw their father a few times a year, at the Playboy mansion. ''He'd send a limo for us,'' she said.
 Perhaps it was the divorce, but Ms. Hefner grew up fast, learning to parent her parents. At 18, when her mother divorced a second time, Ms. Hefner visited her father. ''I said: 'She's never asked you for anything, but you have to help Mom. You have to buy her a place to live.' Dad bought her a town house.''
 After graduating summa cum laude from Brandeis, she planned to go to law school, when her father suggested she first get some work experience at Playboy.
 She stayed 33 years, building a profitable Internet operation and creating a $1 billion brand licensing division that is the company's biggest profit maker. While Hef bragged about not crossing the line into hard porn, she did, buying Spice TV and Club Jenna and defending the move as business.
 Under her direction, Playboy was profitable in good times and has survived in these bad times for print media. As her role grew, he cut back, becoming chief creative officer. ''He once said to me, 'I want you to know I sleep better at night because you're in this position.' At the time I wasn't sleeping because I was worried about all the people whose jobs were threatened if I made the wrong decisions. At least one of us was sleeping.''
 Her father lent his support to causes like birth control and abortion rights, but activism was at her core. She campaigned for the Equal Rights Amendment and gay rights and was chairwoman of a drive that raised $30 million for an AIDS treatment and research clinic in Chicago. Gloria Steinem, who made sport of attacking Hef (''a woman reading Playboy,'' she once said, ''feels a little like a Jew reading a Nazi manual'') brought Ms. Hefner onto the board of Voters for Choice.
 Ms. Hefner lives in Chicago and is heavily involved in politics. She has donated $201,000 to Democrats and liberal causes over the last 30 years, according to federal data collected by the NewsMeat Web site. ''It's not unusual for someone running for Senate in Illinois to come see me,'' she said.
 For 25 years she was on the board of the Magazine Publishers of America, and in 2005 arranged for one networking friend, Barack Obama, to speak at its annual conference.
 She was always prompt for interviews for this column. Arriving at 4:30 for one, she apologized. ''I promised you an hour and a half, but I'm going to have to leave at 5 of 6 -- I have an appointment at the Four Seasons.''
 In 2006, Forbes named Ms. Hefner 80th on its list of the world's 100 most powerful women. By 2008, she earned $1.5 million a year in compensation.
 Last fall, she decided she had been responsible for Playboy long enough. She had guided the company through several downturns and wasn't looking forward to another. ''Retrenching and cutting and not growing -- to say it's not much fun is an understatement.''
 On election night last November, she said, she received a call from Playboy's head of human resources saying they wanted to put together a celebration to observe her 20th year as chief executive. Instead, she flew to the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles to tell Dad it was time for her to go.
 She turned down the publisher's position at Columbia, but is helping Mr. Navasky create a for-profit arm for the Columbia Journalism Review modeled on the Harvard Business Review, which raises money by selling case studies and sponsoring conferences. She is networking with several executives including Cathy Cranston, the business review's former publisher. The two first networked when Ms. Hefner was on the magazine association board and Ms. Cranston was with the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.
 To keep her name before the public, she has been appearing as an unpaid economic talking head on CNN, Fox and CNBC cable programs. Though she received $2 million in severance from Playboy, she says she needs to work. Her Playboy stock, at a high of $36 a share a decade ago, now sells for $3.
 She recently signed a deal with the Canyon Ranch resorts to build a brand-licensing business for health products modeled on her efforts with the Playboy brand. Asked if it would be a full-time job, Hef's daughter said, ''I expect it will take up approximately 40 percent of my time.''

HEADLINE: U.S. WILL DEMAND EARLY INSPECTION OF NEW IRAN SITE

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD; David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and William J. Broad from New York. Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration plans to tell Iran this week that it must open a newly revealed nuclear enrichment site to international inspectors ''within weeks,'' according to senior administration officials. The administration will also tell Tehran that inspectors must have full access to the key personnel who put together the clandestine plant and to the documents surrounding its construction, the officials said Saturday. 
 The demands, following the revelation Friday of the secret facility at a military base near the holy city of Qum, set the stage for the next chapter of a diplomatic drama that has toughened the West's posture and heightened tensions with Iran. The first direct negotiations between the United States and Iran in 30 years are scheduled to open in Geneva on Thursday. 
 American and European officials say they will also press Iran to open what they suspect are nuclear-related sites to international inspectors, and to turn over notebooks and computers that they think may document efforts to design weapons. 
 President Obama has repeatedly said that Iran must show significant cooperation by the end of the year, establishing what officials say is effectively a three-month deadline. Interviews with American and European officials, however, suggest differences of opinion about how much time Iran should be given to show full compliance.
 On Saturday, Iran's nuclear chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, said the International Atomic Energy Agency would be invited to visit the site near Qum that American intelligence agencies estimate was designed to house 3,000 centrifuges, enough to produce about one bomb's worth of material a year. But he did not say when, nor did he say whether Iran would meet any of the other American and European demands. 
 Mr. Salehi, who spoke on Iranian state television, added that Mr. Obama's dramatic release of the information about the site at a global economic summit meeting was a ''plot'' meant to ''unite the whole world against us.''
 Iranian officials have long maintained that their nuclear program is designed to produce energy, not weapons, and they said the facility near Qum is for peaceful purposes. They have not explained why it was located inside a heavily guarded base of the Revolutionary Guards. 
 From the White House to Europe, senior officials were pushing to exploit the disclosure of the covert facility as a turning point in negotiations to try to get Iran to halt its nuclear program. 
 ''This is the most important development in the three and a half years since the U.S. has offered negotiations with Iran,'' said R. Nicholas Burns, a Harvard professor who served as the Bush administration's chief strategist on Iran. Mr. Burns said Mr. Obama ''now has much greater leverage to organize an international coalition to confront'' the country's leaders with sanctions should the negotiating effort fail. 
 David A. Kay, a nuclear specialist who led the fruitless American search for unconventional weapons in Iraq, said the discovery ''reopens the whole question of the military's involvement in the Iranian nuclear program.''
 For now, the most urgent issue, current and former officials agree, is gaining immediate access to the hidden tunnel complex that Iran now acknowledges is a uranium enrichment plant still under construction. Quick access to the facility is considered crucial because of fears that Iran would move incriminating equipment or documents. 
 It is still unclear what kind of incentives the United States and its allies might offer Iran if it completely opened, and ultimately dismantled, its nuclear program. On Saturday, Mr. Obama, in his weekly radio address, said he remained committed to building a relationship with Tehran. 
 ''My offer of a serious, meaningful dialogue to resolve this issue remains open,'' he said. ''But Iran must now cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and take action to demonstrate its peaceful intentions.''
 Now that the clandestine site has been revealed, however, American and European officials say they see an opportunity to press for broader disclosures. Iran will be told that to avoid sanctions, it must adhere to an I.A.E.A. agreement that would allow inspectors to go virtually anywhere in the country to follow suspicions of nuclear work. 
 Iran would also have to turn over documents that the agency has sought for more than three years, including some that intelligence agencies obtained that they say appear to suggest work was done on the design of warheads and technologies for detonating a nuclear core. 
 The negotiators would also insist, officials say, that Iran abide by I.A.E.A. rules, which Iran agreed to and then renounced, requiring it to announce in advance any plans to build nuclear facilities. Iran says it will adhere only to an older rule, requiring notification when a plant is about to become operational. 
 For several years, Iran has deflected I.A.E.A requests to interview key scientists, presumably including those who ran the highly secret Projects 110 and 111. American intelligence officials, after piercing Iran's computer networks in 2007, said they believe that those projects are at the center of nuclear design work. Iran has denied that the projects exist and has denounced as fabrications the documents the United States has shared with the agency, and with other nations. 
 Administration officials acknowledge that it is unlikely that Iran will accede to all of their demands. But they say this is their best chance to move the seven-year standoff over Iran's nuclear program sharply in their favor. 
 In interviews and public comments, the administration's tone has clearly changed in recent days, becoming tougher and more confrontational.
 In an interview to be broadcast Sunday on ABC, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said the hidden facility was ''part of a pattern of deception and lies on the part of the Iranians from the very beginning with respect to their nuclear program.''
 But he deflected a question that has been circulating inside the government: Is the Qum facility one of a kind, or just one of several hidden facilities that were intended to give Iran a covert means of enriching uranium, far from the inspectors who regularly visit a far larger enrichment facility, also once kept secret, at Natanz. 
 ''My personal opinion is that the Iranians have the intention of having nuclear weapons,'' Mr. Gates concluded, though he said it was still an open question ''whether they have made a formal decision'' to manufacture weapons. 
 In recent years, Tehran has slowly and systematically cut back on the access of atomic sleuths. Early in 2006, for instance, it unilaterally began redirecting the international inspectors from dozens of sites, programs and personnel all over the Islamic republic to a single point: Natanz, where Iran is enriching uranium. 
 Pierre Goldschmidt, a former I.A.E.A. official who is now a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the revelation of the secret enrichment plant drove home the urgent need for enhanced legal authority for tough inspections. ''It's proof that, without additional verification authority, the agency cannot find undeclared nuclear activities,'' he said. 
 Beneath the dry language of reports issued every three months by the international agency lies the story of an intense cat-and-mouse game in which inspectors seek documents or interviews with key scientists. 
 The I.A.E.A.'s agenda of inspection is already huge, as is its record of failing to get the Iranians to address the most serious clues and charges, inconsistencies and suspicions.
 The departing chief of the agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, recently argued that the case for urgent action against Iran was ''hyped,'' even as he acknowledged that the country has refused, for two years, to answer his inspectors' questions about evidence suggesting that the country has worked on weapons design.
 In May 2008, the atomic agency in Vienna issued an uncharacteristically blunt demand for more information from Tehran and, even more uncharacteristically, disclosed the existence of 18 secretly obtained documents suggesting Iran's high level of interest in atom bombs.
 But the wording of the public portion of the 2007 United States National Intelligence Estimate had already frozen the effort to force Iran to reveal more. Its conclusion that weapons design work was halted in 2003 was a surprise that ended talk of sanctions. 
 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has called the report an exoneration. 
 In fact, the classified portion of the intelligence estimate listed more than a dozen suspect locations, though officials last week would not say whether the list included the site that was revealed Friday. It is also unclear if Washington and its allies believe they have enough evidence to justify demanding access to those sites.

HEADLINE: Obama at the Precipice

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
THE most intriguing, and possibly most fateful, news of last week could not be found in the health care horse-trading in Congress, or in the international zoo at the United Nations, or in the Iran slapdown in Pittsburgh. It was an item tucked into a blog at ABCNews.com. George Stephanopoulos reported that the new ''must-read book'' for President Obama's war team is ''Lessons in Disaster'' by Gordon M. Goldstein, a foreign-policy scholar who had collaborated with McGeorge Bundy, the Kennedy-Johnson national security adviser, on writing a Robert McNamara-style mea culpa about his role as an architect of the Vietnam War. 
 Bundy left his memoir unfinished at his death in 1996. Goldstein's book, drawn from Bundy's ruminations and deep new research, is full of fresh information on how the best and the brightest led America into the fiasco. ''Lessons in Disaster'' caused only a modest stir when published in November, but The Times Book Review cheered it as ''an extraordinary cautionary tale for all Americans.'' The reviewer was, of all people, the diplomat Richard Holbrooke, whose career began in Vietnam and who would later be charged with the Afghanistan-Pakistan crisis by the new Obama administration. 
 Holbrooke's verdict on ''Lessons in Disaster'' was not only correct but more prescient than even he could have imagined. This book's intimate account of White House decision-making is almost literally being replayed in Washington (with Holbrooke himself as a principal actor) as the new president sets a course for the war in Afghanistan. The time for all Americans to catch up with this extraordinary cautionary tale is now. 
 Analogies between Vietnam and Afghanistan are the rage these days. Some are wrong, inexact or speculative. We don't know whether Afghanistan would be a quagmire, let alone that it could remotely bulk up to the war in Vietnam, which, at its peak, involved 535,000 American troops. But what happened after L.B.J. Americanized the war in 1965 is Vietnam's apocalyptic climax. What's most relevant to our moment is the war's and Goldstein's first chapter, set in 1961. That's where we see the hawkish young President Kennedy wrestling with Vietnam during his first months in office.
 The remarkable parallels to 2009 became clear last week, when the Obama administration's internal conflicts about Afghanistan spilled onto the front page. On Monday The Washington Post published Bob Woodward's account of a confidential assessment by the top United States and NATO commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, warning that there could be ''mission failure'' if more troops aren't added in the next 12 months. In Wednesday's Times White House officials implicitly pushed back against the leak of McChrystal's report by saying that the president is ''exploring alternatives to a major troop increase in Afghanistan.''
 As Goldstein said to me last week, it's ''eerie'' how closely even these political maneuvers track those of a half-century ago, when J.F.K. was weighing whether to send combat troops to Vietnam. Military leaders lobbied for their new mission by planting leaks in the press. Kennedy fired back by authorizing his own leaks, which, like Obama's, indicated his reservations about whether American combat forces could turn a counterinsurgency strategy into a winnable war. 
 Within Kennedy's administration, most supported the Joint Chiefs' repeated call for combat troops, including the secretaries of defense (McNamara) and state (Dean Rusk) and Gen. Maxwell Taylor, the president's special military adviser. The highest-ranking dissenter was George Ball, the undersecretary of state. Mindful of the French folly in Vietnam, he predicted that ''within five years we'll have 300,000 men in the paddies and jungles and never find them again.'' In the current administration's internal Afghanistan debate, Goldstein observes, Joe Biden uncannily echoes Ball's dissenting role. 
 Though Kennedy was outnumbered in his own White House -- and though he had once called Vietnam ''the cornerstone of the free world in Southeast Asia'' -- he ultimately refused to authorize combat troops. He instead limited America's military role to advisory missions. That policy, set in November 1961, would only be reversed, to tragic ends, after his death. As Bundy wrote in a memo that year, the new president had learned the hard way, from the Bay of Pigs disaster in April, that he ''must second-guess even military plans.'' Or, as Goldstein crystallizes the overall lesson of J.F.K.'s lonely call on Vietnam strategy: ''Counselors advise but presidents decide.''
 Obama finds himself at that same lonely decision point now. Though he came to the presidency declaring Afghanistan a ''war of necessity,'' circumstances have since changed. While the Taliban thrives there, Al Qaeda's ground zero is next-door in nuclear-armed Pakistan. Last month's blatantly corrupt, and arguably stolen, Afghanistan election ended any pretense that Hamid Karzai is a credible counter to the Taliban or a legitimate partner for America in a counterinsurgency project of enormous risk and cost. Indeed, Karzai, whose brother is a reputed narcotics trafficker, is a double for Ngo Dinh Diem, the corrupt South Vietnamese president whose brother also presided over a vast, government-sanctioned criminal enterprise in the early 1960s. And unlike Kennedy, whose C.I.A. helped take out the Diem brothers, Obama doesn't have a coup in his toolbox. 
 Goldstein points out there are other indisputable then-and-now analogies as well. Much as Vietnam could not be secured over the centuries by China, France, Japan or the United States, so Afghanistan has been a notorious graveyard for the ambitions of Alexander the Great, the British and the Soviets. ''Some states in world politics are simply not susceptible to intervention by the great powers,'' Goldstein told me. He also notes that the insurgencies in Afghanistan and Vietnam share the same geographical advantage. As the porous border of neighboring North Vietnam provided sanctuary and facilitated support to our enemy then, so Pakistan serves our enemy today. 
 Most worrisome, in Goldstein's view, is the notion that a recycling of America's failed ''clear and hold'' strategy in Vietnam could work in Afghanistan. How can American forces protect the population, let alone help build a functioning nation, in a tribal narco-state consisting of some 40,000 mostly rural villages over an area larger than California and New York combined? 
 Even if we routed the Taliban in another decade or two, after countless casualties and billions of dollars, how would that stop Al Qaeda from coalescing in Somalia or some other criminal host state? How would a Taliban-free Afghanistan stop a jihadist trained in Pakistan's Qaeda camps from mounting a terrorist plot in Denver and Queens? 
 Already hawks are arguing that any deviation from McChrystal's combat-troop requests is tantamount to surrender and ''immediate withdrawal.'' But that all-in or all-out argument, a fixture of the Iraq debate, is just as false a choice here. Obama is not contemplating either surrender to terrorists or withdrawal from Afghanistan. One prime alternative is the counterterrorism plan championed by Biden. As The Times reported, it would scale back American forces in Afghanistan to ''focus more on rooting out Al Qaeda there and in Pakistan.'' 
 Obama's decision, whichever it is, will demand all the wisdom and political courage he can muster. If he adds combat troops, he'll be extending a deteriorating eight-year-long war without a majority of his country or his own party behind him. He'll have to explain why more American lives should be yoked to the Karzai ''government.'' He'll have to be honest in estimating the cost. (The Iraq war, which the Bush administration priced at $50 to $60 billion, is at roughly $1 trillion and counting.) He will have to finally ask recession-battered Americans what his predecessor never did: How much -- and what -- are you willing to sacrifice in blood and treasure for the mission? 
 If Obama instead decides to embrace some variation on the Biden option, he'll have a different challenge. He'll face even more violent attacks than he did this summer. When George Will wrote a recent column titled ''Time to Get Out of Afghanistan,'' he was accused of ''urging retreat and accepting defeat'' (by William Kristol) and of ''waving the bloody shirt'' (by Fred Kagan, an official adviser to McChrystal who, incredibly enough, freelances as a blogger at National Review). The editorial page at Will's home paper, The Washington Post, declared that deviating from McChrystal's demand for more troops ''would both dishonor and endanger this country.'' If a conservative columnist can provoke neocon invective this hysterical, just imagine what will be hurled at Obama.
 But the author of ''Lessons in Disaster'' does not believe that a change in course in Afghanistan would be a disaster for Obama's young presidency. ''His greatest qualities as president,'' Goldstein says, ''are his quality of mind and his quality of judgment -- his dispassionate ability to analyze a situation. If he was able to do that here, he might more than survive a short-term hit from the military and right-wing pundits. He would establish his credibility as a president who will override his advisers when a strategy doesn't make sense.''
 Either way, it's up to the president to decide what he thinks is right for the country's security, the politics be damned. That he has temporarily pressed the pause button to think it through while others, including some of his own generals, try to lock him in is not a sign of indecisiveness but of confidence and strength. It is, perhaps, Obama's most significant down payment yet on being, in the most patriotic sense, Kennedyesque.

HEADLINE: Opting In Vs. Opting Out

BYLINE: By RICHARD H. THALER. 
Richard H. Thaler is a professor of economics and behavioral science at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago.

 BODY:
WHEN Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, appeared in public recently for the first time in months, he revealed that he had received a liver transplant from the victim of a car crash. ''I wouldn't be here without such generosity,'' Mr. Jobs said, adding that he hoped that many people would become organ donors. 
 With the help of a little behavioral economics, it is possible to make that hope a reality. 
 More than 20,000 organ transplants take place every year in the United States, with a vast majority coming from deceased donors. Demand greatly exceeds supply: in 2006, for example, 3,916 patients died while waiting for kidneys, according to the National Kidney Foundation.
 Some economists have come up with a simple solution: a market allowing the buying and selling of organs. Because people have two kidneys and need only one to live, a robust market could greatly increase supply. 
 The idea may have some merit, but it is spectacularly unpopular. As the Harvard economist Alvin Roth has noted, many people consider it ''repugnant,'' mainly for two reasons. First, they object to the possibility of rich people buying their way to the front of the line. (The hospital where Mr. Jobs's procedure took place said he received the liver transplant because he was the sickest person on its waiting list who matched the donor's blood type.) Second, they object to incentives that would induce the poor to sell their kidneys. 
 These objections can lead to some logical quandaries. Why, for example, is it O.K. for a parent to donate a kidney to save a child's life but not for her to sell her kidney, thereby also saving a life? And why is it acceptable to risk your life for money, say, by becoming a coal miner, but not by selling a kidney? 
 Still, whether you think a legal market for organs is a brilliant or a dreadful idea, it's a political nonstarter, so it is important to obtain donors from another possible source: patients who have been declared ''brain dead'' but are being kept alive temporarily. 
 Nationwide, roughly 12,000 to 15,000 people fall into this category each year, but only half end up as donors. Because each such donor could supply an average of three organs, having another thousand donors could save 3,000 lives. We need more people to agree to be donors in advance. 
 One strategy is to alter the default rules for signup. Most states, as well as many other countries, use an ''opt in'' or ''explicit consent'' rule, meaning that people must take a concrete action, like going to a public library or requesting and mailing in a form, to declare they want to be donors. But many who are willing to donate organs never get around to such steps.
 An alternative approach, used in several European countries, is an ''opt out'' rule, often called ''presumed consent,'' in which citizens are presumed to be consenting donors unless they act to register their unwillingness.
 In the world of traditional economics, it shouldn't matter whether you use an opt-in or opt-out system. So long as the costs of registering as a donor or a nondonor are low, the results should be similar. But many findings of behavioral economics show that tiny disparities in such rules can make a big difference.
 By comparing the consent rates in European countries, the psychologists Eric Johnson and Dan Goldstein have shown that the choice of opting in or opting out is a major factor. 
 Consider the difference in consent rates between two similar countries, Austria and Germany. In Germany, which uses an opt-in system, only 12 percent give their consent; in Austria, which uses opt-out, nearly everyone (99 percent) does. 
 Although presumed consent is generally accepted in countries that have adopted it, the idea can bring strong opposition. Many people object to anyone presuming anything about their organs, even if the costs of opting out are low. In Britain, a proposal by the Labour government to adopt an opt-out system was opposed by Muslims who objected to organ removal on religious grounds. 
 Fortunately, there is another possibility, called ''mandated choice,'' under which people must indicate their preference. In Illinois, where I live, this system has been in use since 2006 and doesn't seem to have ruffled many feathers.
 Here is how it works: When you go to renew your driver's license and update your photograph, you are required to answer this question: ''Do you wish to be an organ donor?'' The state now has a 60 percent donor signup rate, according to Donate Life Illinois, a coalition of agencies. That is much higher than the national rate of 38 percent reported by Donate Life America
 The Illinois system has another advantage. There can be legal conflicts over whether registering intent is enough to qualify you as an organ donor or whether a doctor must still ask your family's permission. In France, for example, although there is technically a presumed-consent law, in practice doctors still seek relatives' approval. In Illinois, the First-Person Consent Law, which created this system, makes one's wishes to be a donor legally binding. Thus, mandated choice may achieve a higher rate of donations than presumed consent, and avoid upsetting those who object to presumed consent for whatever reasons. This is a winning combination.
 THE key, however, is to make signup easy, and requiring people to make a choice is just one way to accomplish it. The private sector could help create other simple methods. Here is a challenge to Mr. Jobs: Why not create a Web site -- and a free app for the iPhone -- that lets people sign up as organ donors in their home states? 
 At the same time, he'd need to work with the states to create the technology for a secure, simple signup procedure. Social networking sites like Facebook could also help, by encouraging signup campaigns. 
 Many Americans say they want to be organ donors, but they just don't get around to acting on their intentions. Helping these potential good Samaritans overcome their inertia could prolong thousands of lives a year. Signing up to be an organ donor should be at least as easy as downloading a song to your iPhone.

Dear Diary:
 On the F train to Brooklyn, a young mother with her children was not sure whether they had to get out at the next station. 
 Consulting the subway map, she asked, ''Where are we?'' Her little daughter shouted, ''On eBay.''
 Passengers smirked at the girl's mention of the online auctioneer. Turns out she was right, though: The train was just rolling out of the East Broadway station -- or E-B'way, as the signs on the pillars say. Roman Elsener 
 Dear Diary:
 I was sitting on a bench in the East Village on a warm and sweaty New York evening. I always enjoyed watching the flow of people heading home or into bars trying to make it on time for happy hour.
 Suddenly, I noticed an older lady approaching my bench. There was nothing about her that could catch my attention. That is, nothing but the long black coat she was wearing, which was inappropriate for the season. To my surprise she sat down next to me. 
 A few seconds went by before I opened a friendly conversation: ''A little bit warm tonight for a coat isn't it?''
 ''Well,'' she began, ''it was my husband's coat.'' 
 I didn't say anything. She continued: ''He used to wear it all the time. Deep into June, even.''
 I let a few seconds of silence spread between us before I spoke again. I regretted my poor choice of subject, but what could I do now? ''I am sorry for your loss,'' I said.
 ''What loss?'' She raised her voice a little. ''He got a new one on sale last week on Orchard Street.''
 She got up and walked north up the avenue. ''It was quite a bargain too,'' she added, while fading into the night. It felt even warmer. Amitai Mor
 Dear Diary:
 While driving south on the Harlem River Drive the other day, my wife, Hilary, and I noticed one of those portable illuminated signs that the Transportation Department often places along the side of the road to convey information to drivers.
 This one delivered its message in three installments:

 Dear Diary:
 On July 3, as I was leaving the Metropolitan Museum of Art's European galleries after viewing the small exhibition on ''The Torment of Saint Anthony,'' believed to be Michelangelo's first painting, a woman of about 40 said to her male companion (or perhaps to no one in particular): ''Thirteen years old when he did that. Thirteen. I don't know why I get up in the morning.'' Alan Blum, M.D.
 Dear Diary:
 On the westbound 86th Street crosstown bus:
 At First Avenue, an elderly woman with a walker boarded and sat next to me. She had trouble folding the walker, and I tried to help her. 
 ''Thank you very much,'' she said, ''but I can handle my most valuable possession. I am 94 years old, and with my walker I can get around and do anything I enjoy.''
 We chatted some more, and before reaching Madison Avenue she got ready to disembark. Before leaving, she said, ''Guess where I'm going?''
 Making a faux pas, I blurted out, ''To a doctor.''
 ''Oh, no,'' she said. ''I am going to Yonkers Raceway to play the slots!'' George Stein

HEADLINE: At an Industry Event, a Sense That the Gloom Is Lifting

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT and STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
HERE is a look back at some of the highlights, lowlights and sidelights of the sixth annual Advertising Week, which took place from Monday through Friday in New York.
 WEEK, NOT WEAK Despite the severity of the recession, and the gloom that has pervaded Madison Avenue, Advertising Week seemed like a throwback to a more upbeat, robust time.
 Events were crowded. There were lines to get into many sessions. And the Mixx Conference and Expo, held during the week by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, had about 2,400 attendees, said Randall Rothenberg, president and chief executive at the bureau, an increase of about 150 from the 2008 Advertising Week.
 ''One of my board members said, 'It's bad,' '' Mr. Rothenberg said, referring to the economy, '' 'but it's up from horrible.' '' 
 ''People started feeling an uptick in business a couple weeks ago,'' he added, and that was reflected in how the week unfolded.
 Andreas Combuechen, chairman, chief executive and chief creative officer at Atmosphere Proximity, said it seemed as if attendees had decided after hunkering down for the last year that ''it's time to shake it off.'' Atmosphere Proximity is part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.
 HOW MANY'S A CROWD? A program on social responsibility on Wednesday, at the Paley Center for Media, was packed and prolonged. A symposium on climate change ran almost 30 minutes beyond its end time.
 By the panel that followed, ''Social Media, Social Change,'' attendees were sitting on the stairs, on the floor in front of the first row and even on the stage. That earned Matt Scheckner, executive director of Advertising Week, a stern talking-to from Paley Center representatives, who thought a fire marshal would not quite approve. Mr. Scheckner agreed, and turned away some people who had arrived late. 
 ''We've just outgrown this place,'' Mr. Scheckner sighed.
 The panel that came next, on corporate support for Feeding America, ran so late that a panelist -- Martine Reardon, executive vice president for marketing at Macy's -- had to leave halfway through to make a flight to Los Angeles.
 Nathan Shore, Macy's director for cause marketing, who was sitting in the front row, signaled the producers to wire him with a microphone and nimbly replaced Ms. Reardon on the panel. 
 TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS(WEEK) Many media companies took advantage of the Advertising Week crowds to pitch themselves to agencies and marketers, particularly Web-based brands like AOL, Google and Yahoo. One traditional name with a big presence was BusinessWeek magazine, which sought to drum up interest with a campaign carrying the theme ''BusinessWeek moves brands forward.''
 The magazine's presence included ads on floors and stairways as well as messages on Adwalker portable digital screens. The effort raised eyebrows because BusinessWeek has been put up for sale by its owner, McGraw-Hill.
 Why proceed with a campaign that may be changed or discontinued by a new owner? One reason is that a new owner would, presumably, keep publishing the magazine, and could reap whatever benefits the campaign may yield.
 Another reason, an employee of BusinessWeek said, is that the campaign was in the works for a while and ''those checks were cashed a long time ago.'' The employee spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the magazine's potential sale. BusinessWeek also plans to market itself at the annual conference of the Association of National Advertisers, the employee said, to be held in Phoenix in November.
 'MAD MEN' MEETS '30 ROCK' The organizers of Advertising Week typically sell sponsorships for the opening breakfasts. The sponsor this time was a unit of NBC Universal, part of General Electric, called Women at NBCU, which took the opportunity to bombard attendees with the most cheerfully forward sales spiel since the last time ''Today'' promoted a new NBC series.
 A vacant floor in a building in Rockefeller Center was set up like a county fair, filled with booths, displays and exhibits peddling Women at NBCU properties like ''The Biggest Loser'' on NBC and ivillage.com. For example, a wall banner read, ''Oxygen gets more working women who amplify your brand message.''
 After a presentation that included a video about ''the world-class brands at NBC Universal,'' a host of the breakfast, Bethenny Frankel of ''The Real Housewives of New York City'' on Bravo, narrated a tour of the displays. But it was hard to hear her over the increasingly loud chatter of attendees who preferred schmoozing to being pitched.
 THIS ICON'S FOR YOU One of the few events during Advertising Week aimed at the public, rather than professionals in advertising, marketing and media, is the annual selection of inductees to the Madison Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame. This year, to capitalize on that interest, the announcement took place in the crossroads of consumerdom, Times Square.
 The AOL running man and the Budweiser Clydesdales won in the category of brand characters, or icons as they are known for the voting, which took place on a section of the Advertising Week Web site (advertisingweek.com/wof). They bested 24 other nominees, including Smokey Bear and the Vlasic stork.
 The runner, the subject of an intense get-out-the-vote drive by AOL, and the Clydesdales join icons chosen since 2004 that include Mr. Peanut and Tony the Tiger.
 In the slogan category, the winners were ''Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there,'' for State Farm insurance, and ''Virginia is for lovers,'' for Virginia tourism. They topped 24 other nominees that included ''Just do it,'' for Nike.
 The winning slogans join others in the hall of fame that include ''We deliver for you,'' for the Postal Service, and ''Where's the beef?,'' for Wendy's.
 Scores of passers-by in Times Square stopped to take photographs of the brand characters, including a party-crasher whose name, according to the AgencySpy blog, was Moisty the Snowcone. Moisty, who vanished before he (or she) could be questioned, was dressed like a snowman except for a traffic cone in place of the top hat.
 A JOB IS JOB ONE In an event that crossed ''The Apprentice'' with ''American Idol,'' four fledgling mad men -- and women -- landed monthlong internships with leading agencies by winning a contest called the Big Ad Gig.
 The four were among eight finalists who presented to a panel of judges ideas for a campaign for the American Heart Association, promoting hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Abraham Truzman, 30, a copywriter, won an internship with Crispin Porter & Bogusky, part of MDC Partners, and his campaign will be produced by the heart association and the Advertising Council in media donated by Microsoft.
 The other winners were: Matt Koulermos, 23, who will intern at Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of WPP: Anna Lippert, 31, Atmosphere Proximity; and Jaime Walker, 28, Saatchi & Saatchi Wellness, part of the Saatchi & Saatchi unit of the Publicis Groupe. 
 ''Creating opportunities for talented young people is one of the best things about this industry,'' said Chuck Porter, co-chairman at Crispin Porter and chairman of Advertising Week, who watched the contest. ''This is a really cool way to highlight that.''

HEADLINE: Cassandras Of Climate

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Every once in a while I feel despair over the fate of the planet. If you've been following climate science, you know what I mean: the sense that we're hurtling toward catastrophe but nobody wants to hear about it or do anything to avert it.
 And here's the thing: I'm not engaging in hyperbole. These days, dire warnings aren't the delusional raving of cranks. They're what come out of the most widely respected climate models, devised by the leading researchers. The prognosis for the planet has gotten much, much worse in just the last few years. 
 What's driving this new pessimism? Partly it's the fact that some predicted changes, like a decline in Arctic Sea ice, are happening much faster than expected. Partly it's growing evidence that feedback loops amplifying the effects of man-made greenhouse gas emissions are stronger than previously realized. For example, it has long been understood that global warming will cause the tundra to thaw, releasing carbon dioxide, which will cause even more warming, but new research shows far more carbon dioxide locked in the permafrost than previously thought, which means a much bigger feedback effect. 
 The result of all this is that climate scientists have, en masse, become Cassandras -- gifted with the ability to prophesy future disasters, but cursed with the inability to get anyone to believe them.
 And we're not just talking about disasters in the distant future, either. The really big rise in global temperature probably won't take place until the second half of this century, but there will be plenty of damage long before then. 
 For example, one 2007 paper in the journal Science is titled ''Model Projections of an Imminent Transition to a More Arid Climate in Southwestern North America'' -- yes, ''imminent'' -- and reports ''a broad consensus among climate models'' that a permanent drought, bringing Dust Bowl-type conditions, ''will become the new climatology of the American Southwest within a time frame of years to decades.''
 So if you live in, say, Los Angeles, and liked those pictures of red skies and choking dust in Sydney, Australia, last week, no need to travel. They'll be coming your way in the not-too-distant future. 
 Now, at this point I have to make the obligatory disclaimer that no individual weather event can be attributed to global warming. The point, however, is that climate change will make events like that Australian dust storm much more common. 
 In a rational world, then, the looming climate disaster would be our dominant political and policy concern. But it manifestly isn't. Why not?
 Part of the answer is that it's hard to keep peoples' attention focused. Weather fluctuates -- New Yorkers may recall the heat wave that pushed the thermometer above 90 in April -- and even at a global level, this is enough to cause substantial year-to-year wobbles in average temperature. As a result, any year with record heat is normally followed by a number of cooler years: According to Britain's Met Office, 1998 was the hottest year so far, although NASA -- which arguably has better data -- says it was 2005. And it's all too easy to reach the false conclusion that the danger is past. 
 But the larger reason we're ignoring climate change is that Al Gore was right: This truth is just too inconvenient. Responding to climate change with the vigor that the threat deserves would not, contrary to legend, be devastating for the economy as a whole. But it would shuffle the economic deck, hurting some powerful vested interests even as it created new economic opportunities. And the industries of the past have armies of lobbyists in place right now; the industries of the future don't.
 Nor is it just a matter of vested interests. It's also a matter of vested ideas. For three decades the dominant political ideology in America has extolled private enterprise and denigrated government, but climate change is a problem that can only be addressed through government action. And rather than concede the limits of their philosophy, many on the right have chosen to deny that the problem exists.
 So here we are, with the greatest challenge facing mankind on the back burner, at best, as a policy issue. I'm not, by the way, saying that the Obama administration was wrong to push health care first. It was necessary to show voters a tangible achievement before next November. But climate change legislation had better be next.
 And as I pointed out in my last column, we can afford to do this. Even as climate modelers have been reaching consensus on the view that the threat is worse than we realized, economic modelers have been reaching consensus on the view that the costs of emission control are lower than many feared. 
 So the time for action is now. O.K., strictly speaking it's long past. But better late than never.

HEADLINE: Small Business Owners Are Coping, And Feeling Grateful for the Bright Spots

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
A restaurant owner, squeezed by a slump in sales and growing debt to his landlord, discontinues his health insurance. A contractor decides not to replace a member of his small crew who quit. An industrial bicycle maker starts selling to universities, prisons and zoos. For a quintet of small businesses that The New York Times has been tracking for the past year, the persistent recession has hurt some more than others. As fall began, some cautious optimism about a recovery crept into recent interviews conducted by Patrick McGeehan, Erik Olsen and Gabriel Johnson.
 Georgette Blau
 Georgette Blau, 35, is president of On Location Tours, a Manhattan-based company that offers entertainment-themed tours of New York locations from movies like ''Sex and the City'' and television shows like ''Gossip Girl'' for about $40. Tourism from Europe rebounded more quickly than many tour operators had expected, providing a pleasant surprise, Ms. Blau said. Customers have started tipping again but they still are not paying up for premium-priced limousine tours, she said. She said she has decided to raise prices by about 5 percent next year. 
 I am definitely less worried. I was kind of nervous, especially around January, and thinking, oh my God, we're going back to 2005. We always hold our breath in January and February in tourism. I was so on edge I didn't know what to expect. We're still a little bit on edge. I've heard the numbers are down 5 percent overall in New York. We're 20 percent above 2007 and about 15 percent below 2008.
 We're seeing not only more Italians and French, but, specifically, younger Italians and French who are noticing how much cheaper New York is. This summer, we got tons and tons of people just post-college who were staying in hostels. So many of them are saying that they are staying in hostels or hotels that are becoming more affordable. The hotels literally went from $400 a night to $150.
 The streets were flooded with tourists. Whenever we ask people in the international crowd, they don't really know what the recession is. So we say, ''We're not going to tell you, just keep spending.''
 One thing that definitely happened over the winter and spring was our tour guides were not getting tipped. We get the sense that people don't bring any extra money with them. If the tour guides are lucky, they'll get a dollar from a lot of the students.
 I keep hearing of people losing their jobs, so I'm just hopeful. I'm still being cautious. I really don't feel like we need to hire anybody more. But I happen to be hiring a salesperson to replace someone who is leaving. We've had a flood of resumes. Last time, we had a trickle of resumes. This time, not only have I gotten 45 to 50, but literally two weeks after I posted the job I'm still getting resumes.
 Wayne Sosin
 Wayne Sosin, 55, the president of Worksman Cycles in Ozone Park, Queens, has had to come up with alternative uses for the industrial tricycles and heavy-duty bicycles his company has traditionally sold to auto plants and other big factories and warehouses. New sales to universities, zoos and prisons have helped. Worksman has called back some laid-off workers and increased hours for others.
 The economy is still suffering obviously, and a lot of our customers in the automotive field are going to take a while to bounce back. But we've found some new markets for old products and it seems to be turning in the right direction for us. So it's been pretty exciting the last couple of months.
 We're always busiest in the spring. This year we got off to a slow start. The economy definitely had a lot of people watching their pennies and holding back on orders. Unfortunately, on the East Coast the weather was awful for the bicycle industry in May and June. There was so much rain and dreariness, it definitely put a hurting on the market for recreational bikes and trikes in the whole Northeast. But as the months have passed, there's been some uptick in our business activity.
 For us the challenge was that we saw that our core customers -- the G.M.'s, Fords and Chryslers -- were certainly not going to be able to support us with their normal level of business, as they were shuttering factories, laying off employees. So we really had to come up with an alternate strategy of finding other markets. 
 We looked around and said, well, what kind of environment would be appropriate for using industrial-grade tricycles or heavy-duty bicycles? One of the ones we found was the federal prison systems. We've established about 20 federal prisons or so that are now using tricycles in a trial basis to replace some of the motor vehicles that they were using, both for the prison population and for their own staffs. So that's one of the exciting markets. University bike-share programs is another one. Princeton University has selected Worksman Cycles for the bikes that they're going to use for their student bike-share program. They'll have 100 bicycles available for their students to ride. 
 We've actually brought back a few of the employees that we had to furlough for a while. That was wonderful to be able to do. We're actually in the process now actively of looking for some sheet-metal mechanics. So we should be adding some staff pretty soon. We're up a little bit in employment from where we were and the number of hours that people are working. We're almost back to working the regular 40-hour weeks, in fact working some overtime, which is encouraging. So it's going in the right direction.
 Mouhamad Shami
 Mouhamad Shami, 54, the owner of Alfanoose, a Middle Eastern restaurant on Maiden Lane in the financial district, says he owes his landlord almost $25,000 for property taxes and was forced to cancel his health insurance just after having an operation. With fewer orders coming from big banks, he is trying to hold on until his son finishes college next year and joins him full time.
 Between my overhead and the drop in the business I couldn't continue with my health insurance coverage. I dropped it at the beginning of this year. 
 I fell here. They were mopping the floor. I didn't go to the doctor for X-rays or anything. I just went to an acupuncturist on Nassau Street and he said nothing is broken. So I was in pain for about six to eight weeks.
 I work from, like, 10 o'clock in the morning till 10:30 at night. I haven't been able to take any time off except for the last year, when I did a hernia operation. But I took only one week off. For the past six years now, I haven't taken vacation.
 I just hired one guy. I'm getting tired, to tell you the truth. I was pulling the work for more than two people, three people as a matter of fact. Now I start to feel it. You know I'm not a kid anymore. Sometimes, believe it or not, I feel like the weight of my upper body cannot carry my legs anymore. I'm hoping again, you know, that things they will get better. If they don't, I'm just going to let him go.
 I'm hoping that things they will go back to normal. If the rest of the companies they start making profits like Goldman Sachs and like Chase Manhattan bank, the area, it will survive and it will revive itself. So that's what we're hoping for.
 If I can't keep up, then I'm going to look for a smaller place. Then I'll take a loan to set up because I'll be confident. With the amount of business that I'm making right now, I'll be able to survive in a less-overhead, smaller place. This place, it means so much to me. I built it up from scratch. I keep trying to convince myself that I'll be able to save it, I'll be able to save it. So I'm going to give it one more chance till the end of this year.
 Ruben Villasante
 Ruben Villasante, 47, owns a small contracting firm, V & V Construction, that specializes in painting and home renovations in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. Most of his customers are calling him for repairs and repainting, not kitchen replacements or other renovation projects. One member of his four-man crew quit this summer, but Mr. Villasante said that he would wait for business to pick up before replacing him.
 Business is like it was six months ago. It didn't keep falling and it didn't pick up either. People are struggling. There's no money outside. There's no loans. Houses are not selling. Therefore, basically what we're doing are repairs, not renovations. We're redoing a porch and have another porch coming up. We're painting here and there. 
 Before, I used to have lined up for the next year already two or three months of work, but that's not happening this year. There's a lot of talking about doing something but there's nothing on paper already set. It's not ''put me down for March,'' ''put me down in April.'' What is happening is, ''I'll call you in the spring,'' ''I'm going to give you a call when the weather gets better.''
 Money's not the issue. The issue's competition. It used to be there was a lot of work to do and people didn't have to ask prices. Now, people have two or three bids on a job. If I get a new customer, I know I'm not going to be the only one bidding on it. 
 It looks a lot better here than in Florida. I was in Florida four weeks ago and everything is so quiet. I was in one of those big malls at 10 a.m. and they had all the salespeople and all the lights on and just two customers. I was thinking, how do they stay in business?
 Now I have three men. One just left. I didn't have to rehire. It's too close to the winter. Winter comes and there's not much we can do outside. We're going to handle what we have until December and then regroup in March.
 Michael Menna
 Michael Menna, 46, owns Menna's Quality Meats and Salumeria, his family's 50-year-old meat market in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx. The cool, wet start to the summer cut into sales of meat for the barbecue, Mr. Menna said. On the flip side, the store's power bills were low, allowing Mr. Menna to pay down a debt to Con Edison that built up as the recession dragged on. He closed for a week in August to go on a family vacation.
 Business is not back to where it's supposed to be, but we're seeing light at the end of the tunnel. We lost all of June and half of July to the weather but we saved on Con Ed. So that helped. I didn't put the air on until August, so that was a big savings.
 People are still being somewhat frugal, but they're starting to buy again. Hopefully after the summer, we'll get back on a regular schedule. August was a little quiet, as it's expected to be because of people going on vacation. Right after Labor Day, you get a nice shot in the arm. Hopefully, we'll have a nice consistent fall right into the busy holiday season. 
 It's been a while since it was hopping. But you see signs of it coming back.
 We're just staying on kind of a skeleton crew, keeping the hours to a minimum. Everybody's been pitching in. A lot of people are taking on more jobs in the store, including myself. Sometimes people complain that they're doing too many jobs. Sometimes we need to have a meeting about that and remind everybody where we're at and that everybody needs to help each other out. 
 I've just tried to get a little more aggressive with advertising. Trying to get some more bargains out for the customers so they come into the store. This was a family business that my dad and my uncles, like 40 years ago, started. Things were so much different then. Everybody shopped at the local butcher. It's not like that any more. 
 We've been around a long time. We're a little bit of a landmark here. So we're going to try to keep it a landmark.

Canadian Banks
 Missed a Chance
 It might sound churlish to say, but Canada's bankers may have been too buttoned-down for their own good. A combination of regulatory restraint and conservative management allowed the nation's financial institutions to avoid the large-scale crisis that took place in the United States and elsewhere. Yet these traits may have also caused them to miss out on subsequent opportunities to expand their businesses abroad. 
 None of the major banks in Canada failed in this financial crisis. In fact, they found themselves in stronger shape. The total market capitalization of the big five Canadian banks -- Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto Dominion, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal and CIBC -- has risen 8 percent since the start of 2007. By comparison, the five biggest American commercial banks lost almost 40 percent, vaporizing more than $350 billion of market value. 
 There are many reasons that American banks got into trouble while the Canadians didn't. Among them: 50 percent greater leverage among American banks, which amplified losses; less prudent underwriting and credit standards; a regulatory patchwork that allowed banks to play one set of watchdogs off against another; American government officials' belief that the private sector needed less oversight; and a larger reliance on short-term borrowing. 
 These factors all played a role and fed upon each other. For example, Canadian regulations encourage banks to keep more loans on their books. While half of all United States mortgage loans were sold at the peak of the securitization bubble, the figure for Canada was about 25 percent. Since the banks had to eat more of their own cooking, so to speak, there was more incentive to make sure borrowers could repay. 
 The Canadians also had a bit of luck. They weren't forced to step in and provide liquidity to their off-balance-sheet vehicles at the height of the crisis because, unlike in the United States, the standard legal arrangements didn't require that. More important, the American cultural mood latched onto the idea of buying houses and flipping them for hefty profits to a much greater extent. Canadians were more circumspect, limiting the housing bubble north of the border.
 But the relatively strong performance of Canadian banks after the financial panic presents a question as to why they have not been more aggressive in exploiting American rivals' weaknesses. After all, Canada's domestic market is already sewn up. Big mergers at home are over: the government shot down two attempted megadeals in the mid-1990s. With American rivals nursing hangovers, it would seem a perfect time to swoop south and buy troubled franchises or try and expand market share. 
 There has been some looking and nibbling. Bank of Nova Scotia appeared interested in the assets of a failed Ohio bank, National City, which eventually went to PNC, based in Pittsburgh. And Toronto Dominion raised its stake in the broker Ameritrade. But the conservative nature of Canadian bankers -- the product of tighter regulation and a relatively cautious banking culture -- has largely won out. 
 By contrast, the American ''winners'' of the crisis were far more active. JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo either bought troubled rivals or expanded market share in commercial banking, investment banking and wealth management. Ditto for some overseas rivals: Barclays, in London, bought Lehman Brothers' American operations after they failed. BBVA in Spain snapped up the remnants of a Texas-based bank, Guaranty Financial, from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 If the big five Canadian banks missed some opportunities, their conservative management and vigilant regulation has its consolations, as the relatively strong performance of the group's shares illustrates. Big acquisitions during unsettled times are dangerous, as Bank of America has discovered. It nearly foundered after snapping up the troubled lender Countrywide and Merrill Lynch. 
 Moreover, time hasn't yet been called on the crisis. The worst may or may not be over, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation says more banks will fail. Many are saddled with large books of commercial real estate that are slowly turning sour. Indeed, the head of Royal Bank of Canada, Gordon Nixon, recently said that opportunities for acquisitions outside Canada will increase, not decrease, over the next year. If that's right, the prices may not be as appealing as they were at the height of the crisis. But paying more may be a fair trade-off for more surety. Canadian banks may have missed out on a bargain, but that isn't as dangerous a sin for a bank as overexpansion. ROBERT CYRAN

HEADLINE: High Cost of Death Row

 BODY:
To the many excellent reasons to abolish the death penalty -- it's immoral, does not deter murder and affects minorities disproportionately -- we can add one more. It's an economic drain on governments with already badly depleted budgets. 
 It is far from a national trend, but some legislators have begun to have second thoughts about the high cost of death row. Others would do well to consider evidence gathered by the Death Penalty Information Center, a research organization that opposes capital punishment.
 States waste millions of dollars on winning death penalty verdicts, which require an expensive second trial, new witnesses and long jury selections. Death rows require extra security and maintenance costs.
 There is also a 15-to-20-year appeals process, but simply getting rid of it would be undemocratic and would increase the number of innocent people put to death. Besides, the majority of costs are in the pretrial and trial.
 According to the organization, keeping inmates on death row in Florida costs taxpayers $51 million a year more than holding them for life without parole. North Carolina has put 43 people to death since 1976 at $2.16 million per execution. The eventual cost to taxpayers in Maryland for pursuing capital cases between 1978 and 1999 is estimated to be $186 million for five executions.
 Perhaps the most extreme example is California, whose death row costs taxpayers $114 million a year beyond the cost of imprisoning convicts for life. The state has executed 13 people since 1976 for a total of about $250 million per execution. This is a state whose prisons are filled to bursting (unconstitutionally so, the courts say) and whose government has imposed doomsday-level cuts to social services, health care, schools and parks.
 Money spent on death rows could be spent on police officers, courts, public defenders, legal service agencies and prison cells. Some lawmakers, heeding law-enforcement officials who have declared capital punishment a low priority, have introduced bills to abolish it. 
 A Republican state senator in Kansas, Carolyn McGinn, pointed out that her state, which restored the death penalty in 1994, had not executed anybody in more than 40 years. In February, she introduced a bill to replace capital punishment with life without parole. The bill gained considerable attention but stalled. Similar arguments were made, unsuccessfully, in states such as New Hampshire and Maryland. Colorado considered a bill to end capital punishment and spend the money saved on solving cold cases. But this year, only New Mexico went all the way, abolishing executions in March.
 If lawmakers cannot find the moral courage to abolish the death penalty, perhaps the economic case will persuade them to follow the lead of New Mexico.

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Stability Cushions
 Life in Woodside
 Change comes slowly to Woodside and Sunnyside, Queens, even in a recession.
 These decidedly middle-class neighborhoods -- with Woodside's Irish character lately showing South Asian and Latin American influences -- have retained a relative degree of stability, judging by economic indicators tracked by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy. 
 The areas have low rates of subprime lending (11 percent at the height of boom in 2006, compared with 23 percent citywide) and few foreclosures. And one of the early signs of homeowner distress, tax delinquency, is virtually nonexistent.
 With tidy rows of one-, two- and three-family brick homes, the residential streets feel far from the No. 7 train that rumbles nearby. Nearly 50 percent of the residential units are within a retail corridor, the highest percentage of any community district in Queens. 
 On one stretch of Roosevelt Avenue, an Ecuadorean disco stands next to a Colombian travel agency and a Mexican taqueria. Stalwarts include Donovan's Pub and the ubiquitous laundries, most with fading signs evincing little turnover. 
 Dorothy Raymond Morehead has owned a home in the area since 1975 and has been a local real estate agent for 20 years. Now the owner of a real estate company and the chairwoman of the community board's environmental committee, she talked about the area's well-being.
 Q. How has the neighborhood been feeling the recession?
 A. It hasn't. I know of only one person that was laid off from Yeshiva University, but that had to do with Madoff. Some of the small businesses are feeling it, though. I bought a building next to my office and turned it into a restaurant, and I know it's been tough for the owners who bought it. 
 Q. How do you account for the low rates of subprime lending and foreclosures?
 A. We have a number of long-term residents with manageable mortgages that don't have to sell. And we have a lot of young people coming in. They'll come here and rent as young parents, then buy. The other thing is that if somebody has to move, they can rent because there's a strong rental market.
 Q. What keeps people here?
 A. The taxes are reasonable. Seniors in places like Long Island and New Jersey can't afford the taxes. But there are a lot of support services for the elderly, like a home-care program and Meals on Wheels. And their neighbors really support them.

HEADLINE: A Focus on Medical Malpractice

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''A System Breeding More Waste,'' by David Leonhardt (Economic Scene column, Sept. 23):
 Mr. Leonhardt's article is a good-faith effort to discuss both sides of an emotional issue. It acknowledges the fact that a majority of wrongfully injured patients never seek compensation. That means that culpable doctors get away with medical negligence.
 Under our system of justice no doctor is held to account for a ''mistake,'' but only for falling below the established standard of reasonable medical care -- that is, being negligent. 
 Some believe that the most effective reform would be a cap on damages -- an artificial limit on negligently injured patients' compensation. No state that has imposed such limits, to my knowledge, has seen a reduction in medical negligence or even a meaningful reduction in doctors' malpractice insurance premiums.
 Saying to a child or any patient who, because of negligent medical care, sustains permanent brain damage that his or her inability to have a normal life should be ''fairly'' compensated with $250,000 or $500,000 (for noneconomic damages) reduces medical negligence to a determinable cost of doing business for insurance companies and negligent doctors. Such ''reform'' is unfair to patients. Patrick J. Kenneally

 To the Editor:
 David Leonhardt did a fairly good job of reviewing some of the statistics in the debate about including medical liability reform in pending health care legislation. But I'd like to add two salient points.
 Though Harvard School of Public Health researchers set out to prove in a 2006 study that medical malpractice litigation really isn't a problem, their integrity compelled them to publish the pesky fact that about 40 percent of malpractice lawsuits filed each year in America are ''groundless.'' 
 Also relevant to the discussion is a somewhat static rate of medical errors in the United States during the past several decades, excluding considerable improvement within the field of anesthesiology.
 We should always seek further reduction of such errors. But so long as medicine is practiced by imperfect human beings, errors will never be eliminated entirely -- no matter how many groundless lawsuits trial lawyers impose on our health care system.
 Darren McKinney

 Washington, Sept. 23, 2009
 To the Editor:
 David Leonhardt's article about tort reform brought to light important misconceptions about malpractice trials and awards. As a physician, I can say that, from medical school onward, we are taught to fear lawsuits and to practice medicine defensively.
 This is reinforced throughout one's career by seminars and educational material from the malpractice insurance carriers. I appreciated Mr. Leonhardt's compassion for the suffering of the physician who does end up being sued.
 As the mother of a child who was severely impaired after negligent post-operative care, I know that the experience of a malpractice trial is easily as traumatic for the patient and the patient's family.
 Without the aid of motivated lawyers, the individual patient is powerless against wealthy hospital corporations and their defense teams.
 When participating in discussions of tort reform, I would encourage my colleagues to remember that, but for chance, they could one day find themselves in the position of being the injured party rather than that of the defendant. Gale Organist
 Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., Sept. 23, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I found most of David Leonhardt's article to be enlightening and insightful. But I took offense at his statement, ''Imagine if the government paid for more research into which treatments really do make people healthier -- a step many doctors don't like.'' 
 The truth is that physicians are actively looking for ways to enhance patient care. Hundreds of articles are published every day in medical journals discussing new treatment modalities. Physician-scientists in fact look forward to more government funding into comparative research. This is evidenced by the thousands of applications to President Obama's health care challenge grant with the explicit goal of performing comparative effectiveness research. 
 Physicians are working hard every day trying to enhance patient care.

HEADLINE: Truckers Insist on Keeping Computers in the Cab

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
Crisscrossing the country, hundreds of thousands of long-haul truckers use computers in their cabs to get directions and stay in close contact with dispatchers, saving precious minutes that might otherwise be spent at the side of the road. 
 The trucking industry says these devices can be used safely, posing less of a distraction than BlackBerrys, iPhones and similar gadgets, and therefore should be exempted from legislation that would ban texting while driving.
 ''We think that's overkill,'' Clayton Boyce, spokesman for the American Trucking Associations, said of a federal bill that would force states to ban texting while driving if they want to keep receiving federal highway money. 
 The legislation will be discussed at a conference on distracted driving in Washington, starting Wednesday, organized by the Transportation Department. 
 The issues raised by truckers show the challenges facing advocates for tougher distracted-driving laws, given that so many Americans have grown accustomed to talking and texting behind the wheel.
 Mr. Boyce, who said the industry does not condone texting while driving, said computers used by truckers require less concentration than phones. The trucks ''have a screen that has maybe two or four or six lines'' of text, he said. ''And they're not reading the screen every second.''
 Banning the use of such devices, he added, ''won't improve safety.''
 But some safety advocates and researchers say the devices -- which can include a small screen near the steering wheel and a keyboard on the dash or in the driver's lap -- present precisely the same risk as other devices. And the risk may be even greater, they note, given the size of 18-wheel tractor trailers and the longer time required for them to stop. 
 Some truckers say they feel pressure to use their computers even while driving in order to meet tight delivery schedules.
 ''We're supposed to pull over, but nobody ever does,'' said Kurt Long, 46, a veteran trucker based in Wagoner, Okla., who hauls flour, sugar and other dry goods. 
 ''When you get that load,'' he added, ''you go and you go and you go until you get there.'' 
 The trucking industry has invested heavily in technology to wire vehicles. Satellite systems mounted on trucks let companies track drivers, send new orders, distribute companywide messages and transmit training exercises. Drivers can also use them to send and receive e-mail and browse the Internet. 
 After videotaping truckers behind the wheel, the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute found that those who used on-board computers faced a 10 times greater risk of crashing, nearly crashing or wandering from their lane than truckers who did not use those devices.
 That figure is lower than the 23 times greater risk when truckers texted, compared with drivers simply focused on the road, according to the same study. However, the Virginia researchers said that truckers tend to use on-board computers more often than they text. 
 The study found that truckers using on-board computers take their eyes off the road for an average of four seconds, enough time at highway speeds to cover roughly the length of a football field.
 Richard J. Hanowski, director of the Center for Truck and Bus Safety at the Virginia institute, said videotape monitoring of 200 truckers driving about three million miles showed many of them using the devices, even bypassing messages on the screen warning them not to use the devices while driving. 
 ''Is this any different than texting?'' Mr. Hanowski said. ''With either one, the risks are very high.''
 In Mr. Long's unkempt cab, the computer screen is mounted on the dashboard to the right of his steering wheel. He operates it both by touching the screen and by using a keyboard, which he often keeps in his lap (along with one of the two Chihuahuas that keep him company on his drives).
 On the computer screen, there is a warning: do not use while vehicle is in motion.
 ''But it gives you a proceed button,'' Mr. Long said with a laugh during an interview in August at a truck stop in Joplin, Mo. 
 Mr. Long pushes that button often. After all, pulling over to read and respond to a message, then start up again, would take 10 to 15 minutes, he said. If he's late by even 15 minutes on a delivery, he said, his pay can be cut.
 Mr. Long's experience is typical, according to Michael H. Belzer, an economics professor at Wayne State University who studies the trucking industry. He said truckers had no choice but to use their computers while driving, given their deadline pressures.
 Some makers of the on-board devices, like Qualcomm, sell versions of the systems that cannot be used while a vehicle is in motion or that can be used only in a limited way -- for example, allowing drivers to only read messages or listen to a computerized voice reading them. 
 In recent years, fatalities caused by large trucks have risen slowly, despite many safety advances like air bags and antilock brakes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In 2007, large trucks caused 4,808 deaths -- or 12 percent of all driving-related fatalities -- up from 4,777, or 11 percent, in 1997. 
 Randy Mullett, vice president for government relations at Con-way, one of the nation's biggest fleets, says safety is paramount for the industry, and for his company. 
 For instance, he said Con-way forbids the drivers of its roughly 8,000 trucks on regional routes to use a cellphone or to text while driving. Trucks on those routes tend not to have the computer systems.
 For the company's 4,000 longer-haul trucks, the company discourages drivers from texting and talking on cellphones, but does not have an official policy against it. Mr. Mullett said that such a policy would be difficult to enforce and that drivers rely on that technology to stay connected to both work and home.
 Mr. Mullett also said drivers use the technology only to communicate with dispatchers, and infrequently at that. 
 He said drivers only have to press a button on the screen to acknowledge they received new instructions that appear on the screen. ''It's not much different than pressing a button on the radio,'' he said. 
 Asking truckers to pull over for such a simple action is inefficient and expensive, Mr. Mullett said, given that the company loses about $1.50 a minute when a truck is idle. 
 ''If it took a driver 15 minutes four times a day to pull over, you'd basically lose 10 percent of a driver's time. You can't take 10 percent of a truck fleet out of service to make them answer,'' he said. 
 ''Let's figure out a way to work with Congress that doesn't make these technology advances obsolete or less efficient than they are,'' Mr. Mullett said.
 Tim Lynch, senior vice president at the American Trucking Associations, said a compromise might exempt devices mounted in places where drivers can keep their eyes straight ahead.
 ''That way a driver could still be focusing on the road but looking at a device as opposed to having a BlackBerry they're looking down at,'' he said.
 At least one sponsor of the federal legislation, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said that he was not aware of the trucking industry's concerns but that there was room to accommodate their devices without compromising safety.
 ''There are ways I think to preserve what the trucker actually needs in terms of doing his or her job,'' he said. ''I think the real danger occurs when you're regularly texting, not when you're looking at a machine and doing a quick answer.'' 
 But Robert D. Foss, a senior researcher at the Highway Safety Research Center at the University of North Carolina, said the dispatch computers and texting devices present the same potential for distraction.
 ''It's hard to accept the assertion: 'We're just different,' '' he said. ''You know full well this is motivated by economic considerations.''
 Beyond the dispatch computers, truckers said they relied heavily on an array of technologies to stay productive, entertained and connected on the road. Their cabs become like home offices, wired with CB radios, AM/FM and satellite radios, weather band radios, GPS devices, electrical outlets, laptops and even computer desks. And, of course, cellphones.
 Mr. Long said he uses one or another of his devices 90 percent of the time he is on the road. He said doing so actually makes him a safer driver because it keeps him awake and alert.
 And he said it was one reason he had not had any serious accidents in more than two decades as a trucker. 
 At least, until last Monday.
 On a highway in Oklahoma, a dump truck pulled into his lane from a side road. Mr. Long slammed into it, lost control and drove into a lake. 
 His truck was totaled. Neither he nor the dump-truck driver was badly injured. (His dogs were hurt, one thrown from the cab, but neither badly.)
 Mr. Long said he had not been using his phone or computer at the time, but he had taken his eyes off the road for an instant. ''I reached down to grab a cup of coffee,'' he said. 
 He said the lesson is that drivers need to be careful not to get distracted, particularly when they use electronic devices.
 ''I guarantee if you're not an ace on that keyboard, you've got to look to find them letters,'' he said. ''Sometimes, it takes a lot longer to find a letter on that keyboard than it does to get a cup of coffee.''

HEADLINE: The Dollar Declines, Hitting an 8-Month Low Against the Yen

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
The United States dollar fell to its lowest in eight months against the yen on Monday, as investors unwound short yen positions and as expectations that Japan will intervene at these levels receded. 
 The dollar dropped as low as 88.23 yen, its weakest since late January when it hit a 13-year low of 87.10 yen.
 Japan has intervened in the currency market in the past to weaken the yen as this helped keep its competitive advantage in global trade.
 Large margin calls on the pound and yen have also been behind the yen buying. The pound fell sharply to $1.5770, its lowest since late May, breaking below support for sterling at around $1.5800. It was hammered against the yen, falling 1.6 percent and briefly dropping below the 140 yen mark, its lowest since late April.
 The pound has been under pressure after the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, said last week that a weak pound would help exports and the British economy.
 ''Continued speculation that they will not intervene has led to capitulation of short yen positions, led by the sterling/yen cross,'' said Sue Trinh, a senior strategist at RBC Capital Markets.

HEADLINE: Dialing for Answers Where Web Can't Reach

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

DATELINE: KAMPALA, Uganda 

 BODY:
The caller was frustrated. A new pest was eating away at his just-planted coffee crop, and he wanted to know what to do. Tyssa Muhima jotted down notes as the caller spoke, and promised to call back in 10 minutes with an answer.
 Each day, Ms. Muhima and two other young women at this small call center on the outskirts of Uganda's capital city answer about 40 such calls. They are operators for Question Box, a free, nonprofit telephone hot line that is meant to get information to people in remote areas who lack access to computers. 
 The premise behind Question Box is that many barriers keep most of the developing world from taking advantage of the wealth of knowledge available through Web search engines, said Rose Shuman, the service's creator. That could be a drag on economic development.
 ''So I was thinking, why not bring the information to them in a way that's most convenient and useful to them?'' said Ms. Shuman, who is based in Santa Monica, Calif.
 Instead of searching for information themselves, people in two rural agricultural communities in Uganda can turn to 40 Question Box workers who have cellphones.
 The workers dial into the call center and ask questions on behalf of the locals, or they put the call on speakerphone so the locals can ask for themselves. The operators then look up the requested information in a database and convey it to the workers, who pass it along to the villagers. The workers are compensated with cellphone airtime. 
 The service is a joint effort of Open Mind, a nonprofit group founded by Ms. Shuman, and the Grameen Foundation, which is best known for promoting small loans for the poor. It has received financial backing from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
 The Question Box service was first introduced in remote villages in India two years ago, and it came to Uganda in April. The Ugandan version takes advantage of the explosive popularity of cellphones in Africa. Cellphone use has more than tripled in the last few years, and nearly 300 million Africans now have cellphones.
 Where rural villages were once cut off and isolated from urban centers, cellphones now offer a lifeline, providing access to banking, news and business opportunities. 
 That is a big technological advance, but for most Africans, Internet access is still too costly and slow. Question Box was conceived as a way of overcoming both the expense and the scarcity of Internet connections. Eventually, Question Box will allow farmers and others to use the hot line with their own cellphones or through text messages.
 In June, Google introduced a similar effort in Uganda, also involving the Grameen Foundation, that allows people to find information on topics like health and agriculture via text messaging. 
 Nathan Eagle, a fellow at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico who has done research on cellphones and development in Africa, said that while services like these can be helpful, they must be responsive to the needs of their users.
 ''We can't sit in our offices in America and decide what is useful to people and what is meaningful in their lives,'' said Mr. Eagle, who also runs a cellphone-based business in Kenya. ''The services only add value if they are open-ended.'' 
 Ms. Shuman said this was the aim of Question Box. The service, she said, is first and foremost a tool for economic development. Uganda's agricultural sector employs over 80 percent of the country's work force, and receiving timely information about crop prices or the most current planting techniques is crucial.
 ''In this way we are helping farmers make decisions regarding where to sell, what to plant and how to best take care for their crops,'' Ms. Shuman said. ''It's all about giving communities the ability to help themselves.''
 Not all of the questions that come in are business-minded. Some are about sports -- ''Which is the better football team, Manchester United or Barcelona?'' -- or historical trivia.
 In India, villagers can use Question Box through an actual box -- a metal one with a push-to-talk button. They ask a question and an operator in a distant city will either look up the answer on the Web immediately or ask the callers to wait a few minutes before getting back to them.
 In Uganda, though, that model proved unworkable because Internet connections are so slow. So the operators at Question Box search a locally stored database created by Appfrica Labs, a Ugandan company that hosts the call center. The database contains answers to past questions as well as a repository of documents, government statistics and research papers.
 ''A lot of this information isn't even available on the Internet,'' said Jon Gosier, chief technology officer of Question Box and founder of Appfrica Labs. ''The real value in this database is that it contains a wealth of data that only pertains to the local areas.''
 Most of Uganda's rural agricultural communities are simply too remote to make it cost effective for Internet providers to offer service there, Mr. Gosier said. ''Even in the next 10 years I don't think you're going to see areas like this being wired. That's why Question Box will continue to be an important tool for getting people in these areas the information they need.''

HEADLINE: Abbott Nears Deal to Buy Drug Unit

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
The big American drug maker Abbott Laboratories plans to announce on Monday a deal worth about $6.6 billion in cash to acquire the prescription drug unit of the Belgian company Solvay and take sole possession of their shared cholesterol drug venture, two people close to the discussions said on Sunday.
 The deal, set at 4.5 billion euros, also includes a provision for up to 300 million additional euros, or $440 million at Friday's exchange rate, in future payments that would be linked to product milestones from 2011 to 2013, the people said. 
 In acquiring Solvay's pharmaceuticals business, Abbott, based near Chicago, will take sole possession of the TriCor cholesterol pill, which it was sharing with Solvay and had more than $1.3 billion in sales for Abbott last year. Abbott will also acquire sole rights to Trilipix, a new cholesterol treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration last December and marketed as TriCor's successor.
 Abbott will also acquire Solvay's drugs for hypertension, hormone replacement and neurological and other conditions.
 While most of the world's mergers-and-acquisitions business has been dormant during the recession -- until recent signs of life like Walt Disney's $4 billion purchase of Marvel Entertainment and Kraft Foods' unsolicited bid for Cadbury -- cash-rich drug makers have been on buying sprees this year. 
 That includes Pfizer's $68 billion deal for Wyeth in January, a deal that helped break a logjam of possibilities stalled by the credit freeze. In March, Merck paid $41 billion to acquire Schering Plough, and Roche paid $47 billion to buy the remainder of Genentech.
 For Abbott, the Solvay deal is but one of a series of deals this year. And other potential buyers in the hunt for acquisitions include Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, and Eli Lilly and Company, according to a Sept. 17 report by analysts at Credit Suisse. 
 Pending health care legislation in Congress is not considered a deterrent for pharmaceutical acquisitions, because the drug makers are expected to do well in whatever emerges from Washington. The industry has a potentially winning political argument that its drugs prevent disease and save medical costs. And the industry stands to benefit from the addition of tens of millions of Americans to the ranks of the insured, under a health care overhaul.
 Solvay put its drug business up for sale this year. The unit last year accounted for 28 percent of Solvay's billion euros in revenue. Although the drug revenues have helped fill gaps in Solvay's chemicals and plastic businesses through the recession, analysts say the company is now looking to expand in other core areas, probably chemicals.
 Abbott outbid Nycomed of Switzerland for Solvay's drug business. Abbott had been rumored since July to be a potential acquirer. On Sunday, Solvay set a press conference for 10:30 a.m. Brussels time on Monday (4:30 a.m. New York time).
 Abbott had sales of $29.5 billion last year and $5.2 billion in profit, not counting one-time items. Its top product is the arthritis drug Humira, with $4.5 billion in sales. 
 But future growth projections for other big Abbott products are potentially more challenging, analysts say, with patents expiring on TriCor in 2011, and in 2013 for the cholesterol fighter Niaspan and the prostate cancer drug Lupron. The H.I.V. treatment Kaletra loses patent protection in 2016.
 David S. Moskowitz, an analyst for Caris and Company, said the deal would be a good fit for both companies. ''It makes sense,'' he said on Sunday. The price, slightly less than double last year's revenues for Solvay drugs, indicates that Solvay's drug business was relatively mature without a lot of growth potential, Mr. Moskowitz added. ''It's a reasonable price,'' he said.
 Catherine J. Arnold, senior pharmaceuticals analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote to investors on Friday to say an Abbott-Solvay deal would add to Abbott's earnings, but that it was ''more like financial engineering'' by using cash to buy revenues. The deal, she wrote, would increase Abbott's bet on the cholesterol pills even as TriCor's patent is about to expire and the company faces challenges getting patients to switch to Trilipix. 
 Further, Ms. Arnold wrote, it would fail to diversify Abbott's product line much beyond Humira, which is expected to contribute 35 percent of the company's sales growth the next three years. 
 In Ms. Arnold's opinion, Abbott would be better off pursuing ''strategic assets that would provide more access to innovation.'' She cited Alexion Pharmaceuticals and BioMarin Pharmaceutical as worthy targets.
 The Solvay purchase would be the latest in a series of Abbott acquisitions this year. Two earlier deals focused on eye care companies: Advanced Medical Optics for about $2.8 billion in cash and assumed debt in January, and this month, Abbott said it would buy Visiogen for $400 million cash. 
 Abbott also announced the purchases of the nutrition businesses of Wockhardt Ltd. of India for $130 million cash in late July, and Evalve, a cardiovascular technology company, for up to $410 million, this month.

HEADLINE: Truckers Insist on Keeping Computers in the Cab

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
Crisscrossing the country, hundreds of thousands of long-haul truckers use computers in their cabs to get directions and stay in close contact with dispatchers, saving precious minutes that might otherwise be spent at the side of the road. 
 The trucking industry says these devices can be used safely, posing less of a distraction than BlackBerrys, iPhones and similar gadgets, and therefore should be exempted from legislation that would ban texting while driving.
 ''We think that's overkill,'' Clayton Boyce, spokesman for the American Trucking Associations, said of a federal bill that would force states to ban texting while driving if they want to keep receiving federal highway money. 
 The legislation will be discussed at a conference on distracted driving in Washington, starting Wednesday, organized by the Transportation Department. 
 The issues raised by truckers show the challenges facing advocates for tougher distracted-driving laws, given that so many Americans have grown accustomed to talking and texting behind the wheel.
 Mr. Boyce, who said the industry does not condone texting while driving, said computers used by truckers require less concentration than phones. The trucks ''have a screen that has maybe two or four or six lines'' of text, he said. ''And they're not reading the screen every second.''
 Banning the use of such devices, he added, ''won't improve safety.''
 But some safety advocates and researchers say the devices -- which can include a small screen near the steering wheel and a keyboard on the dash or in the driver's lap -- present precisely the same risk as other devices. And the risk may be even greater, they note, given the size of 18-wheel tractor trailers and the longer time required for them to stop. 
 Some truckers say they feel pressure to use their computers even while driving in order to meet tight delivery schedules.
 ''We're supposed to pull over, but nobody ever does,'' said Kurt Long, 46, a veteran trucker based in Wagoner, Okla., who hauls flour, sugar and other dry goods. 
 ''When you get that load,'' he added, ''you go and you go and you go until you get there.'' 
 The trucking industry has invested heavily in technology to wire vehicles. Satellite systems mounted on trucks let companies track drivers, send new orders, distribute companywide messages and transmit training exercises. Drivers can also use them to send and receive e-mail and browse the Internet. 
 After videotaping truckers behind the wheel, the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute found that those who used on-board computers faced a 10 times greater risk of crashing, nearly crashing or wandering from their lane than truckers who did not use those devices.
 That figure is lower than the 23 times greater risk when truckers texted, compared with drivers simply focused on the road, according to the same study. However, the Virginia researchers said that truckers tend to use on-board computers more often than they text. 
 The study found that truckers using on-board computers take their eyes off the road for an average of four seconds, enough time at highway speeds to cover roughly the length of a football field.
 Richard J. Hanowski, director of the Center for Truck and Bus Safety at the Virginia institute, said videotape monitoring of 200 truckers driving about three million miles showed many of them using the devices, even bypassing messages on the screen warning them not to use the devices while driving. 
 ''Is this any different than texting?'' Mr. Hanowski said. ''With either one, the risks are very high.''
 In Mr. Long's unkempt cab, the computer screen is mounted on the dashboard to the right of his steering wheel. He operates it both by touching the screen and by using a keyboard, which he often keeps in his lap (along with one of the two Chihuahuas that keep him company on his drives).
 On the computer screen, there is a warning: do not use while vehicle is in motion.
 ''But it gives you a proceed button,'' Mr. Long said with a laugh during an interview in August at a truck stop in Joplin, Mo. 
 Mr. Long pushes that button often. After all, pulling over to read and respond to a message, then start up again, would take 10 to 15 minutes, he said. If he's late by even 15 minutes on a delivery, he said, his pay can be cut.
 Mr. Long's experience is typical, according to Michael H. Belzer, an economics professor at Wayne State University who studies the trucking industry. He said truckers had no choice but to use their computers while driving, given their deadline pressures.
 Some makers of the on-board devices, like Qualcomm, sell versions of the systems that cannot be used while a vehicle is in motion or that can be used only in a limited way -- for example, allowing drivers to only read messages or listen to a computerized voice reading them. 
 In recent years, fatalities caused by large trucks have risen slowly, despite many safety advances like air bags and antilock brakes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In 2007, large trucks caused 4,808 deaths -- or 12 percent of all driving-related fatalities -- up from 4,777, or 11 percent, in 1997. 
 Randy Mullett, vice president for government relations at Con-way, one of the nation's biggest fleets, says safety is paramount for the industry, and for his company. 
 For instance, he said Con-way forbids the drivers of its roughly 8,000 trucks on regional routes to use a cellphone or to text while driving. Trucks on those routes tend not to have the computer systems.
 For the company's 4,000 longer-haul trucks, the company discourages drivers from texting and talking on cellphones, but does not have an official policy against it. Mr. Mullett said that such a policy would be difficult to enforce and that drivers rely on that technology to stay connected to both work and home.
 Mr. Mullett also said drivers use the technology only to communicate with dispatchers, and infrequently at that. 
 He said drivers only have to press a button on the screen to acknowledge they received new instructions that appear on the screen. ''It's not much different than pressing a button on the radio,'' he said. 
 Asking truckers to pull over for such a simple action is inefficient and expensive, Mr. Mullett said, given that the company loses about $1.50 a minute when a truck is idle. 
 ''If it took a driver 15 minutes four times a day to pull over, you'd basically lose 10 percent of a driver's time. You can't take 10 percent of a truck fleet out of service to make them answer,'' he said. 
 ''Let's figure out a way to work with Congress that doesn't make these technology advances obsolete or less efficient than they are,'' Mr. Mullett said.
 Tim Lynch, senior vice president at the American Trucking Associations, said a compromise might exempt devices mounted in places where drivers can keep their eyes straight ahead.
 ''That way a driver could still be focusing on the road but looking at a device as opposed to having a BlackBerry they're looking down at,'' he said.
 At least one sponsor of the federal legislation, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said that he was not aware of the trucking industry's concerns but that there was room to accommodate their devices without compromising safety.
 ''There are ways I think to preserve what the trucker actually needs in terms of doing his or her job,'' he said. ''I think the real danger occurs when you're regularly texting, not when you're looking at a machine and doing a quick answer.'' 
 But Robert D. Foss, a senior researcher at the Highway Safety Research Center at the University of North Carolina, said the dispatch computers and texting devices present the same potential for distraction.
 ''It's hard to accept the assertion: 'We're just different,' '' he said. ''You know full well this is motivated by economic considerations.''
 Beyond the dispatch computers, truckers said they relied heavily on an array of technologies to stay productive, entertained and connected on the road. Their cabs become like home offices, wired with CB radios, AM/FM and satellite radios, weather band radios, GPS devices, electrical outlets, laptops and even computer desks. And, of course, cellphones.
 Mr. Long said he uses one or another of his devices 90 percent of the time he is on the road. He said doing so actually makes him a safer driver because it keeps him awake and alert.
 And he said it was one reason he had not had any serious accidents in more than two decades as a trucker. 
 At least, until last Monday.
 On a highway in Oklahoma, a dump truck pulled into his lane from a side road. Mr. Long slammed into it, lost control and drove into a lake. 
 His truck was totaled. Neither he nor the dump-truck driver was badly injured. (His dogs were hurt, one thrown from the cab, but neither badly.)
 Mr. Long said he had not been using his phone or computer at the time, but he had taken his eyes off the road for an instant. ''I reached down to grab a cup of coffee,'' he said. 
 He said the lesson is that drivers need to be careful not to get distracted, particularly when they use electronic devices.
 ''I guarantee if you're not an ace on that keyboard, you've got to look to find them letters,'' he said. ''Sometimes, it takes a lot longer to find a letter on that keyboard than it does to get a cup of coffee.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: September 30, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the trucking industry's concerns over proposals to ban texting while driving referred incorrectly to statistics regarding large trucks and fatal crashes. The statistics, from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, cover trucks that were involved in fatal crashes; they do not specify the number of crashes ''caused'' by the trucks. The article also misstated the change in numbers of fatal crashes involving large trucks from 1997 to 2007. According to N.H.T.S.A., that number declined to 4,808 in 2007, from 5,416 in 1997; it did not increase to 4,808 in 2007, from 4,777 in 1997. (In 1997, N.H.T.S.A. data differentiated between medium-weight and heavy trucks; in the 2007 data, they were counted together as large trucks.)

HEADLINE: Many Investors Still Avoiding Risks of Iraq

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: BAQUBA, Iraq 

 BODY:
The Diyala State Company for Electrical Industries here staggers along, making transformers, spark plugs, ceiling fans and steam irons that few want or can afford anymore.
 Its labor force has tripled in size, even as production has slumped. A deal to lure $60 million in foreign capital -- one of only a handful of foreign investments in Iraq's state-owned industries -- collapsed. The American government recently gave the company $2.5 million to keep its main production line operating and its workers out of penury and, perhaps, insurgency.
 Next month the United States and Iraq will gather hundreds of officials and company executives for a two-day conference in Washington intended to send a message that after six years of war, Iraq is open for business, and not just in oil. Now more than ever before, Iraqi officials boast that a trickle of foreign investment -- including the first new hotel in Baghdad since Saddam Hussein's government fell -- is at last poised to be a flood.
 The experience of the company here, though, shows that economic development and foreign investment face more obstacles than security alone. 
 The state-owned industries that dominate the country's economy -- from oil fields to dairies to textile factories -- are as bloated and inefficient as they were in Mr. Hussein's time, arguably more so. They are hobbled by corruption, still sporadic electricity and poor roads and bound by bureaucracy and central planning that leave them unable to compete with a flood of cheap imports from Iran, Turkey and beyond.
 New legislation intended to regulate investments, land rights, taxes, financial services and consumer protections remains stalled in Parliament. The mere mention of the sort of privatization that swept Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union after the collapse of Communism is anathema to officials here. 
 ''We are not after shock therapy,'' Sami al-Araji, the chairman of Iraq's national investment commission, said in an interview. 
 ''We are after a gradual change from a centrally controlled economy to an open one.''
 Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki publicly pressed Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. earlier this month about ''the need for this conference to be a success.'' 
 Privately, though, American officials express concern that it will be little more than a political exercise before Mr. Maliki's re-election campaign unless the Iraqis do more to create a solid foundation for foreign investors willing to take a risk on the country's prospects. 
 Mr. Biden, in his meetings with Mr. Maliki and other senior leaders, stressed the need for better regulatory and financial systems, according to a senior official traveling with him. The official said that reforms would, for example, allow the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to extend loan guarantees to American companies interested in investing in Iraq.
 Few, though, expect the legislation to proceed before next year's parliamentary elections and the inevitable political bargaining that will follow, putting off significant reforms, and thus investment, for at least a year.
 ''Capital is cowardly,'' said Mejul Mahdi Ali, the president of Diyala's newly created investment commission. ''It is always looking for a safe place.''
 As he spoke, an explosion reverberated through Baquba; a roadside bomb killed three police officers.
 Mr. Ali complained that many government ministers showed little interest in foreign or private investment, or actively opposed it. The commission was kicked out of two government offices before moving to a shabby villa, equipped not by the provincial government, but the American reconstruction team at Forward Operating Base Warhorse, which is nearby. He has not been paid in three months, he said.
 The provincial government's idea of economic development, he said, is a plan to buy 10,000 taxis and lease them to drivers, against his advice. Baquba might soon be the easiest place in the world to catch a cab, but he said, ''That's not investment.''
 Still, even with uncertain security and insufficient legal protections, Iraq has started attracting the attention of investors. 
 Daimler AG signed an agreement with Iraq last year and opened an office in Baghdad. Case New Holland, the international tractor maker, began building the first of 1,250 tractors for the Iraqi government at a factory in Iskandariya, once a center of the insurgency in an area south of Baghdad known as the ''triangle of death.'' 
 Workers broke ground in July on a high-end $100 million hotel near the ''crossed swords'' monument in Baghdad's international zone. 
 ''Potential investors have a virtual open landscape to develop projects that will fill the needs of Iraq's expanding and demanding population,'' Dr. Araji of the national investment commission wrote in an investors guide published this year.
 Optimism has been premature before. 
 The Ministry of Industry last year solicited bids for more than 40 projects involving partnerships with state-owned enterprises, but received them for only 11. Most of those have since failed to come to fruition, including the $60 million proposal for the electrical company here in Baquba. 
 The plant, with eight separate factories, was originally built in 1982 and equipped with machines by Mitsubishi that are now out of date. They still function only because workers have cannibalized parts. 
 When the war in Diyala was at its worst in 2007, the company shut down; the Islamic Army of Iraq, one of the leading insurgent factions, established its headquarters nearby. The director, Abdul Wadoud al-Sattar Mahmoud, went into hiding; his personal assistant was killed.
 The violence ultimately eased, and the factory began to operate again, though largely with the help of the American reconstruction team at Warhorse and the Task Force for Business Stability Operations, a Pentagon agency that supports economic development in Iraq. The task force's function has been to restore production at Iraq's state-owned enterprises, after American officials initially sought to shut them immediately after the invasion in 2003.
 A report by the task force in 2007 criticized the factory's management and described the factory's ''most insidious'' problem as ''a general lack of industriousness.''
 Government policies have not helped make it profitable either. 
 The Ministry of Industry has vastly expanded its payroll to 3,400 workers, compared with 1,200 after the invasion, and raised salaries, driving up the costs of its products. At the same time, a decision by the Coalition Provisional Authority to lower customs duties has meant cheaper foreign products. The factory now has 12,000 unsold ceiling fans and one million spark plugs stored in its warehouses.
 Mr. Mahmoud said that while one ministry drove up costs, another, the Ministry of Electricity, complained that it could buy cheaper transformers from abroad. ''The competition here is very difficult for me,'' he said.
 Iraqi law forbids foreign companies from owning equity in state-owned enterprises. The Ministry of Industry also forbids wholesale restructuring of companies that would require dismissing workers.
 Even worse, in the case of the factory here, when the Ministry of Industry initialed the $60 million investment deal with an Egyptian-Iraqi consortium last year, it suspended its subsidies for the steel needed to make electrical transformers, potentially its most lucrative product in a country starved for power. 
 The consortium, however, pulled out of the deal earlier this year -- because of the general international economic crisis, officials said -- and the supply of steel necessary to keep production going dwindled. The production line would have ground to a halt if the Americans had not stepped in with the grant. 
 ''We could produce more if we had raw materials,'' the line's manager, Abdul Salam Mohammed, said plaintively.
 The director, Mr. Mahmoud, has begun to personally lobby provincial governments for business, deeply discounting the transformers and worsening the company's losses, something he never had to do before. 
 ''This is a new experience for us,'' he said.

PERSON: William Safire 

HEADLINE: William Safire, Political Columnist And Oracle of Language, Dies at 79

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
William Safire, a speechwriter for President Richard M. Nixon and a Pulitzer Prize-winning political columnist for The New York Times who also wrote novels, books on politics and a Malaprop's treasury of articles on language, died at a hospice in Rockville, Md., on Sunday. He was 79.
 The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Martin Tolchin, a friend of the family.
 There may be many sides in a genteel debate, but in the Safire world of politics and journalism it was simpler: There was his own unambiguous wit and wisdom on one hand and, on the other, the blubber of fools he called ''nattering nabobs of negativism'' and ''hopeless, hysterical hypochondriacs of history.'' 
 He was a college dropout and proud of it, a public relations go-getter who set up the famous Nixon-Khrushchev ''kitchen debate'' in Moscow, and a White House wordsmith in the tumultuous era of war in Vietnam, Nixon's visit to China and the gathering storm of the Watergate scandal, which drove the president from office.
 Then, from 1973 to 2005, Mr. Safire wrote his twice-weekly ''Essay'' for the Op-Ed page of The Times, a forceful conservative voice in the liberal chorus. Unlike most Washington columnists who offer judgments with Olympian detachment, Mr. Safire was a pugnacious contrarian who did much of his own reporting, called people liars in print and laced his opinions with outrageous wordplay.
 Critics initially dismissed him as an apologist for the disgraced Nixon coterie. But he won the 1978 Pulitzer Prize for commentary, and for 32 years tenaciously attacked and defended foreign and domestic policies, and the foibles, of seven administrations. Along the way, he incurred enmity and admiration, and made a lot of powerful people squirm. 
 Mr. Safire also wrote four novels, including ''Full Disclosure'' (Doubleday, 1977), a best-seller about succession issues after a president is blinded in an assassination attempt, and nonfiction that included ''The New Language of Politics'' (Random House, 1968), and ''Before the Fall'' (Doubleday, 1975), a memoir of his White House years. 
 And from 1979 until earlier this month, he wrote ''On Language,'' a New York Times Magazine column that explored written and oral trends, plumbed the origins and meanings of words and phrases, and drew a devoted following, including a stable of correspondents he called his Lexicographic Irregulars.
 The columns, many collected in books, made him an unofficial arbiter of usage and one of the most widely read writers on language. It also tapped into the lighter side of the dour-looking Mr. Safire: a Pickwickian quibbler who gleefully pounced on gaffes, inexactitudes, neologisms, misnomers, solecisms and perversely peccant puns, like ''the president's populism'' and ''the first lady's momulism,'' written during the Carter presidency.
 There were columns on blogosphere blargon, tarnation-heck euphemisms, dastardly subjunctives and even Barack and Michelle Obama's fist bumps. And there were Safire ''rules for writers'': Remember to never split an infinitive. Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing metaphors. Proofread carefully to see if you words out. Avoid cliches like the plague. And don't overuse exclamation marks!!
 Behind the fun, readers said, was a talented linguist with an addiction to alliterative allusions. There was a consensus, too, that his Op-Ed essays, mostly written in Washington and syndicated in hundreds of newspapers, were the work of a sophisticated analyst with voluminous contacts and insights into the way things worked in Washington. 
 Mr. Safire called himself a pundit -- the word, with its implication of self-appointed expertise, might have been coined for him -- and his politics ''libertarian conservative,'' which he defined as individual freedom and minimal government. He denounced the Bush administration's U.S.A. Patriot Act as an intrusion on civil liberties, for example, but supported the war in Iraq.
 He was hardly the image of a button-down Times man: The shoes needed a shine, the gray hair a trim. Back in the days of suits, his jacket was rumpled, the shirt collar open, the tie askew. He was tall but bent -- a man walking into the wind. He slouched and banged a keyboard, talked as fast as any newyawka and looked a bit gloomy, like a man with a toothache coming on.
 His last Op-Ed column was ''Never Retire.'' He then became chairman of the Dana Foundation, which supports research in neuroscience, immunology and brain disorders. In 2005, he testified at a Senate hearing in favor of a law to shield reporters from prosecutors' demands to disclose sources and other information. In 2006, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George W. Bush. From 1995 to 2004, he was a member of the board that awards the Pulitzer Prizes.
 William Safir was born on Dec. 17, 1929, in New York City, the youngest of three sons of Oliver C. and Ida Panish Safir. (The ''e'' was added to clarify pronunciation.) He graduated from the Bronx High School of Science and attended Syracuse University, but quit after his second year in 1949 to take a job with Tex McCrary, a columnist for The New York Herald Tribune who hosted radio and television shows; the young legman interviewed Mae West and other celebrities.
 In 1951, Mr. Safire was a correspondent for WNBC-TV in Europe and the Middle East, and jumped into politics in 1952 by organizing an Eisenhower-for-President rally at Madison Square Garden. He was in the Army from 1952 to 1954, and for a time was a reporter for the Armed Forces Network in Europe. In Naples he interviewed both Ingrid Bergman and Lucky Luciano within a few hours of each other. 
 In 1959, working in public relations, he was in Moscow to promote an American products exhibition and managed to steer Vice President Richard M. Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev into the ''kitchen debate'' on capitalism versus communism. He took the photograph that became an icon of the encounter. Nixon was delighted, and hired Mr. Safire for his 1960 campaign for the presidency against John F. Kennedy.
 Starting his own public relations firm in 1961, Mr. Safire worked in Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's 1964 presidential race and on John V. Lindsay's 1965 campaign for mayor of New York. Mr. Safire also wrote his first book, ''The Relations Explosion'' (Macmillan, 1963).
 In 1962, he married the former Helene Belmar Julius, a model, pianist and jewelry designer. The couple had two children, Mark and Annabel. His wife and children survive him, as does a granddaughter, Lily Safire. 
 In 1968, he sold his agency, became a special assistant to President Nixon and joined a White House speechwriting team that included Patrick J. Buchanan and Raymond K. Price Jr. Mr. Safire wrote many of Nixon's speeches on the economy and Vietnam, and in 1970 coined the ''nattering nabobs'' and ''hysterical hypochondriacs'' phrases for Vice President Spiro T. Agnew.
 After Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of The Times, hired Mr. Safire, one critic said it was like setting a hawk loose among doves. As Watergate broke, Mr. Safire supported Nixon, but retreated somewhat after learning that he, like others in the White House, had been secretly taped.
 Mr. Safire won his Pulitzer Prize for columns that accused President Jimmy Carter's budget director, Bert Lance, of shady financial dealings. Mr. Lance resigned, but was acquitted in a trial. He then befriended his accuser. 
 Years later, Mr. Safire called Hillary Clinton a ''congenital liar'' in print. Mrs. Clinton said she was offended only for her mother's sake. But a White House aide said that Bill Clinton, ''if he were not the president, would have delivered a more forceful response on the bridge of Mr. Safire's nose.''
 Mr. Safire was delighted, especially with the proper use of the conditional.

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Monday about the columnist William Safire referred imprecisely to a photograph he took of the ''kitchen debate,'' the 1959 encounter between Vice President Richard M. Nixon and Nikita S. Khrushchev, the Soviet premier, in Moscow. His picture, though well known, was not ''the'' one to become ''an icon of the encounter.'' Another picture, by Elliott Erwitt, showing Nixon poking Khrushchev's chest, also achieved iconic status.

HEADLINE: A War President?

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
All spring and summer, it looked as though Joe Lieberman, the independent from Connecticut, would play the same role in the debate over President Obama's Afghanistan policy that he played in the struggle over Iraq: as a champion of the surge-style counterinsurgency that Obama endorsed in March and as a defender of a wartime White House against the Democratic Party's leftward flank.
 But that was before Afghanistan's fraud-riddled elections, before Obama's new top commander there, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, came back with a dire report and a request for further reinforcements and before a spooked White House entered full-scale reassessment mode. 
 Now, while Obama weighs his options, Lieberman is waiting to find out if he's going to be the president's ally on Afghanistan or one of his sharpest critics.
 In a conversation last week, the Connecticut senator was careful to avoid taking the president to task for pausing before he escalates. After seven years of war, Lieberman noted, we've only now ''begun the first serious national debate about Afghanistan: whether we should be there and what we should be doing there. In that regard, it's entirely appropriate that the president is deliberating.''
 But he was simultaneously careful to imply that Obama's ultimate decision should be a foregone conclusion -- not least because the president's past statements allow for no alternative. 
 Throughout our discussion, Lieberman repeatedly cited Obama's own arguments (''as the president said the other day. ...'') to buttress the case for sending more troops to Afghanistan. And he suggested, more than once, that the president's choice essentially amounts to deciding whether to abandon a strategy to which Obama has already committed himself.
 I heard a similar theme, in public and private, from many counterinsurgency advocates last week. Having recently described Afghanistan as a ''war of necessity,'' they asked, can the president really turn down a request for more troops from a general he himself appointed to support a campaign that he personally endorsed? 
 The answer is very likely no. However serious his doubts about escalation, Obama seems boxed in -- by the thoroughness of McChrystal's assessment and the military's united front, by his own arguments across the last two years and by his party's long-running insistence on painting Afghanistan as the neglected ''good war.'' 
 But if Obama takes us deeper into war out of political necessity rather than conviction, the results could be disastrous. 
 That's because the counterinsurgency strategy he's contemplating is the worst possible option -- except for all the others. It looks attractive only because the alternatives involve abandoning southern Afghanistan to the Taliban's tender mercies, playing Whac-a-Mole with Al Qaeda from afar with hopelessly inadequate intelligence and pushing the nuclear-armed Pakistani military back into a marriage of necessity with a resurgent Taliban next door.
 Even allowing for these perils, the case for escalation remains a near-run thing. In the words of Stephen Biddle, who advised McChrystal on the review, increasing our military involvement in Afghanistan is ''a close call on the merits,'' whose ''outcome is uncertain'' and which is ''likely to increase losses and violence in the short term in exchange for a chance at stability in the longer term.''
 This kind of war may well be worth fighting. But it can only be prosecuted by a president who believes in it wholeheartedly.
 It will have to be sold to an American public battered by recession and weary of seven years of conflict. 
 It will require rallying a Democratic Party whose support for sending more troops to Afghanistan -- the better to outhawk the Republicans -- has vanished with the Bush presidency.
 And it will need to be conducted with a constant eye not only on Iran, but on the fragile situation in Iraq, which has fallen out of the headlines but remains, even now, our most important military theater.
 In other words, fighting to win in Afghanistan will require that Obama become as much of a war president as his predecessor. And that's a role for which he has shown little appetite to date. 
 Maybe this will change. ''My hope,'' Lieberman told me, is that once Obama finishes his ''very public process of deliberation, he will have brought the public along with him'' -- and placed the war effort on a firmer footing in the process.
 But the president can only bring the country with him if he really believes in the war that he's inherited. For now, that remains an open question. 
 And if Obama takes us deeper into a conflict for which he doesn't really have the stomach, then the outcome will almost certainly be tragic -- for him, for us, and for Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Testing the Dexterity Of a Crisis Manager

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
The startling disclosure of a secret Iranian nuclear facility late last week shoved the results of the G-20 economic conference here off center stage. 
 That was hardly surprising, since the conference was intended as a stay-the-course session affirming the promising early results of coordinated efforts to revive the global economy. And it was nothing new in the career of Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, a principal architect of those policies who is among the least prepossessing figures in an administration of large personalities.
 Before taking the Treasury job, ''I had spent most of my life trying not to be on television,'' Mr. Geithner said in an interview here. Indeed, results so far suggest that is where he does his best work. 
 After stumbling in his transition from backstage player to out-front crisis manager, Mr. Geithner has since quieted critics inside and outside the administration at a time when health care and foreign policy challenges increasingly command the headlines. But with the economy still hovering between recession and recovery, multiple tests of his judgment and political dexterity lie ahead.
 A Shaky Start
 Mr. Geithner made his professional reputation over two decades of behind-the-scenes government work that began in the Reagan-era Treasury Department. His profile rose considerably last fall as president of the New York Federal Reserve, when he joined President George W. Bush's Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, in the frantic effort to prevent financial collapse.
 His public struggles began when Mr. Obama chose him as Treasury secretary. First he survived a confirmation controversy over unpaid taxes; later he drew fire for comments about Chinese currency policies that some analysts considered too blunt.
 Mr. Geithner's shaky initial rollout of a plan to help banks clean up so-called toxic assets generated calls for his ouster. Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, grew concerned enough about Treasury's performance that he escalated his own involvement in the department's affairs.
 As it happened, the toxic asset plan's signal contribution was the announcement itself; the increase in market confidence it engendered all but obviated the need for financial institutions to use it. Meanwhile, signs that economic growth is resuming have eased the sense of crisis surrounding Mr. Geithner's work.
 The economic ''message'' meetings in Mr. Emanuel's office have slowed from daily to weekly. The administration's immediate domestic priority is health care, while foreign policy challenges with Iran and the war in Afghanistan have gained fresh urgency.
 Aides say the president never lost confidence in Mr. Geithner, who was born two weeks after Mr. Obama in August 1961. Mr. Emanuel said Mr. Obama values the same quality in Mr. Geithner that he values in himself: the ability to ''stay calm and focused and dispassionate in a storm.''
 Tempering Populism
 Conservatives continue accusing Team Obama of dangerously expanding government control over the economy, from Wall Street to Detroit. But some Bush White House veterans credit Mr. Geithner with tempering the populist impulses of other Obama advisers.
 One example: the administration has resisted calls, domestically and from G-20 allies like France, for specific dollar limits on executive compensation in the financial industry. ''He's doing as good a job as he can under the circumstances,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsey, once Mr. Bush's top economic adviser.
 Such praise only fuels those on the left who cast Mr. Geithner as a tool of Wall Street interests for having rebuffed their calls to nationalize troubled banks. 
 ''Progressives have been disappointed,'' said Robert L. Borosage, director of the Committee for America's Future. But he added, ''I don't think we see a lot of distance between Obama and Geithner.''
 Mr. Geithner proved that point by successfully pushing for Mr. Obama to reappoint Mr. Bernanke, his close ally in the battles of the last year. The decision was fraught because a leading alternative was the National Economic Council director, Lawrence H. Summers, Mr. Geithner's onetime mentor in the Clinton Treasury Department. Staying put in his current job, Mr. Summers will remain as a rival to Mr. Geithner for influence over administration economic policy. 
 The president's decision to impose tariffs on imported Chinese tires, which Mr. Geithner opposed, showed he does not win every argument. Over the next year, he will face a raft of new fights over financial regulation in Congress, deficit reduction, and when to roll back Washington's economic interventions.
 That rollback may be the toughest strategic choice, pitting inflation fears against persistently high unemployment. Kevin M. Warsh, a Fed governor, warned in The Wall Street Journal last week that ''policy likely will need to begin normalization before it is obvious it is necessary, possibly with greater force than is customary.''
 His early public battering largely behind him, Mr. Geithner sounded sanguine last week. ''As long as I feel confident we're making the best decisions among a set of options,'' he concluded, ''I feel good.''

HEADLINE: U.S. IS SEEKING TOUGHER TACTICS AGAINST TEHRAN

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Ethan Bronner contributed reporting from Jerusalem, Michael Wines from Beijing, and Nazila Fathi from Toronto.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration is scrambling to assemble a package of harsher economic sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program that could include a cutoff of investments to the country's oil-and-gas industry and restrictions on many more Iranian banks than those currently blacklisted, senior administration officials said Sunday.
 The administration also is seeking to build a broader coalition of partners for sanctions so that it may still be able to act against Iran even if China and Russia were to veto harsher measures proposed in the United Nations Security Council.
 ''There are a variety of options still available,'' Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, speaking on CNN's ''State of the Union,'' said of the potential list of targets for Iranian sanctions, notably in energy equipment and technology. He called it ''a pretty rich list to pick from.'' 
 Administration officials began describing what new sanctions might look like with a critical face-to-face meeting between the United States and Iran just four days away. The Americans are expected to press their demand for quick access and blueprints to a newly disclosed Iranian nuclear site. 
 In pushing for more stringent sanctions, the administration wants to accomplish two potentially irreconcilable goals: forcing Iran back to negotiations over its nuclear program -- which the United States and its Western allies suspect is meant to create a weapon -- while at the same time winning the support of Russia and China, which are eager to preserve their significant economic ties to Iran. 
 For now, administration officials said, the United States was not likely to win support for an embargo on shipments of gasoline or other refined fuel to Iran. The European allies, one official said, view this as a ''blunt instrument'' that could hurt ordinary Iranians, inflame public opinion and unite the country behind the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose legitimacy within Iran has remained under a cloud since his June 12 re-election that opponents claim was rigged.
 American efforts to marshal worldwide pressure against Iran have gained traction since the revelation last Friday that Iran was operating a clandestine nuclear site. 
 Even Israel, which has long warned that a military strike might be the only effective response to Iran's ambitions, now seems satisfied to let President Obama play out his strategy of offering to talk while threatening to impose painful measures if those talks go nowhere. 
 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel telephoned the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and five other influential lawmakers on Thursday and Friday to urge the United States to pursue ''crippling sanctions'' against Iran, according to Israeli officials and people close to the lawmakers.
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said on the CBS program ''Face the Nation'' that the administration was exploring how to ''broaden and deepen sanctions.'' Existing sanctions, she acknowledged, have been ''leaky,'' but the United States had learned from its experience with North Korea how to assemble a broad coalition behind punitive measures.
 Still, the administration faces an uphill battle, both because of the nature of the countries it must persuade and because of changes inside Iran, particularly its disputed election and the ensuing protests.
 ''Sanctions out of the blue for punishment purposes, as much as I think they deserve it, probably don't serve any useful purpose in resolving the issue,'' said Thomas R. Pickering, a former under secretary of state who has held informal negotiations with the Iranians.
 Administration officials acknowledge it will be difficult to persuade Russia to agree to harsh, long-term sanctions against Iran, whatever the assurances that the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, gave last week to Mr. Obama. China, these officials say, is even less dependable, given its reliance on Iranian oil and its swelling trade ties with Iran.
 Iran has proved resilient to sanctions, having weathered them in one form or another since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. And the political upheaval there creates a new complication: Western countries do not want to impose measures that deepen the misery of ordinary people, because it could help the government and strangle the fragile protest movement.
 Citing those fears, the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, said last Monday he was opposed to an embargo of refined fuel products. Another senior Western diplomat said such a measure was not likely to be on the menu of options, even though sanctions experts say it is probably the most effective short-term cudgel.
 At a dinner in New York last week, the night before he addressed the United Nations, Mr. Ahmadinejad told his guests he would ''warmly welcome'' additional sanctions because it would only make his country more self-sufficient, according to a person who was there.
 ''For sanctions to work, they not only have to be multilateral, but there has to be international solidarity over a prolonged period of time,'' said Ray Takeyh, an Iran expert at the Council on Foreign Relations who was until last month a senior adviser to the Obama administration.
 Mr. Takeyh said that he was skeptical that sanctions alone would alter Iran's long-term behavior. But he said he would not be surprised if Iran came to the meeting on Thursday with an offer to allow inspectors to visit the secret uranium enrichment plant near the holy city of Qum.
 That would fall well short of the administration's demand that Iran hand over blueprints for the plant or produce key people involved in its design. But it might be enough to weaken solidarity, said Mr. Takeyh, who noted that the Iranians ''tend to be tactically adroit.''
 Iran's missile tests on Sunday were interpreted by administration officials as a message to the West after the disclosure of the nuclear site. The missiles had a range of 90 to 125 miles, according to state-run television. Iran plans to fire two medium-range Shahab-1 and Shahab-2 missiles on Monday, the state-run Fars agency reported.
 In assessing the threat posed by Iran, some countries still focus on economics. China has interests in Iranian oil and gas reserves that potentially total close to $100 billion, according to experts. It needs Iranian cooperation to tap those reserves and move the fuel to China.
 Russia, a neighbor of Iran, is more intertwined with it than any other world power, and has more concerns about upsetting relations. That partly explains why it has sought to dilute the impact of previous sanctions on Iran.
 Political changes in Iran have also made it less vulnerable to some sanctions. Among the most common is to deny visas to senior officials to travel to Europe or the United States. But the new generation of Iranian leaders is a product of an Islamic theocracy, and is less likely to care about travel restrictions, experts say.
 ''They don't want to go shopping for their wives in Paris; they don't want to go visit their bank accounts in Geneva,'' said Danielle Pletka, an expert in the Middle East at the American Enterprise Institute. ''That reduces the leverage the international community has over them.''

HEADLINE: A Brooklyn of Wealth and Needs Gets a Major Charity All Its Own

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Brooklyn, which never fully recovered from merging with Manhattan and losing the Dodgers, is about to get new fuel to stoke its stubborn brand of local pride: It is now rich enough to support a major charity of its own.
 The Independence Community Foundation, long the largest private charity based in the borough, is changing its tax status so it can raise money rather than simply rely on income from its roughly $50 million endowment.
 With the change, to be announced on Thursday, the foundation will concentrate most of its fund-raising and all of its grant-giving on Brooklyn. It will try to capitalize on the borough's well-developed sense of identity and its growing wealth, a net worth estimated to be $154 billion by next year.
 The charity, to be renamed the Brooklyn Community Foundation, will be the first community foundation devoted to a single New York borough -- and a potential rival to other groups that raise and disperse money in Brooklyn and other parts of the city. 
 The move is born of a feeling that the borough is not getting its fair share of charitable money. 
 ''When you're out here,'' Marilyn Gelber, the president of the foundation, said in her office in Dumbo, ''looking at the fact that New York State is still No. 1 in philanthropic giving, with over $5 billion annually, and then you start to look at how much is coming to Brooklyn, given our size and given our need, you realize that the landscape of philanthropy is quite uneven.''
 Brooklyn -- which, if it were still a separate city, would be the country's fourth-largest, with 2.5 million residents -- is a landscape both of vibrant neighborhoods that attract young families and members of the creative class and of vast struggling areas with high poverty rates. But a 2002 study by the Foundation Center, an independent research group, found that nearly 90 percent of New York-area charitable giving goes to Manhattan.
 ''The needs are enormous, and this was the only way we could figure out how to do it,'' Alan Fishman, the chairman of the foundation, said of its decision to change from a private charity to a community foundation. ''We already operated as if we were the community charity anyway, and we just needed more resources.''
 Traditionally, community foundations have worked with trusts and estates, allowing people to direct contributions while they are alive through so-called donor-advised funds, as well as to pass on their assets when they die. According to the Foundation Center, community foundations account for 1 percent of grant-making foundations in the country but represent about 10 percent of giving. Even as the economy spiraled downward last year, they increased their giving to $4.6 billion, for the first time exceeding that of corporate foundations. 
 The city already has a community foundation, the New York Community Trust, which has about $1.5 billion in assets in 2,000 donor-advised funds and endowed funds, over which the foundation has discretion. The trust, one of the country's largest, is also one of the most generous: In 2008, it made about $170 million in grants, mostly from donor-advised funds. 
 Of that, $57.5 million went to organizations in Manhattan, although the foundation's executives say some of the money was used for services in the other boroughs. An additional $3.5 million went to organizations in Brooklyn, $2.1 million to Queens, $1.5 million to the Bronx and $62,000 to Staten Island.
 But leaders of the Brooklyn foundation, established in 1998 with an endowment from Independence Savings Bank, would like to see more money focused on its borough's needs. It hopes to tap not only local donors large and small but also successful Brooklynites like, say, Sanford I. Weill or David Geffen, who have moved away but may feel nostalgia for the place where they grew up.
 Since its inception, the foundation has given out about $70 million in grants, mainly in Brooklyn but also in North Jersey. Now it is looking to establish a different model for community charities by encouraging donors to give to any of five ''field of interest'' funds. Through a competitive application process, the foundation's staff members and the board would select grant recipients working on issues like low-cost housing, education, emergency social services, the arts or the environment. 
 Experts in philanthropy have generally greeted the plan with enthusiasm, saying that anything that channels more money toward charitable causes is a good thing. 
 ''They're tapping into people who live in Brooklyn and want to give to Brooklyn to support their own community, and the idea behind becoming a community foundation is that donors of all sizes can join together to do that work,'' said Ronna D. Brown, the president of Philanthropy New York, an association of 285 grant-making foundations. ''The more the better -- you want more and more people in a community to find the vehicle that feels comfortable for them to join in and to be able to give.'' 
 But others warned that the foundation could siphon donations from nonprofit organizations.
 ''I don't think you know whether it will be good or bad,'' said Lorie A. Slutsky, the president of the New York Community Trust. It will be good, Ms. Slutsky said, if the foundation attracts donors who are not already giving, but added, ''To the degree in these troubled times it steps in front of local charities who are now getting direct gifts from Brooklyn individuals, it probably won't be a net plus.'' 
 Officials at the foundation, however, say they are looking to increase overall giving rather than take donations away from others, especially given the wealth now concentrated in the borough. According to a study the foundation commissioned to estimate how much money could be available for charitable giving, Brooklynites could provide enough for $153 million a year in grants from 2010 to 2030.
 It is not just the money, though, that Ms. Gelber said the foundation is seeking to harness; it is also that ineffable Brooklyn spirit and a growing sense of social activism. 
 As a case in point, she mentioned a challenge grant the foundation recently organized that raised $100,000, mainly from central Brooklyn, to help a public library in Bedford-Stuyvesant buy books and establish an African American Heritage Center.
 ''This notion that in Brooklyn there is not the capacity to do more for itself, something like this shows that's not the case,'' she said. ''It's not only Brownstone Brooklyn -- it's all communities, all neighborhoods. If given the opportunity to invest in things they care about, people will do it.''

HEADLINE: From Science, Plenty of Cows but Little Profit

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

DATELINE: HANFORD, Calif. 

 BODY:
Three years ago, a technological breakthrough gave dairy farmers the chance to bend a basic rule of nature: no longer would their cows have to give birth to equal numbers of female and male offspring. Instead, using a high-technology method to sort the sperm of dairy bulls, they could produce mostly female calves to be raised into profitable milk producers. 
 Now the first cows bred with that technology, tens of thousands of them, are entering milking herds across the country -- and the timing could hardly be worse. 
 The dairy industry is in crisis, with prices so low that farmers are selling their milk below production cost. The industry is struggling to cut output. And yet the wave of excess cows is about to start dumping milk into a market that does not need it.
 ''It's real simple,'' said Tony De Groot, an early adopter of the new breeding technology, who milks 4,200 cows on a farm here in the heart of this state's struggling dairy region. ''We've just got too many cattle on hand and too many heifers on hand, and the supply just keeps on coming and coming.'' 
 The average price farmers received for their milk in July was $11.30 for 100 pounds, down from $19.30 in July 2008. The retail price of milk has not dropped as much, but it is down 24 percent in a year, to an average of $2.91 a gallon for milk with 2 percent fat.
 Desperate to drive up prices by stemming the gusher of unwanted milk, a dairy industry group, the National Milk Producers Federation, has been paying farmers to send herds to slaughter. Since January the program has culled about 230,000 cows nationwide. 
 But the sorting technique, known as sexed semen, is expected to put 63,000 extra heifers into milk production this year, compared with the number that would be available if only conventional semen had been used, researchers estimate. 
 That number will jump to 161,000 next year, and farmers fear it could double again in 2011. While that is a fraction of the 9.2 million milk cows nationwide, the extra cows this year and next could roughly equal those removed from production by the industry's culling program. 
 Economists expect milk prices to recover only gradually, which has farmers worried about the impact of so many extra heifers and the milk they could produce. 
 ''Just as the industry starts to recover from these difficult times, we're going to see these heifers enter the marketplace,'' said Ray Souza, president of Western United Dairymen, which represents farmers who produce about 60 percent of the milk in California. ''At the very worst it could certainly stop the recovery altogether and send us into another price recession.''
 The sorting technology relies on slight size differences between the Y chromosome, which produces male offspring, and the X chromosome, which produces female offspring and has a slightly larger amount of genetic material, or DNA. 
 After it is collected from a bull at a stud farm, semen is mixed with a dye that sticks to DNA. A machine detects the extra dye sticking to X chromosomes and sorts the sperm. The sorted semen is frozen and sold to farmers who use it to inseminate their livestock.
 (A fertility institute outside Washington is studying whether the same technique can be used safely in people. If it won approval from the Food and Drug Administration, the technology would let parents choose their baby's sex.)
 When the technology was first marketed widely to farmers in 2006, it represented a long-awaited breakthrough, and was embraced because global milk demand was outstripping supply. 
 A typical Holstein herd using conventional breeding methods will produce 48 percent female offspring and 52 percent male. The male calves are usually sold for little money to be raised as meat, and the females are raised as milk producers. But the sorted sperm produces 90 percent or more female offspring, allowing farmers to expand their herds more efficiently.
 At Mr. De Groot's farm on a recent afternoon, a worker removed a slender pink tube of sexed semen from a liquid nitrogen canister, where it was kept frozen. He passed it to a colleague who inserted it into a heifer's body. The cow munched on feed, seemingly oblivious. If the insemination took, her calf would almost certainly be female. 
 The technology's impact is being felt now, at the depths of the dairy industry's hard times, because of the long lag time in raising cows born of sexed semen to the point that they have calves of their own and thus enter milk production.
 Mr. De Groot, 74, first turned to sexed semen during the long economic boom because he wanted to expand his herd. 
 ''When the world was short of milk we were all told, 'We need more milk!' Everybody was crying for more milk,'' he said in his farm office, decorated with trophies for the high quality of his milk. 
 But his plans were interrupted by the economic crisis, which caused booming dairy exports to dry up and curbed demand at home, sending prices tumbling. At the same time, feed costs remained high, squeezing farmers from both sides.
 Mr. De Groot, who has used the technology with only a portion of his livestock, estimated that he would get up to 350 additional heifers a year by using sexed semen. But he cannot expand his herd because dairy processors will not buy the extra milk. 
 So for the time being, as the sexed semen offspring come of age, he will put them into the herd in place of lower-producing animals. That will drive up output too, though not as much as expanding the total number of cows.
 Scott Bentley, dairy product manager at ABS Global, in DeForest, Wis., a major producer of sexed semen, said that in the long run, the technology should be a boon. But first, the industry has to get through its worst economic crisis in decades. 
 ''This is a really exciting thing,'' Mr. Bentley said of the technology. ''And this is very difficult times. And you combine the two and realize it didn't work as well as we hoped.''

HEADLINE: Stuck in the Middle

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
University presidents in Division II of the National Collegiate Athletic Association sometimes joke that they experience ''ticker envy,'' a yearning for the visibility that comes with a spot on the ESPN ticker.
 For years, colleges and universities in Division II were defined by what they were not. They were not Division I, with its outsize athletics budgets and national news media attention. They were not Division III, with its reputation for rigorous academics and a ban on athletic scholarships. 
 ''We didn't know who we were,'' said Chuck Ambrose, the president of Pfeiffer University in North Carolina and a former chairman of the Division II Presidents Council. ''We didn't know where we were headed. We suffered from a middle-child syndrome.'' 
 Now, members of Division II say they hope they have found their niche by offering a haven from the kind of big-time college athletics that are increasingly seen as overly commercial and exploitative. Under a proposal expected to be approved at the N.C.A.A. convention in January, Division II members plan to shorten the seasons in 10 sports, as well as cut back practice time in football. Supporters say the move sets Division II apart by heading in the opposite direction of Division I, which in recent years has lengthened the football season and has allowed basketball teams to play more games. Trimming seasons will ease the stress on students by having them miss fewer classes and giving them more time to participate in campus life. But skeptics say the cuts are motivated by the desire to cut finances. 
 ''I think it's 95 percent fueled by the economy,'' said Kelly Higgins, the athletics director at Fort Lewis College in Colorado. Higgins is concerned that the loss of home basketball games -- and the thousands of dollars in revenue they bring -- will negate potential savings.
 In addition to reducing the number of competitions in basketball, soccer, baseball and other sports, the proposal would also reduce the seasons in four sports by allowing students to report to school about a week later than they currently do. Football would not lose any games, but players would begin their preseason practice one week later. The proposal would also establish a weeklong ''dead period'' around Christmas in which athletes could not participate in practices or games. Division I is also considering schedule cuts, although they are more limited. A proposal sponsored by the Atlantic Coast Conference would cut one game from the women's basketball season, and a similar proposal is in the works for men's basketball, although it first must be reviewed by Division I's board of directors.
 Bob Fortosis, the athletics director at Eckerd College in Florida and a member of the Division II management council, acknowledged that the Division II proposal was rooted in a desire to cut costs, but that the motivation was also to give students more time on campus. Division II's effort to redefine itself dates to the summer of 2005, when about 150 university presidents and chancellors met in Orlando, Fla., to discuss why several members were leaving for Division I. They hired a marketing expert, devised a slogan -- ''I chose Division II'' -- and wrote a positioning platform focused on highlighting the balance that Division II offered between athletics and academics. 
 ''There's some authenticity to what's happening in Division II that you may not see at some universities,'' said Tim Selgo, the athletics director at Grand Valley State in Michigan and the chairman of the Division II management council. ''Yes, we play highly competitive athletics, but we don't want our student-athletes' time consumed by their intercollegiate athletic experience.''
 Even so, Division II athletes spend nearly as much time playing sports as their counterparts in Division I, according to a 2006 N.C.A.A. survey of athletes. While Division I men's basketball players spent an average of 36.8 hours per week on athletic activities, for example, their counterparts in Division II spent 35 hours a week on the same activities. In football, Division II players spent more time on athletics, an average of 37.1 hours a week compared to the 35.3 hours by Division I players in the Football Championship Subdivision. (The Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, however, logs 44.8 hours a week.) That commitment did not surprise Ronnye Nelson, a running back at Georgia's Valdosta State University, the 2007 Division II national champions. 
 ''I think that it's all the same,'' he said. ''Football is football.''
 Nelson's path to Valdosta was not as simple as the division's slogan implies. A star quarterback from Albany, Ga., Nelson said he spoke to several Division I universities but that interest waned after he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in his senior year. In the end, Nelson decided to attend Valdosta because it was close to home and ''they win a lot.'' 
 The decision was more straightforward for Maddie Dickinson, a junior goalkeeper at Seattle Pacific University, the 2008 Division II soccer champions. 
 ''D-I has a great reputation and it would be great to play there, but it definitely wasn't what I was about,'' said Dickinson, who is from Vancouver, Wash., a three-hour drive from Seattle. ''It was about where I was comfortable, and where home was.''
 Like every division of the N.C.A.A., Division II has seen its numbers grow in the past decade as institutions migrated from the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, a body similar to the N.C.A.A, and as some Division III universities moved to Division II. Between 2000 and 2009, membership in Division II grew to 288 active members from 264, a 9 percent increase. However, during the same period, several Division II members moved to Division I, which has grown 5 percent since 2000. That number is considered artificially low because during that period Division I issued two moratoria on new members. The University of Northern Colorado moved to Division I after an analysis revealed the university was spending nearly as much on sports as comparable Division I universities.
 ''Division II status tends to kind of feed into that sense of being almost second class,'' said Kay Norton, the university president. ''I think there is a connection, I really do.'' This year's freshman class was 6 percent larger than in 2007, the year the university became a full member of Division I. Officials say many factors contribute to enrollment, but ''we do have a higher profile,'' Norton said. 
 Norton said she saw Division II's rebranding efforts as positive. But when asked whether perceptions had shifted, she said, ''Not yet.''

HEADLINE: British Airways Will Fly Business-Only to New York

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
British Airways, which is starting a business-class-only service from London to New York on Tuesday, may eliminate some short-haul flights to restore earnings.
 ''This is an airline that really has to bite the bullet on short-haul, looking long and hard at what it's costing and whether they can ever get a decent margin out of it,'' said Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners in London. ''Some U.K. and European routes have a very limited future.'' 
 Fares between European countries have declined as discount carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet grab market share. Routes like London to Paris, where British Airways pioneered the first international air service in 1919, may be among the first to go because of the shrinking profit margins and the effect of the competing Eurostar high-speed rail service, Mr. Wheeldon said.
 British Airways is already the biggest carrier between Europe and the United States. The business-class-only experiment from London City airport will help Willie Walsh, British Airways' chief executive, determine whether the company can fill planes with people flying to and from London alone or whether it still needs a substantial European network to feed passengers from around the region onto long-haul flights.
 The carrier, Europe's third-largest, has historically made almost all of its profit from first- and business-class travel and last year derived 45 percent of revenue from premium tickets that accounted for only 13 percent of seat sales. The company's revenue fell 12 percent in the three months through June as it had a $:106 million ($169 million) net loss, the carrier said July 31.
 The recession has led to a 12-month decline in bookings that has left premium seats sparsely populated as people avoid flying or trade down to economy class. Premium traffic at the carrier fell 12 percent last month, compared with a 1.3 percent gain in coach, and Mr. Walsh told shareholders on July 14 that demand might never fully recover.
 The declines have prompted British Airways, which is based in London, to review its model for short-haul services and the Club Europe business-class brand, Peter Simpson, managing director of the CityFlyer regional unit, said in an interview. His division is responsible for European and domestic routes already served from London City.
 ''We have looked at Club Europe within the current environment and our customers are telling us that yes, there is a demand,'' he said. ''The market will dictate whether it's still around in five years' time.''
 Richard Tams, the British Airways sales chief for Britain and Ireland, said in an interview that the carrier still needed European feeder traffic to help sustain longer routes and that, for business travelers, offering daily flights was a minimum requirement.
 The London-New York service beginning on Tuesday will provide evidence of the carrier's ability to lure bankers, lawyers and other professionals with a premium-only product costing $:1,900, or $3,032.25, for a round-trip ticket. Financial institutions accounted for 13 of the airline's top 50 clients last year.

HEADLINE: The Next Culture War

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Centuries ago, historians came up with a classic theory to explain the rise and decline of nations. The theory was that great nations start out tough-minded and energetic. Toughness and energy lead to wealth and power. Wealth and power lead to affluence and luxury. Affluence and luxury lead to decadence, corruption and decline. 
 ''Human nature, in no form of it, could ever bear prosperity,'' John Adams wrote in a letter to Thomas Jefferson, warning against the coming corruption of his country. 
 Yet despite its amazing wealth, the United States has generally remained immune to this cycle. American living standards surpassed European living standards as early as 1740. But in the U.S., affluence did not lead to indulgence and decline.
 That's because despite the country's notorious materialism, there has always been a countervailing stream of sound economic values. The early settlers believed in Calvinist restraint. The pioneers volunteered for brutal hardship during their treks out west. Waves of immigrant parents worked hard and practiced self-denial so their children could succeed. Government was limited and did not protect people from the consequences of their actions, thus enforcing discipline and restraint.
 When economic values did erode, the ruling establishment tried to restore balance. After the Gilded Age, Theodore Roosevelt (who ventured west to counteract the softness of his upbringing) led a crackdown on financial self-indulgence. The Protestant establishment had many failings, but it was not decadent. The old WASPs were notoriously cheap, sent their children to Spartan boarding schools, and insisted on financial sobriety.
 Over the past few years, however, there clearly has been an erosion in the country's financial values. This erosion has happened at a time when the country's cultural monitors were busy with other things. They were off fighting a culture war about prayer in schools, ''Piss Christ'' and the theory of evolution. They were arguing about sex and the separation of church and state, oblivious to the large erosion of economic values happening under their feet.
 Evidence of this shift in values is all around. Some of the signs are seemingly innocuous. States around the country began sponsoring lotteries: government-approved gambling that extracts its largest toll from the poor. Executives and hedge fund managers began bragging about compensation packages that would have been considered shameful a few decades before. Chain restaurants went into supersize mode, offering gigantic portions that would have been considered socially unacceptable to an earlier generation.
 Other signs are bigger. As William Galston of the Brookings Institution has noted, in the three decades between 1950 and 1980, personal consumption was remarkably stable, amounting to about 62 percent of G.D.P. In the next three decades, it shot upward, reaching 70 percent of G.D.P. in 2008.
 During this period, debt exploded. In 1960, Americans' personal debt amounted to about 55 percent of national income. By 2007, Americans' personal debt had surged to 133 percent of national income. 
 Over the past few months, those debt levels have begun to come down. But that doesn't mean we've re-established standards of personal restraint. We've simply shifted from private debt to public debt. By 2019, federal debt will amount to an amazing 83 percent of G.D.P. (before counting the costs of health reform and everything else). By that year, interest payments alone on the federal debt will cost $803 billion.
 These may seem like dry numbers, mostly of concern to budget wonks. But these numbers are the outward sign of a values shift. If there is to be a correction, it will require a moral and cultural movement.
 Our current cultural politics are organized by the obsolete culture war, which has put secular liberals on one side and religious conservatives on the other. But the slide in economic morality afflicted Red and Blue America equally. 
 If there is to be a movement to restore economic values, it will have to cut across the current taxonomies. Its goal will be to make the U.S. again a producer economy, not a consumer economy. It will champion a return to financial self-restraint, large and small.
 It will have to take on what you might call the lobbyist ethos -- the righteous conviction held by everybody from AARP to the agribusinesses that their groups are entitled to every possible appropriation, regardless of the larger public cost. It will have to take on the self-indulgent popular demand for low taxes and high spending.
 A crusade for economic self-restraint would have to rearrange the current alliances and embrace policies like energy taxes and spending cuts that are now deemed politically impossible. But this sort of moral revival is what the country actually needs.

HEADLINE: In Flurry of Big Merger Deals, Signs of Restored Confidence

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. 
The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

 BODY:
The corner office is getting a bit more bullish about the economy.
 While investors have been bidding up shares in the stock market for months, many chief executives and boards had privately remained skittish about their own businesses -- until recently.
 In a signal that confidence -- and perhaps a bit of executive swagger -- may be returning to the business world, two large mergers were announced on Monday, adding to a flurry of deals in the last month. First, Abbott Laboratories, the drug maker, agreed to acquire a unit of Solvay of Belgium for $6.6 billion, and then Xerox agreed to buy Affiliated Computer Services, an outsourcer, for $6.4 billion.
 Neither merger compares in size to the double-digit billion-dollar deals that took place just two years ago at the height of the buyout boom. 
 But taken in the context of what has been a merger drought -- in the wake of the financial crisis, deal-making is still off by more than 50 percent from last year -- the transactions suggest that the most senior ranks of corporate America may now have a more optimistic outlook on the economy than some people thought. 
 ''Will you see us move with a lot of acquisitions over this next year? You betcha,'' John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems, said in a recent meeting. ''Especially if it plays out economically the way that I think.'' 
 For nearly two years, mergers plunged along with the markets as executives grappled with trying to understand how best to survive. At this time in 2007, $1.28 trillion in takeovers in the United States had been announced; so far this year, only $491.8 billion have been announced, according to Thomson Reuters.
 And with stock prices fluctuating sharply after falling for many months until the spring, buyers were anxious about overpaying and sellers were nervous about shortchanging themselves. But as the markets have rebounded and leveled off, companies are more confident about their prospects, so they are dipping their toes into the deal waters. The takeovers, in turn, helped lift the stock market on Monday, which had stalled recently. 
 ''The psychology has changed. This is sign that things have stabilized,'' said Boon Sim, Credit Suisse's head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, who suggested that deals were a lagging indicator to the stock market. ''I don't think the floodgates are opening up,'' he continued, ''but C.E.O.'s are now beginning to say, 'If I don't buy it now, it's only going to get more expensive in the next 12 or 18 months.' '' 
 What Wall Street hasn't seen, of course, is the return of the biggest buyers in recent years -- the private equity firms that propelled much of the merger mania during the debt-fueled bubble.
 And that may be good news. The big deals announced recently are strategic deals, in which one company buys another to make it an integral part of its business, and they require the buyer to take on mounds of new borrowing to pay for the acquisition. 
 In contrast, many of the takeovers for the last five years were based on little more than financial engineering, with lax lenders providing low-interest debt to help private equity firms buy companies that they often planned to resell quickly in hopes of pocketing a fast profit. That has left many companies struggling to make interest payments, making it harder for them to invest in new products or more efficient manufacturing methods. 
 A number of those takeovers are already underwater and some have turned sour. Just one example: Simmons, the mattress maker, was bought by the private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners, or THL, in 2003, largely with borrowed money. Last week, THL said that Simmons -- whose immense debt burden from the takeover was hampering its prospects -- would be put into bankruptcy proceedings and sold. But the sale price for Simmons is so low that bond investors will lose around $500 million.
 At Xerox, Ursula M. Burns, the company's chief executive, said that she pursued the deal for Affiliated Computer Services only because she finally felt more comfortable with the performance of her own business. ''We're confident that our base business will rebound when the economy does -- and in Q2 saw the right trends in this direction,'' she said. ''So, all factors played to our favor. At the end of the day, in tough times, strong companies look to invest in their future.''
 While the recent mergers may represent a positive sign for the economy, Alexander Roos, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group, is less inclined to believe that we are about to see a burst of activity. In a study to be published on Tuesday, he said, his analysis of a sample of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shows that about 20 percent are ''predators,'' ready to take on the risks of a deal, while another 20 percent are ''prey.''
 ''We expect a window of opportunity offering attractive takeover prospects to open soon,'' Mr. Roos said. ''We have already seen some of our smarter clients making preparations in recent months.''
 The greatest concentration of deal-making appears to be in the health care and technology sectors. Warner Chilcott made a $3.1 billion deal for Procter & Gamble's drug business last month, for example, and Dell bought Perot Systems, a technology services company, for $3.9 billion. But deals are also being made in other sectors, like food; Kraft's $16.7 billion unsolicited bid for Cadbury, which was rejected but remains a possibility, is the largest outstanding offer to date.
 ''If you're healthy, it's a great time to acquire inexpensively,'' adds Ted Rouse, a head of Bain & Company's global mergers and acquisitions practice. ''But it's an awful time for two weak companies to merge.''
 While the return of corporate mergers may be a good sign for the economy, a bigger question may be whether it is such a good thing for companies. Most deals sound great at the time, but in the end, not all of them work out as well as planned. 
 Mr. Rouse said, ''Before the recession, Bain's research on M.&A. showed that approximately 55 percent of acquisitions failed to deliver expected shareholder returns after one year -- worse than flipping a coin. The odds only get worse as the size of the acquisition increases and the target is further from the acquirer's core business.''
 Let's hope the odds are better this time around.

 CORRECTION:
The DealBook column on Tuesday, about a recent uptick in mergers and acquisitions, described incorrectly a benefit of strategic deals, in which one company buys another with the aim of making it an integral part of its business. Typically, such deals do not require the buyer to take on extensive debt to pay for the purchase -- not the opposite.

HEADLINE: As Yen Rises, Japan Faces Tricky Policy Choices

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
The yen spiked to an eight-month high against the dollar on Monday, weighing on the Japanese stock market and casting a spotlight on the tricky economic policy decisions facing the new government in Tokyo.
 As investors fretted about the pain that a strong currency means for export behemoths like Sony, Canon and Toyota, the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index dropped 2.5 percent to close just above 10,000, a level not seen since July.
 The yen's spurt to 88.23 on the dollar -- its best since late January, when it hit 87.10, its strongest in 13 years -- was set off by comments from the new finance minister, Hirohisa Fujii, who appeared to indicate that the authorities would not step in to weaken the currency artificially even if it appreciated further. After Mr. Fujii seemed to temper his comments later, the yen eased back to about 89.30 late in the Asian day. 
 Even so, the yen is now about 11 percent stronger against the United States currency than it was in early June, when it took 101 yen to buy $1. This month alone, it has firmed about 4 percent against the dollar.
 The steady upward movement in Japan's currency comes as its economy is still struggling to extract itself from its deepest recession in decades. Japan is highly dependent on exports, and thus vulnerable to any swings in its currency: A strong Japanese yen makes Japanese-made goods more expensive to consumers paying in euros or dollars and reduces the value of Japanese companies' earnings overseas when they are repatriated.
 Like other exporting nations, Japan was hit hard by the collapse in demand for consumer goods in Europe and the United States during the global financial crisis last year. But the situation was aggravated for Japanese exporters by the headwind of a strong domestic currency.
 Worries about the yen's strength have re-emerged in the last few months as the currency firmed again, weighing on the stock market in Japan, which has been one of the weakest performers in Asia this year. 
 Analysts say a number of factors help to explain why the yen is strong despite the fragile state of the overall Japanese economy. But those factors, they add, are likely to fade next year.
 ''The elections were seen as positive for the yen, as there was hope for a new environment in Japanese politics,'' said Thomas Harr, a foreign exchange strategist at Standard Chartered in Singapore, referring to the national elections at the end of August, which swept the Liberal Democratic Party out of power for only the second time since World War II and handed victory to the Japanese Democratic Party.
 ''In addition, short-term lending rates are currently actually higher than those in the United States, prompting many investors to move funds into yen assets,'' he said.
 The new Japanese government wants to wean the economy -- the world's largest after that of the United States -- away from its dependence on exports, and analysts say this may lead it to refrain from seeking to weaken the yen artificially by intervening in the currency markets.
 ''If the yen is strong, that helps domestic consumers, as imports become cheaper,'' said Arjuna Mahendran, head of Asia investment strategy at HSBC Private Bank in Singapore. ''But it is clearly a risky rebalancing, as exporters suffer from a stronger yen.''
 Still, many analysts believe that the yen may not appreciate much further. Mr. Harr of Standard Chartered said the bank's forecast was for the yen to finish the year at 88 to the dollar, then to weaken to 101 by the middle of next year.
 ''The factors supporting the yen will continue to play out through the rest of this year, but will not continue much into next year,'' he said. 
 In addition, Mr. Mahendran said, Japan was quickly becoming more reliant on China -- as opposed to the United States or Europe -- as a destination for its exports, a factor that would reduce the economy's exposure to currency swings against the dollar or euro. 
 Meanwhile, uncertainties about how quickly the world's leading economies will recover from the economic downturn could also weigh on Japan's stock market in coming weeks, adding to the drag created by the currency concerns.
 ''We're now at the tail end of all this fiscal easing; no one is entirely sure how this will develop on that front going forward,'' Mr. Mahendran said of government policies to stimulate lending and spending by banks and consumers.
 For equities markets to firm, he said, ''we really need concrete evidence that company earnings will continue to recover quite substantially.''
 ''That will be the proof of the pudding,'' he said. ''Profits in the second quarter of this year were mostly driven by cost-cutting, not top-line growth. The question now is how much end-demand has recovered, how much pricing power has recovered for companies.''

HEADLINE: Europe's Socialists Suffering Even in Bad Capitalist Times

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
A specter is haunting Europe -- the specter of Socialism's slow collapse.
 Even in the midst of one of the greatest challenges to capitalism in 75 years, involving a breakdown of the financial system due to ''irrational exuberance,'' greed and the weakness of regulatory systems, European Socialist parties and their left-wing cousins have not found a compelling response, let alone taken advantage of the right's failures.
 German voters clobbered the Social Democratic Party on Sunday, giving it only 23 percent of the vote, its worst performance since World War II.
 Voters also punished left-leaning candidates in the summer's European Parliament elections and trounced French Socialists in 2007. Where the left holds power, as in Spain and Britain, it is under attack. Where it is out, as in France, Italy and now Germany, it is divided and listless. 
 Some American conservatives demonize President Obama's fiscal stimulus and health care overhaul as a dangerous turn toward European-style Socialism -- but it is Europe's right, not left, that is setting its political agenda. 
 Europe's center-right parties have embraced many ideas of the left: generous welfare benefits, nationalized health care, sharp restrictions on carbon emissions, the ceding of some sovereignty to the European Union. But they have won votes by promising to deliver more efficiently than the left, while working to lower taxes, improve financial regulation, and grapple with aging populations.
 Europe's conservatives, says Michel Winock, a historian at the Paris Institut d'Etudes Politiques, ''have adapted themselves to modernity.'' When Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Germany's Angela Merkel condemn the excesses of the ''Anglo-Saxon model'' of capitalism while praising the protective power of the state, they are using Socialist ideas that have become mainstream, he said.
 It is not that the left is irrelevant -- it often represents the only viable opposition to established governments, and so benefits, as in the United States, from the normal cycle of electoral politics. 
 In Portugal, the governing Socialists won re-election on Sunday, but lost an absolute parliamentary majority. In Spain, the Socialists still get credit for opposing both Franco and the Iraq war. In Germany, the broad left, including the Greens, has a structural majority in Parliament, but the Social Democrats, in postelection crisis, must contemplate allying with the hard left, Die Linke, which has roots in the old East German Communist Party. 
 Part of the problem is the ''wall in the head'' between East and West Germans. While the Christian Democrats moved smoothly eastward, the Social Democrats of the West never joined with the Communists. ''The two Germanys, one Socialist, one Communist -- two souls -- never really merged,'' said Giovanni Sartori, a professor emeritus at Columbia University. ''It explains why the S.P.D., which was always the major Socialist party in Europe, cannot really coalesce.''
 The situation in France is even worse for the left. Asked this summer if the party was dying, Bernard-Henri Levy, an emblematic Socialist, answered: ''No -- it is already dead. No one, or nearly no one, dares to say it. But everyone, or nearly everyone, knows it.'' While he was accused of exaggerating, given that the party is the largest in opposition and remains popular in local government, his words struck home.
 The Socialist Party, with a long revolutionary tradition and weakening ties to a diminishing working class, is riven by personal rivalries. The party last won the presidency in 1988, and in 2007, Segolene Royal lost the presidency to Mr. Sarkozy by 6.1 percent, a large margin. 
 With a reputation for flakiness, Ms. Royal narrowly lost the party leadership election last year to a more doctrinaire Socialist, Martine Aubry, by 102 votes out of 135,000. The ensuing allegations of fraud further chilled their relations. 
 While Ms. Royal would like to move the Socialists to the center and explore a more formal coalition with the Greens and the Democratic Movement of Francois Bayrou, Ms. Aubry fears diluting the party. She is both famous and infamous for achieving the 35-hour workweek in the last Socialist government.
 The French Socialist Party ''is trapped in a hopeless contradiction,'' said Tony Judt, director of the Remarque Institute at New York University. It espouses a radical platform it cannot deliver; the result leaves space for parties to its left that can take as much as 15 percent of the vote. 
 The party, at its summer retreat last month at La Rochelle, a coastal resort, still talked of ''comrades'' and ''party militants.'' Its seminars included ''Internationalism at Globalized Capitalism's Hour of Crisis.'' 
 But its infighting has drawn ridicule. Mr. Sarkozy told his party this month that he sent ''a big thank-you'' to Ms. Royal, ''who is helping me a lot,'' and Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a prominent European Green politician, said ''everyone has cheated'' in the Socialist Party and accused Ms. Royal of acting like ''an outraged young girl.''
 The internecine squabbling in France and elsewhere has done little to position Socialist parties to answer the question of the moment: how to preserve the welfare state amid slower growth and rising deficits. The Socialists have, in this contest, become conservatives, fighting to preserve systems that voters think need to be improved, though not abandoned.
 ''The Socialists can't adapt to the loss of their basic electorate, and with globalism, the welfare state can no longer exist in the same way,'' Professor Sartori said. 
 Enrico Letta, 43, is one of the hopes of Italy's left, currently in disarray in the face of Silvio Berlusconi's nationalist populism. ''We have to understand that Socialism is an answer of the last century,'' Mr. Letta said. ''We need to build a center-left that is pragmatic, that provides an attractive alternative, and not just an opposition.''
 Mr. Letta argues that Socialist policies will have to be transmuted into a more fluid form to allow an alliance with center, liberal and green parties that won't be called ''Socialist.'' 
 Mr. Winock, the historian, said, ''I think the left and Socialism in Europe still have work to do; they have a raison d'etre, and they will have to rely more on environment issues.'' Combined with continuing efforts to reduce income disparity, he said, ''going green'' may give the left more life.
 Mr. Judt argues that European Socialists need a new message -- how to reform capitalism, ''recognizing the centrality of economic interest while displacing it from its throne as the only way of talking about politics.'' 
 European Socialists need ''to think a lot harder about what the state can and can't do in the 21st century,'' he said.
 Not an easy syllabus. But without that kind of reform, Mr. Judt said, ''I don't think Socialism in Europe has a future; and given that it is a core constitutive part of the European democratic consensus, that's bad news.''

HEADLINE: Markets Regain Momentum Based on Latest Mergers

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Corporate mergers and acquisitions all but dried up during last year's financial crisis. But on Monday, Wall Street bounded higher on signs that companies once again had enough cash, credit and confidence to undertake big-ticket deals.
 Announcements of two separate deals by Xerox and the pharmaceutical company Abbott Laboratories were the latest in a small flurry of corporate deal-making. Last week, the computer maker Dell made a play to expand its presence in the computer services sector by buying Perot Systems, and Kraft Foods has been in a takeover drama with the British candy maker Cadbury. 
 To investors, the revival of merger activity -- however slight -- was another sign that credit was flowing again, and the financial system was gradually returning to normal. Initial public stock offerings have also ticked up in recent weeks.
 ''It sends a very loud message to investors that corporate America's feeling good about the recovery, and it's time to expand,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 124.17 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 9,789.36, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 18.60 points, or 1.8 percent, to end at 1,062.98. The gains helped the major indexes recover many of their losses from the previous week. The Nasdaq was up 39.82 points, or 1.9 percent, at 2,130.74.
 European shares were also higher, with the FTSE 100 in London rising 83.50 points, or 1.64 percent. The CAC 40 in Paris rose 85.86 points, or 2.3 percent, while the DAX in Frankfurt rose 154.90 points, or 2.78 percent. Most exchanges in Asia ended lower. The Nikkei in Tokyo fell 256.46 points, or 2.5 percent, as the dollar hit an eight-month low against the yen, raising concerns that a stronger yen could hurt exports.
 Analysts said that stocks could be lifted this week as the third quarter wound down and mutual funds engaged in so-called window dressing, buying better-performing stocks at the last minute as they prepared to issue quarterly performance statements.
 Volumes were lighter than normal on Monday because of Yom Kippur.
 Markets fell last week by the largest amount since early July as economic signals from the housing market and manufacturing sector portended a long, bumpy recovery. As sales of new homes shrank and orders for durable goods slipped, some investors wondered whether they had pumped too much money into the stock markets.
 But on Monday, investors seized on the dip as a buying opportunity. 
 Technology stocks gained the most ground after news that the global copying company Xerox would pay $6.4 billion to buyAffiliated Computer Services, an outsourcing company.
 Shares of Xerox dipped slightly on the news, while Affiliated's stock rose nearly 15 percent. Some analysts said the uptick in merger activity could pull other investors in from the sidelines.
 ''If a corporate buyer thinks a company's stock price is cheap, maybe it's because they are cheap,'' said Andrew M. Brooks, head of United States equity trading at T. Rowe Price. This week, investors will get more numbers on the housing market with the release of the closely watched Case-Shiller home price index on Tuesday. And the Labor Department will release its monthly employment report on Friday. Economists predict the unemployment rate will climb to 9.8 percent from 9.7 percent, even as the number of payroll job losses declines.
 Interest rates were lower on Monday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 10/32, to 102 28/32, and the yield fell to 3.28 percent, from 3.32 percent late Friday.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three-and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Michigan Lawmakers Face Deadline on Budget Deal

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
State lawmakers in Michigan will convene a last-minute session on Tuesday in an effort to close a $2.8 billion budget gap and stave off a possible government shutdown on Thursday. 
 Among the measures under consideration are eliminating a scholarship program and other forms of financial aid for college students, cutting back on health care for the poor and decreasing state aid to townships and cities.
 Michigan is suffering from a protracted economic downturn that predates the national recession. As the national economy sputtered this year, it caused more grief and challenges in Lansing, the state capital, where deep budget cuts started seven years ago when many states were enjoying surpluses.
 Despite federal aid to the automobile industry and federal stimulus money to help save jobs and services, Michigan's projected shortfall grew this year, to $2.8 billion this month from $1.8 billion in July. The proposed budget for next year is $8 billion.
 Programs already hurting, like the Michigan Promise grant program for college tuition, may be entirely cut.
 Still, legislators sounded hopeful that they could close a deal by midnight on Wednesday that did not include any tax increases. If a deal is not reached, a temporary continuation budget that maintains the current spending level is expected to be put into place. (Two states have fiscal years beginning Thursday. The other, Alabama, has passed a budget.)
 ''We'll work as long as we can and as fast as we can,'' said State Senator Mike Bishop, a Republican and the majority leader. ''I think we've got a very solid chance at working out a bipartisan solution to this budget.''
 In the proposals being floated around the Capitol, no department or agency would escape being cut, on average by 15 percent. 
 ''In many cases, protecting the priorities was about how small we could make the cut,'' Mr. Bishop said. ''We were forced into areas we didn't want to cut,'' like Michigan Promise, he added. ''The whole program is gone.''
 Elizabeth Boyd, a spokeswoman for Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat, said she was optimistic about a resolution.''We are hearing from legislators that they are making progress,'' Ms. Boyd said, adding, ''Everyone has to accept cuts that are painful, but the governor thinks some of the cuts go too far.'' 
 Ms. Granholm has criticized what she said was an overreliance on cuts without increases in revenues.
 Ms. Boyd said the governor hoped to save Michigan Promise and to reduce cuts in state support to municipalities for parks, police and fire protection.
