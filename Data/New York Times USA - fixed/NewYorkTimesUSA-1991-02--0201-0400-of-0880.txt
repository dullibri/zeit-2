HEADLINE: Job Security Is an Issue At Hearings on Trade

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
At the first Congressional airing yesterday of the Bush Administration's plan to break down trade barriers between the United States and Mexico, lawmakers were generally sympathetic but wary that American jobs might be lost because of lower Mexican wage and environmental standards.
Before the Senate Finance Committee, the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, asserted there would be "measurable gains across a broad spectrum" of the American economy and "few losers." 
 The committee chairman, Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, agreed, saying, "I think we can find an agreement that will raise standards of living on both sides."
 
Proposal Is Denounced
 But the proposal was denounced by Thomas R. Donahue, secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., as "an economic and social disaster" for American workers. The labor federation has made fighting the agreement its top legislative priority this year.
Mrs. Hills said the impact on industries identified as possible losers, like fruits and vegetables, glass products, textiles and footwear, would be softened by gradual reduction of barriers over time and programs of worker assistance.
The United States and Mexico are scheduled to start negotiatons this summer, joined by Canada, which has a two-year-old free trade agreement with the United States.
Several lawmakers said yesterday that they were worried lower standards in Mexico would lead to lower standards here.
Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, asked Mrs. Hills why a chemical plant in Louisiana, hurt by the cost of complying with last year's Clean Air Act, would not move to Mexico, pollute there and sell its product to the United States duty free.
As to concerns about plants moving across the frontier to take advantage of lower environmental standards, she said that corporate moves depend on any number of factors besides environmental conditions, such as transportation facilities, educational standards of the workforce and capital requirements.
"The wholesale migration of firms is not something we would anticipate," she said.
Mexico is already making major efforts to lift environmental standards, Mrs. Hills said, and had passed a tough environmental law with criminal penalties. She said it was moving toward requiring catalytic converters on automobiles by 1991.
She indicated she would resist linking enviromental compliance with the free trade negotiations apparently because this could severely complicate the talks. Mexico, she noted, is already working with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and has used American laws as the model for its own legislation.
Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, noted during the hearing that the average wage in Mexico was 57 cents an hour, compared with $10.47 an hour in the United States. He predicted, "Those wage rates will make manufacturing jobs slide away to Mexico."

HEADLINE: Study Foresees Closing Most Nuclear Arms Plants

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
In a study that envisions a sharply reduced need for nuclear arms in the 21st century, the Department of Energy proposes shutting down all but five of its weapons plants for good and letting private companies own the factories for making the weapons' nonnuclear components.
The new study, which is scheduled to be made public on Thursday, is intended by the Department of Energy to open a new era of more economical and safer production of atomic weapons. The department is seeking to end a 47-year period when radioactive materials for the nuclear arsenal were manufactured at great cost to public health, the environment and the Treasury. 
 Details of the study were made available by officials in Congress, the White House and the Energy Department who have read it. Prepared over the last 18 months for the White House and Congress, the study is the first step in an elaborate process to change and modernize an industry that had deteriorated so badly that by late 1988 it ceased to function.
 
First Step of Many
 This month, the Energy Department will hold the first of dozens of hearings around the country to obtain public comment, and the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs has scheduled a hearing on the report later this month.
Under one possible plan offered in the study, the Government's nuclear weapons industry in 2015 would consist of plants in Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada, South Carolina and one other state that has yet to be chosen. This option, one of four outlined in the study, calls for consolidating the functions of the Rocky Flats Plant, the Y-12 uranium plant in Oak Ridge, Tenn., and the Pantex plant, the main warhead assembly plant, near Amarillo, Tex.
The Energy Department's plants in Kansas City, Pinellas, Fla., and Miamisburg, Ohio, which manufacture electronic and other nonradioactive components for nuclear weapons are to be transferred to private industry, according to the study. The Energy Department is also looking to put into private hands the nonnuclear manufacturing operations at its nuclear plants in South Carolina, Tennessee and Colorado.
A separate study begun a month ago by the Department of Energy is evaluating proposals to consolidate the operations of two weapons design laboratories in New Mexico and another in California.
 
Dramatic Shrinkage of Industry
 Taken together, the actions proposed in the new study would greatly shrink an industry that since its birth during World War II, grew to operate at one time in more than 100 sites in 32 states. As late as 1988, the American nuclear weapons industry included production plants, laboratories, testing grounds and waste repositories at 17 sites in 12 states. Currently six of the plants have been shut since October 1988 for safety reasons, two of them permanently.
The new study is the second attempt by the Energy Department to characterize and estimate the nation's needs for nuclear materials. In December 1988, the Energy Department published another plan for the industry's modernization that called for spending $81 billion to shut old plants, relocate others and build several entirely new plants. The 1988 study, which is superseded by the new study, said the United States would need to maintain the production of nuclear materials for weapons, particularly plutonium and tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, at nearly the same levels as existed during the most anxious years of the Cold War.
The new plan makes much different assumptions about the level of tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, according to Congressional and Energy Department officials. According to the four separate possibilities presented, the number of nuclear weapons in the American arsenal is expected to be 30 percent to 85 percent lower than it is today. Experts outside the Government say the United States currently maintains 20,000 warheads in the arsenal.
No matter which plan is ultimately used as the basis for changing the industry, say the study's authors, the United States will never again need to turn on the nuclear reactors and chemical processing plants to produce virgin supplies of plutonium. The explosive radioactive metal, which was discovered 50 years ago this month at the University of California at Berkeley, was manufactured at the Hanford nuclear reservation from 1944 until 1988.
 
Rocky Flats Plant to Be Shut
 All planning possibilities also call for the permanent shutdown and relocation of the Rocky Flats Plant. Rocky Flats has been temporarily shut since November 1989, the second long shutdown in the last 29 months, because of persistent mechanical and managerial weaknesses that make it unsafe to operate, according to James D. Watkins, the Secretary of Energy.
But the study makes clear that the United States will still need the capacity to recover plutonium from retired warheads and process it for new warheads, for temporary storage or for permanent disposal in a new waste repository in New Mexico.
The Savannah River plant near Aiken, S.C., could become the principal site for producing and processing plutonium metal that is recovered from retired warheads. A new $86 million plutonium plant is being tested at Savannah River and is scheduled to be put into operation this summer.
Until it is closed, Rocky Flats, perhaps the most troubled of the nation's nuclear plants, is to remain a machining center to make plutonium parts for warheads and will have the ability to recover and process radioactive wastes from these operations. The new limited mission for Rocky Flats is a marked departure from the plant's role in the weapons industry as the principal site for processing plutonium for the nuclear arsenal.
Mr. Watkins has asked Congress for $283 million in a supplemental appropriation this fiscal year for emergency repairs at Rocky Flats. Congressional investigators said the repairs are to be made to buildings at Rocky Flats that machine plutonium into parts for new warheads and that recover and process plutonium wastes from these operations. The United States, according to independent arms control experts, has been unable to manufacture new warheads for more than six months because of the persistent problems at Rocky Flats.
According to Congressional investigators, the cost of eventually closing Rocky Flats, including its radioactive buildings and cleaning up mounds of accumulated chemical and radioactive wastes could be more than $7 billion.

HEADLINE: New York City Given Warning by Rohatyn On the 1992 Budget

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, warned yesterday that New York City's fiscal problems might deteriorate to the point where the city would have to postpone balancing its budget next year and instead borrow to meet expenses.
Without the borrowing, Mr. Rohatyn said, a declining economy may force the city to face a budget gap totaling $3 billion next year. Such a gap, he said, could not be closed without doing "extreme brutality" to the quality of life in the city. 
 "At some point the tradeoff between balancing the budget and the long-term social and economic harm may not make sense," Mr. Rohatyn said at a board meeting of the corporation, which was set up to raise capital for the city in 1975, when the city could not sell its bonds. He added that closing a gap of $3 billion could require up to 30,000 layoffs and $1.5 billion in new taxes.
By suggesting that the city might be unable or unwilling to balance its budget, Mr. Rohatyn, who once helped save the city from financial ruin and retains considerable power to assist it now, has broached a subject previously considered unthinkable and has opened a debate that could continue for months.
City officials, who believe they are making progress in confronting municipal fiscal problems, were stung by Mr. Rohatyn's gloomy assessment, with its suggestion that the administration might ultimately have to admit inability to control the city's destiny.
Asked whether Gov. Mario M. Cuomo was aware of his remarks, Mr. Rohatyn said, "Does he know my view, yes, but these ideas do not reflect his view."
Thomas Conroy, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said he could not immediately comment on Mr. Rohatyn's remarks.
Mr. Rohatyn said that he was not predicting the onset of a full-scale fiscal crisis, but that the deep local recession could result in one.
Asked about Mr. Rohatyn's remarks, Sally Hernandez-Pinero, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, said, "The Mayor clearly disagrees."
She said Mayor David N. Dinkins had repeatedly shown that he would take whatever steps were necessary to balance the budget so long as they did not undermine "the viability of the city."
"The Mayor's view is the glass is half full," she said, "Felix's view is the glass is half empty."
The city is required by law to balance its budget each year. If it does not, severe damage to its credit standing might result. The lapse might also trigger a state law that gives an appointed body, the state's Financial Control Board, power to abrogate city contracts and veto city spending decisions. The control board was created in 1975 to oversee city finances.
Instead, Mr. Rohatyn suggested that if the city faced damaging budget cuts, it could seek legislation changing the end of its fiscal year. It could then work with the state, municipal labor unions, rating agencies and the Financial Control Board to develop a plan to bring the city's budget back into balance over two to three years.
 
Postponing the Debt
 By extending its fiscal year, which ends June 30, the city would have more time to make cuts and find additional revenue to balance the buddget.
In a crisis, Mr. Rohatyn said, the Municipal Assistance Corporation could provide hundreds of millions in cash for the city next year -- by refinancing bonds to stretch out the payment of current interest over many years -- even if this would simply be postponing debt.
City officials and analysts denounced Mr. Rohatyn's suggestion as a gimmick that harked back to the city's fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's -- borrowing to close deficits.
"The city has to balance its budget," said City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman. "Deficit financing is not the answer. It is a no-no."
Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by businesses, said, "We should have the courage to deal with our problems today instead of foisting them off on our children."
Mr. Rohatyn said, "I asked my board to simply think about it, whether we could participate in such a thing."
 
Bond Sale Due Next Week
 The remarks surprised city officials because they came in the same week that Standard & Poor's, the bond-rating agency, decided to reaffirm the city's A- bond rating after it had considered lowering it. The rating agency, while warning of potential problems ahead, found that the city was acting in a "fairly reasonable fashion" to close its budget gap.
City officials said they did not think Mr. Rohatyn's comments would hurt the city next week, when it plans to sell $950 million in tax-exempt and taxable bonds. The market for city bonds has improved slightly in the last few days, city officials said.
Both the Municipal Assistance Corporation and the Financial Control Board, formerly called the Emergency Financial Control Board, were created in 1975 to help the city through its last major fiscal crisis.
The corporation, headed by Mr. Rohatyn, sold bonds on the city's behalf at a time when it was shut out of the bond market. The board, headed by Governor Cuomo, monitors the city's fiscal health and can intervene in city government if the city is unable to borrow or runs a deficit of more than $100 million.
 
Confrontations in the Past
 Since 1984 the corporation has agreed to turn over several billion dollars in surplus funds, including savings from bond refinancings, to the city treasury. Over the years this has provoked some angry confrontations betweeen Mr. Rohatyn and former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who thought he wanted too much say on how the money was to be spent.
During the last mayoral campaign, Mr. Rohatyn supported Mr. Dinkins over Mr. Koch, and last year the corporation agreed to give the city $500 million in cash for immediate budget relief and $250 million more this year.
Last fall Mr. Rohatyn angrily denounced a labor settlement between the city and the teachers' union as one the city could not afford. When some labor leaders attacked him for interfering, he announced that he was stepping down as chairman of the assistance corporation.
But in January Governor Cuomo convinced him to stay, at least through the adoption of next year's city budget. At the time, Mr. Cuomo had grown increasingly alarmed over the city's fiscal's management, according to his aides.

HEADLINE: After Many Hours and Miles, L.I. Boy Is Rescued From Kidnappers

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
A 14-year-old boy from the North Shore of Long Island was rescued at dawn yesterday from a Queens apartment, 55 hours after two masked men wielding a gun barged into his family's house on Sunday night and kidnapped him.
Much of that time the boy was kept blindfolded in a closet in a small apartment in Ridgewood, Queens. Meanwhile, one kidnapper led the police and F.B.I. agents on an erratic journey -- by stolen car, subway, taxi and on foot -- through much of Queens and Manhattan. 
 Twice the kidnapper even drove back to the boy's home in Upper Brookville to negotiate with his parents and the police. The police let him go the first time in the hope that he would lead them to the boy. The second time they arrested him. The other suspect was seized at the Queens apartment.
 
'They Were Novices'
 "This is my fourth kidnapping case, and it's the most bizarre," said Inspector Donald White of the Nassau County Police Department.
The suspects, both Romanian immigrants, told the police that they were unemployed machinists in need of money to return to Romania. "Maybe it was that they were strange to this country," Inspector White said. "Definitely they were novices to the crime of kidnapping."
They were identified as Vasilica Parteni, 22, and Roberto Ciaprazi, 23, both of 617 Fairview Avenue in Ridgewood. They were charged with first-degree kidnapping, first-degree robbery and first-degree burglary.
The kidnapped boy, who was not harmed, was identified as William Chichester McClean IV, nicknamed Chi by his parents, Ferrel and William Chichester McClean III, both investment bankers in Manhattan. "All I can say is that we're happy our son's safe and that it's over," Mr. McClean told The Associated Press yesterday.
He was abducted about 8 P.M. on Sunday from the McClean home, a large, colonial-style house with green shutters and white awnings that sits atop a hill at the end of Mill River Road.
"Two men in ski masks walked into the house through an unlocked kitchen door," said Hank McCann, a spokesman for the Nassau police. "One was armed with a revolver.
"One of them said, 'We are taking the boy. We will contact you. Do not notify the media or the police or we will kill him,' " Mr. McCann added.
The kidnappers blindfolded the boy and forced him into the family's new, white Jeep, the police said. "They drove the Jeep 60, 70 yards and parked it, hidden away from the road in a neighbor's driveway, then got back in their own car with the kid and drove off," Mr. McCann said.
 
Tape-Recorded Message
 The McCleans did call the police. But only after 18 hours did the kidnappers call -- 2 P.M. on Monday. "They demanded $200,000 for the boy's release and said they would call back to give details on the delivery," Mr. McCann said. "Part of the call was a tape-recorded message from young Chi saying: 'Mom and Dad, I want to come home. Pay the money. I am alright.' "
For 27 hours the police and F.B.I. agents sat in the house with the parents, waiting for a phone call. Suddenly, a man in a ski mask again walked into the house through an unlocked door, Mr. McCann said. The police later identified the masked man as Mr. Parteni.
Detective Robert Ryder of the Old Brookville Police Department said the kidnapper "was cool and calculated, not scared at all."
"He said, 'If I don't get out of here, the kid is dead,' " Detective Ryder said. "He was holding all the cards, and he knew it."
Mr. McCann said: "The kidnapper declared, 'I am here for the ransom, and if you try to take off my mask or detain me, the boy will be killed.' The parents said, 'Let him have the money, we want our son back.' The man then put the money in a canvas gym bag, walked out and, for the second time, stole the white jeep."
 
Followed for Four Hours
 Then began a four-hour odyssey in which the kidnapper was followed by police officers and F.B.I. agents. It was unclear whether the kidnapper was always aware that he was being followed. A police official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said law-enforcement agents had attached an electronic tracking device to the Jeep before the man left. A helicopter also took part in the pursuit, the official said.
The suspect drove into Queens, circling back and forth between LaGuardia and Kennedy Airports. He parked the Jeep near the Long Island Rail Road terminal in Jamaica, walked to a nearby subway station and rode a train to Forest Park in mid-Queens. After wandering on foot near the park, he hailed a gyspy cab and ordered it to drive in a circuitous route that finally led to Fresh Pond Road and Myrtle Avenue in Ridgewood, the police said.
"He disappeared for about 15 minutes," Mr. McCann said. "We were all over the place. Suddenly he reappears, goes to a street phone, calls the McClean household and says, 'Get these cops away from me. Tell them to back off.' "
 
'I Want to Make a Deal'
 The man hailed a yellow cab, ordering it to drive on the Long Island Expressway through the Queens Midtown Tunnel into Manhattan, then doubling back to Queens. He then had the cab drive him to the Jeep in Jamaica.
"And he drove back to the McClean household," Mr. McCann said. "We watched him every step of the way. He went into the household again, unmasked, and said, 'I want to make a deal. I will give you back your son, unharmed, and we keep the money and go free.' "
"At that point, the Nassau police said, 'End of the line,' and placed him under arrest," Mr. McCann said.
Inside the Jeep, the police said, they found Mr. Parteni's wallet, which had his address -- 617 Fairview Avenue, Ridgewood.
About 6:30 A.M. yesterday, the police from Nassau County, Old Brookville and New York City as well as F.B.I agents surrounded the house on Fairview Avenue and rang the bell. "The accomplice opened the door and stepped out," Mr. McCann said, "and the boy came right behind him." The $200,000 was recovered.

HEADLINE: Bush Plan to Fight Infant Deaths Would Use Money Going to Poor

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Administration officials told Congress today that they intended to finance a proposal by President Bush to combat infant mortality in 10 cities by taking money from other health programs that serve pregnant women, poor children and the homeless.
In a letter to Congress, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said the Bush Administration planned to take $24 million from community health centers and $34 million from the existing Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant this year. 
 For next year, Dr. Sullivan said, the Administration plans to take $33 million from those two programs and shift it to the 10 cities with high infant mortality. In addition, the Administration would seek a separate appropriation of $139 million, for which no source has been specified. New budget procedures adopted last year set an overall limit on domestic spending, and increases in one program usually must be offset by cutbacks in others.
By redirecting Federal money to 10 cities with acute needs, the Administration hopes to "reduce the infant mortality rate in targeted communities by 50 percent," Dr. Sullivan said in his letter, which gave new details of the proposal mentioned in Mr. Bush's budget. Mr. Bush said the 10 cities would be chosen from among "cities with exceptionally high rates of infant mortality," and while there are some likely choices, the Government has not disclosed the selection criteria.
 
No Guarantee of Selection
 Washington, Detroit, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Baltimore and Memphis are among the big cities with high rates, but there is no guarantee they will be selected.
The plan immediately stirred concern among public health experts and state officials, who said Mr. Bush was taking money from underserved communities to pay for a high-profile initiative with strong political appeal.
Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, chairman of the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality, welcomed Mr. Bush's new attention to the problem of infant mortality, but said the President was "robbing Peter to pay Paul." Mr. Chiles has been chairman of the 16-member commission since shortly after its creation by Congress in 1986.
The Administration's plan contradicts a confidential recommendation from the White House Task Force on Infant Mortality, which last fall urged Mr. Bush to increase money for both community health centers and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant.
Administration officials said they recognized the merit in that recommendation but could not immediately find money to carry it out.
Catherine Hess, director of the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, which represents state officials, said the Administration was "taking funds for this new initiative from existing programs that already serve low-income pregnant women and infants."
"If infant mortality is such a priority, why not commit new resources to it, rather than just shifting funds from one program to another?" she asked.
 Some Federal health officials said they shared that concern. Others defended Mr. Bush's proposal as an exercise in setting priorities. "We are in the business of making tough decisions," said Kevin E. Moley, budget officer for the Department of Health and Human Services. "We have to make choices between some worthy projects and some that are more worthy."
In his State of the Union Message on Jan. 29, the President did not specifically mention infant mortality. But he said: "Good health care is every American's right and every American's responsibility. And so we are proposing an aggressive program of new prevention initiatives for infants, for children, for adults and for the elderly."
By definition, the nation's 550 community health centers care for "medically underserved populations." They receive Federal money under current law only if they serve an area with a high infant mortality rate and a high poverty rate.
Administration officials said they had originally considered asking some community health centers outside the 10 cities to give back some of the money they have already received, but abandoned that idea as too controversial. The money Mr. Bush proposes shifting would come from money already appropriated but not yet disbursed.
Dr. Sullivan said the money could be used to provide prenatal care and to discourage smoking, drinking and drug abuse by pregnant women.
David R. Hawkins, director of policy analysis at the National Association of Community Health Centers, said Mr. Bush's plan meant that "a poor sick infant in Seattle will not get care so that a poor sick infant in another city, like Chicago, can get care."
 
What About the Rural Areas?
 Lula Clara Dorsey, executive director of the Delta Health Center in Mound Bayou, Miss., said in a telephone interview: "By targeting 10 cities, you can reduce infant mortality in those places without a doubt. But what happens to places like rural Mississippi and rural Alabama that are not on the 10-city list? Infant mortality will increase in those places."
Governor Chiles, a Democrat, said, "The only difference between the current apportionment for infant mortality and this budget's new allowance is that instead of allowing all 50 states to receive their share of the money, now 10 cities must vie for desperately needed funds."
Members of Congress observed similar tradeoffs in other parts of Mr. Bush's budget request. Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said he was pleased to see that Mr. Bush had sought more money to run the unemployment insurance program, so people would not have to wait five or six weeks for benefits. But at the same time, he said, Mr. Bush is trying to eliminate the trade adjustment assistance program, which pays benefits to workers who lose jobs because of competition from foreign imports.
 
Centers Make a Contribution
 Numerous studies have concluded that community health centers make a substantial contribution to lowering infant mortality because they serve low-income people who would not otherwise receive prenatal, obstetric or pediatric care.
President Bush's budget, sent to Congress on Monday, says that "infant mortality is most severe in some of the nation's cities, several of which have infant mortality rates rivaling those of developing nations."
The budget also notes that the "mortality rate for black babies is more than twice the rate for white babies."
In 1989, Mr. Hawkins said, 10,000 babies were born to women under 16 years old. About 3,500 of those women received prenatal care in community health centers and had their babies delivered by doctors working for such centers, he said.
Of the 5.35 million people served each year by community health centers, 60 percent have annual incomes below the poverty level ($13,360 for a family of four last year). In addition, 30 percent of the patients have incomes between the poverty level and twice that amount.
Cornell Scott, executive director of the Hill Health Center in New Haven, which serves 12,000 people and is receiving $500,000 from the Federal Government this year, said: "There are more than 10 cities that have problems with infant mortality. If we are sincere about addressing the problem, we ought to increase the available resources and not just reallocate existing money."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Washington;
BAKER SKETCHES FUTURE GULF ROLE

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d sketched the Administration's postwar vision for the Persian Gulf for the first time today, suggesting it would require some continued American military role in the region and possibly international aid to rebuild Iraq's economy.
While Mr. Baker was not specific on this point, it would seem that any postwar reconstruction aid to Iraq would be conditioned on the removal of Saddam Hussein as President, something President Bush said Tuesday he would welcome as a result of the war.
 
Recovery, Not Revenge
 "No one should forget that for the second time in a decade the people of Iraq will be recovering from a disastrous conflict," Mr. Baker said in testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "The time of reconstruction and recovery should not be the occasion for vengeful actions against a nation forced to war by a dictator's ambition. The secure and prosperous future everyone hopes to see in the gulf must include Iraq." 
 Mr. Baker said that in the view of the Bush Administration, any postwar settlement would have to be based on five pillars. The first would be a new security arrangement among gulf countries, including Iraq and Iran, to stabilize the balance of power in the region and deter any nation from devouring its neighbor.
The second should be an arms control agreement, at least among supplier nations, that would constrain Iraq from rebuilding its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons plants, he said, and the third would be a program of economic reconstruction to ease tensions between the haves and have-nots in the Arab world.
The fourth element of a postwar settlement would be a renewed effort to settle Israeli conflicts with Palestinians and with Arab countries, to remove one of the main sources of instability in the region, Mr. Baker said, and the fifth would be a "comprehensive strategy" by the United States to reduce its dependence on imported oil.
Sketching the outlines of the Administration's approach to the postwar period -- which were drawn up in consultations involving the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department -- Mr. Baker emphasized that the exact policies adopted by Washington would depend greatly on how the gulf war ends.
"It would be irresponsible" not to begin thinking about the postwar order, he said, but "it would be premature and unwise for us to lay out a detailed blueprint for the postwar gulf, or for the region as a whole."
 
Different Messages
 In going even as far as he did today, Mr. Baker seemed to be speaking to several different audiences. To a Congress beginning to wonder whether the war might end with an American military victory followed by a political defeat, Mr. Baker seemed to be saying the Administration was going to do its best not to let that happen.
To the Iraqis, he seemed to be saying that the United States bears animosity not toward them as a people, but only toward Mr. Hussein, and that if he is removed, Washington and its allies could be very forthcoming. He thus spoke to the point made Tuesday by Mr. Bush, who said, "We do not seek Iraq's destruction, nor do we seek to punish the Iraqi people for the decisions and policies of their leaders."
To the Arab world, Mr. Baker seemed to be trying to say that Washington is not looking to impose a "pax Americana" in the Middle East, and that the United States would, in conjunction with the region's peoples, address other festering issues like the Arab-Israeli dispute after the war is over.
 
Optimism Versus Caution
 A certain tension between optimism and sobriety ran through Mr. Baker's words. That tension appears to be running through the Administration as a whole, with some officials believing that opportunities for peacemaking in the Middle East will abound after this war and others believing that the United States should limit itself to getting the Iraqis out of Kuwait and then coming home as fast as possible.
At times Mr. Baker's approach to a postwar Middle East seemed coldly realistic, based on very low expectations of what any outside power can do to reorder that part of the world. At other times it seemed almost naive, particularly when he spoke about working not simply for an end to the state of war between Israel and the Arabs, but for "real reconciliation based on enduring respect, tolerance and mutual trust."
He reminded the lawmakers that "modern history has shown that no single nation can long impose its will or remake the Middle East in its own image."
But he added, "I truly believe that there must be a way, working in consultation with all of the affected nations, to set a course that brings greater security for all and enduring peace."
 
Regional Bodies Cited
 Elaborating on his plan, Mr. Baker said the new security arrangement to stabilize the balance of power would have to be based on "the states of the gulf and regional organizations such as the Gulf Cooperation Council" that would take the "lead in building a reinforcing network of new and strengthened security ties" so no nation would feel free to devour its neighbor.
"No regional state should be excluded from these arrangements," he said, in a clear overture to Iran and the future Iraq. "Postwar Iraq could have an important contribution to play. And so could Iran as a major power in the gulu.f'
But Mr. Baker quickly added that outside powers would also have to play a role to make sure that borders are respected. He seemed to suggest that the United States would maintain its longstanding naval presence in the gulf, and forge separate security arrangements with various Arab states that would allow it to position war materiel on their soil and engage in regular joint military exercises.
He reiterated the President's commitment to remove all American ground forces from the gulf once Iraq is ousted from Kuwait. But he said there would be a transitional period immediately after the war, and suggested the possibility of a permanent ground force made up of local troops under the Gulf Cooperation Council or the United Nations.
 
Looking to Arms Control
 On the subject of arms control, Mr. Baker noted that five Middle Eastern countries had more main battle tanks than Britain or France. After the war, he said, the United States and other powers will have to ask not only how they can insure that Iraq never again acquires weapons of mass destruction, but also how to tighten "supply restraints on the flow of weapons and dual-use technology into the region."
Mr. Baker said efforts should also be made to rebuild Iraq economically, both to make it a stable and functioning state and to remove one of the main "sources of conflict" in the region -- a widespread feeling that the Arab oil countries are not sharing their wealth or investing it with their neighbors.
"It might be possible for a coalition of countries, using both local and external resources, to transform the outlook for the region, in expanding free trade and investment and assisting development and in promoting growth oriented economic policies," he said.
As for renewed efforts to solve the Arab-Israeli dispute, Mr. Baker emphasized the need for "real reconciliation," but added, "The course of this crisis has stirred emotions among Israelis and Palestinians that will not yield easily to reconciliation." If the parties themselves are really willing to move toward peace, he said, Washington will be there to help.

Briton Weighs Postwar Ideas
 LONDON, Feb. 6 (Special to The New York Times) -- The British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said today that he would fly to Egypt and Saudi Arabia this weekend to solicit ideas about security arrangements in the gulf after the end of the war.
"There's a pretty fair consensus that the main ideas have got to come from the region," he told a group of American correspondents tonight. "The whole instinct in Britain and the United States will be to bring the boys home as soon as possible. We don't imagine it will be possible to keep ground forces in the area."
"Naval and air forces, and prepositioned equipment, are a different thing," he said, but it would be up to the countries in the region to say whether they would be required.
The Foreign Secretary and other aides to Prime Minister John Major said today that the timing of an allied ground offensive to force Iraq out of Kuwait would depend on an assessment of how much the bombing campaign had weakened Iraq's ability to inflict heavy casualties.
Mr. Hurd, like other European officials, has emphasized the importance of seeking after the war to reach a settlement of the Palestinian problem, which in Britain's view would mean Israel's giving up the West Bank in exchange for an Arab commitment to peace.
The Foreign Secretary dismissed Iraq's announcement today that it was breaking off diplomatic relations with the United States and its allies in the war as "a pretty empty decision."

Why They Say The Bear Is Dead

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
IS it the beginning of the end of the bear market? Or is it a fool's rally that will fizzle with the next grim headline from the Persian Gulf or the next disappointing statistics from Washington?
Some leading market forecasters -- Steven G. Einhorn, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company, and Byron R. Wien, the market strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company, for example -- are declaring the bear market dead. A new bull is born, they proclaim. Of course, so does Joseph Granville, the flamboyant forecaster who in September was warning of a 1929-style crash and depression. 
 Mr. Wien observed: "The Standard & Poor's 500 is up from about 310 in January to more than 350 now -- in less than four weeks. I don't know how high it's going, but that is a good year's performance in a month."
Laggards have already missed part of this rally, if one measures the market's performance from Oct. 11, the date of its lowest point since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. More recently, "the Dow was at 2,475 just two days before the war broke out, and that was only 100 points above its October low," said Mr. Einhorn, adding: "The bear market ended, and it ended in October. But this is a bull market, and in a bull, there is a lot more to go than just the 12 to 13 percent we've had."
The most commonly cited reason for the investor enthusiasm is the recent efforts by the Federal Reserve to spur the economy and increase the available money supply through the easing of interest rates. "The market has a rule: never fight the Fed," Mr. Wien said.Some technical analysts, who monitor the market by studying its mathematical relationships, have also declared an end to the bear market. Some, for example, define the arrival of a bull market as that point when the major market barometers -- the Dow, the S.& P. 500, the Dow averages of transportation and utility stocks -- have advanced beyond their average level for the previous 200 days. Last week, those market barometers did just that, said Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
One factor supporting the bullish case is the amount of cash in the hands of institutional money managers. At the end of December, for example, stock mutual funds had 11.4 percent of their assets in cash. That was down from a record 12.9 percent at the end of October, shortly after the market's pivot point, but it is well above normal levels.
Most institutional investors -- pension funds, big mutual funds, insurance companies -- would find it hard to put all their cash to work quickly. Thus, they are desperate for advice about when to jump aboard, said Mr. Miller. "Institutions don't feel they can afford to fall behind, especially since their performance has suffered so much in the past few quarters," Mr. Miller said. "They see this market as a moving train that you don't have the luxury of missing."
The reason is simple, said Mr. Wien of Morgan Stanley. "It is usually in the first few weeks of a bull market that you get the fastest and most dramatic improvement," Mr. Wien said.
There are other esoteric indicators that suggest a bull market has arrived, said Richard Eakle, a technician who is president of Eakle Associates in Fair Haven, N.J. He has calculated the year-over-year rate of change for the S.& P. 500 for each month, and compared that with its average change for the previous year. Tracing that historic pattern and comparing it with the market's subsequent behavior, Mr. Eakle found there were certain points when this freshly minted indicator signaled that it was time to buy stocks -- that is, times when the market was beginning a long climb upward. Such signals were rare, Mr. Eakle found. But one occurred, by his calculation, at the end of January.
What is ahead? If there is cautious agreement that the bear market may be dead, there is little consensus among leading strategists about the path the bull market may take. Mr. Einhorn is unequivocal: "The market is going to be a very pleasant place to be for the next 12 to 15 months."
Mr. Wien agrees that the market is heading higher but foresees a roller-coaster market that soars and then falls back as investors conclude that stock prices have outpaced reality.
Mr. Miller is the most cautious of the lot. While he conceded that "the burden of proof is clearly on the bears," he said the rebirth of the bull market rests firmly -- and exclusively -- on faith in the ability of the Federal Reserve to get the nation's money supply to grow at a pace that will encourage investment. "But this economy is showing some sick reflections of 1929-30, and the Fed may not be able to get the job done this time," he warned.
And the day the market begins to suspect that the Federal Reserve is powerless to push liquidity into a sluggish economy, he added, is likely to be the day that investment gurus will start debating about when the bull died.

Geffen Sells His 10.6% Stake In Parent of WWOR-TV

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
David Geffen, the record company executive, said yesterday that he had sold his 10.6 percent interest in Pinelands Inc., the company that owns WWOR-TV, the independent New Jersey television station, for about $30 million.
The station had been part of MCA Inc., of which Mr. Geffen was the largest shareholder. When Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Company bought MCA last year, it spun off the television station into a separate company. United States law forbids foreigners from owning more than 20 percent of an American broadcast property. 
 Mr. Geffen, who has made hundreds of millions of dollars from recent deals, said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he sold about 1.7 million shares of Pinelands at prices ranging from $17.50 to $18.50 a share. No reason was given for the sale. He declined to comment on the transaction when reached by telephone.
The stock was sold in the open market late Tuesday by Morgan Stanley & Company. It could not be immediately determined if one company or person had bought Mr. Geffen's stake.
WWOR, based in Secaucus, N.J., broadcasts on Channel 9 in the New York market.
Given the softness of the television business because of a weak advertising market, the most logical buyers of a stake in Pinelands, or possibly of the whole operation, would be companies that already own stations and that would want another one in a major urban market. That list would include Chris-Craft Industries, Paramount Communications and the Walt Disney Company.
However, there may not be many buyers right now. Industry experts said they doubted that either Paramount or Disney were buyers of the stock, in part because the price for the entire company is considered high.
 
Pinelands' Major Shareholders
 Pinelands' major shareholders are Gabelli & Company, a New York investment firm headed by Mario J. Gabelli; a variety of trusts controlled by Lew Wasserman, the chairman of MCA, and Capital Guardian Research Group, the Los Angeles-based investment firm. Gabelli and Capital each hold about 5 percent of the stock.
Although Mr. Geffen had indicated in the last few months that he might increase his stake in Pinelands, Mr. Gabelli said yesterday that he had been skeptical of such a move.
"We felt that there was no intention that Geffen was going to buy Pinelands," Mr. Gabelli said. "It did not make economic sense as a stand-alone purchase."
Shares of Pinelands closed at $18 yesterday, up 37.5 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Howard Stark, an investment banker who specializes in broadcast properties, said the station had cash flow of about $30 million in the first nine months of 1990 on revenues of about $140 million. That would put the cash flow for the year at $40 million. If the station were sold for 10 times cash flow, it would be worth about $400 million.

HEADLINE: Insurance Giants No Longer Ask To Be All Things to All People

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

 BODY:
Some of the oldest and best-known American insurance companies have decided to abandon their all-things-to-all-people approach in favor of a narrower focus. The change could substantially affect rates for many kinds of insurance, the prices of insurance stocks and the economy in the Northeast, where the largest insurance companies are based.
Stung by losses or shrinking profits in many of their businesses, the insurers are sharply cutting back on or abandoning entire areas of insurance, selling unrelated businesses, closing offices and laying off workers. 
 Not long ago, for instance, the Aetna Life and Casualty Company announced that it would no longer sell individual health insurance policies nationwide. It has also stopped selling automobile and homeowner policies in seven states and hinted that it might leave those businesses.
 
Cutbacks in Many Areas
 The Cigna Corporation has withdrawn from insuring private automobiles as well as from insuring banks against employee fraud. It is also cutting back in workers' compensation and professional liability insurance.
The Travelers Corporation has sold its mutual funds company and announced a withdrawal from personal insurance -- individual policies dealing with homes, cars and health -- in nine states.
"There was a time when this company wanted to write every type of policy in all 50 states," said Walter Fitzgibbon, chief actuary of Aetna. "We just don't want to do that any longer."
In scaling back, the insurers are rapidly bringing to a close the lengthy era of the "multiline insurer," the company that attempted to sell everything from life policies for newlyweds to fire insurance for homeowners to liability coverage for corporations.
 
Subsidizing Losses
 Some economists say that because of the change, insurers will no longer need to hold prices artificially high in some lines of coverage -- health insurance, for example -- to subsidize losses suffered in, say, automobile insurance.
But others say that the withdrawal from various markets by insurers will allow competitors to raise prices and leave an increasing number of people unable to find affordable insurance, forcing them into government-run insurance pools.
The sharp reductions in insurance-industry employment resulting from the increased specialization -- for example, cuts in middle managers like those made in recent years by many industrial companies -- could hurt the Northeast economy. Many multiline insurers have their headquarters in the New York (Continental, Chubb), Hartford (Aetna, Travelers, ITT Hartford) and Philadelphia (Cigna) areas.
The multiline insurers collectively employ 400,000 people in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.
Aetna said in October that it would lay off 2,600 employees, or 5 percent of its United States work force, and subject each of its remaining businesses to a profitability test -- retaining only those businesses that passed. "We must have an expectation that over time the business will not only become significant but produce an adequate return -- 15 percent," said Edmund S. Kelly, president of Aetna's employee benefits division.
 
Questions Remain
 As industry profitability improves because of the increasing specialization, investors in the stocks of multi line insurers could expect improvement on the weak returns they have seen in recent years, analysts say. (A number of other insurance giants, including Prudential, based in Newark, and Metropolitan Life and Equitable Life Assurance, based in New York, are owned by their policyholders rather than investors and in any case are already specialists, typically in life and health insurance.)
But questions remain about whether any of these companies can successfully become specialists. It is unclear whether the multiline insurers can sell their unwanted divisions at anything but unacceptably large losses. And some experts wonder whether the industry's top executives will have the resolve to make the changes. The restructuring that has begun among the multiline insurers could require large layoffs at companies that have had unwritten policies of lifetime employment.
"The cultural adjustments needed are staggering," said Robert Posnak, chairman of the insurance practice at Ernst & Young, the big accounting and consulting firm. "Given the paternalistic history of this business, it will be very hard for any of these giant companies to make the needed changes."
Insurance companies, many of which began in the 19th century as fire insurers, diversified into many lines at the turn of the century as a way of countering the cyclical nature of various lines of insurance. Property and casualty insurance, for example, is notorious for its ups and downs in prices and profits. Just as industrial conglomerates sprang up in the 1960's as a way to smooth earnings, so too insurance executives reasoned that losses in the property-casualty business could be offset by profits in, say, life insurance.
 
Medical Costs Cited
 But now, many of the businesses in which the multiline insurers compete have gone bad at once, and so the insurers are finding it harder to offset one business's losses with another's profits.
In auto insurance, the problems have included rapidly rising medical and car-repair costs. In liability insurance for business, the troubles have included competitive price cutting and large jury awards. In life insurance, increasing rates of return paid to policyholders and problems with life insurers' investments, most notably real estate, have cut deeply into profits. In workers' compensation insurance, regulations have held down premiums and profits.
As a result, many multiline insurers are earning less than 10 percent a year for their investors, barely more than they could earn on a risk-free investment like a Treasury bill.
Insurers are also being forced to streamline by the increasing militance of their institutional investors and by the growing worry of policyholders over solvency. Insurance company failures fell to 35 in 1990 after reaching a 1980's peak of 44 in 1989. Still, industry executives believe that the best way to alleviate public concern is to generate higher profits -- and quickly.
"The old modus operandi has obviously not worked," said Miron Picoult, the insurance analyst at Oppenheimer Inc.
 
Differences Are Widening
 The shifts among multiline insurers are already widening the differences among the players. Aetna, Travelers and Cigna are making major pushes in group health insurance by setting up "managed care" networks of doctors and hospitals for clients trying to contain costs. Chubb continues to focus on the upper end of the market -- large, blue-chip companies and wealthy individuals. The Continental Corporation, having sold its life- and health-insurance businesses, is now purely a property-and-casualty insurer focusing on mid-sized manufacturers and shipping concerns.
Among other changes: Crum & Forster, the insurance subsidiary of the Xerox Corporation, has been shrinking its workers' compensation division. The Lincoln National Corporation has sold its reinsurance division.
Some insurers, such like Cigna, are trying wholesale withdrawals from certain lines. Others, including Aetna, are pulling out only in certain states, although two states, Massachusetts and New Jersey, are resisting such "cherry picking" by insisting that insurers sell all or nothing. Still others, like Crum & Forster, are reducing the amount they sell of certain lines across the country.
Some economists argue that it is always positive for consumers and investors when an industry applies more discipline. High-cost operations are weeded out and leaner players can offer better prices.
 
A Possible Void
 "An industry that has been portrayed by many as sleepy is waking up with a vengeance," said George G. C. Parker, who teaches the course in financial institutions at the Stanford Business School. "This restructuring, while painful to insurers, could be beneficial to consumers."
Others are not convinced. For example, as Aetna, Travelers, Cigna, Crum & Forster and other insurers scale back their money-losing auto-insurance operations, one possibility is that no other insurer will find the business sufficiently attractive to fill the void.
"You could get into availability problems," said William Meehan, a senior insurance specialist at McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm. "More and more people would go uninsured; more and more people would be forced into state-run insurance pools."
Other experts see low-cost, high-volume operators like State Farm and Allstate rushing in to pick up the business. But this, carried to the extreme, could have a troublesome consequence: "If a State Farm or an Allstate got up to 30 percent in terms of market share, you'd begin to see something approaching a classic oligopoly," said David Cummins, a professor of insurance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Jordan;
Jordanian Ends Neutrality, Assailing Allied War Effort

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Evoking Islamic faith and Arab honor, King Hussein of Jordan abandoned his professed neutrality in the Persian Gulf war tonight to align himself with Iraq.
The allied war effort, he declared, is "against all Arabs and all Muslims and not against Iraq alone" and is intended to assert "foreign hegemony" in the Middle East. 
 The King's 30-minute address to the nation on television represented his most unequivocal pro-Iraqi statement of the crisis and seemed a direct rebuttal of an appeal to him by President Bush for a public statement of understanding for America's position in the war.
Without once referring to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, the Jordanian leader seemed to abandon his previous professions of neutrality in the conflict, saying he saluted Iraq's people and army "as they defend us all and raise the banner that says: God is great." His speech echoed themes routinely broadcast by Iraq.
 
Talk of a Cease-Fire
 The true intention of the Western allies, the King said, is to "destroy Iraq and reorganize the area in a manner far more dangerous to our people than the Sykes-Picot agreement," which split the Middle East into areas of French and British spheres of influence after the First World War. The mere mention of the British-French agreement is highly emotive in the Arab world because it symbolizes dominance and manipulation by foreigners not of the Islamic faith.
The King laced his speech with references to pan-Arab nationalism and urged Arabs to demand a cease-fire and negotiations.
"Let us bring this war to an end," he said. "The starting point is immediate and serious work to make the alliance accept a cease-fire in preparation for a responsible dialogue between the antagonists, an Iraqi-American dialogue and an Arab-Arab dialogue that resorts to reason and balances interests against international legitimacy, the legitimacy of security, justice, peace and equality."
He seemed to be addressing his own domestic constituency, more than half of which is composed of fervently pro-Iraqi Palestinians, and to be signaling renewed support to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. But the reasons behind the timing of the address were unclear.
 
Western Diplomats Surprised
 The speech took Western diplomats by surprise since many had argued that the King would seek to maintain a position of neutrality so as to carve out a mediator's position and seek Western economic benevolence at a time of crisis.
In Arab political terms, the King also seemed to abandon the caution by which he has ruled as a frequently pro-Western figure in this troubled region for 37 years, criticizing both Egypt and Saudi Arabia for their roles in the Western-led alliance.
"This war is a war against all Arabs and all Muslims and not against Iraq alone," he said, urging Arabs and Muslims to support Iraq against the "fierce war imposed on brotherly Iraq."
Earlier today, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said the United States was not seeking to destabilize Jordan. Many Jordanians have suggested just that because of recent United States pronouncements urging all Americans to leave the country as soon as possible and suggesting complicity between Jordanian truck drivers bringing oil from Iraq and Iraqi military transporters in western Iraq.
Allied warplanes have launched sustained bombing raids on the main highway through western Iraq, apparently striking at military vehicles suspected of carrying Scud-B missile spares, but also killing eight Jordanian truck drivers and wrecking more than 35 tanker-trucks.
"There were new attempts to deprive us of our needs of oil and that was one way of imposing sanctions against us for no reason except our basic position" of neutrality, the King said. Jordan, he said, is "not willing to dance to the tune others play without being able to freely express our opinion, which we will not give up."
"If the battle is imposed on us we will be up to it," the King said.
 
New Sources of Oil Sought
 He evoked his family dynasty as the Hashemite descendants of the Prophet Mohammed, a dynasty that fought bitter disputes with the ruling Saudi family in the 1920's.
"This is a cry from a Hashemite Arab," he said, "Let us join our efforts to stop this tragedy and to save the people of Iraq from what is planned for it and to end this war."
The uncharacteristically virulent speech and the King's public embrace of unusually radical views coincided with a deepening threat of economic disruption here.
Jordan's main oil supply route through western Iraq has become so perilous that the country is receiving only a fraction of its usual supplies, raising the possibility of severe shortages of both fuel and electric power from oil-powered generators. The losses have deepened a profound sense of grievance that this small kingdom is being punished by the West in general and the United States in particular for a predicament over which it has no control.
 
A Mistake, Bush Says
 
By Reuters
President Bush yesterday rejected Jordan's call for a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war and said King Hussein was making a mistake by aligning his country more closely with Iraq.
Mr. Bush, responding to the Jordanian leader's speech earlier in the day, told reporters en route to New York that the United States had not exceeded the United Nations mandate to force Iraq out of Kuwait. "I'm afraid that we have a major disagreement on that," Mr. Bush said. "It's not true,
"We've tried to make clear with Jordan that we have no argument with Jordan," he said. "I think they made a mistake to align themselves so closely to Saddam Hussein against the rest of the world."

HEADLINE: Bush Is Confident Economy Will Rebound

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
President Bush, elected on a platform of peace and prosperity only to find himself plunged into war and recession, promised the business community last night that the economy would overcome "temporary disturbances and short-term setbacks."
"While our economy may be beset by difficulty, it should not be beset by doubt," Mr. Bush told business executives at a dinner of the Economic Club at the New York Hilton in midtown Manhattan. 
 In a speech upbeat in tone but short on specifics, Mr. Bush tried to reassure the business community with predictions that "our best days are before us."
No President wants to take the blame for a recession and Mr. Bush is no exception. He asserted that a slowing American economy had been pushed over the edge into recession by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
 
Shock of Invasion
 "When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, it was a shock to the world's conscience," and business and consumer confidence fell, the President said.
But in response to questions after his speech Mr. Bush forecast that the recession would be shallow and that "in a couple of quarters, we'll come out of this and we'll have a robust economy." In support of that forecast, he pointed to the recent strong rally in the stock market and said it indicated pessimism was on the decline.
Mr. Bush's trip to New York was his first visit outside Washington unrelated to the military since the United State-led force attacked Iraq three weeks ago.
The President arrived at the hotel in a 40-car motorcade from Newark International Airport amid tightened security precautions that included 1,500 plainclothes and uniformed officers guarding his route and sharpshooters positioned on rooftops, the police said. About 3,500 antiwar protesters staged a noisy demonstration outside the hotel and 10 were arrested, but mostly for blocking traffic, the police said.
In his speech, Mr. Bush acknowledged that the war, the savings and loan crisis and the recession "haven't helped a bit" in controlling the deficit that has burdened the nation. But he promised that with the bipartisan budget agreement in place, the deficit would be "virtually eliminated" by 1995.
Mr. Bush said the Administration would also try to spur economic growth by scaling back on "counter-productive" Government regulations, providing incentives to promote private savings and "job-creating investments" and putting Federal money into education, public works and space technology.
Asked about whether the so-called peace dividend that had been hoped for as the Cold War with the Soviet Union ended could still materialize, the President said defense spending was reduced in the budget he submitted to Congress this week. But he joked that he had been brought up to believe that dividends were paid out of profits, and he noted: "We're operating at a three-hundred-and-some-jillion-dollar deficit, so we're not in exactly a dividend-paying mode."
The President voiced optimism that the stalled Uruguay round of trade talks would be concluded successfully but he added that both Japan and Germany "have got to give us access to markets." He said he hoped that a victory in the gulf would add to the United States' credibility in those talks and perhaps make Japan and Germany more willing to compromise.
 
Must Avoid Extreme Measures
 In his speech the President also somewhat defensively continued to reject suggestions, heightened since the war, that he propose conservation measures and strategies to make the country less dependent on foreign oil.
"Some will argue that reducing our energy vulnerability is not enough, and that we should embark upon more drastic measures designed to achieve total energy independence," he said. "The reality is that we are a long way from total energy independence. We must avoid unwise and extreme measures that would seriously hurt American consumers, American jobs and American industries."

Kodak Posts Improved Earnings

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
The Eastman Kodak Company, best known as a producer of photographic film, yesterday reported strong earnings for the fourth quarter and year, despite a $564 million after-tax charge to settle its patent-infringement case with the Polaroid Corporation. Most of the quarterly growth came from overseas operations.
"Despite a sluggish U.S. economy, 1990 was clearly a recovery year for Kodak," Kay R. Whitmore, the chairman, said in a statement. "Significant factors contributing to higher earnings were gains in manufacturing productivity and the favorable effects of foreign currency rate changes." 
 He said the company expected "good gains in sales, with acceleration expected later in the year, as economic conditions improve and the impact of new products is felt."
 
Higher Costs Foreseen
 But the forecast warned of higher costs for advertising, research and development and plant start-ups, which could hold down profitability. "These investments in the Kodak brand, in innovation and technology will place us in an advantaged position when economic recovery comes," the statement said.
Wall Street was not impressed, though. On the New York Stock Exchange, on a day when the market roared ahead, Kodak's shares lost $2.25 each, to $44. The shares fell after release of the earnings, which were slightly below expectations.
Analysts said Kodak officials had told them that estimates that the company would earn $4.25 a share this year were too high, and also cited disappointment with the 1990 result.
"The stock had run up in anticipation of the earnings, and it was overpriced," said David Presson of Edward D. Jones & Company. The closing price of $46.25 on Tuesday was the highest since October 1989.
Kodak's year-to-year comparisons were affected by the one-time costs of the settlement in 1990 and an $875 million charge in 1989 reflecting the costs of restructuring.
 
Earnings at $326 Million
 In the quarter, the company earned $326 million, or $1.01 a share, compared with a loss of $60 million. Its sales totaled $5.15 billion, up 5.5 percent from $4.88 billion.
For the year, earnings totaled $703 million, or $2.17 a share, up 32.8 percent from $529 million, or $1.63 a share. Kodak's sales totaled $18.90 billion, up slightly from $18.39 billion.
A Federal judge imposed a penalty of $909 million on Kodak last year after the company had been found guilty of violating Polaroid's patents on instant photography. The award was subsequently reduced to $888 million, which produced the $564 million charge after taxes.
Overseas sales increased 11.2 percent, to $2.3 billion, while domestic sales rose 1 percent, to $2.8 billion. For the year, domestic sales declined 1.8 percent, to $10.1 billion, while international sales rose 8.5 percent, to $8.8 billion.
Earnings of the company's imaging, or photography, division totaled $425 million in the quarter, compared with $306 million before restructuring costs and an actual $94 million. Kodak said higher film sales and prices overseas were responsible for the gain.
Kodak's information, or copier, sector posted a loss of $61 million in the quarter, compared with a profit of $28 million before the one-time costs. The company said higher costs were to blame for the earnings decline.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises By 42.57, To 2,830.94

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks rallied briskly yesterday for the third day in a row as investors scrambled to pour more money into what many on Wall Street see as the start of a new bull market.
From the blue chips on the New York Stock Exchange to the smaller, lesser-known issues on the American Stock Exchange and in the over-the-counter market, stocks moved sharply higher as banks, insurance companies and mutual funds entered the market. 
 Although some money managers were already sounding warnings of speculative excesses and more earnings disappointments, the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 42.57 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,830.94.
 
Highest Close Since August
 This was the highest close for the Dow since Aug. 2, the day Iraq invaded Kuwait -- when the average closed at 2,864.60 -- and its first close above 2,800 since Aug. 3.
Trading soared to 276.9 million shares, only slightly less than 290.6 million the day before. In a decidedly bullish ratio approaching three to one, 1,222 Big Board stocks advanced while only 449 declined. And 173 stocks, including Merck, I.B.M. and International Paper, hit new highs.
The Dow now stands only 168 points away from its all-time high in July, when it came within an inch of 3,000. And now, some of Wall Street's leading forecasters are declaring the bear market dead. [Page D12.]
Yesterday's disappointment was Kodak, which slumped 2 1/4, to 44, although it reported fourth-quarter profits of $326 million. Analysts said the profit was less than expected.
 
Impetus From the Fed
 One reason investors are jumping into the market is because everyone is doing it. But the rather late conclusion by the Federal Reserve Board that the time has come for action to bring down interest rates is generally regarded as the main reason.
Both the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks and the Amex's market-value index jumped almost 2 percent, or the equivalent of a little more than 50 Dow points. The Nasdaq composite index of O-T-C stocks climbed 45 Dow points.
The Dow transportation index climbed more than 2 percent, with Delta Air Lines ahead 2 1/2, to 72 1/8; UAL up 2 5/8, to 136 1/2, and gains of a point of more by AMR, Airborne Freight, Southwest Airlines, Burlington Northern, Xtra and Union Pacific.
Interest-sensitive stocks continued to gain, although at a slower pace. BankAmerica rose 5/8, to 32 5/8, in heavy trading. CNA surged 3 1/2, to 78; AIG 2 1/2, to 88; Chubb 1 3/8, to 63 5/8, and Marsh & McLennan 1 3/4, to 76 3/4.
Chemical stocks, which would be a big beneficiary of an economic upturn, rose almost across the board. Monsanto, which forecast a profit rebound, jumped 4, to 57, in strong trading. ARCO Chemical rose 2 1/4, to 38 3/4, and Du Pont added 1 3/4, to 37.
Technology stocks also moved sharply higher in heavy trading. I.B.M. rose 1 3/8, to 129 7/8, after hitting a new high for the year of 130. Honeywell rose 1 3/4, to 51 1/4, while Digital Equipment tacked on 2 1/2, to 72 7/8. Microsoft rose 4 1/2, to 105 3/4, and Intel rose 2, to 50, both in heavy trading. Compaq Computer, which rose as high as 71 3/8, fell 2, to 69 1/8.
International Paper, a leader in the forestry group, rose 2 1/8, to 61 3/4, after touching a new high of 62 1/4. Kimberly-Clark, which hit a new high of 87 3/8, rose 1 1/8, to 87.
On a cautionary note, William S. Stack, chief investment officer for the Lexington Management Corporation, with $2.5 billion in investments, said: "The market's a little ahead of itself because we still have disappointing earnings ahead. It's telling us that the recession's over but it isn't."
Asked if he was putting any more money into the market, he replied, "Not lately; we think the market's too hot and we'll see better prices."
New data suggest that the enormous flow of money into the market has come in just the last few days. Indata, the weekly service based in Stamford, Conn., said that 59 mutual fund clients held 10.8 percent of their assets in cash as of Jan. 18, but that the total fell to 10.3 percent by Jan. 25, suggesting that $678 million -- or roughly $135 million a day -- poured into the market in one week.
But by Jan. 31, Indata said, cash was 10.4 percent of assets, or more than $2 billion, and money managers had not spent any through that period. As a result, the heavy inflow may have come between Jan. 31 and now.
Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said heavy computerized buying lifted the Dow 43 points yesterday. The New York Stock Exchange said such trading was 17 percent of the volume, or more than 30 million shares a day, in the week ending Jan. 18. The week before, it accounted for 10.1 percent, or 14.3 million shares daily.

Tokyo Stocks Close Higher
 TOKYO, Thursday, Feb. 7 (REUTERS) -- Japanese stock prices rose modestly today after Wall Street's strong gains on Wednesday. The Nikkei index of 225 issues picked up 152.39 points, or 0.64 percent, to close at 24,104.43. On Wednesday, the Nikkei gained 130.47 points.

HEADLINE: Planners' Vision of Newark Arts Center

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Feb. 6

 BODY:
A comprehensive master plan for a $200 million arts complex near Newark's troubled central business district was made public today by the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.
As the state's governor and the city's mayor pledged their support during a news conference, the planners announced an ambitious blueprint for using an arts complex as a device to stimulate growth in a downtown area that has undergone something of a revival after suffering major losses in population and employment over the past several decades. The plan calls for a four-building, Lincoln Center-like arts plaza, and also sought to establish planning guidelines for a new cultural district that would unite Newark's disparate downtown area for the first time in its history. 
 "My presence here is intended to be a reassurance that the state is making a full commitment to this program," said Gov. Jim Florio in an interview. His attendance at the news conference gave the support of the Democratic Governor to a project originally endorsed by a Republican, Gov. Thomas H. Kean, in 1987.
The Governor, who recently announced deep cuts in government across the state, said his commitment to the project was firm. He referred to $20 million in low-interest state bonds that he pledged to buy a 12-acre tract and do site reconstruction. The state will buy the land and lease it back to the arts center for 99 years.
In the first phase of development, scheduled for completion for the 1995-96 cultural season, $70 million will be needed for a multi-use hall, plus another $70 million for site work, including the construction of a plaza and the refurbishment of a 1,100-space parking garage. The second phase of the plan, the construction of a concert hall, is budgeted at $60 million and scheduled for completion in 1998.
So far, New Jersey's business community has pledged $33 million toward the completion of the arts center. In addition to the $20 million pledged by Governor Florio, the Federal Government has committed $1.2 million toward planning, design and construction, said to Lawrence P. Goldman, the president of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. Mr. Goldman said the remainder would come from private contributions and Federal, state, county and city sources.
The master plan, in preparation for more than a year, was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and James Stewart Polshek & Partners. It envisions an arts center consisting of a 2,700-seat multi-purpose hall in a building that also houses a 300-seat experimental theater. A second concert hall, with 2,400 seats, would be the home of the New Jersey Symphony.
The complex would have an open plaza comparable in size to Lincoln Center's, and would include two office and residential buildings, bringing leasing and investment revenues to the center.
The 12-acre site for the center is to be part of a 50-acre cultural district facing Newark's waterfront.
If the city approves -- and Mayor Sharpe James said yesterday that he supported the cultural district plan -- the area would be zoned to create ordered development, establishing uniform lighting and streetscape standards, and providing for shops, cafes, restaurants, promenades and pedestrian malls.
 
What They Don't Want
 "The Newark waterfront is destined to develop, and when it does, we want to keep it from becoming Stamford, Conn.," said Mr. Goldman. "There, you have superblocks lined by parking garages, where there is no human scale, and consequently you see no people. We do not intend to miss the opportunity to make the cultural district a place where people like to be."
In November, the arts center appointed Barton Myers, a 56-year-old professor of architecture at the University of California at Los Angeles, to design the art center's $70-million multi-use performance hall, which would be home to the New Jersey Symphony until the concert hall is constructed, and would be suitable for theater, dance, opera and pop and ethnic musical presentations.
The multi-use hall is to be on a two-acre site at Park Place and Saybrook Place, across from Military Park in downtown Newark. The arts center's site slopes down from Military Park toward the Passaic River, and includes the knoll upon which Newark's Puritan founders first set foot in 1666.
The master plan specifies that 40 percent of the 12 acres be devoted to private commercial development, concentrated in two buildings. "The arts center will try to capture the value that cultural assets bring to an area," said Mr. Goldman.
 
Profiting From Success
 He said that Lincoln Center did not benefit in revenues from the office and residential buildings that sprang up around it, but that he hoped the Newark center, in accommodating such development on its own land, would profit as has Carnegie Hall after building Carnegie Tower, and the Museum of Modern Art after building Museum Tower.
"In this way, the arts center says to donors, 'We will be entrepreneurial in helping ourselves,' " said Mr. Goldman. "If Lincoln Center had known it would be so successful in 1958, this is exactly what it would have done."
The master plan calls for the realignment of Mulberry Street and Center Street to create "a lively giant outdoor living room where people will feel at home," said Marilyn Jordan Taylor, a partner at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.
On the waterfront at Center Street, the plan envisions a hotel and residential complex, as well as a marina, retail shops and a riverside esplanade, similar to that at the World Financial Center.
 
Commercial Point of View
 Currently 55,000 people travel to jobs each day in the sprawling downtown business enclaves in Newark, Mr. Goldman said. "Some people consider them to be office workers, but we see them as ticket buyers," he said.
The master plan, Mr. Goldman said, will be the bridge between the three disparate areas of Newark's downtown: the building clusters built in the 1920's, the 1950's and the 1970's and 1980's.
 It joins together many of the city's cultural and business landmarks and would link the Ironbound section and Pennsylvania Station in the south with Military Park and Washington Park in the north. Facing Washington Park are the Newark Public Library and the Newark Museum on Washington Street, with its recent $21 million reconstruction by the architect Michael Graves.
The master plan envisions the construction of a tree-lined promenade along Newark's obsolete waterfront that would permit pedestrians to stroll from Pennsylvania Station along the margin of the Passaic River to the arts center site.

HEADLINE: Safer Banks

 BODY:
Making banks safe. That's what the Treasury Department's proposed overhaul of the banking system would help accomplish if Congress goes along. Despite some imperfections, the plan incorporates the ingredients needed to propel American banking soundly into the 21st century.
Congress ordered the review of the banking system in the aftermath of the $500 billion bailout of savings and loan institutions. The task was to restructure the industry so that banks could prosper without risking another bailout. The Treasury report meets that challenge intelligently with two fundamental recommendations. 
 First, it proposes allowing diversified investments. Banks would be allowed to open branches across the country and offer their customers insurance, mutual funds and securities underwriting. And banks could be bought by commercial and industrial concerns, providing a desperately needed infusion of capital. In each case, the plan builds in safeguards against misuse of federally insured deposits.
The purpose of such diversification is not to promote high-risk ventures but to dilute the risk of bad investments. Savings and loan institutions went bankrupt because, in the main, they were confined to high-risk real estate loans in states where they were based. When the real estate market in Texas collapsed, so did the S.& L.'s there. If they had included branch offices in Florida and Oregon, they would not have been as vulnerable.
Second, Treasury calls for mandatory intervention. The plan would require regulators to intervene once bank reserves begin to slip. Currently they are sometimes permitted to stop struggling banks from paying out dividends or making new loans. Under the Treasury plan, such intervention would become mandatory.
The far-reaching proposals are already exciting concern from special interests. Small bankers fear interstate banking; insurance agents and securities underwriters fear added competition. But these fears are exaggerated, and Congress would make a grave error were it to stifle competition to protect local fiefs.
 The proposal needs improvement. It would unwisely limit individuals to two federally insured accounts -- each for $100,000 -- at any one bank. Savvy individuals would spread out their money over many banks. But the plan fails to protect unsophisticated pensioners and, in the case of Freedom Bank in Harlem, charities and corporations. Even worse, any rule that makes depositors vulnerable to bank collapse could trip waves of panic withdrawals from sound banks that are the object of fearmongering rumors.
Equally misguided is the report's proposal to outlaw brokered deposits, which are federally insured accounts placed by brokerage houses on behalf of their customers. It is a myth that bidding for brokered deposits drove savings and loans into bankruptcy, according to George Benston of Emory University, a banking expert.
The chief error of the Treasury report is not that it goes too far, as some critics allege, but that it doesn't go far enough. Had the plan called for even higher capital requirements, in combination with mandatory regulatory response, it could have lifted all caps on federally insured deposits without fear.
But that's quibbling. Diversified investments and mandatory intervention are the main ticket to safe banks. The Treasury plan gets that exactly right.

HEADLINE: Despite It All, New York Takes Care of Business

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Forecasts that New York City will lose 90,000 jobs in 1991 are distressing, but concerned New Yorkers should also note signs of strength throughout the city's economy. International banking is an example. In 1974, there were 114 foreign banks in New York City; today, there are almost 300. In the last 36 months, 81 foreign banks have signed leases in New York City. As a result, New York's importance as a banking and financial center has skyrocketed.
New York City remains an extremely attractive place to conduct business and an indispensable venue for many companies, where a presence is not just convenient, but even required. The mass of talent -- in accounting, communications, law, finance -- is unavailable elsewhere. The numbers of decision makers, industrialists and financiers per square foot makes New York the world's most important center of commerce.
Short term, the recession will adversely affect employment in New York City. But nothing likely in the current economic cycle will change the fact that tens of thousands of companies are committed to New York because of the prestige they derive from operations here and access to resources available only in New York.

HEADLINE: Insurance Giants No Longer Ask To Be All Things to All People

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

 BODY:
Some of the oldest and best-known American insurance companies have decided to abandon their all-things-to-all-people approach in favor of a narrower focus. The change could substantially affect rates for many kinds of insurance, the prices of insurance stocks and the economy in the Northeast, where the largest insurance companies are based.
Stung by losses or shrinking profits in many of their businesses, the insurers are sharply cutting back on or abandoning entire areas of insurance, selling unrelated businesses, closing offices and laying off workers. 
 Not long ago, for instance, the Aetna Life and Casualty Company announced that it would no longer sell individual health insurance policies nationwide. It has also stopped selling automobile and homeowner policies in seven states and hinted that it might leave those businesses.
 
Cutbacks in Many Areas
 The Cigna Corporation has withdrawn from insuring private automobiles as well as from insuring banks against employee fraud. It is also cutting back in workers' compensation and professional liability insurance.
The Travelers Corporation has sold its mutual funds company and announced a withdrawal from personal insurance -- individual policies dealing with homes, cars and health -- in nine states.
"There was a time when this company wanted to write every type of policy in all 50 states," said Walter Fitzgibbon, chief actuary of Aetna. "We just don't want to do that any longer."
In scaling back, the insurers are rapidly bringing to a close the lengthy era of the "multiline insurer," the company that attempted to sell everything from life policies for newlyweds to fire insurance for homeowners to liability coverage for corporations.
 
Subsidizing Losses
 Some economists say that because of the change, insurers will no longer need to hold prices artificially high in some lines of coverage -- health insurance, for example -- to subsidize losses suffered in, say, automobile insurance.
But others say that the withdrawal from various markets by insurers will allow competitors to raise prices and leave an increasing number of people unable to find affordable insurance, forcing them into government-run insurance pools.
The sharp reductions in insurance-industry employment resulting from the increased specialization -- for example, cuts in middle managers like those made in recent years by many industrial companies -- could hurt the Northeast economy. Many multiline insurers have their headquarters in the New York (Continental, Chubb), Hartford (Aetna, Travelers, ITT Hartford) and Philadelphia (Cigna) areas.
The multiline insurers collectively employ 400,000 people in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.
Aetna said in October that it would lay off 2,600 employees, or 5 percent of its United States work force, and subject each of its remaining businesses to a profitability test -- retaining only those businesses that passed. "We must have an expectation that over time the business will not only become significant but produce an adequate return -- 15 percent," said Edmund S. Kelly, president of Aetna's employee benefits division.
 
Questions Remain
 As industry profitability improves because of the increasing specialization, investors in the stocks of multi line insurers could expect improvement on the weak returns they have seen in recent years, analysts say. (A number of other insurance giants, including Prudential, based in Newark, and Metropolitan Life and Equitable Life Assurance, based in New York, are owned by their policyholders rather than investors and in any case are already specialists, typically in life and health insurance.)
But questions remain about whether any of these companies can successfully become specialists. It is unclear whether the multiline insurers can sell their unwanted divisions at anything but unacceptably large losses. And some experts wonder whether the industry's top executives will have the resolve to make the changes. The restructuring that has begun among the multiline insurers could require large layoffs at companies that have had unwritten policies of lifetime employment.
"The cultural adjustments needed are staggering," said Robert Posnak, chairman of the insurance practice at Ernst & Young, the big accounting and consulting firm. "Given the paternalistic history of this business, it will be very hard for any of these giant companies to make the needed changes."
Insurance companies, many of which began in the 19th century as fire insurers, diversified into many lines at the turn of the century as a way of countering the cyclical nature of various lines of insurance. Property and casualty insurance, for example, is notorious for its ups and downs in prices and profits. Just as industrial conglomerates sprang up in the 1960's as a way to smooth earnings, so too insurance executives reasoned that losses in the property-casualty business could be offset by profits in, say, life insurance.
 
Medical Costs Cited
 But now, many of the businesses in which the multiline insurers compete have gone bad at once, and so the insurers are finding it harder to offset one business's losses with another's profits.
In auto insurance, the problems have included rapidly rising medical and car-repair costs. In liability insurance for business, the troubles have included competitive price cutting and large jury awards. In life insurance, increasing rates of return paid to policyholders and problems with life insurers' investments, most notably real estate, have cut deeply into profits. In workers' compensation insurance, regulations have held down premiums and profits.
As a result, many multiline insurers are earning less than 10 percent a year for their investors, barely more than they could earn on a risk-free investment like a Treasury bill.
Insurers are also being forced to streamline by the increasing militance of their institutional investors and by the growing worry of policyholders over solvency. Insurance company failures fell to 35 in 1990 after reaching a 1980's peak of 44 in 1989. Still, industry executives believe that the best way to alleviate public concern is to generate higher profits -- and quickly.
"The old modus operandi has obviously not worked," said Miron Picoult, the insurance analyst at Oppenheimer Inc.
 
Differences Are Widening
 The shifts among multiline insurers are already widening the differences among the players. Aetna, Travelers and Cigna are making major pushes in group health insurance by setting up "managed care" networks of doctors and hospitals for clients trying to contain costs. Chubb continues to focus on the upper end of the market -- large, blue-chip companies and wealthy individuals. The Continental Corporation, having sold its life- and health-insurance businesses, is now purely a property-and-casualty insurer focusing on mid-sized manufacturers and shipping concerns.
Among other changes: Crum & Forster, the insurance subsidiary of the Xerox Corporation, has been shrinking its workers' compensation division. The Lincoln National Corporation has sold its reinsurance division.
Some insurers, such like Cigna, are trying wholesale withdrawals from certain lines. Others, including Aetna, are pulling out only in certain states, although two states, Massachusetts and New Jersey, are resisting such "cherry picking" by insisting that insurers sell all or nothing. Still others, like Crum & Forster, are reducing the amount they sell of certain lines across the country.
Some economists argue that it is always positive for consumers and investors when an industry applies more discipline. High-cost operations are weeded out and leaner players can offer better prices.
 
A Possible Void
 "An industry that has been portrayed by many as sleepy is waking up with a vengeance," said George G. C. Parker, who teaches the course in financial institutions at the Stanford Business School. "This restructuring, while painful to insurers, could be beneficial to consumers."
Others are not convinced. For example, as Aetna, Travelers, Cigna, Crum & Forster and other insurers scale back their money-losing auto-insurance operations, one possibility is that no other insurer will find the business sufficiently attractive to fill the void.
"You could get into availability problems," said William Meehan, a senior insurance specialist at McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm. "More and more people would go uninsured; more and more people would be forced into state-run insurance pools."
Other experts see low-cost, high-volume operators like State Farm and Allstate rushing in to pick up the business. But this, carried to the extreme, could have a troublesome consequence: "If a State Farm or an Allstate got up to 30 percent in terms of market share, you'd begin to see something approaching a classic oligopoly," said David Cummins, a professor of insurance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: Salvador E. Luria Is Dead at 78; Shared a Nobel Prize in Medicine

BYLINE: By RICHARD SEVERO

 BODY:
Salvador E. Luria, a biologist and physician who shared a 1969 Nobel Prize for his pioneering work in medicine and physiology, died yesterday at his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 78 years old.
Dr. Luria suffered a heart attack, said a spokesman for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Dr. Luria had taught since 1959. 
 He won the Nobel Prize for research he did in a loose association with Max Delbruck of the California Institute of Technology and Alfred D. Hershey of the Carnegie Institution's genetics research laboratory in Cold Spring Harbor, L.I.
The three were cited for their "discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses." Their work began the transformation of genetics and contributed to the foundation on which modern molecular biology rests. It shed much light on how viruses work and how more complex organisms reproduce and pass on hereditary characteristics.
 
Active in Peace Movement
 Dr. Luria, who was born in Turin, Italy, was also widely known as an active member of the peace movement and was outspokenly critical of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the American intervention in Vietnam.
Apparently because of his candor and independence on such issues, his name appeared on a Federal blacklist of 48 scientists in 1969, the year he won the Nobel Prize.
The National Institutes of Health, which drew up the blacklist, never specified why Dr. Luria, a Jew who became a United States citizen in 1947 after having fled Fascist Italy nine years earlier, should be barred from the institutes' panels.
Dr. Luria was also a critic of what he regarded as a lack of safeguards on nuclear power. In 1976 he joined other scientists in calling for a halt to the building of new atomic power plants.
Besides the work that won the Nobel Prize, Dr. Luria organized a teaching and research program in microbiology at M.I.T. and later founded the M.I.T. Center for Cancer Research, which he directed from 1972 until 1985.
 
A Highly Esteemed Title
 Although he retired from M.I.T. in 1978, he remained active there. At his death he was Institute Professor Emeritus, a title that M.I.T. reserves for the most esteemed members of its faculty.
Dr. Luria's interest in the humanities rivaled his achievements in science. In 1985 he said scientists who "exile themselves from the arena of social struggles" were failing the societies they were supposed to serve.
He urged his science students to develop interests in the humanities. Besides his lectures in science, he offered a course in world literature to graduate students at M.I.T.
In 1974 he won a National Book Award in the Sciences for a nonacademic work, "Life: The Unfinished Experiment." The book, which was published by Charles Scribner's Sons, was translated into Italian, French, Spanish, German and Japanese.
 
'Active Participant' in Politics
 While Dr. Luria was angry over his blacklisting, it did not prevent him from confronting issues he regarded as important. "I made up my mind that as a citizen I would be an active participant in American politics," he once said, "taking advantage of the democratic opportunities that were not available to me in Italy."
He added: "What scientific achievement I have reached is due to the freedom provided in this wealthy country to all aspects of intellectual enterprise."
He advocated "human standards of justice, decency and compassion," and, in a letter to The New York Times in 1982, he said he thought that the Israeli military campaign in Lebanon "violates those standards."
Salvador Edward Luria was born in 1912 and was graduated from the University of Turin, summa cum laude, in 1935. He became a radiology specialist in Rome, but fled Italy in 1938 and continued his research in Paris before immigrating to the United States in 1940.
 
A Teacher and Lecturer
 He did graduate work at Columbia University for two years, and then did more work at Vanderbilt and Princeton universities.
He taught at Indiana University from 1943 to 1959. Before joining M.I.T. he also lectured in biophysics at the University of Colorado, and was Jesup Lecturer in zoology at Columbia. In 1959 he was Niewland Lecturer in biology at the University of Notre Dame.
He served since 1984 as senior scientist at the Repligen Corporation, a biotechnology company in Cambridge, Mass.
Among his affiliations were the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Microbiology. He was president of microbiology academy in 1967 and 1968.
He held many honorary doctorates, including ones from the University of Chicago, Brown University and the University of Palermo.
Surviving are his wife, Zella Hurwitz Luria, a professor of psychology at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., and a son, Daniel, an economist. Funeral arrangements are private but M.I.T. said a memorial service would be held at a date to be announced.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Argument Over the Banks

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE battle has begun over the Administration's proposals for the most drastic overhaul of the nation's banking system since the Depression. President Bush's aim is to restore confidence in the banking system and make America's banks world leaders again.
As the Treasury stresses, of the 30 biggest banks in the world, ranked by deposits, nine were American in 1969, with the top three the Bank of America, Chase and First National City, which became Citibank; in 1989, only one of the top 30 was American, with Citibank in 27th place. The Administration's aim is admirable, but there are risks. 
 It says one of its main goals is to "make banks stronger and safer by strengthening the role of capital -- not by raising capital standards, but with a plan to attract capital to the banking industry." One element would be to permit industrial companies to buy banks. But critics say that would transform the economy and society into a far more concentrated structure, dominated by big corporations.
Henry Kaufman, president of Henry Kaufman & Company, an investment advisory firm, regards this proposal as "very dangerous." In an interview, he said it would confer too much power on a corporate and financial elite, with close ties to the Government, transforming the United States from an economic democracy to a "corporate state."
Other critics of the plan say the "too big to fail" doctrine, which would be retained, would increase the concentration of financial power by throwing the weight of Government behind big banks and would contradict the Administration's professed support of market-determined solutions.
Robert Glauber, Treasury Under Secretary and former Harvard professor, who had most to do with the drafting of the plan, rejects charges that it would favor the big over the small. He said in an interview that there would not be a big push by industrial corporations into banking. Few, he said, are so flush with cash that they would want to put billions into bank investments and acquisitions. And relatively few banks would look attractive now, given the competition from other financial service companies and "non-bank banks," their low and often overstated profits, low stock values, large numbers of nonperforming loans, and the necessity of being subjected to Government regulation. One almost wonders why the Administration even wants to propose acquisition of banks by industrial companies.
On both the adequacy of capital and "too big to fail" issues, Mr. Glauber said the Administration's aim was to reduce failures by big and small banks alike and to improve banks' profitability by widening their opportunities to compete in other lines of business and across state borders.
But "despite the Administration's market orientation," he said, it would have to act to prevent failures of big banks that would threaten the economic system. Central banks in all countries act to prevent "systemic risk." The issue is always which banks to save, and here the Administration provides for joint decision-making between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. "Secretary Brady doesn't believe bigger is better," Mr. Glauber said. "He believes in strong community and regional banks, and our plan will help regional banks to grow and expand across state borders." Yet many smaller banks fear that the plan would open their territory to big money-center banks, and they will fight it in Congress.
Should the Glass-Steagall Act be repealed, as the Administration proposes, and commercial banks allowed to do investment banking and sell insurance? Albert Gailord Hart, professor emeritus of economics at Columbia University, a noted banking scholar, told his seminar this week: "The idea that banks can be put in good shape by letting them horn in on the overcrowded businesses of investment banking and insurance is crazy. Whenever banks go into a new line where experience as commercial bankers is not the key to success, they come a cropper."
As evidence, he cited "the Florida real estate disaster when banks went into real estate investment trusts," the losses (including the failure at Continental Illinois) when banks engaged in syndication of loans based on oil and related real estate in the Southwest, the evaporation (which still plagues us) of "sovereign loans" in the third world. "The further mess created by the banks' involvement in corporate takeovers in the 1980's," he said, "is just beginning to become clear to outsiders, but will prove at least as expensive as those just mentioned."
Like Professor Hart, Gail Fosler, chief economist of the Conference Board, fears that diversification by banks into other businesses will weaken their ability to perform their "remarkable function as instruments of monetary policy." She stressed the danger of banks being driven further into riskier credit markets, creating pressures on the Federal Reserve to "overliquefy -- and ultimately create more inflation."
In Congress this year, the banking issue will be the most urgent after the war in the Persian Gulf, and it is an issue even more crucial to the nation's economic strength.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: AFRICA;
In East Africa, U.S. Cuts Diplomatic Presence

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Across East Africa, the United States has moved to ward off terrorist attacks as a result of the Persian Gulf war. After incidents of violence and threats by Muslims sympathetic to Iraq, Washington has closed its embassy in the Sudan, evacuated officials in Tanzania and increased precautions in Uganda and Kenya.
In the Sudan, the American Ambassador, James R. Cheek, and remaining staff members at the embassy in Khartoum, about 50 people, were evacuated from the building hours before the first strikes against Iraq. The embassy building is now closed. Two American diplomats remain in the Sudanese capital and are working out of the British Embassy, which is heavily guarded by British soldiers flown in to provide extra protection. 
 The Islamic fundamentalist junta in the Sudan, historically an American ally, has backed Iraq since last August and has become steadily more anti-American.
Reports circulated earlier this week that the Sudan was harboring Iraqi planes, but officials in Washington have said they do not think this is true. One official said there were no landing strips in the Sudan capable of taking the advanced fighter planes described in the reports. At the end of January, Egypt said its air force had conducted military exercises near its border with the Sudan to warn its neighbor against any attempts to station Iraqi planes or missiles there.
Because no officials of the United States Agency for International Development are now in Khartoum, concern is rising in Washington about how effectively large amounts of famine relief aid being sent to the Sudan will be distributed.
The United States has pledged to send 330,000 tons of grain to the Sudan to try to avert famine that some experts have predicted will affect up to eight million Sudanese. Some of the food is already on ships en route to Port Sudan.
The most violent incident in the region involved an explosive device thrown shortly after the war started onto the tennis court at the American Club in Kampala, Uganda, soon after the United States Ambassador, John A. Burroughs Jr., had finished playing.
"We assume it may have been thrown at him," said Dudley Sims the public affairs officer at the embassy.
About 20 percent of Kampala's roughly one million people are Muslim.
 
Extra Security in Uganda
 American officials said they believed the explosive tossed at the American Club was thrown by a Ugandan rather than a terrorist sent to Uganda to target Westerners. After the gulf war started, American officials in Kampala were warned to take extra security precautions.
In Tanzania, "credible threats" were made against American officials in the capital, Dar es Salaam, where up to half the population is Muslim, American diplomats said. All non-essential staff-members were ordered to leave by last week. The embassy is working with only a skeleton staff. The 43 Peace Corps volunteers were also evacuated. The United States Information Service library has been closed.
The diplomats said it was necessary to scale back operations in Tanzania because the Government there had been unable to provide necessary security.
In Kenya, Government authorities have provided extra security outside the residence of the American Ambassador, Smith Hempstone.

HEADLINE: O'HARE JOURNAL;
War Brings Eerie Peace To Busiest Airline Hub

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 7

 BODY:
These days, you can find a parking space at O'Hare International Airport right by the elevators. You can walk the terminals without your bag bumping into somebody else's. You can find a seat at the gate. You can have the souvenir shops, taverns, rental car vans and just about anything else you want all to yourself.
O'Hare, the nation's busiest airport, where on any given day tens of thousands of people routinely pass through the gates, is nearly empty.
Since the outbreak of war in the Persian Gulf three weeks ago, O'Hare and other airports, already hurt by a slumping economy, have become barometers of Americans' fear of terrorism, ghost towns abandoned by all but the most determined travelers who often find themselves outnumbered by airport personnel.
Many airports say they have not yet compiled statistics to document the decline in passengers in the last few weeks. But estimates by airline analysts range from 10 to 50 percent, and some gate personnel at O'Hare say they have sent off 727's with just six people aboard.
American Airlines, which has a hub at O'Hare, has reported that 9 percent fewer passengers boarded its planes at the airport in January than in the previous January. It is not clear how sharp the drop was after the war broke out in mid-January.
"We have a recession of unknown depth and duration and fears of possible terrorism, and there you are," said Edward Starkman, an airline analyst at Paine Webber.
The effects can be seen far beyond the gates and ticket counters. At Los Angeles International Airport, there are 20 percent fewer cars in the parking lots. Buses bound for Manhattan have left Newark Airport with just one or two passengers.
"It's been very, very, very slow," said Tim Jeffries, manager of a sports shop at O'Hare, where rows of Chicago Bulls and Blackhawks T-shirts stood neatly hung, untouched by customers for hours at a time.
"We just try to keep busy," he said. Mostly that means straightening up and wiping the counters.
In the airport's underground passageways, cavernous corridors normally thick with travelers hurrying between terminals, Mike Barber, a street trumpeter, played "Misty" for baggage handlers on break.
Upstairs, the car rental counters were virtually deserted.
"See those escalators?" said Lisa Valentine, an Avis clerk, pointing to the moving stairs carrying three passengers. "People would be jampacked down those escalators this time of day. It would be elbow-to-elbow at baggage claim. There would be so many people at our counter, we couldn't sit down."
Not now. Now she was reading the newspaper instead. Her co-worker, Karen Huebner, sat twirling a telephone cord around her finger. Two-thirds of the way through a 10-hour period in which they would normally rent cars to 100 people, only 20 people had come by for cars.
Across the airport, police officers, skycaps, bartenders, clerks at the duty-free shops could be seen, head in hand, drawing circles with their toes, looking more like the Maytag repairman than airport workers during a nationwide state of alert.
Bill Jech and David Buescher, two publishing executives and frequent fliers who were headed to Montreal, sat in a vast, private American Airlines lounge, arms stretched out over a bank of seats. "I've never seen it this empty," Mr. Buescher said. "This place is usually overflowing. Sometimes we've milled around here where we can't even get a phone."
O'Hare and airline officials are trying to put a good face on the situation. "It's primarily the meeters and greeters and seer-offers who are gone," said Sara Dornacker, a spokeswoman for United Airlines.
But people who make their daily livelihood off the passengers say the passengers are not there either. For Zakaria Maaitah, a taxi driver who works O'Hare, there are so few passengers that the waiting time for a fare has more than doubled, to more than two hours.
On a recent evening, it took that long just to make it to the head of the line at the terminal curbside, then another half hour for what looked remotely like a possible fare. And that was during rush hour.
"We can't make it anymore," he said. "It's not worth it to come out here."
That night, Mr. Maaitah got out of his cab hurried over to an elderly woman. But she was being picked up by a relative. He politely, slightly desperately, sprinted toward a second woman. She was looking for a hotel van. Finally, Paul Dodman, a business executive, walked out and looked in Mr. Maaitah's direction.
His luggage was in the trunk before he could say where he wanted to go. He offered a single comment. "The airport was empty," Mr. Dodman said, "and so was the plane."

HEADLINE: Technology Is Found to Exist To Cut Global Warming Gases

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Current technologies can sharply reduce gases that scientists say would contribute to global warming, but not without significant expense and dramatic changes in how Americans use energy, a Congressional study reported today.
The report estimated that substantially cutting emissions of one of the gases, carbon dioxide, could eventually cost the economy as much as $150 billion a year, about what Americans now pay for compliance with all existing environmental laws. 
 The study by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment comes as delegates from 130 nations are meeting near here to work toward a worldwide treaty on global warming. It also follows pressure from some members of Congress to commit the United States to specific goals to reduce gases that contribute to global warming, something the Bush Administration says should await more study.
There is division among scientist over the extent, and indeed the existence, of global warming. But many scientists believe that global temperatures will rise because increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other manmade gases will trap and retain heat from the sun in a process similar to what happens in a greenhouse. Such a warming trend could cause sea levels to rise, cause severe droughts and storms and severely disprupt the earth's biological systems.
 
Number of Gases Involved
 The phenomenon has been attributed to a number of gases, including chlorofluorocarbons and methane. But carbon dioxide, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels, accounts for more than half of the gases identified as creating the greenhouse effect. And scientists believe significant cuts in carbon dioxide emissions will require sharp reductions in the burning of fossil fuels, oil, coal and wood.
The new study concluded that carbon dioxide reductions of 35 percent are feasible over the next 25 years in the United States with the adoption of stringent energy-saving policies.
"Such emission reductions will be difficult to achieve and could be costly," said the study, which had been requested by several Congressional committees, but it added that the reductions would require no major technological breakthroughs,
The report said the cost was difficult to estimate. Energy savings would increase because of conservation and fuel efficiencies, but the cost of appliances, automobiles and houses, would most likely increase.
The report said predictions on how much it would cost to deal with global warming vary widely, from saving the economy money to costing as much as $150 billion a year to cut carbon dioxide emissions alone by the year 2015.
Environmentalists have argued that at the very least, industrial nations must reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent to have any hopes of reversing the trend toward unusual warming of the earth.
The report said a substantial cut in carbon dioxide emissions would require energy conservation measures to be taken by virtually all sectors of the economy, including construction, manufacturing, transportation and energy industries.
 
Energy Taxes Could Be Needed
 The energy savings most likely would have to be brought about through a mixture of energy taxes, financial incentives and government regulation, the study concluded.
The Congressional study did not endorse any specific approach or suggest what kinds of energy taxes or incentives might be preferred. But it suggested that tougher energy efficiency standards would have to be developed for commercial buildings as well as for homes, appliances, heating and cooling systems, windows and other elements of construction.
It cited the need for more energy-efficient transportation systems, including steep increases in automobile fuel economy standards, more incentives toward development of mass transit and perhaps reinstituting the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit nationwide.

Warmer Forecast in Europe Ends the Rally in Oil Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices fell yesterday after a rally driven by the price of heating oil faded on forecasts of warmer weather in Europe.
"The cold weather is supposed to lift by Sunday and as soon as that weather lifts, the weak U.S. demand will be apparent," said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy analyst at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. 
 Energy prices rose on Wednesday as the European cold snap sent heating oil prices sharply higher, and oil began trading yesterday up slightly.
But light sweet crude oil for delivery in March closed at $21.22 a barrel, down 27 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil closed at $20.18 a barrel, up 2 cents, on the International Petroleum Exchange.
Home heating oil for delivery in March settled at 65.52 cents a gallon, down 0.83 cent, in New York.
Unleaded gasoline for March delivery closed at 60.58 cents a gallon, down 1.16 cents. Natural gas for delivery in March closed at $1.380 a 1,000 cubic feet, up 0.9 cent.
"I think we're in a period where things are just going to drift back and forth without any strong, sustainable influence, as long as this war drags on," said Philip L. Dodge, an oil analyst with Nomura Securities International Inc. After that, many experts predict oil prices will tumble, at least temporarily, as the global market contends with a sizable glut that even now cannot be sold off.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Intervention Lifts the Dollar; Gold Is Up $4.90 on Comex

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar edged higher in domestic trading for the first time in more than a week yesterday after two central banks intervened to shore up the flagging United States currency, traders said.
Gold was up moderately in New York, rising $4.90 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange, to $367.80. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $367.10 an ounce, up $4.80 from late Wednesday. 
 The slight domestic rise of the dollar helped it recover somewhat from a post-World War II low reached Wednesday against the German mark. Traders said, however, that the market's belief that the Fed would act to lower interest rates to lift the sagging United States economy threatened to push the dollar to new lows in coming sessions.
Lower interest rates generally mean lower investment returns on securities, so foreigners desire less currency to buy those securities.
"The dollar still feels very heavy," said Tom Benfer, senior market representative in foreign exchange at the Bank of Montreal. "The economic fundamentals still augur for a lower dollar."
 
Touched 1.4460 German Marks
 Traders said the Fed and the Bank of Canada stepped in to buy dollars in the early afternoon after the dollar touched a new postwar low of 1.4460 German marks.
While the dollar-buying was relatively small in volume, trading was thin enough for the intervention to lift the dollar against the mark, they said.
The intervention came on the heels of comments by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady that the United States was not pursuing a low-dollar policy, traders said.
By late in the day, the dollar stood at 1.4553 German marks, up from 1.4483 marks late Wednesday.
Robert Hatcher, corporate dealer with Barclays Bank P.L.C., said there was a widening belief in the currency markets that the Fed interventions -- yesterday's was the fourth in as many days -- were designed to slow the dollar's decline, not reverse it.
"On balance, I would say the market is still anti-dollar," he said. "The central banks have been able to discourage a serious drop in the dollar. The problem is the sentiment is still pretty bad."
 
Pound Below $2 in Britain
 In London, the British pound fell to $1.9980 from late Wednesday's 10-year high of $2.0000. In New York, the pound weakened to $2.0000, from $2.0035 late Wednesday.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.53 yen, to a closing 128.60 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 127.80 yen, and in New York the dollar bought 128.52 yen, up from late Wednesday's 128.13 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's, included: 1.2437 Swiss francs, up from 1.2316; 4.9535 French francs, up from 4.9325; 1,093.75 Italian lire, up from 1,088.50, and 1.1587 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1575.

HEADLINE: Homebuyers Send Funds To Neediest

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
With the purchase of a new home, people often become preoccupied with interest rates and mortgage payments, buying furniture and coordinating colors in the living room. But for some, the change in residence also inspires a desire to help others and to contribute to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
In May, Deidre and Ed Hogan moved from their apartment on 84th Street near Lexington Avenue to a Dutch colonial house in Darien, Conn. Last month, the Hogans sent their first contribution, a gift of $100, to the fund. In the corner of the check was written "housing donation," and their letter said, "Perhaps we'll make our gift like our mortgage, a 30-year 'tradition.' " 
 Ms. Hogan said in a telephone interview that she and her husband had noticed the increasing numbers of homeless people while living in Manhattan, but "it did not hit home" until they left.
"Moving into a house made us more aware that there were people who aren't as fortunate as we are," she said. There was something about owning a home that made them realize they "had a place and others did not."
Another contributor, Elizabeth C. Segal, gave $35 and wrote: "Making a donation has been a holiday tradition with me for many years (at least eight), and I am happy to continue it. This year, I feel particularly fortunate, as I became for the first time a homeowner this autumn. I would therefore especially like to be able to do at least a little for the many people who are much less fortunate than I am, and if possible would like this donation to be used to help a homeless person."
 
3 Weeks Remain
 Money from the Neediest Cases has helped prevent hundreds of people from being evicted from their homes, provided food and clothing for disadvantaged children and sent dozens of homemakers to visit the elderly. Proceeds are distributed to seven charities to help the sick and the poor, and The New York Times pays for the campaign's overhead.
The 1990-91 appeal closes on Feb. 28, and the fund is still short $268,364.49 of the amount that was raised last year. But dozens of people continue to send in contributions, moved by the plight of the city's homeless.
Ursula Wolfe of New Providence, N.J., sent $100 and wrote: "As I sat by the fire after a good meal, my inward eye saw the hungry homeless huddled in cardboard boxes against the cold. Please help."
A gift of $25 from Michael Lieder arrived at the beginning of January. "It snowed last night, and I'm thankful that I have a roof over my head," he wrote. "Many others don't."
And there was also a $100 contribution from Imran Riffrat, a New Yorker who has been living in Cairo. "We return to our city each year and are saddened to see the state of things as they are today," he wrote. "There seems to be a steady deterioration, and our contribution, small as it may seem, may help to stem the decline."

HEADLINE: New York Faces Loss of Insurers For Bond Issue

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Next week, for the first time in many years, New York City bonds are likely to be issued without insurance backing because the Wall Street house underwriting the issue could not find an agency interested in providing it.
Some investment bankers say the lack of insurance has more symbolic than economic importance. The city cannot obtain it because the insurance companies' appetite for New York City bonds is sated, not because the city is viewed as too great a credit risk, they say. 
 Typically, the city pays an insurance premium to a triple A-rated municipal bond insurance agency, which in exchange lends its credit rating to some of the bonds.
 
Higher Interest Likely
 Without insurance, investors are likely to demand higher interest on the city's bonds, raising the cost to the city. Usually the difference between insured and uninsured bonds is about 1 1/4 percentage points.
Next week's bond issue is for $950 million, but since only a portion of that -- typically about 10 percent -- would normally be insured, the cost to the city of going without insurance will be about $1 million.
The insurance agencies set internal limits on how much credit they want to guarantee for any one entity, and New York has been issuing so many bonds in the last few years that it has reached those limits.
"All of us already have so much exposure to the City of New York that if we took any more we would have to let other risks roll off," said Mary Anderson, a senior vice president at Ambac, a municipal bond insurance company.
The lack of insurance could make it harder to sell New York City bonds, not just next week, but over the next few years, when the city is expected to issue about $1 billion in bonds a quarter. Only the United States Treasury issues more bonds each year.
 
Concern Among Investors
 As more and more municipal governments have run into financial trouble, investors have grown increasingly sensitive to risk. "We detect concern," said Robert Godfrey, executive vice president of the Municipal Bond Insurance Association. "Investors have started to focus on credit quality -- they like the triple A."
The percentage of new municipal bonds that carry insurance has risen from 3 percent in 1980 to 26 percent last year.
"Using insurance would certainly help the city," said Stan Ciemniecki, an executive vice president at Lehman Brothers, which is underwriting the city's new bond issue. But he said he was confident his concern would have no problem selling the city's bonds.

HEADLINE: Consumer Credit Fell In December

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Consumer credit fell at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in December, the steepest decline in nearly four years, the Federal Reserve said today. The report surprised analysts, because December is usually a busy shopping month.
Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group in Washington, cited consumer fears about the economy. "We have lost a million jobs since June," she said. "Wage rates are way behind inflation. In many areas, the values of homes are declining. People are worried about the banking situation." 
 As so, she continued, "people are not buying much of anything and, therefore, are not using their credit cards."
Bill Wood, an economist with Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass., said the decline would not have been so unexpected in January, usually a slow time for retailers and other store owners.
"It does not bode well for January," he said, suggesting that the January credit report could be worse because of the added element of concern over the Persian Gulf war.
The Fed said consumer installment debt dropped a seasonally adjusted $1.45 billion, the first decline since a two-tenths of 1 percent dip in February 1989 and the sharpest fall since a 5.2 percent drop in February 1987.
 
Auto Loans Increased

For the year, credit growth slowed to just 3.1 percent, down from 6 percent in 1989 and 8.5 percent in 1988. November's 4.5 percent growth was stronger than the 2.8 percent gain first reported, however.
Consumer credit includes all consumer loans except mortgages and home-equity debt. Total consumer spending represents about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
Only automobile loans increased in December. All other types of consumer debt, including credit card debt, declined in the month that included the bulk of Christmas shopping.
Auto loans, which had fallen for six months until a slight three-tenths of 1 percent gain in November, rose another 3.3 percent, or a seasonally adjusted $786 million, in December.
Revolving credit, the category that includes credit cards, fell 6.7 percent after increasing 7.6 percent in November, the last week of which has marked the start of the holiday shopping season.
Total revolving debt fell $1.23 billion in December, compared with a $1.38 billion gain the previous month.
The Commerce Department had reported earlier that retail sales in December fell four-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
Boy Scout Crisis: Who Will Help America's Youth?

BYLINE: By ANDREW H. MALCOLM

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON, N.Y.

 BODY:
Douglas Gordon is an Eagle Scout who didn't know he was missing. Neither did Gordon Andrew. And Peter Ruhlin still doesn't know it. They have been living normally all these years, suspecting nothing.
But now authorities from their childhood have tracked down these men and hope that they, along with about 9,997 other missing Eagle Scouts in the area, will help solve an acute crisis in the New York region for the Boy Scouts of America. 
 The crisis in this venerable institution is not a shortage of boys willing to wear shorts, salute with three fingers and memorize the 12 points of Scout Law. There are, in fact, too many who seek such a structured ladder of socially acceptable achievement these days, even in New York City, where to many minds the sight of a teen-ager's hand reaching out for an elderly woman's elbow at a crosswalk does not bring to mind a daily good deed.
The Boy Scout crisis is instead a shortage of adults willing to donate their own precious time to become troop leaders, assistant leaders, merit badge counselors and general role models.
 There is, for one thing, more competition for the time of adults in this era of economic uncertainty. For another, even in those households that still have two parents, only a small fraction now are the traditional model of one parent in the work place and one parent in the home place.
 A very large num ber have two working parents. They have enough problems juggling their personal assignments and ambitions with the competing demands, schedules and ill-timed illnesses of their own children, let alone trying to leave work in midafternoon once a week to help a dozen 12-year-olds send semaphore signals the length of a church basement.
The Boy Scouts have made adjustments. After at least one lawsuit, women can now be scoutmasters. Troop and pack meetings, once confined to immediate post-school hours, often convene at 8 P.M. or even on weekends. And there are lessons on drug and sexual abuse.
Still, several thousand New York-area youths are on Scout waiting lists eager to begin climbing the Tenderfoot achievement ladder but unable to because there are no adult leaders. With one adult needed for every eight youngsters, that makes for a lot of missing leaders.
Where better to look for Scout leaders than among former Scouts? More precisely from the 1.3 million American Scouts who have completed the 21 steps on the trail to Eagle rank, which include demonstrations of troop leadership.
So the Greater New York Councils of the Boy Scouts are in the midst of a hunt for the 10,000 Eagle Scouts they estimate live around here. They've been on radio. They've written known Eagle Scouts urging them to turn in others. The councils got a notice in the newsletter for Metro-North's 100,000 train riders. The letter told Eagle Scouts to phone 1-800-3EAGLE-0.
So far, 4,236 have. The typical profile: a married college graduate between age 30 and 40 working as a professional in Manhattan but living in the suburbs. Like Gordon Andrew of Fairfield, Conn., and Douglas Gordon here.
Now a civil engineer selling custom air-conditioners, Mr. Gordon was once a leader of Troop 104 in Jefferson City, Mo. He found scouting invaluable in learning values in a structured environment, and he hopes his 18-month-old son will some day seek the same scouting satisfaction. "You set goals," he said. "You work for them. You achieve them. You're rewarded." Just like college, or business before the overlay of office politics.
Mr. Andrew belonged to Troop 103 in West Hartford, Conn.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bond Prices Drop After Auction

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices in the credit markets gave ground for the first time in days yesterday, as market participants apparently took profits after a successful auction of $11 billion in new 30-year Treasury bonds.
Bids at the bond sale, the last leg of the Treasury's $34.5 billion quarterly refunding auctions, produced an average yield on the securities of 7.98 percent, down substantially from the 8.71 percent average yield at the last bond sale in November. It is the lowest yield on a new 30-year Treasury bond since the auction in November 1989. 
 Traders said demand for the new issue had been good. Nevertheless, prices in the secondary market for Treasury securities, which had been firm as the auction approached, began to deteriorate once the results of the sale were announced.
"Based on the auction, I am surprised this sort of selling is happening," one government bond trader said.
Others said the selloff was not so surprising, given the strong gains that have been recorded recently.
"A lot of this is due to profit taking," said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at the Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corporation.
Mr. Lieberman and others said Japanese firms, which are estimated to have placed bids for 20 to 25 percent of the new bonds, began to liquidate positions shortly after the auction results were announced. Those sales in turn encouraged others to lighten up positions.
By late in the day, the new bonds were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.03 percent.
Analysts and traders said the selloff, which amounted to as much as 5/8 point for some securities, was not likely to last long. The economy remains weak, and with the refunding auctions completed, the market will not have to cope with meaningful amounts of new Treasury securities for a few weeks.
"In the past, the trading pattern has been that the long end gets sold off the most aggressively because that is where the bulk of the risk is," another government bond trader said. "But in a day or two, the market will go back up. The economy is still in awful shape."
Poor economic conditions are good for prices in the credit markets because they tend to dampen inflation. Lower rates of inflation lift returns on fixed-income securities.
The Treasury's auction took place on an exceptionally busy day in the world's primary bond markets.
In addition to the Treasury auction, Government bond auctions were held in Japan, France, Germany and Britain yesterday.
"There was a rash of worldwide supply and the markets have absorbed all of it quite well," said James R. Capra, a principal at Moore Capital Management, a money management firm in New York.
 
In the Secondary Market
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered late yesterday at a price of 107 25/32, down a little more than 5/8 point, to yield 8.05 percent, up from 8.00 percent late Wednesday.
Among oustanding Treasury note issues, the 7 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 1/4, down 7/32, to yield 7.43 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes were unchanged, at 100 3/8, to yield 6.79 percent.
In when-issued trading, the 6 7/8 percent three-year notes auctioned on Tuesday were offered at a price to yield 7 percent. And the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.83 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.92 percent late yesterday, up 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a basis point, to a late offered rate of 5.87 percent.
 
Corporate Issues
 New-issue activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market slowed yesterday after several days of heavy flow.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, prices of most issues dipped by 1/4 point to 3/8 point, dealers said.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of most widely quoted issues fell by 1/8 point in quiet trading.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Jan. 28.
The report, which was largely in line with analysts' expectations, had no impact on prices in the credit markets.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of new 30-year Treasury bonds:

HEADLINE: Dinkins Hints at Stretching Budget Problems Over Years

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
Raising the possibility that New York City would resort to measures not seen since its fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, Mayor David N. Dinkins hinted yesterday that he might consider a plan under which the city would stretch its current budget problems over several years.
The Mayor's comments came one day after Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, offered a dire prognosis for New York City's finances. 
 Mr. Rohatyn said the city's financial situation could deteroriate to the point where the cuts needed to balance the budget would cause lasting harm. In that case, he said, the city should consider some kind of borrowing to stretch the problem out over several years.
"At some point the trade-off between balancing the budget and that long-term social and economic harm may not make sense," Mr. Rohatyn said.
 
The Best Alternative
 Initially, Mr. Dinkins had seemed hostile to Mr. Rohaytn's suggestions. But yesterday he said he agreed that stretching out the problem might be the best alternative.
"One has to be constantly mindful that to push debt into the future is frowned upon and not deemed to be the wisest course," he said. "On the other hand, however, it is recognized that when you have a very severe situation, it frequently cannot be met in a limited period of time and therefore there is some argument for an expansion. Instead of a one-year budget, a budget of several years."
Mr. Dinkins repeatedly stressed that the city was prepared to balance its budget this year and that it had already taken significant steps to close toward doing so.
 
More Study Needed
 Aides to Mr. Dinkins said the idea of a "multiyear" budget was still in the early stages and required more study. "I think what the Mayor was saying was that the city was prepared to consider the possibility of a multiyear budget," Albert Scardino, the Mayor's press secretary, said.
But fiscal experts warned yesterday that deferring the city's problems could trigger a takeover of the city budget by the Financial Control Board, a state oversight panel formed during the fiscal troubles of the mid-1970's.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is the chairman of the Financial Control Board and would, in the case of a takeover, become responsible for the city budget. It is widely agreed in both City Hall and the State Capitol that such a takeover would be a huge political liability for Mr. Cuomo.
In Albany, Goveror Cuomo said he thought that it was "too early" to conclude that extraordinary measures would be needed to solve the problem.
The city's budget problems have become a source of enormous tension between the city and the state, which is grappling with tremendous budget troubles of its own. Yesterday, Mr. Cuomo, apparently trying to avoid a new round of finger-pointing, responded noncommitally to the proposition that the city would not be able to balance its budget this year. He said he would leave discussions about worst-case scenarios to "kibbitzers."
"This is kibbitzing," he said to a reporter who pressed him on the issue. "This is what you do, not what I do."
 
Deep Concern
 In recent months, Mr. Cuomo himself has often voiced deep concern over the city's fiscal problems. At the same time, he has insisted that he has absolute faith in Mayor Dinkins's ability to overcome them.
Governor Cuomo has traditionally been an ally of Mr. Rohatyn, who was one of the architects of the city's fiscal recovery. The Governor recently asked Mr. Rohatyn to stay on as chairman of the M.A.C. after he threatened to leave. But yesterday he seemed taken aback by the reports of Mr. Rohatyn's remarks and he suggested that they had been misunderstood.
In an interview, Mr. Rohatyn, too, insisted that his comments had been misinterpreted. He said he had simply been issuing a warning about steps that might be needed if the Persian Gulf war were prolonged and the economy continued to slide. "It didn't seem to me to be revolutionary," he said.

HEADLINE: Test for Japan's Leader;
Kaifu Faces Growing Difficulty in Building A Consensus on Tokyo's Role in Gulf War

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 7

 BODY:
An extraordinary national debate over Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's pledge of aid for the war against Iraq is suddenly proving to be the biggest test of Japanese friendship for the United States in many years -- and the biggest test so far of Mr. Kaifu's ability to remain in office.
All week long, Mr. Kaifu has been battered by sharp questioning in public from his parliamentary foes along with what is said to be a growing sentiment behind the scenes that he and his Cabinet would have to resign if the $9 billion aid package falls through. 
 The high stakes have lent a tone of urgency to all discussions about the fate of the aid package, even as Government officials have become somewhat more optimistic about its prospects in recent days.
"I don't foresee any possibility in which the Government will not be able to secure that $9 billion," said Nobuo Matsunaga, a former Ambassador to the United States. But he warned that its defeat would display Mr. Kaifu's "inability to govern" and badly damage Japan's credibility.
In any case, Mr. Kaifu and his aides are waging an all-out campaign of high rhetorical flourishes combined with political horse-trading and even sleight of hand, the likes of which rarely comes into the open in Japan as it has in the last several days.
The backdrop of Mr. Kaifu's problems is that despite the absence of sizable anti-war demonstrations, Japanese public opinion has swung round to a deep-seated skepticism about the war and even deeper anxieties about being drawn into it.
Surveys show that a majority of Japanese opposed the American attacks, although paradoxically many of these same people favor aiding the United States to avoid international criticism. There is even more opposition to the Government's plan to send military planes to the region to evacuate refugees.
Running through the debate, in the nation if not in Parliament, is more than a trace of anti-American sentiment, a legacy of Japan's annoyance over feeling pushed around for years on trade issues and taken for granted on Iraq by President Bush.
 
'America Started This War'
 "We didn't ask for war," Hiroshi Kume, a popular television news anchorman, told viewers the other day. "Japan said differences should be settled through diplomatic means, but Bush didn't listen. We should tell him that America started this war, and it's up to America to finish it."
Japan had already pledged $4 billion to aid the gulf mobilization last year, half of it for economic aid to the region and the other for assistance to the military buildup restricted to payment for transportation and other non-combat costs.
There have been delays in disbursement, but the Government said last week that most of the money had finally been spent or committed.
This week, in the face of the antiwar sentiment, Mr. Kaifu has made more compromises to secure the new $9 billion pakcage. He announced, for instance, that the money would again not go for weapons or ammunition, but for transportation, medical services, food and other "logistical" matters.
 
Courting Opposition Party
 Mr. Kaifu's objective is to secure the votes of the Clean Government Party, or Komeito, which holds the swing votes in the opposition-controlled upper house of Parliament. But the party is still holding out for more concessions.
By tradition, the Komeito is both conservative and pacifist, since it draws its membership from small shopkeepers and businessmen in the cities allied with a popular Buddhist sect. Many of its rank-and-file are women who are most opposed to Japanese involvement in the war.
A senior Government officials commented that it was "insanity" to restrict Japan's aid to non-lethal goods, but such a step had to be taken and that more concessions might be in the offing.
There is now some talk of dropping the proposed tax on tobacco to pay for the aid, for example, and instead cutting Japan's budget in other areas, as the Komeito wants. Indeed, the entire tax package may be deferred until a later date, officials say.
 
An Official Is Sacrificed
 As for political logrolling, the talk of the capital nowadays is that the first Japanese casualty of the war appears not to be any Japanese soldier, but the longtime Governor of the district of Tokyo, Shunichi Suzuki.
In a fascinating display of American-style political hardball, Mr. Suzuki is being denied renomination by Mr. Kaifu's governing Liberal Democratic Party so that the party can back a neutral candidate more to the liking of the Clean Government Party -- again, to get its votes on the gulf.
What is going on behind the scenes is also a matter of speculation, some of it nasty. It has long been an open secret that the ruling party pays off the opposition at crucial moments with cash under the table, but a furor was provoked this week when a ruling party mentioned the practice in the open.
Suddenly irked over opposition taunts, a Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker declared that it was "impudence" for one colleague to level criticism, especially since he was on the take for 500,000 yen, or about $3,800, paid "as many as 20 times a year" from the ruling party.
 
Charges of Payoffs
 The comment brought a storm of protests and denials, a fact that amused some old hands in the party, who commented privately that it might now be more difficult to make such a payoff in the future.
Mr. Kaifu has won praise within the party for handling of the issues, although it is clear that the horse trading is being carried out mainly by the more powerful party kingpins who are his patrons. But many fear that even if he survives this battle, his future is not assured.
In the event of ground war in Iraq, political analysts say that the intensity of anti-war sentiment will likely increase.

HEADLINE: Watch Your Car, Here Comes Repo Man!

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Angel Cordova appeared puzzled by the black unmarked tow truck in front of his apartment building. He was only three months behind on his car payments. He had been discussing his problems with the finance company. Besides, the car had a faulty relay switch. Who makes payments on a lemon?
"I'm with Nissan Motor Acceptance," the tow truck driver, Brian Papp, a 325-pound former semi-pro football tackle, said to Mr. Cordova. "Where's the car?" 
 Despite bankruptcies, foreclosures, layoffs and bank failures, all is not gloom-and-doom in the Northeast these days. For some people, like Mr. Papp, the recession has hardly made a dent in business. Mr. Papp is a repo man.
Mr. Papp, who calls himself "a financial educator," is a co-owner of Hawk Repossessions, a small but fast-growing business that operates throughout New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, recovering cars, often surreptitiously, from owners who have fallen behind on loan payments.
 
Anything and Everything
 Since starting five years ago, Hawk, with offices in Norwich, Conn., and Newark, has repossessed cheap cars, expensive cars, sailboats, cigarette boats, campers, trailers, mobile homes and all manner of recreational vehicles, not to mention a bulldozer, a tow truck used byanother repossession service and a limousine owned by the talk-show host Morton Downey Jr.
Mr. Papp's pound in Norwich, a city of about 38,500 people 10 miles north of New London, also holds less mobile repossessions, like six weight-lifting machines from a fitness club.
"I expected a check from the guy, not the equipment," Mr. Papp said. "But he said: 'Take it. No one ever uses it.' "
The health of the repossession industry in the Northeast is difficult to assess. Only about two dozen companies are registered with the American Recovery Association, a New Orleans-based trade association that represents more than 500 repossession companies in the United States and several other countries. Dozens more, though, operate either exclusively as repossession companies or as part of towing businesses.
The association says business has declined in the last two years because credit has been tightened, especially among car dealers whose long-term, low-payment loans were more likely to end in a repossession. And some businesses say their work is down.
"If new car sales are down, you can expect repossessions to follow suit," said A. J. Christensen, president of Commercial Services Corporation in Newark.
 
Competition Grows
 But more people are also entering the business, intensifying competition.
"Everybody is going into repossessions," said Donald Rimbach, the manager of Thomas J. Rimbach, which recovers about 30 vehicles a week and has offices in Queens and Binghamton, N.Y. "You're getting collection people who were laid off. A lot of undercutting of prices is going on."
Finance companies, like the General Motors Acceptance Corporation in Detroit, cite a steady rise in repossessions, but they caution that the increases may only be keeping pace with a larger volume of loans made each year. According to G.M.A.C. figures, about 116,000 of their loans resulted in repossession in 1987. That figure rose to 143,000 in 1988 and 153,000 in 1989. No figures have been released for 1990.
Hawk sees a steady and slightly expanding amount of work. "Business has been steadily increasing," said Mr. Papp, whose 30 trucks recover about 200 vehicles a week.
Mr. Papp, who is 31 years old, estimated that the 50 cars, campers and boats impounded at his Norwich lot were worth more than $500,000. Most will be auctioned, with the proceeds going to banks and finance companies. If the sale price for a car is not enough to pay off the loan, the original owner is liable for the balance.
The fee charged by Hawk for its services runs between $125 and $600 an assignment. "I tell them, 'Look, I got to eat, too,' " Mr. Papp said. " 'If I don't take your car, they're going to come for my car.' "
Hawk has repossessed the rare Rolls-Royce and Lamborghini, but most of its cases involve middle-class owners of Hyundais and Hondas who have recently lost a job or a secondsource of income. A few find their cars repossessed if a lender learns they are insufficiently insured.
 
'People Who Just Walk Away'
 Some, like Mr. Cordova, stop making payments if their car is involved in an accident and they fail, either out of negligence or because of a lack of insurance, to make repairs.
"There are some people who just walk away," Mr. Papp said.
Danger, of course, can be part of a repo man's life; nationally, four were killed last year in arguments with car owners. Mr. Papp, who carries a handgun, was beaten by a group of men while on an assignment in the North End of Hartford last year.
"I do it for the excitement," he said. "Basically, you're stealing a car and not getting arrested."
Most car owners, however, when told of their loan status, turn in their keys. Occasionally, a repossession consists of a quick, quiet "tow and go" involving nothing more ingenious than a tow truck.
Other times, Slim Jims, lock picks, portable key-cutting equipment and steering-wheel-pullers are employed.
Nocturnal visits are more myth than reality. "People think we're coming at night, so we try to find them during the day," Mr. Papp said, scanning license plates at lunchtime in a factory parking lot in Putnam, and an hour later in a condominium complex in nearby Brooklyn, Conn.
On those rare instances when a face-to-face request for keys or a car is required, the situation seldom simmers above a slightly heated conversation.
Such was the case with Mr. Cordova, a 25-year-old bank employee living at home with his parents. After a couple of curses and a few futile phone calls to the finance company, he handed his car keys to Mr. Papp and helped him open the garage door.
"O.K., you guys can have the car," he said. "I'll make it easy on you."

HEADLINE: Senators Proposing Overhaul Of U.S. Intelligence Agencies

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Concerned that United States intelligence agencies often produce homogenized, timid assessments of world events and remain focused on cold war issues, the leaders of an important Senate committee today proposed a reorganization of the Government's espionage operations.
The proposed changes, the most extensive since the intelligence establishment started to take shape in 1947 with the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency, would revise the organization and leadership as well as the aims of the nation's spy agencies. 
 In making the proposal, the Democrat and Republican leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee said the changes were necessary to remove a tendency by the agencies to produce bland, hedged assessments that are watered down by bureaucratic battles.
In addition, the two Senators, David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, and Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said they hoped to eliminate overlapping responsibilities, streamline management, improve accountability for mistakes and reduce wasteful expenses.
 
Bill to Be Offered in Spring
 Their recommendations are to be detailed in legislation they plan to introduce this spring. Leaders of the House Intelligence Committee have said they intend to propose similar changes. It is unclear whether Congress will approve the proposals. The White House said today that it was satisfied with the current system.
The Government's primary intelligence agencies include the C.I.A.; the National Security Agency, which monitors international communications; the Defense Intelligence Agency, which provides military intelligence, and the National Reconnaissance Office, which is responsible for developing and launching spy satellites.
Under the current system, the head of the C.I.A. also serves as the Director of Central Intelligence, in charge of setting overall goals for the intelligence community and supervising the production of assessments on political, economic and military developments abroad for the President.
One of the central recommendations from Mr. Boren and Mr. Murkowski would be to establish a new position -- a director of national intelligence -- that is not imbeded in any of the agencies. The person in that new post would coordinate operations unencumbered by loyalty to a particular organization.
 
Boren Views on Proposals
 Mr. Boren said in an interview today that the changes were needed to renew an espionage apparatus whose leadership is spread throughout the Government, whose duties often overlap and whose overwhelming concern -- the Soviet military threat -- is rapidly becoming ancient history.
"Some of the major agencies -- the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency -- weren't even in existence when we created the C.I.A.," Mr. Boren noted.
Even a simple organization chart of the espionage community takes up "pages and pages and pages," Mr. Murkowski said.
Mr. Boren said his committee would also study bolstering the authority of the Defense Intelligence Agency, which analyzes intelligence for the military services, and making public the Government's overall spending on intelligence operations. The budget is classified but estimates place it at about $30 billion.
In interviews today, Mr. Boren and Mr. Murkowski, the newly appointed vice chairman of the committee, said they were optimistic that legislation could be enacted in their remaining two years of service on the intelligence panel.
 
Strong Support Cited
 Senator Boren said the proposal had the strong backing of key officials on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which shares authority over intelligence spending. He also noted that the new Democratic chairman of the House intelligence panel, Representative Dave McCurdy, also of Oklahoma, announced his own plans this week to study reorganizing the espionage apparatus.
But Mr. Boren also said that he had not consulted the White House or the Director of Central Intelligence, William H. Webster, about the proposals and that their support is uncertain.
Mr. McCurdy drew criticism from Republicans today. They were reacting to what Mr. McCurdy said this week in separate interviews with The Associated Press and The Washington Post. Mr. McCurdy said that he did not believe his committee had been aggressive enough in the past and that he intended "to stand up to Webster."
Today, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the third-ranking House Republican, accused Mr. McCurdy of "picking a public fight" with the Director of the Central Intelligence and said the White House was very concerned about the intentions of the House panel.
Mr. Boren sought today to erase any partisan tinge to his plans, saying he would have sought a reorganization even if the President and his C.I.A. director were Democrats. "We have no agendas in terms of settling political scores," he said. "Our only agenda is to build a better mousetrap."
 
Argument for Streamlining
 He and Mr. Murkowski said Federal budget problems and the political changes of the post-cold war era made the time ripe to streamline intelligence operations. Spending on intelligence declined by about 5 percent in real dollars this year, other officials have said.
Both men also suggested that reorganization was badly needed to increase the independence and accountability of espionage agencies. Mr. Murkowski expressed irritation at his frequent inability to fix blame or credit for such incidents as the Soviet Union's successful attempts in the 1980's to plant eavesdropping devices in the new United States Embassy in Moscow.
"If you try to look at responsibility," he said, "You can't find out. Guys say, 'That was not under my watch.' Maybe I'm naive, but I'd like to restructure this thing so there is clear accountability."
Senator Boren said that intelligence analyses of important world events are now so thoroughly processed by review panels and senior officials, each determined to avoid a wrong conclusion, that they are devoid of independent thought.
"In these briefings we get, when you're through with 75 percent of them, you don't know whether there's likely to be a revolution in Country X or not," he said. "Nobody will stick his neck out, and it's the person who will stick his neck out that really needs to be heard."

HEADLINE: Companies Cut Stock Dividends As Profits Drop

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Another of the corporate excesses of the 1980's is being reversed in executive suites across the country.
The common stock dividend, the venerable piece of the capitalist system's pie that grew robustly at many companies in the last decade, is being sliced. Profits are shrinking as the recession digs in, leaving the nation's auto, aerospace, appliance and other companies with little extra cash to pay to shareholders. 
 The General Motors Corporation, the nation's largest car maker, cut its quarterly payout Monday nearly by half -- a step that Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman, called "an extremely difficult decision." The Ford Motor Company, which put off its dividend decision for a few months, and the Chrysler Corporation are expected to follow G.M.'s lead.
On Tuesday, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the aerospace and defense company, trimmed its regular payment to shareholders. And yesterday, the Maytag Corporation, the big appliance maker, and the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company cut their dividends sharply.
Until now, the beleaguered banking industry was the most notable dividend-cutter, as bankers searched for ways to conserve cash and raise capital. Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Manufacturers Hanover and others lowered their payouts in the last couple of months, saving funds to offset problems with bad loans.
"There is a tremendous squeeze these days," said Arnold Kaufman, editor of Standard & Poor's Outlook newsletter, which tracks dividend trends. "Profits are no longer high enough to pay for dividends at many companies."
Dividend costs at many companies are high these days, thanks to a run-up in profits and an outpouring of corporate largesse in the 1980's. The generous payments were partly to buy the loyalty of shareholders and thus discourage corporate raiders. Such was the ethos of the 1980's that even companies facing no imminent threat were under pressure from shareholders to pass out cash.
The Commerce Department estimates that American corporations paid out 44 percent of their pretax profits in dividends last year, up from 23 percent in 1980.
Strong business conditions often made those decisions easier. But in many cases, corporations loaded up on debt while dividends were rising. This brought a decline in retained earnings as companies doled out more to shareholders while making higher interest payments.
Thus, an increasing share of profit was diverted from reinvestment in factories, training or research on new products. At a time when international competition is intensifying and some of America's leading rivals, notably the Japanese, pay meager dividends and invest heavily, many analysts find this trend disturbing and a threat to the nation's economic growth.
"We should be running American companies for the long term," said Joseph L. Bower, a professor and director of research at the Harvard Business School. "Companies should be creating opportunities for growth and investment rather than paying out their funds as dividends."
 
Matter of Dispute
 Dividend policy is a matter of lively dispute, both in board rooms and academia. One camp contends that dividends should be modest-sized and flexible, if they are paid at all. Exponents of this view point to growing high-technology companies, which often pay no dividends and spend heavily on research and investment.
The Intel Corporation, for example, a $3.9-billion-a-year maker of semiconductors, has never paid a dividend. The company, whose stock trades over the counter, considered a dividend last year, but decided against it, choosing to bolster its share price instead by purchasing some of its own shares. Intel recently announced that it would spend up to $1 billion this year on new plants and equipment.
"We have opportunities for growth inside this company, and that is where we're putting our money," said Robert Reed, the company's chief financial officer.
 
Discipline for Management
 But others argue that dividend payments are a healthy discipline for corporate managements. The need to pay ample dividends, they say, helps force companies to take the steps necessary to cut costs and become more efficient. Besides, they add, shareholders are better able to make objective investment decisions than are corporate managements.
One of Mr. Bower's colleagues at the Harvard Business School, Prof. Michael C. Jensen, is an outspoken proponent of this view. He notes that there is a "casual relationship" between high-growth technology companies and low dividend payments, but stresses that that should not lead people to conclude that companies that hold onto funds will invest them productively.
"The issue is not that our corpoations spend too little on new equipment or research and development, but that the money is being wasted," Professor Jensen said. "Unless we go to extraordinary lengths, the managements will keep the money within the corporations and invest it on things that are by and large unprofitable for the shareholders and for society."
 
2 Contrasting Cases
 Avon Products Inc. yesterday took an extraordinary step reminiscent of the 1980's, increasing its annual dividend 40 percent. It also said it would pay out a special dividend of $3 a share, more than a year's worth of profits. The move was intended to please shareholders and help management win a threatened proxy fight.
Maytag, by contrast, appears to be a case of a company that is paying for the excesses of the 1980's with its dividend cut, from 90 cents to 50 cents a year. Maytag grew nearly fivefold since 1985, to $3.1 billion in sales last year, with a series of acquisitions. But it borrowed heavily, and long-term debt jumped 35-fold in the period, to $845 million last year.
Daniel J. Krumm, Maytag's chairman, said the dividend cut was "the prudent thing to do" in the current recession, allowing the company to conserve cash and continue "vital capital spending programs."
When G.M. decided earlier this week to cut its dividend, it also announced cuts in spending and in its work force. Robert T. O'Connell, G.M.'s chief financial officer and an executive vice president, stressed that the move was motivated by the need to keep capital spending at $7 billion a year through 1994 and "stay the course aggressively on our new product program."
 
Informing Big Shareholders
 Before the board meeting in New York on Monday at which the dividend cut was decided upon, G.M. had been in contact with some of its big shareholders, explaining the compay's concerns about the soft economy and the need to keep up the pace of new-model development.
"Nobody likes to see the dividend cut," Mr. O'Connell said, "but there was a great measure of understanding in the investor community."
DeWitt Bowman, chief investment officer of the California Public Employees Retirement System, one of the nation's largest institutional investors and a major holder of G.M. stock, supported the company's moves.
"We were pleased to see the dividend cut and the other actions," he said. "The company could not bleed money the way they were and continue their basic manufacturing."
Mr. Bowman said that he regarded dividends as good corporate discipline, however, and that he preferred to have the money to invest where he saw fit and not in the hands of management.
 
Changing Market Reaction
 Traditionally, a company's share price drops sharply after a dividend cut -- a key reason why managements typically resist making the move. Managements often also feel obligated to small shareholders, especially retirees who rely on dividends to pay household expenses.
But G.M.'s stock has held steady since the company cut its payout, and market analysts and investors say that similar reactions to dividend cuts of other companies recently were a sign that the accepted wisdom may no longer hold.
"That's a big change in market perception," said Peter L. Bernstein, a Wall Street economist.
Increasingly, analysts say, the stock market's reaction to a dividend cut will be determined by the motivation and strategy behind the change.
"What is critical in the decision to cut a dividend or not pay one is the credibility of the management," said Ennius Bergsma, a director of McKinsey & Company, a management consultant.
 
Part of a Strategy
 The Occidental Petroleum Corporation recently provided an example of a dividend cut made as part of a larger strategy. In January, a month after the company's longtime chairman, Armand Hammer, died, the company said it would cut its dividend from $2.50 a year to $1. The dividend reduction was part of the new management's program to reduce debt and focus on its oil and chemicals businesses. Occidental's share price rose after the announcement.
"Occidental's dividend cut was a model of how it should be done, because it came in the context of a clear strategic vision that was articulated by the management," said Bryan Jacoboski, an analyst at Paine Webber Group.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: JORDAN;
2 Risky Gambles for Jordan's Ruler

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Feb. 7

 BODY:
In a region whose political bazaar rarely fixes absolute prices and where reality is filtered through emotional perceptions, King Hussein has taken two gambles by aligning himself with Iraq.
 The first bet is that by supporting the Iraqis, the Jordanian King can contain and continue to lead his restive domestic constituency without forfeiting his longstanding ties to the West. That seems a safer bet than the other gamble: that he can win wider Arab support in a region splintered by the allied offensive against Baghdad. 
 Both bets hinge on competing notions of Arab legitimacy that are likely to determine the credibility of Arab leaders and the direction of their politics, however the gulf war is concluded.
Addressing his nation on television on Wednesday night, King Hussein transformed Jordan's tilt toward Iraq into an open embrace, depicting the United States and its allies as the lineal successors of European imperialists out to destroy Arab pride and mold the region to their will.
Iraq, he said, is "defending us all" against the intruders.
 
Arabs Against the West
 In this vision, President Saddam Hussein's battered Iraqi nation becomes the bulwark of Arab aspirations, not the brutalizer of Kuwait. It is a political vision that looks beyond the occupation of Kuwait to the region's perennial battle against alien intruders.
The Jordanian ruler's intention, Western and other specialists say, is to reassert control of his own troubled land, in which more than half the population is Palestinian, Many here are frustrated, and eager to grasp at Iraqi promises of Palestinian statehood and Arab redemption.
"As he has done throughout the crisis, his intention was to get out ahead of the street," said an Arab diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity, referring to a Jordanian public that sees the Iraqi President as a champion.
There were some nuances. While King Hussein did not allude to the invasion of Kuwait at any point in his 30-minute address, he did not mention Saddam Hussein by name, either. Moreover, he spoke repeatedly of the imminent destruction of Iraq, perhaps hinting to Jordanians that they may well have to contemplate the defeat of an Arab leader who stature has grown here as the war has unfolded.
 
Ties to U.S. at Risk
 Yet, by setting the markers of domestic politics, the King risked further alienating the United States and jeopardizing his personal relationship with President Bush, who had asked the King for a public expression of understanding for America's views.
That was part of the first, more certain gamble: Washington, the King calculated, would understand his predicament at home and would not wish to cut off communication with an Arab leader who has during 37 years in power, played an important role in much of Washington's Middle East diplomacy.
The second gamble, far riskier, suggested a calculation that the only Arab leaders likely to emerge from the gulf war with credibility and legitimacy would be those who did not collaborate in the spilling of Arab blood by infidels.
"It is very difficult for anyone who has been party to the war camp to have a real say in the future," said Ibrahim Izzedine, Jordan's Information Minister and a former ambassador to Washington. "You have to have credibility." By "war camp," he meant Arab countries supporting the American-led coalition in the gulf, notably Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
 
'Symbols for Legitimacy'
 "In any society there are some symbols for legitimacy to influence and to continue to influence decisions. You can't do it if you put yourself in the war camp," Mr. Izzedine said.
Western European diplomats acknowledged that such an the argument exerts a strong pull. Syria supported non-Arab Iran against Arab Iraq throughout the 1980-88 war, one envoy noted, and "paid the price of Arab isolation for doing so."
In his speech, the Jordanian King singled out Egypt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, all staunch United States allies, as countries that had brought shame upon Islam by supporting the United States in what he called the destruction of an Arab nation: Iraq.
King Hussein's words might be viewed as a careless, even reckless, move to alienate neighbors, particularly Saudi Arabia, whose oil wealth potentially could rescue Jordan's sinking economy.
But Mr. Izzedine said Amman's view was that as the war unfolds, more and more Arabs and Muslims will feel repelled by the allied offensive. "I don't think it's going to be accepted by any Arab," he said, seemingly implying that many would turn against Governments supporting the allied war effort.
 
Appeal to the Masses
 The King may ultimately be reaching past the leaders of some Arab governments to build a broad consituency among their peoples. Mr. Izzedine pointed to the historical role played by the King's Hashemite dynasty, once the custodian of Islam's holiest shrines in what is now Saudi Arabia.
"The King belongs to a historic family," the Information Miniter said. "He believes he has a historic responsibility. His family has played a very important role in the Arab world and in shaping public opinion that goes beyond the borders of any state."
Although the King's statement seemed unequivocally pro-Iraqi, it did not commit him to specific action. Despite his abandonment of political neutrality, there was no suggestion that Jordan wishes to enter the war.
"We are not party to the conflict and we are not going to be drawn in," Mr Izzedine said. Moreoever, he said, Jordan still supports the return of "legitimacy" in Kuwait and has not abandoned its earlier position criticizing the Iraqi invasion.
The timing of King Hussein's speech, reflected his concern that the intensity of the allied onslaught might soon preclude any peace initiative.
"The basic message he tried to send," a high-ranking official said, "was that he would like to see an Iraq-American dialogue and an Arab-Arab dialogue. It would be impossible for him to see Baghdad destroyed."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: WASHINGTON;
U.S. Says It Is Reviewing Aid to Jordan

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
The Bush Administration announced today that it was reviewing all of its economic aid to Jordan after a speech by King Hussein in which he seemed to abandon his professed neutrality in the Persian Gulf war and threw his support behind Iraq.
"We are reviewing all military and economic assistance to Jordan," the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said. The announcement came after President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d conferred on the issue this afternoon. 
 In fiscal 1990, Jordan received $102 million in economic and military aid from the United States. In fiscal 1991, which began last October, it received $57.2 million -- $20 million in military assistance, $35 million in economic assistance and $2.2 million in training programs.
Officials said Jordan's 1991 allocation now being dispersed would not be affected. The review would apply to how much money Jordan might be allocated in fiscal year 1992, which starts next Oct. 1. The fiscal 1992 foreign aid allotments are only now being drawn up, but officials said Jordan was scheduled to receive roughly the same $50 million before the review.
The aid to Jordan could either be reduced, eliminated altogether or maintained at its present level.
 
Official Protest Lodged
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker, while they still have some sympathy for the difficult predicament in which King Hussein finds himself, decided that his latest speech was so "gratuitously" anti-American that they simply could not let it stand without at least a symbolic rejoinder, an Administration official said.
The Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, John H. Kelly, summoned Jordan's Ambassador to Washington to the State Department on Wednesday night to lodge an official protest.
In his speech, the Jordanian King, most of whose subjects are Palestinians, declared that the allied war effort was directed against "all Muslims and not against Iraq alone" and is aimed at establishing "foreign hegemony" over the Middle East and destroying "brotherly Iraq."
Before the gulf crisis, King Hussein was considered not only a longtime friend of the United States but a personal friend of Mr. Bush. The Amman Government has long been viewed as a voice for moderation in Arab-Israeli affairs, a strategic buffer between Israel and Iraq and a bulwark against a Palestinian state in Jordan.
 
Quandary for Washington
 King Hussein's steady drift into Iraq's orbit has put the Bush Administration in something of a quandary, which was reflected in today's decision to review aid, but not necessarily to slash it. To put it simply, Administration officials say, increasingly they can't live with King Hussein, but they can't live without him either.
While they are deeply disturbed by his increasingly strident support for Iraq, Administration officials say, the only alternative to King Hussein that seems likely to emerge would be a Jordan dominated by the Palestine Liberation Organization, and that, they say, would be even worse. Given a choice between a King Hussein who is espousing the slogans of the P.L.O. and Iraq, or a Jordan dominated by the P.L.O. itself, Washington still prefers King Hussein as the lesser of two evils, officials said.
"We have a major disagreement with the King and what he said in that speech and the position that he has taken," Mr. Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today, when asked for his reaction to the Jordanian King's speech.
"To allege that our effort against Iraq is unjust and exceeds the U.N. resolution is something that is patently not true," Mr. Baker added. "We have repeatedly emphasized that our objective is not the destruction of Iraq, it is the liberation of Kuwait, and quite frankly we find it very sad that the King omitted in this rather long speech any reference whatsoever, not one single reference, to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and omitted any reference therefore to any call for withdrawal."
Mr. Baker said the Administration intended to "keep lines of communication open to the King notwithstanding the fact that he's on the wrong side and we have a major disagreement here with him."
That is because, Mr. Baker said, "when we look at alternatives we don't see what we perceive to be a particularly pretty picture -- alternatives to the King, and therefore we would not -- we would think that it's important to keep our lines of communication open and to make it clear to him and to that Government that we fundamentally disagree with that position."

HEADLINE: January Sales Data Reflect Continued Retail Weakness

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Leading retailers reported generally disappointing results for January, creating concern over profits in the final quarter and the year as a whole.
Twelve of the 19 largest chains announcing their results had declines or minimal gains at stores open at least a year, a category known as same-store sales, Some, like Sears, Roebuck & Company, the nation's largest, and the J. C. Penney Company, No. 4, had overall sales declines, including new stores. Wal-Mart, though, showed strong sales growth. 
 If the year appeared to end with a whimper, retail analysts noted that the sluggish trend had endured all year, although it worsened after the war began.
 
'Havoc' on the Consumer
 "The January results reflect the havoc that was created by the Mideast war on the American consumer," said Kurt Barnard, a New York retail analyst and newsletter publisher.
While January is historically the year's second-smallest monthly contributor to annual apparel sales, 6 percent compared with December's 14 percent, analysts noted that it was an important month because it represented a final effort to clear out inventory for the benefit of year-end profits.
"The sales reported by the big retailers confirm the continued weakness in spending for discretionary items, a trend in place even before Iraq invaded Kuwait," said Janet Mangano, research vice president at Jesup, Josephthal & Company in New York.
Despite its disappointing results, Sears managed to maintain a small lead over the fast-running Wal-Mart Stores. The K Mart Corporation, enjoying a relatively good month, stayed ahead of Wal-Mart in January, but it fell under Wal-Mart's yearly total.
At J. C. Penney, the chairman, William R. Howell, said catalogue demand was off substantially but store sales increased in January.
Indicating a broad-based consumer shopping lag, department store chains experienced a difficult month.
"We remain very conservative in our planning for 1991 in view of the uncertainties in this economic environment." said Kenneth A. Macke, chairman of the Dayton Hudson Corporation.
In evaluating the results, Mr. Barnard and Ms. Mangano said the best results were turned in by "value oriented" retailers, like Wal-Mart and Venture Stores. Mr. Barnard added, "The best ones also have attractive merchandise and pleasing shopping environments."
Ms. Mangano said, "The results show steady demand at those value-oriented retailers that offer commodity items at everyday low prices."
 
Results Vary
 But results at discounters varied sharply. Venture said its January sales rose 10.4 percent, to $78.2 million, and its same-store sales were up 6.2 percent, while its annual sales increased 6.1 percent, to $1.42 billion. But the Jamesway Corporation had 2 percent higher sales in January, to $33.4 million, and same-store sales, considered a more accurate indicator of retailing performance, fell 4 percent.
The specialty shop field, with eight big companies, had mixed results with the Limited Inc., the Melville Corporation, the Neiman Marcus Group, Ross Stores Inc. and Charming Shoppes Inc. reporting slow same-store sales. But new store expansion seemed to help, with Melville, the Limited, and the Gap Inc. reporting stronger overall sales. Merry-Go-Round Enterprises was up 30 percent, and Edison Brothers Stores had a 15.6 percent gain in the month.

The Economy
The common stock dividend is being sliced. With profits shrinking as the recession digs in, the nation's auto, aerospace, appliance and other companies are left with little extra cash to pay to shareholders. Thus another of the corporate excesses of the 1980's is being reversed. [Page A1.]
Leading retailers reported generally disappointing results for January, creating concern over profits in the final quarter and the year as a whole. Twelve of the 19 largest chains announcing their results had same-store declines or minimal gains. [D1.]
Former F.D.I.C. regulators told a Congressional hearing that for more than a year their superiors had thwarted their efforts to recover large losses from the billionaire owner of a Phoenix savings and loan that failed. [D2.]
"An invitation to regulatory civil war." That is what William Seidman calls the Administration's radical plan to change the way banks are run. As head of the F.D.I.C., Seidman stands to lose some of his extensive power under the new bank plan. [D2.]
Consumer credit fell at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in December, the steepest decline in nearly four years, the Fed said. [D3.]
New York City bonds are likely to be issued without insurance backing for the first time in years. [B3.]
 
Companies
Chrysler surprised Wall Street by posting a $31 million profit in the fourth quarter in the face of plunging car and truck sales. But its profit was too narrow to quiet growing concerns that the No. 3 auto maker may soon face severe financial difficulties. [D1.]
Avon said it would increase its dividend 40 percent and pay a special dividend of $3 a share, or more than a year's profits. Analysts said the surprise move could help it win a coming proxy fight with Chartwell Associates. [D1.]
MIPS Computer Systems has emerged as one of two leaders in the race to sell computers based on the RISC chip design. [D1.]
Sony is reportedy talking to Orion Pictures about buying that financially troubled film and TV company. Sony is said to be acting through Castle Rock Entertainment, a small film production company one-third owned by Columbia Pictures. [D1.]

A team trying to arrange an employee stake in The Daily News met to lay out its strategy. [B4.]
 
Markets
Prices in the credit markets gave ground for the first time in days, as market participants apparently took profits after a successful auction of $11 billion in new 30-year Treasury bonds. [D1.]
Stocks fell for the first time in almost a week, but trading remained exceptionally heavy. The Dow lost 20.30, to 2,810.64, as many investors switched into lower-priced stocks. [D6.]
The dollar edged higher in domestic trading for the first time in more than a week after two central banks intervened to shore up the currency. [D13.]
Oil prices fell after a rally driven by the price of heating oil faded on forecasts of warmer weather in Europe. [D13.]

'Gypsy' Returning
The Tony Award winner Tyne Daly is coming back to Broadway as Mama Rose when "Gypsy" reopens on April 23 for a 12-week engagement, this time at the Marquis Theater. The producers, Barry and Fran Weissler, previously announced that a company headed by Miss Daly, who played the role for nine months on Broadway last season, would open in London in late spring. But those plans were made before the war in the Persian Gulf began. 
 Mr. Weissler says: "Some people in the company have expressed concern about flying certain airlines. And if a ground war starts now, will anyone come to the theater? I want to be where I can take care of the show, especially if you can expect surprises. To do it all by phone makes me uncomfortable." He says he hopes to open "Gypsy" in London next fall.
 
No Reservation? No Problem.
 The war and the recession have hit the theater hard, and along with it the restaurants in the theater district, whose business depends on how many hits are up and running. Out of 36 Broadway theaters, 17 are dark. And according to the grosses reported in Variety, many of the 19 shows now running are doing weak business. Perhaps the most sobering proof is last Wednesday's matinee of "The Phantom of the Opera." The show actually "went dead" with about 140 tickets, meaning that for the first time since the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical opened, seats went unsold.
The restaurants near 45th Street seem to be hardest hit. The block between Broadway and Eighth Avenue has always been considered the prime booking location on Broadway. But now, four of its six theaters are empty.
Vincent Sardi Jr., who owns his family's restaurant on 44th Street, says: "There was an instant reaction the day the war started. We are missing the foreign businessmen and travelers. They've practically disappeared. We went through all kinds of paperwork to be able to accept JAL, a Japanese credit card, and we haven't even used it yet."
Joe Allen, who owns the restaurant named for him, as well as Orso, both on 46th Street, confirms that foreign business is way down. Hunter Cain, a manager at Sam's on 52d Street, says his pre- and post-theater business is off, but not as drastically as that of his competitors in the mid-40's. He attributes his better fortune to his restaurant's being on the same street as the strong "City of Angels" and "Jackie Mason: Brand New." He also says he expects a big increase when the heavily pre-sold "Miss Saigon" opens at the Broadway Theater at 53d Street in April.
Other restaurateurs in the mid-40's are eagerly awaiting Neil Simon's "Lost in Yonkers," scheduled to open at the Richard Rodgers Theater on 46th Street on Feb. 21. Mr. Allen says, "Neil Simon doesn't realize the awesome responsibility he has to save a whole neighborhood."
 
Not for the Drama League
 Arthur Kopit's new play at the Circle Repertory Theater, "Road to Nirvana," starring Peter Riegert and Saundra Santiago, is already causing debate even though it doesn't open until March 7. The work is about two film producers who will do anything to make the ultimate deal, and the theater's artistic director, Tanya Berezin, calls it shocking. The script calls for the characters to eat feces, she says, and "there's lots of sex." She adds, "It's harsh, but also hilarious."
Apparently, Julia Hansen, president of the Drama League, fails to see the humor. Her nonprofit organization, which administers a variety of programs and special events for its members, sponsors a subscription series that, she says, "encourages them to be imaginative and see work that's entertaining and interesting, to keep educated about the theater and be as supportive as they can be." Circle Rep has kept those members entertained in the past, but after the Drama League's marketing director requested a script of "Road to Nirvana," Ms. Berezin was told that the play was "not for their audience."
In response, Ms. Berezin says she wrote Mrs. Hansen a note saying she was surprised at the reaction. Ms. Berezin says the note went un answered. Mrs. Hansen would not say whether the "Nirvana" script had been read and rejected. She would say only that the Drama League chose plays at the WPA and Second Stage theaters instead. The reason: one of the Drama League's programs, the Director's Project, had participants working on productions there.
Ms. Berezin says: "When I committed to do this play, I knew I would not want people to bring their 8-year-olds. Whoever we lose, we lose. That's what risk is all about."
 
'Earth and Sky' and Hollywood
 Hollywood's latest obsession is Douglas Post. The 30-year-old playwright's "Earth and Sky" opened at the Second Stage on Monday. Although critics' responses were mixed, the consensus among film and television executives is that this thriller about a woman's investigation into her lover's mysterious death, with its tour de force leading role, played by Jennifer Van Dyke, is hot with a capital H. (Michelle Pfeiffer and Jodie Foster are already being mentioned for a film version.) Second Stage subscribers have sat next to representatives of Columbia Pictures, Paramount, M-G-M, Universal, Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox, Orion, TriBeCa (Robert De Niro's company) and the director-producers James Brooks, Norman Jewison and Alan J. Pakula.
Helen Harvey, Mr. Post's agent, says no deal has yet been made. Robyn Goodman, co-artistic director of Second Stage, says a sale was delayed until the play opened so there wouldn't be extra pressure on Mr. Post during his first New York production. "All you have to do with Hollywood people is say no," she says, "and here they all are."
 
Casting Notes
 Steve Guttenberg takes over the lead role in "Prelude to a Kiss" at the Helen Hayes Theater on March 19 and will stay until at least June 16, joining Ashley Crowe and John Randolph, who recently replaced Barnard Hughes. . . . "The Substance of Fire," by Jon Robin Baitz, will start performances at Playwrights Horizons on March 1 with Maria Tucci, Sarah Jessica Parker, Ron Rifkin, Jon Tenney and Patrick Breen. Daniel Sullivan will direct. . . . Zohra Lampert has been cast in Elaine May's "Mr. Gogol and Mr. Preen," which is to open at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater in May, with Mike Nussbaum and W. H. Macy. Gregory Mosher will direct.

GRAPHIC: Photo: "Still Spoofing"
 To celebrate the 1,000th performance at Theater East of "Forbidden Broadway," the satirical revue of Broadway shows, the 1991 cast and alumni are making a new recording of the show's highlights, including "Annie Today," played by Suzanne Blakeslee (above), and a spoof of Patti LuPone in "Anything Goes" called "I Get a Kick Out of Me." The recording goes on sale in March. (Carol Rosegg/Martha Swope Associates/Theater East)

Potato People
Dalton School
108 East 89th Street
Manhattan
(212) 744-1649
Recommended ages: 3 to 12
Tomorrow
The Potato People wear papier-mache masks with no mouths, yet they manage to convey their slapstick humor and antics through mime and exaggerated body language and with the help of a Madonna tune or two. Indeed, you might wonder why it's so hard for your children to express themselves sometimes after you spend an hour with the Potato People. Produced by the Theater Beyond Words in Ontario, Canada, formerly the Canadian Mime Theater, the company has toured extensively through its own country, the United States and even the Soviet Union, where potatoes are almost a natural resource. The main characters are indolent Poppa Potato, Momma Potato in her curlers and blue slippers, and Nancy Potato, an overgrown 3-year-old. Momma and Poppa are a domestic Laurel and Hardy, providing a lot of self-mocking fun, though Nancy garners a round of giggles when she blows her nose like a trumpet. The Martin Theater at the Dalton School holds 500 people, so the stage is close and seating is democratic. There is no intermission and no refreshments are served. Strollers can be left in the school's central lobby. Tickets are $7.50.
 
The Ice Studio
1034 Lexington Avenue, at 73d Street
(212) 535-0304
Recommended ages: 4 and up
Archie Walker, a former skater with the Ice Capades, is the effusive owner of this dance-studio-size indoor rink, which has been here 14 years. The smallish rink, with its large windows and ballet barres, is separated by a glass wall from the reception area, where wooden benches draw parents who aren't up to skating but who want to watch and relax. On a recent Saturday, the studio was not at all crowded, and the intimate atmosphere was one of calm civility: just right for the Upper East Side. Lessons, a coat check and a restroom are available. Hours for general skating are 8:30 to 10 P.M. on Thursdays; 5 to 6 P.M. and 8:30 to 10 P.M. on Fridays, and noon to 1 P.M. and 5:15 to 6:15 P.M. on weedends. On Sundays, an additional session from 3:15 to 4:15 P.M. is available. Admission: $5 for one hour; $6 for an hour and a half. Skate rental: $2.75.

Tomorrow
 As part of the Happy Concerts for Young People, series the Little Orchestra Society of Manhattan is presenting the No Elephant Circus, a troupe of jugglers, dancers, acrobats and clowns that tours with symphony orchestras. Under the baton of Dino Anagnost, who takes the time to talk to the young audience about the music the orchestra is playing, the wily circus performers eat fire, walk on stilts and clown on unicyles. They just don't have any elephants. No matter. The rousing circus-theme music, by such composers as Copland, Dvorak and Bizet, excites the audience just as well, conjuring up images of cotton candy, calliopes, sawdust and far-flung aerialists. Tickets to the 50-minute programs, which are performed without intermissions, are $15 to $28, at the Avery Fisher Hall box office or through the telephone numbers above. Fisher Hall is a worldly yet comfortable place, with restrooms on each floor, elevators, two restaurants and a snack bar selling muffins, cookies, sandwiches and drinks in the lobby before and after the performances, which begin at 11 A.M. and 1 P.M. Children dress up in suits and patent-leather shoes, but casual clothes fit in, too.

(212) 247-4777 or (212) 307-7171
Recommended ages: 2 and up
Through Sunday
Mickey may have starred in more than 130 films and hundreds of stage, television and video events, but at 60 years old he is just approaching his prime. His low-key, almost modest manner has not changed since his debut in "Steamboat Willie." In fact, he seems a bit shy at this current event at Radio City celebrating his birthday. Dressed in red satin pants, a black topcoat with tails and mouse skates, Mickey amiably shares the limelight with Goofy, Pluto, Donald, Daisy and Minnie. There is certainly enough stage time, with 2 acts and 11 short scenes, for Mickey's cohorts and other Disney characters to skate in skits from such stories as "Steamboat Willie," "Sorcerer's Apprentice" and "Puppy Love." Though most of the audience may not have seen the first "Puppy Love," which made its debut in 1933, they will appreciate seeing how Mickey and Minnie first met. For the most part, children are riveted for the two hours as they bask in the aura of Mickey Mouse, which is important because many acts lack complete narratives or theatrical direction. The scenes in the second act are slightly more cohesive and dramatic. In "The Land Above the Clouds," for example, a giant's moving hand makes the children suitably uneasy, if not impressed. What is lacking is made up for by the lavish pure Walt Disney sets and costumes, as well as the computerized lighting that adds tension to many scenes. A 20-minute intermission is welcome, if only to note the bustle at the souvenir stands in the lobby, where the recession seems to have been thoroughly snuffed out. Strollers are checked by the kindly ushers, and elevators can whisk you upstairs if the main staircase is too daunting. Tickets are $14 and $18, and show times are at 2:30 and 7 P.M. today; at 11 A.M., 2:30 and 7 P.M. tomorrow, and at 11 A.M. and 2:30 P.M. on Sunday.
 
North Meadow Recreation Center
Central Park
96th Street and Central Park West entrance
(212) 348-4867
Recommended ages: 8 and up
Saturdays and Sundays
Follow the concrete path midway through the park to a pair of low, red-brick buildings sitting on a slope. The North Meadow Recreation Center is in the building on the left, but you have to walk through an army of bright green park vehicles in the courtyard to get to its front door. The Central Park Conservancy and the New York City Department of Recreation and Parks sponsor the center's weekday and weekend activities for boys and girls; on Saturdays, Tony Velez is in charge; on Sundays, Ron Green runs the show. Depending on the weather and the number of people who come and what their mood is, the day could consist of football (touch or tackle), basketball, kite flying, paddle ball and handball on the clean athletic fields and handball courts. Inside the airy one-room center, with its trussed ceiling and large windows, quieter pursuits like Ping-Pong, bingo, board games and macrame take place. The center provides all the equipment free. No food is available, and on the weekends after dark there is no formal arrangement to escort people out of the park, though most walk home at the same time or in groups. The hours are 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. on the weekends and 3:15 to 5:45 P.M. on weekdays. Registration is necessary, and can be done any day.

Trump Plans to Meet With Arum and Duva

 BODY:
Donald Trump said yesterday he would meet tomorrow with the co-promoters Bob Arum and Dan Duva in an effort to iron out any differences that might jeopardize the heavyweight title fight between Evander Holyfield and George Foreman.
The bout is scheduled to be held at the Atlantic City Convention Center on April 19, but Arum says he might have to shift the match to Las Vegas if Trump persists in trying to re-negotiate his deal for the live-site rights.
Arum said yesterday that he had spoken to representatives of Caesars Palace about moving the fight there, following assertions on Wednesday by Trump that an "act of war" clause in his contract gave him the right to revise the deal.
Trump, who agreed to pay $3.5 million and guarantee another $7.5 million in gate receipts for the right to stage the fight in Atlantic City, said the war in the Persian Gulf had altered the economic climate for the bout and he wanted to reduce his site fee. But Arum said Trump was raising false issues to cloud the fact that he could not meet the next installment of $2.5 million due the promoters tomorrow.
"He's breached the contract by saying what he has said," Arum said. "Now he can cure the breach by putting up the money. If he doesn't, this fight's going to end up at Caesars Palace."
Arum said that money, or Trump's lack of it, was the real issue, and that the deal for the live-site rights had been signed Jan. 19, three days after the war started.
Trump contends that the fight cannot be moved without his approval. "The fight stays," said Trump, "or else there will be a lot of litigation."

HEADLINE: A Gas Tax Could Nip the Next Crisis in the Bud

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Perhaps the greatest benefit the war in the Middle East could provide is to rouse us into a sensible energy policy. A gas tax could help avert the next crisis before it begins.
If we're willing to send half a million fellow citizens into battle, to protect oil supplies and our economic way of life, we should be no less willing to make the small sacrifice of paying more for gasoline. A revenue-neutral plan that reduced Social Security taxes by $1 billion for every penny a gallon of gas tax would leave the working poor and middle class better off than before. In the long term, the whole country would benefit from reducing the hidden tax of pollution, congestion and dependence on foreign oil.
With oil prices now down substantially, let's not squander this opportunity to win the next war without firing a shot.

HEADLINE: U.N. Force Offers Israeli-Palestinian Solution;
Peace Treaty Now

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A. M. Rosenthal argues ("Bill of Reckoning," column, Jan. 22) that the Iraqi Scud attacks on Israel prove the case for continuing the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Had the missiles come from the West Bank, he writes, they could have been equipped with larger or more dangerous warheads and would have caused more damage. The opposite is more nearly the case.
As the Israeli novelist A. B. Yehoshua has pointed out, the Scud attacks simply confirm that the concept of strategic depth is largely obsolete and that only a political solution can assure Israel's security.
Now more than ever, Israel needs a peace treaty with the Palestinians. Withdrawal from the West Bank is no longer the traumatic issue it was a few years ago: as a result of the Palestinian uprising, it has already happened. The pre-1967 border is back in place, the integration of the Israeli economy with the occupied territories has been largely reversed, and the historic sites where the Jewish people first became a nation are essentially inaccessible anyway. The price of withdrawal has been paid; it is time to reap some of the benefits.
A peace treaty would not result in the nightmare of Iraq-on-the-Jordan. A treaty would require that the West Bank be a demilitarized zone, with only a police force and no offensive capacities. Neither tanks nor poison gas plants are easily hidden in an unindustrialized country with interested neighbors no more than a few miles away. Any attempt at a military buildup would be detected by Israel, which could immediately respond -- before the buildup reached dangerous levels. The contrast to Iraq, which built the world's fourth or fifth largest army with the active or passive support of nearly every major country in the developed world, could not be stronger.
Indeed, a Palestinian government would have the strongest possible incentive to protect Israeli security. Today, Palestinians in the Persian Gulf, Jordan and the West Bank are loudly calling for Saddam Hussein to bombard Tel Aviv with everything he has. But after a peace treaty, a Palestinian government would have to restrain its people: terror coming from the Palestinian territory would invite a fearful response from Israel. Underlying all Palestinian strategic decisions would be the certain knowledge that if Israel were forced to invade to protect its domestic security, there would never be a second withdrawal.
Meanwhile, the Israeli army would be freed of the demoralizing task of policing a hostile occupied population and could concentrate on insuring that its antimissile defenses are ready and functional before the next distant madman decides that the most effective way to fight the United States army is to bomb Israeli civilians. Israel could concentrate its resources and energies on building its own democracy by integrating the Russian and Ethiopian immigrants -- newcomers who want to be part of the state -- instead of policing hostile Palestinians, who do not. Even a cold peace, like the one Israel has with Egypt, would allow Israelis to return to the national mission of building a democratic state in the land of Israel.

HEADLINE: Aryness Wickens, 90, Economist Who Developed Major Cost Index

BYLINE: By GLENN FOWLER

 BODY:
Aryness Joy Wickens, an economist and statistician who played the crucial role in developing the Government's cost-of-living index, now the Consumer Price Index, died last Saturday at the Lakeland Health Care Center in Jackson, Miss. She was 90 years old and lived in Jackson.
She died of a heart attack, her family said. 
 Mrs. Wickens retired from the Department of Labor in 1970 after a 42-year career in Fderal service that began when she joined the Federal Reserve Board as a research assistant in 1928 after having taught at Mount Holyoke College for four years.
In 1933 she served on a committee organized by the American Statistical Association to advise Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins on setting up the Bureau of Labor Statistics program. A few years later she directed the bureau's studies for the Temporary National Economic Committee's investigation of monopolistic practices in industry.
When the bureau was reorganized in 1940, Mrs. Wickens became chief of the branch studying prices and the cost of living. From 1946 to 1961 she was assistant and then deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics.
In 1952 she was president of the American Statistical Association. Eight years later, in recognition of her outstanding Government service, she was one of six recipients of the first Federal Women's Awards of the Civil Service Commission.
 
Adviser at U.N. Conferences
 In 1961, after having been a United States adviser at many United Nations and other international conferences, Mrs. Wickens was named economic adviser to the Secretary of Labor. In that post she laid the statistical base for what became the department's Manpower Administration and its Employment and Training Administration.
After retirement Mrs. Wickens served on the advisory board of the United States Export-Import Bank. In 1976 she returned to government work as director of statistical studies for the Commission on Federal Paperwork.
Mrs. Wickens was born in Bellingham, Wash. She was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Washington and held a master's degree from the University of Chicago. She lived near Vienna, Va., before moving to Jackson four years ago.
Her husband, David L. Wickens, an economist, died in 1970. She is survived by a son, Donaldson, of Jackson, and three grandsons.

HEADLINE: CHENEY FORESEES NEW SOVIET UNREST

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told Congress today that he foresaw "continued economic decline" and "increased unrest" in the Soviet Union. As a result, he said in his exceedingly bleak assessment, the Administration may reconsider its request for reductions in military spending over the next six years.
 "The possibility for major unrest may be such that we would not feel safe recommending to the Congress of the United States the kind of long-term six-year reductions" in military spending requested by President Bush in his latest budget, Mr. Cheney said. The budget was sent to Congress three days ago. 
Mr. Cheney's comments, in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, were the clearest statement to date of his might implode and that the Administration might have to rethink Pentagon spending plans.
 "The Warsaw Pact is dead," and "the Soviets will continue to withdraw from Eastern Europe," but "the Soviet economy is collapsing," Mr. Cheney said.
 Moreover, he said: "We have to plan on enormous uncertainty about developments inside the Soviet Union in the future. I have to believe there will be continued economic decline, that that means increased unrest and the possibility which Soviets frankly discuss among themselves, perhaps even of civil war in the Soviet Union."
 Thus, Mr. Cheney said, "the greatest threat to the neighbors of the Soviet Union in the future may well come more from the Soviet inability to control events inside the Soviet Union than it will from any conscious policy of seeking to expand their influence by military means."
 Mr. Cheney did not say precisely how such a threat might emerge. Some experts on Soviet affairs have expressed concern that if the Soviet Union drifted into chaos, nuclear weapons and other military equipment might fall into the hands of irresponsible people.
 "Violent disintegration of the Soviet Union may create terrible convulsions outside the Soviet Union," said Dimitri K. Simes, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "If reactionary forces establish a dictatorship, surely it would affect Soviet foreign policy."
 
'Where Would It Stop?'
 "There are more nuclear weapons in the Ukraine than in all of Europe outside the Soviet bloc," Mr. Simes said. "If economic decline leads to civil war in the Soviet Union, with clearly defined sides like Russia against the Ukraine, or conservatives against democrats, where would it stop? I can easily visualize scenarios where Europeans would want a credible American deterrent to maintain stability."
 Mr. Bush's new budget was drafted on the premise that the Soviet threat had diminished. Military spending would decline from $298.9 billion this year to $295.2 billion next year and $292 billion in 1993.
 Mr. Cheney said today that economic and political turmoil in the Soviet Union cast doubt on the prospects for further arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington.
 "Those moves toward democracy and demilitarization of the Soviet Union that we all welcomed so thoroughly in recent years now appear to be in doubt," Mr. Cheney said. "Mr. Gorbachev has resorted to and sanctioned a crackdown in the Baltics, appears to be prepared to use force to fall back upon the security services in the military, to try to maintain order inside the Soviet Union," he added. "We're beginning to see now a reversal of some of the trends in terms of human rights and freedom of the press, and of course a continuing conflict between nationalities."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 9, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of a mechanical error, an article yesterday about Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's bleak assessment of the Soviet Union's future omitted part of the third paragraph. It should have read, "Mr. Cheney's comments, in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, were the clearest statement to date of his concern that the Soviet Union might implode and that the Administration might have to rethink Pentagon spending plans."

More Cost Cutting Expected at Ford

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 8

 BODY:
A senior executive of the Ford Motor Company said the automobile maker would intensify cost cutting in response to the industry's recession but would not lower capital spending as the General Motors Corporation has decided to do. Alexander J. Trotman, executive vice president of the No. 2 car maker and head of its North American operations, declined to elaborate on how Ford would further reduce costs but said, "It's not business as usual."
G.M., Ford and the Chrysler Corporation began cost-cutting programs in the late 1980's but have accelerated and deepened them as the American economy turned sour last year. Mr. Trotman's comments came at a press preview of the Chicago Auto Show, which opens on Saturday.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances in Europe; Gold Is Higher Worldwide

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced in Europe yesterday but was mixed in domestic dealings despite waves of concerted central bank intervention that capped a week of government efforts to shore up the currency.
Gold prices advanced worldwide. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $370.10 an ounce, up $2.30 from Thursday. At the Republic National Bank, gold gained $2.65 an ounce to settle at $369.75. 
 The move to buy dollars, mostly offset by sales of German marks, began when trading opened in Europe and continued when dealing shifted to the United States. Most big European central banks participated and were joined by the Federal Reserve.
"We haven't had concerted, worldwide intervention like this since November 1988, when the dollar was under heavy selling pressure" following the election of George Bush, said James McGroarty, a senior vice president at Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. in Greenwich, Conn.
 
Initiaive by European Banks
 What differentiated yesterday's intervention from other recent moves was that European central banks took the initiative and that the rounds of interventions continued after the dollar moved to higher levels, Mr. McGroarty said.
The Fed as well as some European central banks were active participants in the foreign currency market throughout the week. Yesterday's effort was high in profile, traders said, and succeeded mostly in lifting the dollar from its lows.
With the central banks concentrating on dollar-mark transactions, traders still intent on selling the dollar did so mostly against the yen and the pound, traders said.
The mood surrounding the dollar remains bearish. Traders continue to point to the declining United States economy. In addition, "interest-rate differentials weigh very heavily against the dollar and are keeping it under pressure," said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.
United States interest rates have been declining as yields on many European fixed-income securities have risen, making European investments more valuable. And when United States securities become less attractive, it reduces investors' need for dollars.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.40 yen, to a closing 128.20 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 127.85 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 127.78 yen, down from 128.52 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.9875, from $1.9980 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.9885 to buy 1, less expensive than Thursday's $2.0000.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.4556 German marks, up from 1.4553; 1.2435 Swiss francs, down from 1.2437; 4.9595 French francs, up from 4.9535; 1,096.25 Italian lire, up from 1,093.75, and 1.1580 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1587.

HEADLINE: War in Persian Gulf Inspires Some Donors to the Neediest

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
Amid the daily reports of bombings, troop movements and Pentagon news conferences, it has become difficult for many Americans to think about any issue besides the war in the Persian Gulf. But for some people, battles overseas are also a reminder of the problems at home.
A number of recent donors to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund said that their gifts to the fund were inspired by the war. They feared that the attention paid to the nation's soldiers could mean further neglect of the city's homeless. 
 These expressions of concern about the war's impact on the sick and the poor came from people who opposed the fighting as well as those who favored it.
On one side of the issue was Madeline Walling of Highland Park, N.J., who contributed $10. "I am giving this money now, as I know that with the war, everyone will forget about the problems here," she wrote. "I am well aware that the war in the Gulf is not about Saddam, oil or even money. It's about ignoring the problems here.
"I know this is not much," she said of her gift, "but I don't make much. I am showing that I won't forget."
Another donor, Jay Rosenberg, had an almost opposite view of the war, but shared Ms. Walling's commitment to the needy.
In a letter attached to a gift of $100 written the night before the war began, he wrote, "As our country prepares to go to war and hundreds of thousands of Americans risk their lives for what I truly believe to be a just cause, I search my conscience and know that I must begin to make sacrifices for my country and my fellow citizens."
Proceeds from the Neediest Cases are distributed among seven charities to provide disadvantaged children, the elderly and the unemployed with food, clothing and shelter among other services. The New York Times pays for the campaign's overhead, and the drive runs through Feb. 28.
With less than three weeks remaining, the fund has already collected the second highest total in its 79-year history. But it must raise another $267,000 if it is to pass the record set in the previous drive. And several charity officials said yesterday that the recession and the war seem likely to make the next few weeks a difficult time to raise money.
One donor, Christopher B. Steward of Brooklyn, wrote his check for $200 to the fund on the night that the United States began bombing Iraq. He said that he had almost forgotten to contribute but then realized that "with recession looming -- and as of tonight war -- it is more important than ever to remember those who will suffer most."

HEADLINE: For Banks, Suitors May Be Few

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
What if the Treasury Department threw a party and nobody came? That could be the response to the department's proposal earlier this week to reshape the financial system by making the banking franchise more attractive and by inviting in new participants with a wad of capital.
Although it is unclear whether the Treasury's proposals will win approval in Congress, bankers certainly applaud the department's attempts to help them enter the securities business and to sell insurance where state laws allow that. But when it comes to luring in more capital by allowing commercial and industrial companies to own banks, the Administration may be sorely disappointed with the results if such a development ever comes to pass. 
 Those companies that have already dabbled with offering their customers certain financial services have expressed little interest in owning and operating a full-fledged commercial bank.
 
Two Experiments

The McDonald's Corporation, for instance, has experimented with letting banks put automated teller machines in some restaurants as a convenience to customers, but that program is still in the trial stage, and a McDonald's spokesman said the company had no interest in adding banking as a line of business.
Likewise, the K Mart Corporation allowed several banks to install small branches in some stores, but the synergies between shopping and banking never materialized, and that program has been phased out. "People don't go to a K Mart to take out a loan," said Mary L. Lorencz, a spokesman for the company. "We're not interested in being in the banking business."
The companies that are most likely to take advantage of any eventual liberalization are companies that have one foot in banking already. The American Express Company, for instance, already owns three non-bank banks, which can accept insured deposits or make commercial loans, but not both. It also owns two industrial loan corporations and one international bank. Each of those institutions has to abide by some cumbersome regulatory limitations on the services it can offer and the extent to which it can cross-market its products and services.
"We have to turn ourselves into pretzels to do what we want to do," said Paul A. Seader, the company's assistant general counsel. The American Express Centurion Bank in Delaware, for instance, which provides services to the company's Optima credit card customers, is prohibited by law from allowing its assets to grow more than 7 percent a year.
 
 No Big Commitment Planned
 At some point in the future, Mr. Seader said, the company might try to convert one of its non-bank banks into a commercial bank, or buy a bank to simplify its financial service business. But as for developing a banking franchise that would draw the kind of capital into the industry that the Treasury is hoping for, Mr. Seader said American Express would not be interested. "We really don't have any desires or plans to get into commercial banking," he said.
Some banking specialists predict that few commercial companies will ultimately choose to enter banking. They point to the banking industry's poor profitability and the high cost of doing business. If they are right, the situation will hardly cause havoc, but it leaves open the question of how banking will ever succeed in drawing in new, deep-pocketed participants.
"People can do everything a bank can do and not be a bank. So why put up with all the garbage?" asked George J. Benston, professor of finance, accounting and economics at Emory University in Atlanta. "You can do everything except take insured deposits, and if they keep raising the deposit insurance rates, why would anyone want to do it?"
 
 One Regulator's Concerns
 If new buyers from outside the financial industry do not emerge, that would be just fine with some bank regulators. E. Gerald Corrigan, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has been particularly vocal in opposing a blending of banking and commerce.
Shortly before the Treasury issued its proposal, Mr. Corrigan made a speech before a banking group in which he seemed to throw down the gauntlet by challenging many of the arguments that the Treasury subsequently used in its report.
Mr. Corrigan disputed the Treasury's central thesis that banking needs more capital and must attract money from commercial and industrial companies. Capital is the cushion of permanent financing that helps a bank absorb losses. Mr. Corrigan did not deny that some banks need more capital, but he said the system as a whole has enough capital to provide "the finite quantity of good loans which the economy can support."
Mr. Corrigan again expressed his longstanding concern that if the parent company of a bank ran into financial trouble, the bank would be perceived as an integral part of that company and could become vulnerable, too.
Imagine, for instance, that Eastern Airlines, which recently filed for protection under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws, owned a bank. Would depositors, fearful about the safety of their deposits, rush to pull their money out? And if the regulators had to intervene, would the deposit insurance fund have to be used to bail Eastern's bank depositors out? And would the Federal Reserve be under pressure to make its financial resources available to the airline's parent company to stabilize the bank?
 
 Some Potential Perils
 "At a time when the public is focusing on the horrendous exposure to the savings and loan industry, and now the banks, do we really want to raise the question of creating exposure to the automobile industry or a company that makes washing machines?" asked Michael Bradfield, a former general counsel of the Federal Reserve who is now a lawyer specializing in banking in the Washington office of the firm of Jones Day Reavis & Pogue.
The Treasury, in its report, said that adequate safeguards could be put in place to prevent insured deposits from being misused and that it was important to be able to draw new capital and management talent into the industry. If commercial companies are not permitted to buy banks, it added, many Wall Street firms, which might be logical bidders, would be precluded from making offers because they are owned by commercial companies. Kidder, Peabody & Company, for instance, is owned by the General Electric Company, and Dean Witter Reynolds is owned by Sears, Roebuck & Company.
Resistance to the blending of banking and commerce has traditionally stemmed from fears that banks could become too powerful if they joined with large industrial companies, causing distortions in the business of making loans. A company that owns a bank could conceivably get loans on overly favorable terms from its captive lender, or loans might be extended to the parent company's best customers, while a competitor of the parent company and its customers might be denied credit.
The Treasury contends that the potential for abuse could be overcome by making sure that no entity other than a bank would be allowed access to deposit insurance or to the Fed's discount window, where banks can borrow from the central bank at favorable interest rates.
In addition, unusually large transfers of money between a bank and its affiliates would have to be reported to the bank's regulator. And if an industrial company was abusing its banking subsidiary by siphoning off money or allowing it to falter, the Treasury proposal would allow bank regulators to restrict dividend payments, force the parent company to raise more capital or even require that the bank be sold.
Banking experts are skeptical that the "firewalls" that the Treasury says can be erected would actually work in a financial crisis. They point to several recent examples in which the problems of troubled brokerage firms spilled over onto their parents, even though they were ostensibly at arm's length. Over the last few yers, companies like American Express, Credit Suisse and General Electric have all felt compelled to inject substantial amounts of money into their ailing brokerage subsidiaries rather than let them founder and risk tarnishing their own image.
Likewise, when Drexel Burnham Lambert's holding company filed for bankruptcy last year, it was unable to prevent its financial problems from overwhelming its brokerage subsidiary, which was supposedly separately capitalized. "Once the holding company went, it was clear that the brokerage could only be kept alive by extraodinary measures," said H. Rodgin Cohen, a banking attorney at the New York law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell. "Drexel put the nail in the coffin of the concept of firewalls."

HEADLINE: Yield on 30-Year U.S. Bond Falls Below 8%

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The yield on the benchmark long-term Treasury bond fell below 8 percent yesterday and held steadfastly there for the first time in more than a year as strong retail demand caused a rebound in prices.
Dealers said the demand was not unexpected, given the enthusiastic reception accorded this week's auctions of $34.5 billion of Treasury notes and bonds. 
 But the retail investors -- pension and mutual funds and other institutions -- prudently waited to begin buying until dealers and other successful bidders had taken quick profits after the last of the three auctions ended Thursday. As usual, the sales by profit takers caused prices to weaken.
"The retail buyers seemed to be eager to lock in current yields on the longer Treasury paper, often selling shorter-note maturities to pay for the long-term bonds," said Mark A. McCluskey, chief trader at the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer of Zurich.
Mr. McCluskey said the buyers were also encouraged by the relatively high level of market liquidity "for a no-news Friday."
"The market's basic view," he said, "is that it does not expect the economy to show any signs of revival that would cause interest rates to rebound soon."
In the stock market, bullishness returned after Thursday's downturn. The Dow Jones industrial average closed yesterday with a gain of 20.05 points, to 2,830.69, ending a week of near-record trading volume. For the week, the Dow was up 100 points, or 3.7 percent. [Page 32.]
Eugene J. Sherman, senior vice president and chief economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, said the credit market's quick selloff on Thursday after the auction of the 30-year bond "may also have been prompted by fears that Japanese and other successful foreign bidders would be first to unload their acquisitions largely because of the continued weakness of the dollar."
"We believe the refunding was a success despite the dollar's weakness," he added, "simply because there wasn't as much foreign participation as many were led to believe. We think it was a largely domestic affair and domestic institutions do not have many promising alternative investments today."
While the yield on the Treasury's new 30-year bond slipped slightly below the pychologically important level of 8 percent shortly after the issue was auctioned Thursday, it was not until the yield on the outstanding 30-year bond slipped below 8 percent that the trend was confirmed.
The bellwether old 30-year bonds, the 8.75 percent issue due August 2020, were offered late in the session yesterday at 108 22/32, up 29/32. This caused the yield to plunge to 7.98 percent, its lowest since late December 1989. The yield was down from 8.05 percent the day before and 8.08 percent a week ago.
The yield on the new 7 7/8 percent long bonds of February 2021, which were auctioned Thursday, slipped to 7.95 percent in trading on a when-issued basis, down from 7.98 percent the day before. Also in when-issued trading, the yield on the new 7.75 percent 10-year notes auctioned Wednesday dropped to 7.76 percent, from 7.83 the day before, and that on the new 6 7/8 percent three-year notes auctioned Tuesday dipped to 6.96 percent, from 7 percent the previous day.
Some investors were also encouraged by the Federal Reserve's move to keep the interbank lending rate from moving above the 6.25 percent level that is now considered to be the central bank's target. The Fed added $2.5 billion of reserves to the banking system at midday when the funds rate was at 6 5/16 percent. The funds subsequently traded down to 5.75 percent at yesterday's close.
But the discount rates on Treasury bills, normally most sensitive to any changes in the funds rate, barely moved. The rate on 90-day bills fell 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.92 percent; the six-month bills were unchanged at 5.89 percent, and the one-year bills lost 2 basis points, to 5.86 percent. The recent decline in bill rates, to their lowest level in almost three years, reflects the eagerness of investors to lock in current yields in the expectation that yields will decline further with the economy.
The Treasury announced that it planned to auction $11.75 billion of new one-year bills on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Big Price Rises for Farm Products Called Unlikely

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 8

 BODY:
For the most part, American consumers will probably not see drastic price increases, reduced supplies or inferior quality in California fruits and vegetables in spite of the drought and state and Federal water cutbacks to agriculture, farming experts and growers' representatives say.
If one farmer cuts back on a crop for lack of water deliveries, another with abundant ground water is likely to increase planting of that crop, said Mike Henry, a spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation in Sacramento. "The diversity of California agriculture has saved the consumer in the past four years and may save us again," he said of the long drought. But the prices of some crops may be much more volatile because of periodic shortages. 
 Even a severe cutback in production of some crops will probably not cause large price increases. In some cases, like California almonds, a large carry-over of the 1990 crop will insure an adequate supply. In others, like canned fruits and vegetables, the cost of the crop itself is a relatively small part of the shelf price.
 
 Smaller Tomatoes
 Growers of tomatoes for canning anticipate a million-ton drop in production from last year, to about 8.2 million tons, "but that alone will not have a dramatic impact on price," said David Zollinger, executive vice president of the California Tomato Growers Association in Stockton. While quality will also not be affected, "the size of individual tomotoes will be smaller, and that in turn will impact the tonnage," he said.
In some crops, California farmers' losses will be made up by other states. California acreage planted to cotton, a particularly thirsty crop, will be cut by several hundred thousand acres, but because the drought struck before the planting season, the shortfall will be made up in other states, said Kevin McDermott, vice president for economics research for Calcot Ltd., a cotton marketing cooperative based in Bakersfield. "You'll see acreage in Texas and Mississippi expand 16 to 20 percent," he said.
For many fruits and vegetables, it may be too early to gauge crop size and prices. Fruit trees will not begin blossoming until later in the spring. Paradoxically, late rains, as occurred last year, could knock off blossoms and reduce crops of apples, pears and grapes. Growers say prices for some of these products could soar if crops are unusually short.
 
 Frost Lifted Citrus Prices
 Citrus fruit prices have already taken a big jump, because the crop suffered heavy damage from record frosts in December. Prices for California oranges have doubled from the typical season prices of 59 to 79 cents a pound, to $1.39, and have prompted the usual corresponding rise in apple and banana prices even though those fruits are in abundant supply. Prices of these fruits tend to rise and fall together because consumers view them as alternatives to one another.
Without adequate water, many frost-weakened trees will die, said Curt Anderson, a spokesman for Sunkist Growers in Sherman Oaks. "As one grower said to me, 'The freeze may look like a Sunday school picnic compared to the drought,' " he said.
The wine industry, already reeling from steep increases in Federal excise taxes, could see grape prices rise as well. This would have the most extreme impact on producers of inexpensive jug wines, which use grapes from the heavily irrigated Central Valley. Vines in premium wine-growing areas, like Napa and Sonoma counties, tend to have deeper roots and require less irrigation.
With record vintages in 1989 and 1990, wine-grape prices have drifted down from 1988 highs, "but any contraction on the supply side has a greater effect on the price side," said George M. Schofield, a winery consultant based in St. Helena. Drought years are often thought to be good-quality vintages, but that is not always the case. Wines from the drought year of 1976 "are really intense, but some people don't like the concentration," Mr. Schofield said.
This year, California farms, which consume about 80 percent of the state's water, will have about half the normal supplies, with the water coming from local and Federal reservoirs and from ground water. The California State Water Project has said it will deliver no water for agriculture, but it supplies only about 10 percent of irrigation water in a normal year. The Federal Central Valley Project is expected to deliver from one-third to one-half of the normal supply.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Jordan

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times; ANGER AND DISMAY OVER U.S. ACTIONS

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Isolated in the Middle East and vulnerable to potentially fierce pressures from the war in the Persian Gulf, many Jordanians reacted sharply today to White House criticism of King Hussein's alignment with Iraq and to Washington's earlier decision to review economic aid.
The Bush Administration's moves, diplomats said, will almost certainly deepen the widespread anti-American sentiment that puts pressure on the Jordanian King to shelter his government with the public embrace of Arab nationalist and anti-Western principles. 
 "I think we've been subjected to strangulation," said Abdul-Karim Kabariti, a legislator and former Government minister. "If relations are said to be chilling, then it's fair to say they are heading toward the freezing point."
The decision to review aid, $85.6 million last year, coincided with other American moves that Jordanians considered hostile. Even those Jordanians with long affection for the United States say they are bewildered by what they interpret as a deliberate campaign to destabilize their country, which is wedged between Iraq and Israel.
 
Americans Are Urged to Leave
 Last week, at the same time the State Department criticized Jordan's continued importing of crude oil from Iraq, Jordanians were becoming incensed by allied air strikes against the main highway in western Iraq, attacks that killed nine Jordanian tanker-truck drivers.
The United States also reduced its diplomatic representation here, ordering some diplomats home, and urged Americans to leave Jordan as soon as possible. The decision was interpreted by some Jordanian officials as a show of no-confidence in the King's ability to protect foreigners in a country seething with pro-Iraqi fervor and anti-American anger.
"Why are they doing this to us," said a Jordanian businessman here who refused to give his name. His comment reflected a widespread sense of aggrievement that the United States, once admired by many educated Jordanians, was willfully misinterpreting the King.
 
Analyzing a Speech
 Senior Jordanian officials sought to play down the impact of the latest American move. Like some Arab and Western diplomats, they argued that a speech by the King two days ago, in which he called the allied war effort unjust and aligned himself politically with Iraq, was directed specifically at an Arab audience.
Finance Minister Basil Jardaneh echoed other Cabinet officials, who have said that, for Westerners, the twin messages of the King's speech were his affirmation that Jordan was not a party to the military conflict and his renewed call for dialogue to end the fighting before it further escalation.
"The King's remarks were intended for Jordan," a high official said. "But unfortunately they were received in the United States."
Two incidents today highlighted some of the threats facing the King from a Jordanian population that is more than one half Palestinian and easily ignited by displays of perceived American hostility.
In the northern town of Ramtha, police fired tear gas and arrested four people who were involved in a rare clash with the authorities. Police officials said protesters poured from a mosque after noon prayers on the Islamic holy day and smashed cars and burned tires as they chanted anti-American and pro-Iraqi slogans.
The authorities have generally sought to coax protesters into peaceful demonstrations, and the King is thought to hope that his recent political liberalization, including a freeing of Parliament and the press, offers a safety valve for the passions of his people. But, diplomats said, further violent protests like today's could erode the King's popularity if it seemed that his security forces were suppressing pro-Iraq sentiment.
In the second incident, in the south, three people infiltrated into Israel early today and were shot to death after a firefight with Israeli soldiers. An Israeli official called the mission "suicidal."
 
Lessons From the '67 War
 While the two incidents were apparently unrelated, they again served notice on the King of the volatility of his population.
"The King has not forgotten the 1970's, when the Palestinians rose against him," an Arab diplomat said.
For this reason, Western European diplomats said, the King has ordered his security services to try to curtail unlawful armed militias.
But as today's incursion into Israel showed, Jordan's long border with Israel cannot easily be sealed by either side and neither can all privately held weapons be traced, leaving the King vulnerable to the impact of incursions that are designed to provoke an Israeli response.
Also in the King's memories is the 1967 Middle East war, when Israeli forces drove Jordan's far smaller and less-equipped army out of the West Bank. Many Jordanians acknowledge that a new military conflict with Israel would hold no greater chance of victory than 24 years ago.
"The King has made clear he does not want military involvement," said a Western diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "He has said the same to both Iraq and Israel."
Zeid Bin Shaker, the head of the Royal Court, today denied a news agency report in which unidentified officials were quoted as saying the King was so angry with the United States that he was "carefully studying" the likely impact of severing diplomatic relations, despite decades of close ties with Washington. The report, Mr. Ben Shaker said, was "part of a disinformation campaign against Jordan."

HEADLINE: Cracks in California's Economy

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 8

 BODY:
The Gaylord Container Corporation is shutting two-thirds of its paper mill in Antioch, Calif., dismissing 330 of the 525 employees. The mill is no longer economically competitive, in part because of California's dire water shortage.
"You cannot produce paper without water," said Walt E. Murray, a manager at the plant across the bay from San Francisco. "Water itself is one of the highest-cost raw-material items. You go to the East Coast and that's not the case." 
 The price Gaylord pays for its water is about to go up by a factor of seven, said Mr. Murray, who is also president of a local business group. And the river water that normally supplies part of the company's needs has become too salty to use, since saltwater from San Francisco Bay is moving upstream as the river's flow dwindles.
 
Adding to Economic Pain
 After five years of drought, the Golden State has turned brown, and it is sending shivers though an economy that has been a star in the national picture for the last decade.
The drought's biggest and most immediate impact is, of course, on the state's vast farmlands. The state's water project cut off supplies to farmers this week, forcing some to abandon crops for the year and threatening some with loss of their farms.
But California is also one of the largest producers of wood, oil, gold, computers and computer chips. And from the northern forests to the southern oilfields, in Silicon Valley and Napa Valley, the drought is starting to add to the economic pain caused by war and recession. Some small businesses, including landscapers and swimming-pool builders, are also suffering.
Several economists estimate that agricultural losses alone will be about $1 billion of the state's $18 billion farm output. Those losses will in turn lead to losses for food processors and other segments linked to farms.
The result could be an overall loss of $3 billion for the state's economy, said Tapan Munroe, chief economist for the Pacific Gas and Electric Company.
To be sure, that is a tiny fraction of the state's $700 billion economy and is almost unnoticeable on a national scale. Compared with the real estate slump and military spending cuts, the drought is "not a prevalent factor in the outlook," said David Hensley, acting director of the business forecasting project at the University of California at Los Angeles.
Still, the drought, which began in 1986, could slow the state's growth. Some businesses will suffer lost production and customers, and virtually all companies will have to take steps to save water. Businessmen here have one eye on the sky, hoping for rain, and the other on Sacramento, where state officials are devising possibly Draconian water-use restrictions to be announced this month.
Ski resorts in the Sierra Nevada, in eastern California, and businesses near lakes have been badly hurt. Some executives fear that tourists may stay away this summer, envisioning a Yosemite National Park with dried-up waterfalls and trees ready to ignite. Tourism was already expected to be down because of the fear of flying induced by the Persian Gulf war.
 
Trees Are Dying
 The forest-products industry, suffering from the housing slump, is now seeing its future source of income -- trees -- dying in droves.
"We've probably had about a tenfold increase in the amount of trees that have been dying," said Bill Snyder, chief forester of the Fibreboard Corporation, who added that drought-weakened trees could not fight off beetle infestations. And the trees that survive are growing only about half as fast as they normally would.
The damage is most extensive in the eastern part of the state; the coastal redwood areas have fared better. Other companies with large timber holdings in California include the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, the Pacific Lumber Company and the Simpson Paper Company.
Brian Barrette, chief of forest management for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said trees worth 9 billion board feet might die of drought-related causes this year. That is more than twice the amount normally harvested from California forests in a year. Looked at another way, it is enough for all the houses in several San Franciscos. Some of the dead trees, but not all, can be salvaged and used.
 
Thirsty Mining Process
 In California's gold country in the Sierra foothills, a new mining process has made it feasible to reopen mines that had been closed since the days of the forty-niners. But the process requires a lot of water.
The Sonora Mining Corporation's mine in Jamestown, which uses 3,000 gallons a minute, should have no problems if it rains again this winter, but may have to reduce production if there is no rainfall. "The bottom line is no rain, no mine," said Stephen M. Hair, a company spokesman.
Wine producers in the Napa and Sonoma valleys will almost certainly see reduced grape harvests. Getting water for tank-cleaning and other steps in the production process could also be more difficult.
At the Buena Vista Winery in Sonoma, the reservoirs used for vineyard irrigation have dried up. And last fall, in the thick of the harvest, the output of the well that provides water for the wine-making process suddenly dropped sharply. The winery ordered an emergency delivery by truck and began a crash conservation program that has cut use by 45 percent, said Jill Davis, vice president of production and wine making.
 
Huge Use by Industry
 Refineries use huge amounts of water for cooling and for generating steam for heat and power. Computer chip companies wash silicon wafers over and over in the process of etching circuits on them. Executives at such companies say they expect to get by for now.
"We would find a way to meet it; I don't see us cutting production," said Pat Avery, manager of environmental, health and safety at an ARCO refinery outside Los Angeles.
About half of the 12 million gallons a day the refinery uses comes from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which is now talking about cuts of 30 percent. If that happens, ARCO will rely more on well water, Mr. Avery said. If the wells run dry, the company will treat and re-use its water even more extensively than it now does, he said.
Many companies said they had already taken steps to conserve and now have less room to maneuver.
"We've done the big-ticket items, and now it's going to be substantially more painful," said Ken Knutsen, a vice president of the National Semiconductor Corporation. The Silicon Valley chip maker, which uses a million gallons a day, has cut consumption by a third since 1987.
The Santa Clara Valley Water District, which supplies Silicon Valley, has already required customers to cut their use by 20 to 25 percent, and is looking for an additional 10 percent cut. "We're pretty devastated," said Teddy Morse, a spokeswoman for the water district. "We're out there looking for water wherever we can find it."
 
 Less Water, More Pollution

The drought hurts companies in subtle ways as well. Electric power bills rise because utilities substitute expensive oil and gas for cheaper hydroelectric power. Re-using water can increase the concentration of pollutants in waste water, making it harder for companies to meet environmental requirements. National Semiconductor is being simultaneously praised by its city water department for conservation efforts and warned by the sewer department to make its waste water cleaner.
A big question is whether the drought will slow the state's formerly robust growth. The water shortage could be one more reason for people and companies to leave California or to stay away, along with high housing costs, smog and traffic jams.
But some doubt that will be the case. "I liken it a little to the earthquake," said Leslie Appleton-Young, vice president of research and economics for the California Association of Realtors. "You don't see an exodus out of the state because of the earthquake."
In a survey of more than 800 executives conducted for the California Business Roundtable, 14 percent said they did plan to move some or all of their operations out of the state. But they cited housing costs, taxes and other problems far more than the drought. And even as some companies leave, others are lured by California's huge markets, the climate and the state's ringside seat on the booming Pacific Rim.
The drought could slow growth, however, by prompting communities to ban new construction or water hookups. For home builders, who were already expecting 1991 California housing starts to be less than half the 1986 level, that prospect is "very, very frightening," said Ira Norris, president of Inco Homes in Upland, Calif. He said builders were organizing efforts to head off such measures.
 
 Businesses Join Water Planning
 Indeed, business groups, which once left water issues to the water authorities, are suddenly becoming more involved. A new group called Californians for Water has been formed, in part to put the influence of the business community behind the push for more water projects.
Businesses also want to take part as cities develop rationing plans, in part to make sure they are given credit for conservation steps they previously took.
Business and industry use only about 5 percent of the state's water, while residences use 11 percent and farms about 80 percent. Still, companies that use a lot of water could come under pressure to bear a big share of the looming cuts. They will likely respond by saying cuts will mean lost jobs, not just brown lawns.
"We really have very little discretionary use of water in a refinery," said Mr. Avery of ARCO. "We really don't wash cars or take showers or water the lawn."
Businesses linked to such discretionary uses, like landscapers and swimming-pool builders, are among those hurt most by the drought.
Instead of making gardens, builders will be "putting down black plastic and gravel on top," said Olof Soderback, a landscaper in Marin County. Water authorities in the trend-setting county across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco voted on Wednesday to limit each resident to 50 gallons a day, less than half what is normally used. That might discourage the use of hot tubs, for which the county is famous.
But hot tub vendors are repositioning their products as water savers. Said Len Woodall, a salesman at Creative Energy, a Marin County dealer, "If you own a spa, all of a sudden you won't take a bath anymore."

HEADLINE: Discount Rate Cut Was Urged at Meeting

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Most Federal Reserve banks, noting "appreciable weakening in economic activity," urged a half-point reduction in the discount rate at the December meeting of the Fed's policy makers, according to minutes released today.
Immediately after the Dec. 18 meeting, the central bank's board of governors voted 6 to 0 to lower the key bank lending rate from 7.0 percent to 6 1/2 percent, a move intended to lower interest rates generally and help pull the economy out of a recession. 
 The discount rate represents the interest the Fed charges on loans to banks and other financial institutions. A decrease often results in less-expensive costs for other short-term loans, like adjustable-rate mortgages and car loans.
 
Vote on Increasing Reserves

At the same meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, members voted 11 to 0 to increase reserves and permit the Federal funds rate to fall as developments dictated. The funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, dropped from 7.25 percent to 7.0 percent the next day.
Since then, the Fed pushed the discount rate down another one-half percentage point on Feb. 1, to 6 percent, while at the same time it permitted the funds rate to drop to a target of 6.25 percent.
"The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity had fallen appreciably in recent months," according to the minutes that noted declining consumer and business activity and growing unemployment.
"Members commented that a relatively mild and short recession remained a reasonable expectation, but they emphasized the risks of a more severe and prolonged contraction in economic activity," the minutes said.
 
 Inflation Status

At the same time, inflation -- which had prompted the Fed to keep interest rates relatively high for two years -- appeared to be moderating.
"Members saw growing indications that a disinflationary process might be getting under way, and some viewed recent price and wage developments as consistent with an outlook for faster progress in reducing inflation than they had anticipated some months ago," the minutes said.
The Federal Open Market Committee, which gathers eight times a year, met again last Tuesday, and many analysts believe it agreed to continue pushing interest rates lower in March. The committee is the central bank's arm for setting monetary policy. Composed of the seven board members and five of the 12 presidents of the Fed's regional banks, it controls the funds rate. There is currently one vacancy on the board itself, which controls the discount rate.

HEADLINE: $1.50 Worth of Help for $200, but No credit

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Some consumers responding to recent direct-mail and telephone promotions for "low interest" credit cards are getting big bills instead of cards.
Some have paid as much as $200, only to get a list of banks that offer credit cards with low interest rates. Others have received applications for secured credit cards, which require the applicant to put up cash or collateral equal to a card's credit line. 
 Some banks make legitimate offers by mail or telephone for low-interest credit. But many recent offers are coming not from banks but from marketing companies that cannot issue credit cards. The abuses are so common that officials in Colorado and Oregon have brought charges of fraud against companies that claim to offer low-interest credit cards.
In a report on a recent survey, Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer-advocacy group in Herndon, Va., said it found dozens of companies using misleading marketing schemes aimed at people who want low-interest credit cards. In many promotions, a consumer receives a postcard saying that he or she can receive a major credit card with interest as low as 11.88 percent simply by calling a toll-free number, said Mary Beth Butler, the group's program associate. Many banks now charge interest rates of 16.8 percent or more on credit cards.
 
Getting a Pitch, Not a Card
 Ms. Butler said people who respond to the promotions are not offered a card but are urged instead to buy information that will supposedly help them get a credit card. That information, which can cost $98 to $200, typically comes in the form of a list of banks offering low-interest credit cards or a booklet of general financial advice, she said.
The same information is available for a lot less. A list of banks offering low-interest credit cards can be got for $1.50 from Bankcard Holders of America, 560 Herndon Parkway, Suite 120, Herndon, Va. 22070. Cardtrak, a monthly newsletter published by Ram Research , P.O. Box 17, Frederick, Md. 21702, also provides information on banks offering cards with low rates. The newsletter is $5 a copy.
Robert McKinley, the publisher of Cardtrak, said some unscrupulous marketers are also using 900 numbers to promote low-interest credit-card offers. A person who calls the number may be charged a flat fee as high as $50, Mr. McKinley said.
People responding to such offers do get credit cards, he added, but sometimes the cards can be used only to charge merchandise in a mail-order catalogue. Some people also receive applications for secured credit cards. Along with requiring collateral, some secured credit cards carry high fees. "They can be very expensive," Mr. McKinley said.
 
'Deal Directly With Banks'

 
 Steven Apesos, a spokesman for Mastercard International , said consumers should be leery of any solicitation that suggests that low-rate cards are easy to get. Usually, only people with the best credit records qualify for such cards.
<> <> "The most important advice we have is to deal directly with banks and avoid unscrupulous marketers," Mr. Apesos said.
Dennis Fiene, the director of security for Visa International , said his company had tried to stop marketers who illegally use its emblem in promotions. "Using our logo gives these promotions an air of legitimacy," he said.
The attorneys general of Oregon and Colorado recently filed fraud actions seeking to close two credit-card marketing companies. But the problem is not easy to solve. In many cases, an unscrupulous marketer will set up his operation outside the state where the consumers being solicited live. That makes it harder for state officials to act on consumer complaints.
Mr. Fiene of Visa said several Federal agencies, including the Postal Service and the Federal Trade Commission, are looking into the problem. "I don't know of a single consumer that has received a credit card through these kinds of promotions," he said.

Lincoln, Revolution And Civil Liberties

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:
Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution
By James M. McPherson
173 pages. Oxford University Press. $17.95.
 
The Fate of Liberty
Abraham Lincoln and Civil Liberties
By Mark E. Neely Jr.
278 pages. Oxford University Press. $24.95.
In Prof. James M. McPherson's informative and intelligent book of essays, "Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution," the Princeton history professor raises a tantalizing question: 
 Was Lincoln a conservative or a revolutionary?
Professor McPherson, author of "Battle Cry of Freedom," the strongest one-volume history of the Civil War, concludes that Lincoln was a conservative revolutionary. In this respect, he disputes those scholars who contend that the 16th President was made by events and did not have any real philosophy of his own in the White House.
"Not an ideological revolutionary, to be sure -- Lincoln was no Robespierre or Lenin with a blueprint for a new order -- but he was a pragmatic revolutionary who found it necessary to destroy slavery and create a new birth of freedom in order to preserve the Union," Professor McPherson writes.
To support his position, the author emphasizes a neglected area of study: the relationship of Lincoln and Congress. Before Lincoln became President, the Southern-dominated Democratic Party that controlled the Federal Government had repeatedly defeated efforts to foster economic development through tariffs, to regulate the banking system, to subsidize land grants and to support education. During Lincoln's Presidency, Republicans passed all these measures: a higher tariff, a homestead act, a land-grant college act, an act for a transcontinental railroad, a national banking act, a progressive income tax.
Giving Lincoln a strong share of the credit for the resulting changes, Professor McPherson says: "This astonishing blitz of laws, most of them passed within the span of less than one year, did more to reshape the relation of the government to the economy than any comparable effort except perhaps the first hundred days of the New Deal."
The essays in "The Second American Revolution" occasionally ramble and repeat, but they are straightforward and well written. By no means does the book attempt to cover the whole Lincoln story. For example, the importance of Lincoln's legal background to his thinking on the Constitution is barely mentioned. Readers interested in this subject can turn to "Lincoln as a Lawyer," by John P. Frank, a classic work that has just been reissued (Americana House, Chicago); and the current Lincoln Legals project in Springfield, Ill., is finding dozens of new State Supreme Court cases in which Lincoln was involved.
One of the fascinating essays in Professor McPherson's book is called, with only slight exaggeration, "How Lincoln Won the War with Metaphors." How was Lincoln, with practically no formal education, able to speak and write so well?
Professor McPherson explains that because Lincoln worked on the frontier, he grew up close to the rhythms of nature. This primitive life infused his speech with living images. When he turned to books, his favorites were the King James Bible, Aesop's Fables, Pilgrim's Progress and Shakespeare's plays. All of these sources, the author notes, are rich in figurative language, which Lincoln used to communicate the justice of the Union cause to the people.
In "The Fate of Liberty," by Mark E. Neely Jr., Lincoln's controversial stand on civil liberties is thoroughly examined. Mr. Neely, director of the Lincoln Museum in Fort Wayne, Ind., and author of "The Abraham Lincoln Encyclopedia," has written a fair-minded book that provides fresh details about the writ of habeas corpus and its suspension during the war. He emphasizes that Lincoln had a war on his hands almost from the moment he became President until his death. What we might call fifth columnists operated inside the Union.
"The great writ remained a symbol of individual freedom and many knowledgeable Americans in 1861 believed that its suspension would have dire and lasting effects," Mr. Neely says. "That feeling would nag the consciences of some Republicans. And it would intensify the sincere anxieties as well as inflate the partisan rhetoric of many Democrats. But military arrests of civilians never provoked widespread disobedience of the law or violent protests. Only military conscription could do that."
As President-elect, Lincoln faced the immediate secession of several states from the Union he was supposed to govern. Legal and political considerations were carefully balanced. For instance, when Maryland threatened to secede, Lincoln ordered his generals not to suspend the writ unless Marylanders took up arms. His judgment was vindicated when the Maryland legislature, though dominated by Democrats, refused to consider a secession ordinance.
Mr. Neely's book draws a distinction between arrests made in the Border States, the North and the South. He says that suspending the writ was a political liability and was always regarded that way by the Lincoln Administration. But most military arrests of civilians did not involve torture or prejudice against any ethnic group.
The author estimates that there were at least 10,000 arrests during the war. His book is based on information in a thousand arrest records in the National Archives. It is always wise for historians to go to the original sources instead of citing one anothers' books as documentation. That is what makes "The Fate of Liberty" a valuable addition to the Civil War bookshelf.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Budget Stand

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
By musing on the merits of stretching out New York City's current budget problems over several years, Mayor David N. Dinkins spoke words this week that no New York mayor had dared utter since a city humbled by its brush with bankruptcy was forced to submit to the credo of pay-as-you-go.
Mr. Dinkins and his senior aides repeated yesterday that they intend to balance the budget for the coming fiscal year as required by law, on time and as usual -- with spending cuts and tax increases -- despite a projected shortfall of more than $2 billion in their $29 billion budget. 
 That Mr. Dinkins reflected publicly even in a glancing way on an idea to borrow large sums to fill the immediate gap raised concern among fiscal monitors and is part of a strange and complex drama that touches on everything from Presidential politics to racial sensibilities to the reluctance of a powerful person, Felix G. Rohatyn, to recede from influence.
 
Law, Finance and Politics
 But most of all it reflects the depth of the concern over the city's finances. Some of the Mayor's senior advisers acknowledge that they have discussed the possibility that the city's problems could grow so deep as to require measures beyond cuts and taxes, including steps that raise a range of complicated legal, financial and political questions. Looking for special ways to bring the budget into balance over several years, they say, is not an idea that they are pursuing, but it is one that they cannot rule out.
At the core of the idea is this: the city could seek to reduce its operating deficit by an infusion of funds borrowed by the Municipal Assistance Corportation, which was created by the state to get the city out of its last fiscal crisis. Such assistance could spare the Dinkins administration from additional tax increases or severe cuts in services otherwise needed to keep the budget in balance as required by law.
 But that solution is not as easy as it sounds. Since the law requires a balanced budget, any arrangement that could be seen as paying current bills through borrowing could risk rejection by the Financial Control Board, the state body that has watched over the city's fiscal health since it recovered from the 1975 crisis.
The Mayor's comments on Thursday, in their very equivocation, reflected some of the tension now at work in the political world of New York City finances. There are those who hold city debtfor whom a long-term bailout plan could be anathema, while there are those who receive city services for whom it might be preferable to sharp budget cuts.
 
Rohatyn Broke the Spell
 "I do know that the attitude of many of the monitors, certainly the bond-rating people, is that deferment of debt is frowned upon," Mr. Dinkins said in an interview on Thursday, "although there's much to be said for the notion that for a government, state or city, it is very difficult to take horrendous cuts and handle it in a short period of time, as opposed to stretching it out."
Mr. Dinkins was responding to questions about statements by Mr. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, who first broke the spell on this sensitive subject on Wednesday. Since Mr. Rohatyn was an architect of the very fiscal restrictions under which the city has operated since 1975, his remarks caused a particular stir.
Aides to Mr. Dinkins at first flatly dismissed Mr. Rohatyn's suggestion that the assistance corporation could raise hundreds of millions of dollars through bonds to help the city spread its fiscal pain over a more manageable length of time.
But later, some officials acknowledges, as one senior aide speaking on condition of anonymity said yesterday, "You don't have to be a genius to see that that's a possibility."
 
Like Heresy by the Pope
 Mr. Rohatyn suggested that if the city's economy continued to worsen, the assistance corporation might refinance bonds to stretch out the payment of current interest over many years, even if that meant postponing debt.
Some fiscal monitors said Mr. Rohatyn's suggestion was the equivalent of heresy by the Pope. Others were quick to note that Mr. Rohatyn is a close adviser to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and that his idea could help Mr. Cuomo, who is facing enormous fiscal problems of his own.
A bailout by the assistance corporation could let the Governor avoid hurting the city with cuts in state aid that he has proposed to balance his budget, could ease the state's problems by allowing it to stretch out aid payments and could smooth potential problems for Mr. Cuomo that could arise just when he might be a Presidential contender in 1992.
Mr. Cuomo has special influence over the city's finances as chairman of the Financial Control Board, which was established to run the city's fiscal affairs in the mid-1970's. It now has only advisory powers but could reassert binding ones should the city fail to balance its budget or to sell bonds -- a situation that could be politically damaging to Mr. Cuomo if he were seen as usurping the powers of the city's first black mayor, and to Mr. Dinkins, if he lost stewardship of the citys's finances.
 
'Violates the Spirit'
 Mr. Rohatyn said his suggestion would not require the Control Board to reimpose its powers or require changes in law. But others were not so sure.
"If it doesn't violate the letter of the law, it violates the spirit," said Alair A. Townsend, a former city budget director and deputy mayor who is now publisher of Crain's New York Business.
Mr. Rohatyn, stung by Mr. Dinkins's rejection of his warnings to freeze labor costs and by union leaders' attacks on him, said last fall that he would step down as chairman of the assistance corporation but changed his mind after Mr. Cuomo asked him to stay.
Now the city is reacting warily to the golden apple that Mr. Rohatyn is dangling, though Mr. Rohatyn said he would not favor any proposal that jeopardized bond ratings. And bond rating agencies have warned the city that its credit rating -- which it has been struggling to maintain -- would be jeopardized by such moves, though Mr. Rohatyn said he would not favor any proposal that jeopardized bond ratings.
 
Politically Tempting
 "What they're doing is counterproductive, and it doesn't square with our rating," said Hyman Grossman, a managing director at Standard & Poor's. "Which means if they do anytning like what has been discussed, they won't have our rating."
Still, Mr. Rohatyn's idea is politically tempting for the city.
But First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said the city was, at least for the moment, resisting the temptation. "We understand the arguments on both sides of the equation, and why it looks like it might be helpful but why it creates enormous problems," he said. "But our position is that we're not exploring that option. We intend to balance our budget in one year."
Mr. Rohatyn now says the fiscal critics have misinterpreted his remarks; that he never intended to imply that the city should modify the accounting rules or budgeting laws adopted during the fiscal crisis, only that it might need to consider extraordinary measures.
"I thought we had inflated a spare tire, and all of a sudden I saw that we'd fired a Scud missile," he said yesterday. "If it's sinful to consider these things, then I've sinned."

HEADLINE: Bank Lending Still Tight Despite Easing by the Fed

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board's latest readings on whether banks are lending show that despite aggressive easing by the central bank recently, they continued to tighten lending standards this winter.
As a result, the nation's money supply barely edged up in January. 
 The Federal Reserve is focusing on two measures of credit availability -- both highly imperfect -- to quantify the problem: a quarterly survey of senior lending officers at several dozen leading commercial banks and a monthly measure of the money supply, or M-2, which includes money market accounts as well as checking accounts and cash.
Some bankers were not surprised by the survey. "The credit crunch wasn't started by high interest rates, so why should we expect lower rates to stop it?" asked S. Waite Rawls 3d, vice chairman of the Continental Bank Corporation.
But Federal Reserve officials, bankers and economists say they are confident that traditional monetary medicine -- along with a tilt toward forebearance by bank regulators -- will encourage bankers to increase lending, and thus prevent a deeper recession. Citing the recent rebound in bank stocks, a Federal Reserve governor, John P. LaWare, said, "There's some feeling on the part of the market that the worst of the bank problems are over."
"Will it work?" asked John B. McCoy, chairman of the BancOne Corporation. "Oh yeah. We've had positive loan growth in January. The spreads in our business continue to widen. That helps earnings. Lower rates increase the number of good transactions out there."
The loan officers' survey, which last month polled 60 senior loan officers at both United States commercial banks and branches of foreign banks with United States branches, showed that banks tightened business lending standards and terms over the last three months.
"To put it into perspective, the amount by which spreads were raised was pretty minimal, at least in the Ninth District," said Herbert L. Baer, a senior economist at the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank. The spreads Mr. Baer referred to are the difference between what a bank charges prime customers and less creditworthy borrowers. The survey asked loan officers about their activities in the last three months.
Significantly, banks clamped down more on their biggest borrowers. Nearly half of United States banks reduced borrowing limits for those customers. That compares with 7 percent that reported doing so for small-business borrowers.
Nearly 60 percent of banks raised loan spreads for large companies. But just 40 percent of banks surveyed did so for their smaller customers.
"That goes 180 degrees against the popular version," Mr. Baer said. He pointed out that banks have been under pressure to diversify their loan portfolios. Pushing a big borrower out the door is a convenient way to do that, he said.
 
 Flat Money Supply
 The Federal Reserve's separate weekly money supply report, which was released on Thursday, shows that the amount of money circulating in the economy grew at less than a 1 percent annual rate from December to January. Stephen H. Axilrod, vice chairman of Nikko Securities Inc. in New York, said, "Flat M-2 could indicate either that people aren't eager to put their money into the banking system" because they lack confidence in it, "or that the Fed hasn't pushed enough reserves into the system."
But that does not mean that the Fed's latest move to lower the discount rate a week ago has been ineffective, said James S. Duesenberry, a monetary economist at Harvard University. "It's only six weeks since the Fed really began to change its monetary policy," he said. "It will take a few months for monetary growth to pick up. Expecting to see a big change today is like expecting to win the war with Iraq after one night's bombing."

HEADLINE: Bush's Energy Plan Emphasizes Gains in Output Over Efficiency

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
The White House has drafted a national energy policy that would encourage the growth of the domestic oil industry and remove obstacles to the construction of nuclear power plants. But the plan calls for only a modest effort to encourage energy efficiency.
The plan, which is taking final form as war in the oil-rich Persian Gulf has focused new attention on long-term energy supply problems, is intended to make the nation less dependent on foreign sources. Through deregulation and tax breaks, it would encourage the oil, gas and coal industries to begin aggressive programs for increasing the domestic output of fossil fuels in the United States. The Office of Management and Budget circulated a draft of the legislation embodying the policy to Federal departments and agencies this week. 
 The proposals include few programs aimed at substantially reducing the consumption of energy. Conservation groups have called for such actions by the Government, but none of the proposals would encourage motorists to reduce their use of gasoline, the largest single use for oil in the United States.
Copies of the draft were made available to several news organizations today. White House officials said that the draft was receiving a last review from the Energy Department and other agencies and that when those had been incorporated it would be given to President Bush for his signature. James D. Watkins, the Energy Secretary, is scheduled to testify before the Senate Energy Committee and Natural Resources Committee on Feb. 19, and Senator Timothy Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, said Mr. Watkins would present the plan then.
The draft of a letter accompanying the plan, from Mr. Watkins to Representative Thomas S. Foley, the Speaker of the House, described the policy's purpose. "To secure future energy supplies, we must consider fossil fuels, nuclear power, renewable energy, fusion energy and enhanced R.&D.," the letter said. "As events in the Persian Gulf have demonstrated so aptly, we must reduce our dependence on imported oil from unstable regions. This will require both reducing our overall dependence on oil, particularly in the transportation sector, and increasing domestic production in an environmentally sound manner."
 
Oil Industry's View
 Oil industry executives, who were made aware of its details today, applauded the Administration's aggressive plan to take some restraints off the domestic oil industry. "If this is as described, it certainly sounds very positive, not only for the industry, but for the consumer," said Douglas G. Elmets, a spokesman for ARCO in Los Angeles. "It certainly makes us less reliant on insecure sources of oil."
But leaders of environmental groups who read the draft today said it was one-sided and would fail to solve the nation's dependence on foreign oil, which supplies more than half the American consumption. "There is no leadership here, no vision for a future of clean, efficient use of energy," said James L. Wolf, executive director of the Alliance to Save Energy, a group in Washington that lobbies for energy conservation measures. "It's very aggressive in ignoring transportation efficiencies, which is the root of the oil problem."
Democratic lawmakers predicted today that if the legislation proposed by the White House was similar to the draft circulating today, its chances of passage are slim. "It was only a couple of months ago that Admiral Watkins said in an interim report that the single loudest message he heard all across the country was support for energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy, and almost all of these opportunities were ignored," Senator Wirth said.
 
 Opening the Wildlife Refuge
 Among the measures in the 142-page draft is a proposal to open 1.5 million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for oil exploration.
The Administration wants to put 300,000 acres of the 19-million acre refuge up for bid to oil companies in the first round of oil lease sales; every two years after that, 300,000 more acres would be open for leasing to oil companies. The Interior Department, which owns the refuge and believes as much as 3.6 billion barrels of oil lie below the coastal plain, said this week that new studies show the probability for a successful strike is more than twice what scientists said just four years ago.
The Administration's proposal includes an array of restrictions and regulations to protect animals and their habitats in the vast refuge, but they are not likely to satisfy environmental groups, including the National Wildlife Federation and Sierra Club, which have been lobbying to keep the oil companies out of the refuge.
 
Oil and Gas Pipelines
 Other proposed programs would aid the oil and natural gas industry, including eliminating requirements that energy companies get approval from the Government to import or export natural gas. Several other proposals would reduce restrictions on owners of oil and natural gas pipelines.
The formal process of developing the Administration energy policy began in August 1989 with a public hearing in Washington, the first of several around the country, at which Mr. Watkins presided. "This national energy strategy," Mr. Watkins said, "will be a dynamic, living process, not just a document, from this day forward."
Among the proposals that Mr. Watkins promoted from the start, and that remain in the draft made available today, were new rules for severe limits on the ability of the public to comment on new nuclear power plants before they are started. The proposal is intended to eliminate situations in which new plants are held up or permanently closed because of public protests in the weeks before they are to open.
 
Concern for the Economy
 Mr. Watkins also said he was interested in conserving energy with new, imaginative programs that would aid the economy as well as the environment. In the draft policy, just a few of the ideas offered at public hearings across the country survived. There are new tax credits for producing energy with the sun, water, and wind, and ideas that could encourage the development of alternative sources of electricity. There is also a proposal to set new standards for making lights more energy-efficient.
But nearly all proposals for conservation and efficiency, according to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, are likely to be eliminated by the White House over the weekend. The White House has also proposed to weaken an existing regulation requiring automobiles to become more fuel-efficient.
On Capitol Hill, the White House legislation will compete with several other proposals that have already been introduced.
Bennett Johnston, a Democrat and chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, has co-sponsored a new bill with Malcolm Wallop, a Republican from Wyoming, that would increase the size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and rewrite the nation's principal law that regulates electric utilities.
Senator Richard H. Bryan, a Democrat from Nevada, has reintroduced a measure that was narrowly defeated last year to increase automobile fuel mileage standards.
Representative Philip R. Sharp, Democrat of Indiana, would require states to promote energy conservation, calls for Federal power agencies that sell electricity to utilities to require their customers to establish conservation plans, and would call on Federal lending agencies to promote energy efficiency through mortgage incentives for energy-efficient homes. And Senator Frank Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, reintroduced legislation that was withdrawn after the Exxon Valdez in 1989 to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.

HEADLINE: Filling Plate Takes Priority Over Curbing the Appetite

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
The problem with a nation whose oil production satisfies barely half its oil appetite is not its appetite, the Bush administration has apparently concluded, but its production.
 With most eyes now focused on the war in the oilfields of the Middle East, many elected officials and private analysts are calling for cutting imports. That was a goal, Secretary of State James Baker 3d said in a speech earlier this week. 
 But the oil segment of the draft of the National Energy Strategy is aimed mainly at supplying the American appetite, rather than curbing it. This is in sharp contrast to the energy policies generated by the oil crises of 1973-74 and 1979. Those earlier policies assumed that the cause of the imbalance lay at least in part on the consumption side.
 
Other Sources of Energy

Imported oil amounts to nearly half the oil used in this country but only 10 percent of total energy consumption, which includes natural gas, nuclear power, coal and hydroelectric power. The United States also imports natural gas and other fuels but exports coal. The net result is that the nation produces about 82 percent of all the energy it uses.
Opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling is the oil companies' biggest hope for expanding reserves, and thus production. But in the view of industry and others, this is not salvation. The Department of Energy said last fall that the median estimate of its size was 3.2 billion barrels, which is huge by the standards of what is found in the United States these days, but small relative to consumption. And there is always the possibility that it will come up dry.
"This will not prevent an increase in the level and share of imports," said John H. Lichtblau, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a nonprofit group in New York. "Increase is inevitable," he said. "The rate might be slightly slower than if the Government had not come up with anything."
 
 Competitive Problems
 Brooks B. Yeager, a lobbyist for the National Audubon Society, contends that policies aimed at production cannot make much difference in the level of imports. A bigger factor in production, he said, is prices. "Our ability to pump oil out and market oil is always dependent on whether it is competitive with Middle East oil," he said. Because of geology, it simply is not, he said. But measures that would make domestic drilling competitive, like import fees, have generally been ruled out by the Bush Administration, which says they would interfere with a free market.
Other facets of the policy statement will not cut oil consumption significantly either.
Nuclear power, for example, the other main focus of the energy package, does not usually substitute for oil; it mostly replaces coal and natural gas.
And efforts to encourage greater production of other energy sources -- mostly through a return to market principles -- will also have a relatively minor impact on oil consumption and imports.
 
 Fewer Approvals to Get

Builders of oil and gas pipelines would be relieved of having to obtain an entire category of cumbersome approvals. Nuclear power plant builders would no longer have potentially contentious and delaying hearings at the end of construction. And nearly anybody and his brother could enter the wholesale electricity market as producers.
The treatment of consumption by the energy policy plan stands in sharp contrast. Gone is all mention of gasoline taxes, taxes on all fuels based on energy content or on carbon production, or new taxes on cars based on their fuel economy.
Taxing cars based on fuel economy is one idea that is certain to be revived in Congress this year. Cars are widely veiwed as the biggest single target for greater efficiency, and the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, imposed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo, include one of the two major elements of energy policy surviving from that era. The other is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is barely mentioned in the draft, with a call for stockpiling oil products, as well as crude oil.
 
 Not Much Spending Required

The Department of Energy had considered a variety of methods for stimulating oil production, mostly centering on tax breaks. Some of those would have cost the Treasury $16 or more for every barrel produced. Very few of the proposals that survived to the draft plan stage would require Washington to spend money.
Mr. Bush's approach also differs from his predecessors' in largely avoiding reliance on new technology, although it would encourage some fleet vehicles to run on alternative fuels, which have not been demonstrated on a large scale, with some reduction in gasoline demand. It would also provide some money for research.
 
 Ideas Around for Years
 Those ideas have been around for years. But it was clear early in the process of developing the strategy that in a political sense, the options were limited. Energy is so basic to so much of the economy that any change represents the swing of an elbow that hits someone in the eye.
The oil exploration industry got what it wanted most; the refining industry did not get a huge new requirement for alternative fuels, although it may have a new market to meet if fleets turn to other fuels. The auto industry avoided the mileage standards it did not want. The electric utility industry got a change that will please most of its members.
And the strategy seems mindful of the war in one particular way. By not moving to curb consumption or imports, the Saudis, the Venezuelans and other oil exporters with whom this country has cultivated a good relationship were spared the shrinkage of a big market.

HEADLINE: Mayors Attack Bush Plan to Shift Control Over $15 Billion to States

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
The nation's mayors today denounced President Bush's proposal to give states control over $15 billion worth of Federal programs, saying it would permit governors to skim money that now flows directly from Washington to hundreds of cities around the country.
Speaking officially through the bipartisan United States Conference of Mayors, the mayors also contended that Mr. Bush's proposal would add a new layer of bureaucracy, at the state level, to many health, education, welfare, housing and law-enforcement programs. 
 "We the mayors of America, Republicans and Democrats, are united that this simply won't work and isn't a good idea," said Mayor William J. Althaus of York, Pa., a Republican, who asserted that Mr. Bush's proposal was "entirely wrong."
 
'This Is Fraud'
 Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, vice president of the mayors' conference, said, "This isn't federalism; this is fraud." At a news conference here, the Boston Democrat vowed that mayors would "go to the wall" fighting Mr. Bush's proposal to transfer selected programs to the states with a lump sum of Federal money.
The mayors estimate that cities now receive more than $12 billion a year under the Federal programs Mr. Bush wants to turn over to the states. The programs include Community Development Block Grants, which disburse more than $2 billion a year directly to cities and urban counties. The remaining $10 billion comes from health, education, welfare and housing programs under which states are required to share Federal money with units of local government.
If the mayors lobby as aggressively as Mr. Flynn indicated, they could substantially reduce the chances for Congressional approval of Mr. Bush's proposal. Many governors have cautiously welcomed the block grant proposal and plan to negotiate details with the Administration.
 
Aim of Bush Proposal
 In the budget submitted to Congress on Monday, Mr. Bush suggested that states might receive "a single consolidated grant" in place of the many they now receive to help pay for social services, elementary and secondary schools, public libraries, heating the homes of low-income families and administering welfare, food stamps and Medicaid.
John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said on Thursday that the proposal was an important item on Mr. Bush's domestic policy agenda because it would give states more flexibility and discretion in using Federal money.
"All the states want it -- governors, state legislatures -- and people around the country understand its significance and value," Mr. Sununu said of the proposal. But he added, "We're not sure Congress will pass it."
It is not clear whether the Administration will make a serious effort to persuade Congress to approve the President's proposal. Debra R. Anderson, the White House official responsible for dealing with governors and mayors, was not immediately available to respond to the criticism from the mayors' conference. Elisa Lund, an assistant to Ms. Anderson, said she was tied up with other business.
The mayors said the Federal Government should preserve programs, like the Community Development Block Grant, that disburse money directly to cities.
 
A National Problem
 Referring to the social and economic difficulties of the nation's cities, Mayor Flynn said: "This isn't a city problem. This isn't a poor people's problem or a minority problem. This is an American problem."
Leaders of the mayors' conference plan to meet next week with Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, to argue against the President's proposal.
Mr. Flynn complained that "the Federal Government has been walking away from America's cities" at a time when they must find homes for babies born to mothers addicted to crack, care for people with AIDS, shelter the homeless and cope with extraordinarily high rates of poverty, infant mortality and murder.
Mr. Flynn said there were political reasons for what he called the nation's neglect of its cities. Political power has shifted, he said, and cities can no longer deliver votes or campaign contributions to candidates as they once did. As a result, he said, "cities have no influence whatsoever in Congress."
In a statement distributed at the news conference, Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York, also a Democrat, said the President's proposal could have "grave consequences" for the people of his city next year, jeopardizing a $183 million grant to the city for community development and $579 million for public housing.
Mayor Sharpe James of Newark said there was no reason he should have to apply to the state government in Trenton for the community development funds he now receives from Washington. Cities and urban counties are entitled to such grants under a formula established by Federal law.
"We don't need to create another layer of bureaucracy," said Mr. James, a Democrat. That would only delay the distribution of funds urgently needed to combat drug abuse and to repair run-down housing, he contended. Mr. James asserted that the Bush proposal threatened "the viability and quality of life of our citizens."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Washington;
President Increases Pressure On Jordan to Stay Neutral

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
With the Administration concerned that any change in Jordan's neutral status in inter-Arab politics would have a profound effect on the entire Middle East, President Bush stepped up pressure on King Hussein today not to join forces with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
"I have some concern now about what appears to be a shift in the Jordanian position," Mr. Bush said at a picture-taking session during a meeting in the Oval Office with the Argentine Foreign Minister, Guido Di Tella. The American people, he added, "don't understand some of the rhetoric coming out of there." 
 "We've always had a historically good relationship with Jordan," Mr. Bush said, "but this complicates things. He seems to have moved over, way over, into Saddam Hussein's camp."
The President's remarks followed the announcement on Thursday that the Bush Administration was reviewing its $55 million in 1991 foreign aid to Jordan in response to a speech this week by King Hussein, in which the Jordanian leader assailed the United States and backed Iraq.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said that today's harder line toward Jordan grew out of a closer review by the President of the King's speech. Mr. Fitzwater said the address on Wednesday made it clear "that Jordan has declared his allegiance to Iraq."
"The statements by King Hussein were very precise in terms of his attack on the United States," Mr. Fitzwater added.
 
Maneuvering for Postwar Era
 Administration officials say they understand what the King seems to be doing, which is positioning himself for the postwar Middle East. They believe he has concluded, wrongly, that when the gulf war is over Arab radicals will take revenge against all of the Arab leaders who joined with the United States in destroying Iraq.
Therefore, through his tilt toward Baghdad and denunciations of the United States, the King is trying to buy himself some life insurance for the postwar era, these officials say.
Given the King's life history, this is not altogether irrational. As an 15-year-old Prince, Hussein was at the side of his grandfather, King Abdullah, in 1951 when Abdullah was shot to death by a Palestinian who accused him of selling out the Palestinian cause after the 1948 Middle East war. After the 1967 Middle East war, King Hussein's own throne was challenged by Palestinian radicals, who wanted to sweep him and other Arab leaders aside for their failure to defeat Israel in that war.
But while Administration officials say they are ready to accept a certain amount of posturing by the King, who has provided some useful intelligence on Iraq, and tacit military cooperation, since the gulf war began, they felt that his speech of this week crossed a line and that unless they yanked him back he might be lost indefinitely from the pro-American Arab camp.
 
A Valuable Buffer
 Although Jordan is not a militarily powerful or rich country, it plays a crucial geopolitical role in the Middle East from Washington's point of view. The country is often taken for granted, until officials begin to contemplate what the region might be like without it.
Jordan under King Hussein has served as a stable, moderate and pro-American buffer between a variety of contending parties. It is a buffer between Israel and Iraq, between Syria and Saudi Arabia, between Egypt and Iraq and between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which at different times has tried to take over Jordan for itself.
A senior Administration official said Mr. Bush's remarks today were calculated to put the King on notice that as far as Washington was concerned he had crossed a line and was in danger of going from one of America's oldest Arab friends to one of its newest Arab foes. It was decided by officials that the President himself had to come down hard on the Jordanian leader so there would be no misunderstanding in Amman about how angry the United States was about his remarks.
Not only is the United States reviewing its own foreign aid to Jordan, but Administration officials also said they were stopping all of their efforts to solicit money from American allies to ease Jordan's economic crisis, a result of the gulf war.
Administration officials fear that when the ground war against Iraqi troops in Kuwait begins there could be even more of an anti-American outcry in the Arab world, and they want to keep Jordan at least neutral in order to minimize any political fallout.
 
Putting Americans 'at Risk'
 Mr. Fitzwater said that Saddam Hussein was using "any pretext and any means to try to split" the Arab and Western alliance fighting to reverse Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, and that King Hussein "was playing a role in that effort."
The King still has Arab nationalist credentials, and if he, along with Iraq, denounces the Americans, it could not only embarrass the pro-American Arab governments, but also lay the groundwork for a postwar inter-Arab cold war that would make any peacemaking in the area that much more difficult.
The King's latest speech, a senior Administration official said, "was clearly an effort to delegitimize the American war effort."
"We are not worried that he is going to make Saddam legitimate," the official said. "But there is a war going on now. Americans are at risk, and what the King is doing and saying is putting them more at risk. That is not the way friends behave -- even friends who are under pressure.
"We cannot be the ones always doing what we can to help him. And then he goes and pockets that and doesn't care if he says things that make life more difficult for us. There are limits to our patience, and he needs to know that more clearly."

HEADLINE: Manufacturers Urge Big U.S. Export Push

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOCA RATON, Fla., Feb. 8

 BODY:
Arguing that exports are the bright spot in an otherwise bleak economy, the National Association of Manufacturers is urging the Bush Administration to play a much more aggressive role in promoting the sale of American products abroad.
The lobbying effort, outlined here today at the group's twice-a-year board meeting, is based largely on the premise that more exports, particularly of manufactured goods, can reverse the recession. Should the Bush Administration respond to the appeal and adopt the proposals, it would become deeply involved in promoting and even managing trade. 
 "Exports were probably what kept us from slipping into a recession in the first half of 1990, and they can hasten a recovery in 1991," said Jerry Jasinowski, the association's president and chief lobbyist. He added that stepped-up production in recent years to supply a growing export market accounted for a third of the nation's economic growth.
Mr. Jasinowski said the role of exports in economic growth had been noted by Bush Administration officials, with whom he has discussed the group's new lobbying effort. But the Administration has not publicly commented on potential export policy much beyond President Bush's brief reference in his State of the Union Message.
"Exports," he said in the speech, "are running solid and strong."
The association, representing 13,500 companies that produce 80 percent of the nation's manufactured goods, has always lobbied for pro-export policies. But it is undertaking what is perhaps its most ambitious campaign just as many of its members, rather than export, have established factories abroad to supply overseas customers.
The Maytag Corporation, for example, whose chairman, Donald Krumm, is a former chairman of the manufacturers' group, makes nearly all the appliances it sells abroad in factories in France, Britain and Australia. That is primarily because American-style washing machines, vacuum cleaners and other appliances are not used abroad.
"Basically, no appliance maker is shipping from the United States," Mr. Krumm said. His company gets a third of its $3.1 billion in sales revenue from overseas operations.
 
 Building Here and There
 Others are more like Valmont Industries, a Nebraska manufacturer of irrigation equipment, street light systems and power supplies. Valmont both exports and manufactures abroad.
A factory near Madrid that makes irrigation systems was set up in the early 1980's when the strong dollar made American products too expensive when sold in foreign currencies. But since the dollar has fallen sharply in the last two years, Valmont's factory in Valley, Neb., can now supply its markets in Spain, southern Europe and North Africa more inexpensively than its Madrid plant, said William F. Walsh, Valmont's chief executive.
The company's exports, in fact, have risen slightly, to about $55 million out of total revenue of $870 million, and revenue from the sale of products manufactured abroad has fallen slightly, to just under $50 million. But Mr. Walsh said the Madrid plant would not be closed, in part because it operated inside the European Community, safe from European trade barriers, and because the Spanish Government finances Valmont products exported from Spain.
"We will never retreat from having plants overseas for these reasons," Mr. Walsh said, referring also to Valmont's plants in Austria and France. "There are financing alternatives overseas that are not available here."
The association's export proposals do not refer to the trend toward overseas manufacturing, although today the foreign affiliates of American companies manufacture and sell abroad more than $700 billion a year in products, or roughly twice the value of merchandise exports from this country.
 
 Exchange Rate Is Noted
 In making his pitch for aggressive export policies, Mr. Jasinowski noted that two-thirds of the group's members neither exported nor manufactured abroad. And since the dollar began to fall in 1985, the value of American merchandise exports, other than agricultural products, has almost doubled, even when adjusted for inflation, according to Commerce Department figures.
"The exchange rate is the dominant explanation for the sharp growth in exports since the mid-1980's," Mr. Jasinowski said.
To sustain this growth, one association proposal would commit the Government to maintain the dollar at its current weak level of less than 130 Japanese yen and 1.46 West German marks. Another would funnel more American foreign aid to road building and other capital projects, with the stipulation that American equipment to carry out the projects be purchased with the aid money. A third proposal would abolish the numerous restrictions that require Government permission for the export of many American products.
A fourth proposal would increase Government financing of American exports. And a fifth would encourage the Government to impose sanctions quickly against countries that exclude American products.

HEADLINE: America's Kitchen Midden

 BODY:
Chroniclers of American culture can breathe easy. Sears, Roebuck & Company now insists that neither competition nor the recession can make it give up its catalogue. That preserves a historic marketing device -- and a historic document.
Sears started in the 1880's when Richard Sears, a Minnesota railroad station agent, began offering other agents the chance to earn commissions by selling off shipments of unclaimed watches. Young Sears found this so profitable that he soon abandoned the railroad business and moved to Chicago to sell watches and other goods by mail. 
 The business flourished as it fed the hunger of rural America for access to the cornucopia of American industry. The 1897 Sears catalogue numbered more than 770 pages and offered tens of thousands of items.
In those days, the "wish book" was a form of entertainment as well as a way to shop. While the farmer browsing through the catalogue on a winter evening sized up an Improved Disc Harrow With Seeder Attachment ($34), his wife might look over the ornate cast-iron Sunshine Range ($38.75). His son could dream about the White Bone Handle Jack Knife (12 cents) or perhaps a Spalding Baseman's Mitt ($3.60). His teen-age daughter might ponder a bottle of skin-freshening Eau de la Jeunnesse (75 cents) or even a device called the Princess Bust Developer ($1.46).
As each catalogue offered shoppers variety, convenience and low prices, it gave social historians a rich core sample of American life. "One can well imagine some archaeologist of the twenty-fifth century scratching his head . . . over this gigantic kitchen midden," wrote S. J. Perelman.
Today's catalogue offers such exotica as radar detectors, laptop computers and pulsating shower heads. Should it disappear, 25th-century archeologists, not to mention nostalgia buffs of the 21st, would be poorer indeed.

Reading History on Harbor Waves

BYLINE: By ROGER STARR

 BODY:
Much of New York City's economic history was inscribed on the salt waters that separate all but one of the modern city's boroughs from the rest of North America.
History written on water tends to disappear. But a glimpse of the past can be found on a tidal shelf of the Arthur Kill, the waterway that divides part of New York from New Jersey. On the Staten Island side of the kill, now crowded with tankers and container ships that shun the city in favor of Newark and Elizabeth, a ship-breaker's yard has become the final resting place of scores of abandoned harbor craft. These wood and steel fossils awaiting final dissection offer clues to the past and hints of the future. 
 A visitor wandering among the old hulks, as a Times photographer did recently, can find a wooden-hulled steam towboat that once plied the Hudson trailing as many as 50 ice barges. A family lived on every barge; some children could say they had never set foot ashore during the first 10 years of their lives. When spring opened the upper Hudson to navigation, the flotillas of barges brought ice, cut from northern lakes, to the metropolis that until the early 1920's lacked any other widely available refrigerant.
A smaller, sleeker hull, with a deckhouse and a rusting steel mast, is the corpse of a self-propelled express steam lighter, built to transfer heavy, valuable cargoes (such as high-speed German diesel engines) from ships at anchor to the New Jersey railheads. Near it may be the remains of a floating grain elevator that emptied wheat from Erie Canal barges into oceangoing freighters. Navigational improvements in Midwest canals and the Mississippi have made New Orleans the nation's grain export center; New York has not used its floating grain elevators in 30 years.
Covered barges, their rotted roof beams now open to rain, once carried bagged cement from the rail terminals; they've been replaced by ocean vessels that carry cement in bulk, pumped out pneumatically.
The costs of repeated loading and unloading, from ship to harbor craft to truck, encouraged the development of big cargo containers, reduced the number and variety of harbor craft, cut to a fraction the number of longshoremen needed to work a single freighter hatch and made development of container ports on the empty New Jersey waterside sites inevitable.
Recognition of the changes wrought by economic and technological displacement suggest the possibility of further changes. As metropolitan traffic congestion rises, and the capital cost of new trans-harbor tunnels and bridges looms ever larger, time may reverse itself, allowing local water transport to regain its place in the Upper Bay.
Already, passenger ferries are carrying significant numbers of workers to their jobs, and luxury yachts offer a fancy meal or a platform that provides nice vistas for a wedding ceremony. A revival of maritime diversity in the harbor would stimulate employment, regenerate the significance of geography among New Yorkers and restore some of the excitement and productivity of New York's historic water without necessarily distracting the waiters or the bride and groom.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
The 51st State?

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
"I want Puerto Rico to become the 51st state," President Bush has said. Does he realize that would mean fewer Puerto Ricans in private-sector jobs, more on welfare, and a probable additional cost of $17 billion to the U.S. Treasury?
 Attorney General Dick Thornburgh told Congress this week that the Administration favors a plebiscite in which Puerto Ricans might well vote for statehood. Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, the chairman of the committee preparing plebiscite legislation, says Puerto Ricans' choice in that vote would be "morally binding" on Congress. 
 Mr. Thornburgh questioned the constitutionality of the only other likely status alternative -- an improved, virtually autonomous version of the present Puerto Rican "commonwealth." A third option, independence, is not believed to have sufficient support to be a real possibility for the island.
 Mr. Bush's desire for statehood is hard to understand, although the island's Republican Party also favors it. From a narrowly partisan point of view, Puerto Rico as a state would rate two senators and five or six members of the House. That's larger than a number of present delegations, including some that usually vote Republican; and the Puerto Rican delegation might well be all or mostly Democratic.
 From a broader perspective, moreover, the island insists on maintaining its Spanish culture, which would make it the only state with Spanish as its official language. Even Puerto Rican Republicans agree on that -- though mainland Republicans hardly can be enthusiastic about such an exception.
 Economically, statehood would be a disaster for the island. It would mean the loss of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's exemption from U.S. taxes, under Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code. No state is entitled to claim such an exemption, which has been applicable to Puerto Rico since before commonwealth status was achieved in 1952. That's one good reason the island's annual per capita income has risen since then from a few hundred dollars to more than $6,000 last year.
 Not only would statehood bring the Federal income tax to Puerto Rico; a Peat Marwick study estimated that 72 percent of the companies that have put about 2,000 industrial plants on the island, because of its tax advantages, might leave once statehood caused the loss of those advantages. That would mean the flight of 80,000 to 145,000 jobs, the study suggested.
 A Congressional Budget Office report similarly found that if Puerto Rico's commonwealth tax advantages were lost, unemployment -- averaging 14.6 percent even now -- would increase by 100,000 within the decade. Under statehood, Puerto Rican gross product would fall by 10 to 15 percent in the same period.
 Under the prevailing commonwealth status, however, economic growth is projected at a real annual rate of 2.5 to 4 percent. That's important to other Americans because Puerto Rico already buys more mainland goods than Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Colombia combined -- $9.4 billion in 1989.
 Why would Puerto Ricans opt for statehood if it meant they had to pay United States income taxes while their economy was shattered? One reason is that many islanders are too poor to pay income tax, and statehood would make many eligible for nearly doubled welfare benefits -- causing an estimated $17 billion rise in Federal outlays for Puerto Rico, a short-term bonanza.
 Statehood would allow the islanders to participate in Presidential elections, and to send a voting delegation to Congress. Many Puerto Ricans seem also to believe that it would magically produce for them a living standard equal to that of mainland Americans, whose per capita income is far higher -- even in Mississippi, the poorest of the current states.
 Commonwealth supporters, like Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, believe they can win a plebiscite, though polls now give statehood a narrow lead. They hope commonwealth status can be so defined in the Senate's plebiscite legislation that, if voters opt for it, Congress could not change it in the future. But Mr. Thornburgh said the Constitution required United States territories, other than states, to be controlled by Congress; therefore, he argued, Congress could take away commonwealth status any time it chose.
 If sustained by Bennett Johnston's committee, that's a telling argument against commonwealth and for statehood -- and one that raises the question whether President Bush grasps the real consequences of what he says he wants for Puerto Rico.

HEADLINE: As Yugoslavia Breaks Apart

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Though the Yugoslavs are divided along national and religious lines, the current crisis in Yugoslavia is not fueled by old ethnic feuds alone. Indeed, it is more of a struggle between federal authorities and the provinces. In many ways it is similar to the states-rights controversies that now and then rock the American boat. 
 The two main actors in the Yugoslav drama are Ante Markovic, the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, and Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian head of state. Both are ethnic Croats. Mr. Markovic wants a strong Yugoslavia. Mr. Tudjman wants its dissolution. Although Serbia seems to support Mr. Markovic, the Serbs have been at odds with him over other issues.
Serbian support of their Croatian Prime Minister on the federal question does not mean they are the source of Yugoslavia's problem. Although Serbia versus Croatia may be Yugoslavia's big concern in the near future, today it is a showdown between federal authorities (most of them former Communists) and provincial authorities (who wave a lot of American flags, but are also mostly former Communists).
Serbia, concerned about the millions of Serbs who live in Yugoslavia's other provinces (some of them hostile), may be rooting for the federal government, but it did not precipitate the debate, nor is it responsible for the confrontation.
As an American Serb, I cannot say I support the further existence of Yugoslavia. The pain and detriment it brought my kin far outweigh whatever negligible benefit they may have gained. An absence of concern over self-interest seems a dominant trait in the Serbian psyche. Consumed with the noble idea of a Balkan melting pot, the Serbs sacrificed everything for a truly integrated and united Yugoslavia. Most of their fellow Yugoslavs, however, never committed themselves to the same objective.
As a result, the Serbs have been forced to tolerate a disastrous marriage for more than seven decades, and no abused spouse has ever been more deserving of a quick and painless divorce.
Mr. Markovic's ultimate agenda may collide with my perception of Serbian interests, but as a Westerner I cannot but credit him for his remarkable economic and political strides. Moreover, although some members of Congress with influential Yugoslav constituencies balk, our Government supports the continued unity of Yugoslavia.
Other Americans who want to take sides and, for whatever incredible reason, are tempted to blame the Serbs, should first ask themselves where American interests lie, and what the United States Government has to say.

HEADLINE: Recession Is Forcing Many To Lessen Hopes for College

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
The deepening recession is forcing growing numbers of parents to reconsider plans to send their children to colleges whose tuitions they may no longer be able to afford.
Many say they will wait as long as possible this spring before mailing deposits for the next academic year, and college admissions officers say they expect a large number of students to apply for admission to state schools, where tuition is lower, if the economy continues to slide. 
 "Kids that in the past might have gone to Trinity or Wesleyan or the University of Vermont are coming here," said William Hawkins, director of financial aid at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury. "Or they're transferring here from private colleges because their parents have lost a job or are afraid of losing it. The middle class is getting hammered, and they are telling their kids, 'Hey, we don't have the money for those schools.' "
Especially hard hit, the educators say, will be small private institutions, particularly ones with religious affilations, that were already leading marginal existences with dwindling enrollments, and large universities with budgets based on filling 2,000 or more freshman spaces. Also bracing for a blow to enrollment prospects are private secondary schools.
 
Holding Their Breaths
 Job layoffs, especially in middle-income and professional households, and general unease about how far the economy will slide this year are the main forces behind the apprehensiveness of college officials.
"The uncertainty is so great many colleges and universities don't know what kind of freshman class they are going to enroll next September," said Robert Lay, dean of enrollment at Boston College.
For thousands of the families the sagging economy is just one more blow to plans for a college education. Emily Kokie is a 17-year-old senior near the top of her class at Cranford High School in New Jersey who hopes to be a lawyer. But even by taking out student loans and working part time, she and her parents will not be able to afford any of the seven private colleges to which she has applied, including Yale , unless the colleges pick up the rest of the costs with scholarship aid.
"I don't want my daughter to graduate college with $40,000 in loans to pay back," said Sonia Kokie, wife of a high school basketball coach. "That's about as much as my husband, at his age, makes in one year, and with this economy I know a lot of college grads who can't get a job."
Helene Unger, guidance director at Emily's school, said the competition for financial aid was placing tremendous emotional stress on everyone.
"It becomes an exercise in creativity to find a place for a kid with good S.A.T. scores and decent class rank," she said.
In more affluent homes the distress is deep, too. One woman in New Canaan, Conn., who spoke only on condition that she not be identified, said:
"There was no bonus this year for my husband, a banker, who feels very vulnerable in his job. No one's going to cry for us; we've been very privileged. But at the moment we feel very insecure.
"We have a daughter in a small private college that costs more than $20,000 a year and a son who is a senior in high school. We've told him to put in an application to the University of Connecticut or find a private college with comparable costs."
 
Two Incomes No Longer Enough
 Adele Bihn of Santa Clara, Calif., is worried about college costs for her four children, one in college and another in high school, even though she and her husband own a marketing company with 15 employees.
"We don't know if a bigger depression is going to roll in here from the Northeast one of these days and we may be faced with spending $45,000 after-tax dollars or so a year to send two or three kids to college," she said in a telephone interview. "The day when a woman went to work to pay for college costs are over. Women are already working to pay for groceries and the mortgage."
The economy slumped at a time when higher education was already struggling with two trends affecting recruitment: resistance to rising fees for tuition, room and board, now more than $20,000 at many private colleges; and demographic shifts that have led to a smaller population of 18-year-olds.
As a result, colleges will be selecting next fall's freshmen from a smaller pool of graduating high school seniors and from an even smaller number who can afford the costs.
 
Less Scholarship Money
 Two additional concerns arise from the recession. Colleges fear they may have to cut back on scholarships to poor and minority students, who add diversity to privileged institutions. And alumni and corporations whose contributions underwrite scholarships and other programs are themselves feeling the pinch of recession.
In the mid-1980's, when college enrollments boomed and competition to get into top institutions was fierce, springtime was filled with tension for students who awaited college acceptance notices mailed out around April 1. Now it is college admission officers who will sweat out the spring, awaiting return mail from those willing to put down a deposit on the fall semester.
"Everyone has real concerns about the influence of all these factors," said Lawrence J. Momo, director of undergraduate admissions at Columbia University in New York. "It's our turn to do the nail biting."
Administrators report a surge in requests by students for information on financial assistance. They are now getting calls for emergency financial aid from families of current students who never needed it before.
 
Darwinism in Action
 The only institutions that are expected to ride out the recession relatively unscathed are those with blue-ribbon academic reputations and blue-chip endowments, places like Harvard, Princeton, Stanford and Yale. "There's a survival of the species going on this year, and I wouldn't be surprised if we lost a number of weaker schools, and the Northeast will be the hardest hit," said Richard Steele, admissions director at Duke University. "There is a greater sensitivity to costs now than I've seen in 25 years of admission work."
As institutions reel from the effects of the recession, students are being stunned by the realization that they have to lower their academic goals. Howard Greene, a consultant on college selection with offices in New York and Connecticut, said, "It's heartbreaking when kids have done everything expected of them in the classroom and they can't go to the school of their dreams because the family can no longer afford it.
"In homes where the mother and father never saved a penny because their income was so high they could write checks for tuitions out of their Christmas bonus, the shock is unbelievable when a job is lost or the firm no longer pays a year-end bonus," he went on. "They are sitting there with high assets and no income and they are devastated by the change in their lives."
 
'Safe' Means Affordable
 High school counselors said the financial squeeze was changing students' definition of a "safe" college. In the past, that meant one they knew would accept them; now it is a place they know they can afford.
At the University of Connecticut, where tuition for Connecticut residents is a fraction of that of top private schools, the number of applications received by Jan. 1 was up 20 percent over the year before. "In the weeks before Christmas we got many calls from parents begging us to take late applications for the spring semester," said Ann Huckenbeck, director of undergraduate admissions. "They couldn't pay the tuition bill at some private campus." The deadline, she told them, could not be extended.
As economic pressures force top students to attend state universities, those with weaker academic credentials and limited finances will have to settle for openings in second-tier public institutions or community colleges.
"With so many new applications," said Mr. Hawkins, the financial aid director at Western Connecticut, "this university is becoming far more selective. And if the state budget is cut, which looks likely, the freshman class will shrink."
In some cases, families who can afford the tuition at prestigious colleges are finding the admissions process easier than they expected. John Schnedeker, guidance director at Summit High School in New Jersey, said that this year "a lot of students who received early acceptance from institutions had borderline academic credentials that in the past would have put them on the wait list."
 
Courting Those Who Can Pay
 At large institutions like Boston and Syracuse Universities, which thrived in the 1980's as they built enrollments and national reputations, the financial squeeze on students has created a particularly painful dilemma.
To meet expenses, these universities must collect tuition from huge numbers of students without compromising newly won academic prestige by lowering admission standards. They have strengthened recruitment efforts in regions less affected by the troubled economy, especially the West, and opened the door wider to students from abroad who can pay their own way. At the University of Pennsylvania, foreign students made up 10 percent of the 2,000 freshmen enrolled last fall, up from 4 percent six years earlier.
"Any way you look at it, it's going to be a tough year," said Frank Burtnett, executive director of the National Association of College Admission Counselors. "There's no longer a prescribed formula on how to pay for college. I can see more kids taking five and six years to get through four years, dropping out to work to meet the costs."

A CONFLICT OF RIGHTS
The Supreme Court and Affirmative Action.
By Melvin I. Urofsky.
270 pp. New York:
Charles Scribner's Sons.
$22.95. 
 Affirmative action is an issue about which relatively small segments of the population hold ferociously strong and opposing views while the bewildered majority leans one way and then the other, depending on how the question is framed. The debate over how to construe an unfair past and establish a more just future stirs primal emotions. Both sides bring powerful arguments.
Those favoring affirmative action maintain that a social and economic spoils system has been restricted for generations to white men engaged in their own affirmative action. To correct that imbalance, women and minority group members must be given special breaks.
Those against affirmative action argue that if the civil rights revolution taught us that people must not be judged by their skin color or sex, aren't such breaks -- whether called "quotas" or "goals and timetables" -- the wrong application of that lesson? Isn't the point to reaffirm the individualism of all rather than to promote the Balkanization of the country?
Since the 1978 Bakke case, when nine Supreme Court justices produced six opinions on the legality of a medical school's plan that set aside 16 spots out of 100 for disadvantaged minority students, the Court has found itself caught, like the rest of the nation, between those two arguments. What appeared to emerge from Bakke was approval for race-conscious recruitment but rejection of quotas; since then the Court has upheld some affirmative action plans and struck down others, often without clear continuity of reason.
One of the more noteworthy of those decisions, in this instance involving a woman, came in the 1987 Johnson v. Santa Clara County case, when the High Court upheld, 6 to 3, a California transportation agency's promotion of Diane Joyce over Paul Johnson to the job of road dispatcher -- this, despite Mr. Johnson's greater experience and initial selection by a board of men rather like himself. Ms. Joyce was sufficiently experienced to make the grade, tested virtually as well as Mr. Johnson and noted that none of the county road department's 238 skilled-craft jobs had ever been held by a woman.
The story, both human and legal, is a good one, and Melvin I. Urofsky, a professor of history and constitutional law at Virginia Commonwealth University and the author of many books on the Supreme Court, generally does it justice in "A Conflict of Rights," a timely and modest work. Mr. Urofsky is careful for the most part to stay evenhanded throughout the book.
We meet Mr. Johnson, quiet and industrious, born to poor Kansas farmers, brought up by relatives in Texas, who pushed himself along, justly setting his sights on a well-paying job only to be denied it because he was a white man. And we meet Ms. Joyce, a tough, likable widowed mother of four who spent much of her life being told she couldn't have a variety of jobs because they were only for men. This time she had a county government behind her, she badly needed the money, she was willing to fight and she won.
Mr. Urofsky, who writes cleanly and briskly, makes us see how essentially similar are the values that Ms. Joyce and Mr. Johnson believe they fought to uphold, values of equal opportunity and reward for merit. He offers, too, a nice glimpse of the High Court's deliberations on the case through the access that the retired Justice William J. Brennan Jr. gave him to his files.
The book does have a failing: it does not deliver the human texture it promises. We meet Mr. Johnson and Ms. Joyce, but we do not really get to know them, or their lawyers, colleagues and judges. Depth and drama are missing from some key moments. But for those seeking a reliable and accessible examination of a growing national debate, this is a fine place to start.

THE IDEA BROKERS
Think Tanks and the Rise of the New Policy Elite.
By James Allen Smith.
313 pp. New York: The Free Press. $24.95. 
 The connection between knowledge and power is no doubt most fascinating to people who have some of the former and crave more of the latter. Still, readers with no aspirations to govern the governors can find rewards in "The Idea Brokers," James Allen Smith's account of the increasing influence of experts on Washington during the past century, particularly for the light it casts on intellectual fashions and fallibilities.
After an overview of the changing role of what Mr. Smith calls the policy elite -- people who apply their knowledge of economics or political theory or foreign policy or whatever to public affairs, to "speak a useful truth," as he puts it -- he returns to the beginnings of the American Association for the Promotion of Social Science. To the worthies who founded it in Boston in 1865, Mr. Smith tells us, "social science, reform, and notions of Christian charitable obligation were virtually synonymous."
Although the religious element would be muted or discarded in time, the principle of doing good by first doing research would remain at the heart of the rationale for the brain trusters, think tankers and assorted academics and specialists who found their way into Government service (to use a kind term) as the executive branch flowered in the ensuing decades. In 1988, some 28,100 social scientists were making their livings off the Federal Government.
Early in the 20th century, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation and the Russell Sage Foundation went into the betterment business in a big way. Influenced by the Progressive spirit, Margaret Olivia Sage, then the richest woman in the world, set the objective for generations of enlightened benefactors: apply research to the solution of social ills. The social minded Sageites organized themselves into groups with no-frill titles like Child-Helping, Women's Work and Charity Organization. Mr. Smith credits such movements with seeking explanations for poverty and ill health not in moral failings of the poor but in what he calls "the interplay of social phenomena."
Mr. Smith, who has taught American history at several colleges, lacks the knack for bringing personalities like Mrs. Sage to life on the page, and his narrative, while serviceable, does not have a lot of snap to it. But he is good at explaining how major policy-research institutions grew out of the popular notions of their times. For example, he finds the mania for efficiency of the early 1900's in the workings of the Brookings Institution, the Twentieth Century Fund and the National Bureau of Economic Research; all shared the conviction that harmony in the workplace could be attained by the application of reason. Considering that Marxism was making its mark elsewhere in these years, the faith in efficiency might be taken as enlightened capitalism's counterattack.
Bad times are good for experts, and Mr. Smith gives a shrewd account of the role of Franklin D. Roosevelt's brain trust (Rexford G. Tugwell, Adolf A. Berle and Raymond Moley, charter members) in the New Deal. The President was no intellectual, but he was quick to pick up on fresh ideas and he had the daring to try them out. Planning became a catchword (the National Resources Planning Board actually put out a document in 1934 called "A Plan for Planning"), and some of the innovations made their way into New Deal programs. Here Mr. Smith discerns a significant change, from the expert as bearer of disinterested knowledge to the expert as political instrument. The line between knowledge and power was becoming porous and would remain so ever after.
War, like depression, means prosperity for experts. Economists especially flocked to Washington after 1941 to work out ways to hold down prices at home while food and goods were dedicated to the war effort. They did a creditable job, though not without mistakes. "The experience of being disastrously wrong is salutary," observed John Kenneth Galbraith. Government paid its tribute after the war by setting up the Council of Economic Advisers. Now the outsiders were inside.
Cold war seems to have been as inviting as the hot kind as far as experts were concerned. Research organizations like the RAND Corporation, which contracted its services to the Pentagon grew fast, and phrases like "systems analysis" and "game theory" began showing up in the newspapers. Robert McNamara brought a famous company of "action intellectuals" from RAND to the Kennedy Administration's Defense Department.
Mr. Smith reminds us that the 1950's saw a drawing away by intellectuals from abstract ideas, along with an increased suspicion of ideology. Some influential historians portrayed the United States as the exemplar of the liberal consensus; policy experts could see themselves as expediting national desires like those expressed in Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society program, which also happened to suit their own political tastes. Mr. Smith attributes their imminent decline to their "hyperrational attempt to impose a quantitative order on the world." He says their failure to educate the public had "tragic" consequences.
The book adopts a somewhat puzzling tone of lamentation about the failure of the experts to realize their promise. Although Mr. Smith does not quite come right out and say so, what seems to be bothering him is the spectacular rise to influence of conservative intellectuals, like Irving Kristol, who prospered from the concentration on cold war strategies and the spotty record of liberal domestic reforms, such as the War on Poverty.
Laying the credit or blame for the neoconservative upsurge of the 1970's to a failure of communication by liberals may be a touch too simple. But Mr. Smith does make a case that entrepreneurially inclined operators like the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation and the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research have outmaneuvered liberal groups in working the marketplace of ideas. The conservatives were not hurt, of course, by the big money available from richies like Joseph Coors, John Scaife and the John M. Olin Foundation. As interested in advocacy as in research, all have marketed their message in the form of congenial books and personalities.
Nearly two-thirds of the 100 or so policy research groups now in Washington were set up after 1970. The drift has been rightward, but the collapse of world Communism and the onset of world recession may bring another of the periodic shifts that Mr. Smith helpfully chronicles. For now, as viewers of television news programs and talk shows can confirm, experts of a sort that our author calls policy interpreters are flourishing. Whatever their other qualifications, they know what the tube likes, and have earned their labels of "instant experts," "media professors" and "quote doctors."
For his peroration, Mr. Smith quotes Henry A. Kissinger, probably the highest ascender from the corridors of academe to the groves of power: "Most foreign policies that history has marked highly, in whatever country, have been originated by leaders who were opposed by experts. It is, after all, the responsibility of the expert to operate the familiar and that of the leader to transcend it."
Reflecting on the largely unpredicted events in Eastern and Central Europe in 1989, he adds that when experts can neither foresee nor explain, "the shroud of their mystique is ripped away." For anybody who agrees with Woodrow Wilson that experts had best be kept in their place, that is a comforting observation.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
In Times Square, Dignity by Day, Glitter by Night

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger

 BODY:
In the shotgun marriage of office buildings and honky-tonk that is coming, slowly but steadily, to replace the tawdry Times Square of old, the newly finished skyscraper at 1585 Broadway, between 47th and 48th Streets, represents an achievement of sorts: it is a building that manages to come off more as sleek than showy, more as refined than glitzy. The special zoning laws that were adopted several years ago to preserve some of Times Square's old rakish flavor -- requiring that new office towers have huge advertising signs and special lighting -- have been followed so slyly here that there is no real way to tell that this building is any different from the towers that go up anywhere else in town.
The architects of this 42-story building, the firm of Gwathmey Siegel & Associates, and the developer, Solomon Equities, were no fans of the city's new zoning. Plopping signs onto the facade of a building signaled esthetic violence to the architects, who saw it as destructive of the beauty of their building's form, and economic disaster to the developer, who feared that advertising would drive away prospective tenants and undercut any attempt to give the tower a blue-chip image. The compromise that was devised between the city's zoning laws and these architects' and builders' own interests is in fact quite ingenious: 1585 Broadway has been designed with a base of glass and metal panels behind which elaborate signs, visible only at night, will be hidden. The notion is that at night the building will dazzle, while by day it exudes corporate dignity. 
 There's no way yet to tell how well this will work, of course, since what nobody realized when the city passed its special zoning laws in the mid-1980's was how difficult it would be to rent the spaces set aside for signs on the facades of Times Square's new buildings. No one has taken the sign space on 1585 Broadway yet: the spaces are huge, and the cost of electronic equipment for up-to-date signs is enormous.
 But this building is not alone -- even before the present economic downturn, most of the new sign spaces required by law on new Times Square skyscrapers were going begging. The one thing that can absolutely be said in favor of the Gwathmey Siegel solution is that it leaves 1585 Broadway better prepared for the recession, at least esthetically. For this building has a real facade, designed to stand on its own, that looks reasonable even when not a square inch of the sign space is rented. By contrast, the tower's neighbor a block uptown, the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, has ugly, unfinished brick waiting for a sign that may not come for years, a glaring offense at the pedestrian.
 It's for reasons other than signs, though, that 1585 Broadway has been probably the most eagerly awaited of Times Square's new pieces of architecture. It is the first major skyscraper designed by Charles Gwathmey and Robert Siegel, architects whose elaborately detailed, lavishly executed modernist houses and offices have made them big-time architectural stars of the last two decades. Mr. Gwathmey and Mr. Siegel tried one tall building a little more than a decade ago, a dormitory at Columbia University that turned out to be a structure with an exceptionally harsh, almost crude, presence. After that disappointment, they produced mainly sleek modernist houses, small office buildings, and interiors for clients like David Geffen, Steven Spielberg, and Saul and Robert Steinberg.
 Almost everything they did was widely published, but the partners' work was as closely followed in schools of architecture as in the pages of the glossy magazines: they seemed, for a while, to be serving as serious architecture's leading emissaries to the world of 1980's glitter.
 Maybe that balance -- a little theory, a little knowledge of the commercial realities of the world -- is the ideal preparation for designing a Manhattan skyscraper. For at 1585 Broadway Mr. Gwathmey and Mr. Siegel have pulled off the difficult leap from small buildings to large ones, a leap that has daunted many practitioners before them. Whatever else can be said about this building, it looks to have been designed by architects at ease with and excited by the demands of making a tall building. It isn't an East Hampton villa turned on its side: it's a tower made for midtown Manhattan.
 To start with what's best, Mr. Gwathmey and Mr. Siegel have given this building an exquisite sheathing of blue-green glass, white patterned glass, mirror glass, silver-gray aluminum panels and polished stainless steel. It's a kind of laundry list of modern elements, but here put together into a geometric pattern that manages to be neither flat nor dull. The real achievement is that the architects have found a way within the modernist vocabulary to give their building the thing most modern buildings most urgently lack: texture.
 There's a loose similarity between 1585 Broadway's "skin" and that of Citicorp Center, and the comparison is instructive: this building's facades, made of panels developed by PPG, have a sense of visual depth, and they change dramatically in different kinds of light. Citicorp's aluminum skin is flatter, and looks the same except at a few rare moments in the setting sun. What Mr. Gwathmey and Mr. Siegel have struggled to prove here is that it is possible to do in metal almost all the things that more traditional architecture does in masonry: offer richness, depth, texture and graphic complexity.
 This building steps away, at least tentatively, from the modernist tradition of lightness -- not to real heaviness, but to a tantalizing combination of solidity and airiness. What is most appealing visually about 1585 Broadway is the sense it projects of being both dense and light at the same time.
 As in so many buildings today, there is a little too much architecture here. The facade, for all the richness and strength of those aluminum panels, has a bit too much going on. It doesn't help to have little sections of mirror glass at the corners as a weak allusion to classical quoins. And the top, in which four sides slant inward to create a kind of cross between a gabled roof and a cut-off pyramid, couldn't be more wrong for this building. It's as if the architects wanted so much to prove that they could use the modernist vocabulary to play post-modern visual games that they went overboard, and the result is superficial and glib. Moreover, this quasi gable emphasizes the other real problem with this building's shape: its squatness.
 From the street, though, 1585 Broadway sits comfortably, even sumptuously, on its site, presiding rather more grandly over the north end of Times Square today than it will in the future, when another tower goes up on the site across the street that is now being excavated. The shape of the building, if clunky at the top, is exactly right at street level, with a strong base aligned to the building's frontage on Broadway, and a series of setbacks neatly shifting the tower's axis so that the main shaft rises not in line with Broadway's diagonal, but lined up with the rest of the Manhattan grid. One of the setbacks, at the sixth floor, bows out in a graceful curve that is not only handsome in itself, but is also the key element in the deft shift of the building's visual axis.
 But best of all is what happens just inside the doors of 1585 Broadway. There is a grand lobby running from 47th to 48th Streets that is not only exceptional among Manhattan office-tower lobbies, it ranks among the best public rooms created in this city in the last decade. It is a kind of modernist ballroom, its sweep of space broken only by two huge, round columns; with rough-finished walls of gray granite, accent stripes of dark green polished marble, a floor of white, black and dark green marble in a geometric pattern, and (in a detail that is striking, almost daring) a coffered ceiling of wood, this room is spectacular, even exuberant. Yet this lobby has all the sense of control that one expects from Charles Gwathmey and Robert Siegel's work: this magnificent room stands as proof, once and for all, that these architects have figured out how to be comfortable with bigness, and it is a splendid gift to the city.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
How to Snare Elusive Bargains From Airlines

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
"WITH the current bad economic climate," one travel agent said in New York, "the airlines are not going to offer any specials on any tickets they can sell at a regular price. What they are saying is, 'If you want to travel and you are willing to meet our terms on days and places, you can travel for a cut rate.' "
This column will outline steps to get the big discounts when they are available. It assumes that you do not have a ticket in hand yet, as "downgrading" an existing ticket to match an advertised promotional price is now the exception rather than the rule, said the agent, Joseph Vengersammy of Galo Travel. 
 The airlines are hustling. The mail is full of coupons and the ads full of specials: For example, British Airways sent out coupons for free round-trip companion tickets on one flight a day from New York to London or one a day to Manchester, England, between Jan. 15 and March 15; the return, valid until March 25 -- the Monday before Easter -- is good for one flight a day from each British city. If London is the choice, a ticket to travel Monday to Thursday, purchased 21 days ahead, would cost $632; for weekend travel it would be $685. (British Airways created an even cheaper deal a week later, and Pan Am, T.W.A., Continental and Virgin Atlantic matched it: $249 for a New York-London round trip, meaning that two people could travel to London for $498. The last departure date is March 17, the last return March 22. The disadvantage of this one is that reservations could not be made and nor tickets bought until 48 hours before the flight.)
Continental is sending a set of coupons to its frequent-flier members. A coupon is good for a discount of $35 on a ticket costing $100 to $250 or $50 on a ticket costing over $250. These are valid for flights between April 10 and June 15.
By the time an ad appears or a coupon arrives, the few promotional-fare seats on the most desirable flights may be gone. Everyone who flies is aware by now of yield management, the computerized technique that controls the number of seats offered at a certain fare and that keeps revising the number on the basis of demand and expectations of no-shows. Airlines do not usually advertise their specials until they apply for Government approval, but the line's agents begin selling it beforehand. This is what wipes out the good fares on the good flights on the day of the first ad.
One irate traveler said that he phoned Delta on Nov. 19, the day a $25 companion fare was advertised, to buy tickets from Hartford to Atlanta on Jan. 25 and back on Jan. 27, 66 days thence. He said the prime-time tickets were already gone and reported that he was told that only 15 seats on the flight he wanted had been available at the companion fare to start with. This traveler could have had the fare if he bought a ticket for midmorning departure and a late-evening return, but that was not what he wanted. Or, more correctly, he did not want the fare enough to adjust his hours of travel.
Flexibility Is the Key
So a "get that fare" manual for the consumer starts with the question of day of travel. Be flexible.
For most regular fares, the cheapest days for travel are usually Tuesday noon to Thursday noon. But the deeply discounted fares may have other rules, so the first question to ask the ticket or travel agent is, "What days of the week would qualify me for that bargain fare?"
If the fare has cut-rate fare available in midweek, it may save $25 or more each way. An illustration: On Jan. 17, Midway Airlines was quoting a midweek round trip from Midway Airport in Chicago to New Orleans in February after Mardi Gras at $227, including the $5 Chicago fuel surcharge; United and American were quoting the same price out of O'Hare. With a Friday departure and a Sunday return, the price rose to $270.50. Valerie Stringer of Travel Avenue said that there weren't many weekend seats available at that price.
New York-West Coast flights, which have been on a $298 special that expires Feb. 16, had different rules on travel days. United, Continental, American, Delta, USAir, Midway, America West, Northwest and T.W.A. all specified departures from New York Wednesday to Saturday and returns from California -- all the major airports were available on this special -- Sunday to Wednesday. As Mr. Vengersammy said, "These weekender fares are not designed to meet the traveler's needs, but to see if the traveler is willing to pay for the seat on the airline's terms."
If flexibility on day of the week produces no results, the alternative airport move is the next step. Unless you are really familiar with what your alternatives are, you should first do some research.
So the second big question for saving money is,"What if I leave from that airport instead of this?"
Here are two examples of big savings with alternative airports. In the middle of January, T.W.A. came out with a round-trip fare of $298 from Philadelphia to Albuquerque, N.M., valid until Feb. 20. The available days were Wednesday to Saturday outbound and Sunday to Wednesday return, and the maximum stay was eight days. From New York, the Albuquerque fare was $453, making the alternative a saving of $155, ample to cover a train trip to Philadelphia.
On Jan. 18, American, USAir, Midway, United and Northwest jumped in with a $138 round trip -- $5 fuel charge not included -- between Chicago and Bradley Airport, which serves Hartford and Springfield, Mass. It was for sale only until Jan. 31 but it was valid for travel until Feb. 28. Outbound travel could be Sunday to Friday, but the return could not be before Saturday, or the outbound trip could be Saturday, with a Saturday night stay required. For comparison, the nonrefundable fare between Chicago and Boston for this period on Northwest, Delta, T.W.A., USAir and Continental was $283, making Hartford a saving of $145.
Dial and Redial
There have been cases where bonanza fares are announced, with the sale to begin like a race, at 7 A.M. Eastern time on some later date. One strategy for this is available to people who have automatic redial devices on their telephones. One reader said she started dialing the number before the appointed hour and, when she got a busy signal, simply pressed the button to redial the number until she got an answer. This does not happen often, but redialing is probably worth trying.
It seems to me as the market gets crazier, it is silly to do without a travel agent. Travel agents are notified by the airlines about forthcoming coupons, or learn from one client that there are coupons in the mail and call to tell another. If the agent has been working with you for some time, she or he will keep you from buying a ticket for a trip where a forthcoming coupon may save you money. If there is lots of notice and the venture is worth the reward, the agent can become the equivalent of the redial device, checking the prices regularly.
The discount travel agency is another way of saving money. It charges you a flat fee for producing a ticket but rebates to you the discount it is given by the airlines for selling its wares. The more expensive the ticket, the more worthwhile this is. But a discount agency will not attend to vague ideas or shop around for several weeks. On domestic tickets, Travel Avenue (641 West Lake Street, Chicago, Ill. 60606; [800] 333-3335), formerly McTravel, rebates to you the airlines' discount of 7 to 10 percent of the price and charges $10 for writing the ticket. For a ticket over $100, the agency guarantees a saving of $5. The transaction is all by phone, with credit card charges. The ticket is sent by United Parcel.
The agency's clients know what they want when they call, although flexibility on days is a big key. The president of Travel Avenue, Richard Dickieson, said that the agency did not have a rule on how long agents could stay on the phone with one client. But it is clear that a salesperson cannot take a caller through every possibility and needs to close up a sale pretty quickly.

 BODY:
PRESERVATION of the past is big business in America, but nowhere is it bigger business than in Natchez. I was brought up in England on the notion of the house as museum, but I was quite unprepared for the astonishingly determined re-creation of a bygone age that I saw in the many houses of Natchez during Pilgrimage Month.
Natchez is named for the Natchez Indians, who first settled there on the almost-mile-wide banks of the Mississippi, which now divides the state from Louisiana. Its tropical climate, fish, fruits and live oak and magnolia trees soon attracted white invaders, including French, Spanish and British, who ultimately dispatched the eponymous natives. By the 1800's, when the area became part of the Mississippi Territory, Natchez was a desirable little town, with prosperous trade generated from the Mississippi River and surrounding plantations. Its European heritage and successful economy encouraged fine architecture, and plantation owners vied with each other in building town houses to repair to when plantation life palled. 
 Unlike many parts of the South, Natchez escaped much of the pillage and burning that took place during the Civil War. Even the houses that were occupied by the opposing armies were treated with care except in a very few cases, and thus when the war was over the sense of continuity was comparatively easy to sustain.
A small oil boom in the 1970's infused the town with some much-needed new funds, most of which have dried up now, but which allowed the tourist industry to get a solid footing by restoring and promoting 30 or so antebellum houses out of the hundreds still extant in the town, attractions that are now the pride of Mississippi and a riveting experience for the first-time visitor.
Pilgrimage Month is actually almost two months, one in the spring and one in the fall. All 30 houses -- most privately owned, all restored to varying degrees -- are opened to the public on a kind of shift system, organized into morning and afternoon tours. It is impossible to see all the houses; you would go crazy in the attempt. Last April I visited 20 in four days, and by the end I felt if I was shown one more piece of baroque Victorian furniture by John Belter I would take a match to it; the idea of admiring one more portrait of a proud owner's granddaddy made my eyes fill with the wrong sort of tears. As with all such tourist bonanzas, discrimination is the key. My favorites, of course, indicate my own idiosyncracies, but these descriptions may give some idea of what to expect from the houses, which are scattered all over town.
Rosalie, built around 1820, is one of the most important houses in Natchez for both esthetic and historic reasons. It is situated on a small knoll overlooking the Mississippi, perfectly placed for admiring the view and for military occupation. With its sturdy brick facade and solid white columns, it looks ready for any invasion, even the hordes of tourists who now traipse through its noble, high-ceilinged rooms.
During the Civil War, the Union Army occupied Rosalie, treating it with respect. The only room to sustain damage was the dining room (a cracked mantel), which was used by the soldiers as a mess hall. (Two huge mirrors in the front parlor were taken down, wrapped in quilts and stored in a cave during hostilities, and were later rehung in perfect condition.) Rosalie's furnishings are typical of the mid-19th-century Southern houses one sees all over Natchez -- Belter or Belter-style furniture, rosewood pianos (all Southern belles learned to play), heavy damask fabrics (some original, most not) and finely-carved cornices and moldings. Six to eight acres of the 22-acre garden had been planned as a formal landscape, but is now rather spottily planted.
Lansdowne, built in 1852, appealed to me because, unlike some of the more monumental Greek Revival structures, it is one story of pale pink painted brick, giving it an Italianate feel. Jean Zuber contributed scenic wallpapers to the interior, which is also filled with rosewood and mahogany furniture, and Egyptian marble mantelpieces. The 140 acres of grounds are evocative -- trees hung with Spanish moss, streams, woodland. Inside, the wallpapers are particularly interesting, many of Italianate scenes in subtle monochromatic colors by Zuber.
Edgewood also has a very beautiful approach, including the fascinating sight of bayou-like lakes with trees growing out of the water. Its facade is dark pink stucco, unabashedly Italianate, with slim columns running the full length of the house.
High up on my must-see list is Montaigne, another stucco house painted in the subtle pinkish terra cotta of Edgewood, with gray shutters, enhanced by a supremely elegant portico and pediment. Built in 1855, the interior of Montaigne was destroyed by runaway slaves and white scalawags during the Civil War; chandeliers were smashed, silver and brass melted down, fine furniture and moldings cut down for firewood. But the original owner, a lawyer named William T. Martin, rebuilt it and today it houses Chippendale furniture, marble mantelpieces, Zuber wallpapers, and a lovely staircase. (Seeing the many period or original wallpapers in these houses was one of the most thrilling treats for me; I remember Chinese motifs and pineapples at Elms Court, English roses at Stanton Hall.) Perhaps the most exciting part of Montaigne, however, is the garden -- 23 acres of trees and shrubs, including live oaks, an azalea walk punctuated with double cherry trees and lined with camellias, and the most sensuous brick wall I have ever seen anywhere, looping and dipping with the grace of a suspension bridge, anchored with pedestals and finials, and revealing orchards and woodland beyond.
Most of the other houses on the tours have some elements of those described above, with fine antique furnishings, historical details and beautiful wallpapers. Like English country houses, the majority of them are lived in year-round by descendants of the original owners, thus exuding a loved and cherished feeling, with family photographs and heirlooms displayed everywhere. Many are designed round courtyards, with outbuildings that once housed laundry, kitchens and schoolrooms.
Stanton Hall, the Pilgrimage Garden Club showcase, is grand and well landscaped and has restaurants and overnight accommodation. Dunleith and Hawthorne have been glamorously modernized and thus have lost any period interior interest. Melrose has a lovely floor-through hallway, with doors opening to gardens at each end, like some English houses. Melrose also has hand-painted canvas-covered floors, originally to protect the wood, but very impractical and labor-intensive to us admiring them now.

 THE rest of my superlatives I save for a house called Longwood, an octagonal Oriental fantasy on the lines of Brighton Pavilion, built for Dr. Howard Nutt and his family by the Philadelphia architect Samuel Sloan. The drama about this house is that it was never finished. Eighteen months after it was begun in 1859, the Philadelphia masons and artisans imported by the architect rushed back North. Dr. Nutt, a Union sympathizer, lost all his money and died (aged 48) during the war, leaving his wife and eight children and their servants to live in the basement of the half-built house. At the end of the war the house was sold.
What is left is a symbol of the Old South so poignant that I doubt Margaret Mitchell herself could have come up with a better one. The exterior of Longwood is in perfect condition, down to its Byzantine arches and splendid onion dome. Inside, the house is a shell -- uncovered brick walls, bare supporting beams, naked niches for statuary and lighting. One can look up right up to the top of the dome's skeleton and admire the many wooden planks crisscrossing in a spiral of consummate carpentry. In one ground-floor corner of this echoing space is a stack of packing cases and open, wrecked, empty steamer trunks, all covered with a fine white dust, like archeological finds from a distant civilization. In fact, the whole effect reminded me overwhelmingly of Pompeii, with its ghostly rooms, its sense of life tragically interrupted.
Plans of the original house are on display, showing how the basement had been designated as a billiard room, game room and storage space, but became the hiding place where Mrs. Nutt and her family sat out the war. The basement is now filled with Nutt furniture and heirlooms. The gardens are mostly trees and ponds, no formal structure having been laid out before disaster struck.
Most of the surprisingly large estates of these Natchez houses are very rundown, which may disappoint critical gardeners (although not this one; I found them atmospheric and very touching). As a former owner of one of these houses remarked as we walked around Montaigne, "the biggest problem for people in this business is the upkeep of the gardens." I particularly enjoyed the five to seven acres of formal gardens at Elms Court, built, like most Natchez houses, on a knoll, as the owner, Grace McKittrick MacNeil, said, with terracing to control the rainwater runoff. "My father," she explained, "started using terraces for ornamental purposes." She also showed me a beautiful eglantine rosebush growing up her veranda in the middle of which a cardinal was sitting on its eggs. (Elms Court, unlike most other houses I visited, also has a plant list.) Another house with a lot of character is Elgin, a true plantation house dating from 1791, which also has a very interesting overgrown garden full of running-wild climbing roses, set in 50 acres of wilderness and woodland.
After a few days of exposure to these romantic settings, one certainly gets a powerful sense of what it was to live in the antebellum South, a sense fiercely promoted by the crinoline-clad women, many of them the owners themselves, who lead you through their precious mansions. (The religious connotation of the title "Pilgrimage" is no accident.) Actually, by the end I was desperately scurrying past the open doors of parlors and bedrooms to avoid the clutches of the eager belles in hooped skirts, who seemed never to grow weary of telling yet one more time about this beautiful four-poster bed or that crystal chandelier.
One night at dusk I took a restorative drive through the town of Natchez, away from the chic, manicured tourist areas toward the shabbier neighborhoods. Linton Avenue (on the way to the National Cemetery) seemed to me to express another side of the Natchez story -- antebellum homes as beautiful (although smaller) as the Pilgrimage tour houses, but neglected, unrestored, crumbling, with roses the size of cabbages blooming in the unkempt gardens.
This twilight trip stayed with me when I set out for the evening's entertainment. For the tourist's indoctrination doesn't end at sundown: I had the choice of the "Confederate Pageant," a star-spangled affair in the City Auditorium, presenting richly costumed tableaux of the South's finest moments, or "A Southern Road to Freedom," a musical show presented by the Holy Family Catholic Church Gospel Choir, which took place in a conference room of the Natchez Eola Hotel. I sprinted from one to the other on the same night, the juxtaposition affording a startling contrast. The "Confederate Pageant" made no reference to, nor indeed included performers from, the black population that my meager knowledge of American history tells me played a key role in the history of the area. The audience, jam-packed for this gala event, many dressed in sequins and silks, seemed not to have noticed this omission. The gospel singers, attended by a mixed, sparse audience, sang songs and told stories of their people from the slave days down to the present, and at the end we all sang "Amen," and shook hands. The implication of these concurrent happenings was hard to ignore.
"Before the War Between the States times were different," proclaimed the narrator at the "Confederate Pageant." "Before the war there were rustling silks, fluttering fans, and the perfume of lovely gardens. Romance, grandeur, chivalry, wealth -- all these are Natchez." The local real estate magnate in Natchez told me that several of the grand houses are up for sale (The Burn, $1.1 million; Linden, $900,000), and that buyers in search of silks and fluttering fans tend to come from Texas and California. Perhaps they bring some sense of reality with them to this stalwart corner of Dixieland. But Natchez may instead be gratefully recognized as the most precious living monument to the dreams of the Old South.
 
A VISITOR'S GUIDE TO ANTEBELLUM HOUSES

 
The Pilgrimages
In 1991, the Natchez Spring Pilgrimage runs from March 9 through April 7, and the Fall Pilgrimage from Oct. 5 through 25. At other times of year, 10 of the 30 houses remain open all day, including Rosalie, Lansdowne, Dunleith, Longwood, Melrose and Stanton Hall. For information, call Natchez Pilgrimage Tours at (800) 647-6742; it is at Canal at State Street, Post Office Box 347, Natchez, Miss. 39121.
During pilgrimage months, there are six tours, and each tour, consisting of up to five houses, goes from 9:30 A.M. to 1 P.M., and from 2 P.M. to 5:30 P.M. Thus, if you stay for three full days, you will cover every tour. Each house is open only on its tour day. The cost is $12 (three-house tour), $14 (four-house tour), or $16 (five-house tour). You must buy your tickets at the Natchez Pilgrimage Tours center.
Visitors can get around by car or a special bus, or with private guides ($50 for a half-day; $100 for a whole day).
There are good parking facilities everywhere in town and I did not see a parking meter in Natchez.
 
Where to Stay
For total saturation, you may actually stay the night in some of these houses, which offer a bed-and-breakfast service. These include Twin Oaks, Monmouth, D'Evereux, Linden, Melrose, Dunleith, Elgin, Stanton Hall, The Burn, Mount Repose and Hope Farm. For further information and room rates, call Natchez Pilgrimage Tours.
Another antebellum house converted into a guesthouse (seven rooms in the main house, plus six in cottages on the grounds) is The Briars, 31 Irving Lane, Post Office Box 1245, Natchez, Miss. 39120; (601) 446-9654 or (800) 634-1818, with the great advantage of a spectacular view over the Mississippi. Double room for two from $120, including breakfast.
Just below it, with more modern amenities is the Ramada Hilltop, 130 John R. Junkin Drive, Natchez, Miss. 39120; (601) 446-6311. Double room $58 in February, $64 starting March 1.
The other large modern chain-style hotel is the River Park Hotel, 645 South Canal Street, Natchez, Miss. 39120; (601) 446-6688. Double room $40 through February, then $65 from March 1 onward.
The best hotel in the center of town is the Natchez Eola, which has a handsome Victorian lobby with pillars, 110 North Pearl Street, Natchez, Miss. 39120; (800) 888-9140 outside Mississippi. Double room $60; $70 during Pilgrimage.
 
Where to Eat
Most restaurants are the paper-napkin-and-plastic-menu kind. Wherever I went I had good fried catfish, the local specialty, and anything with a spicy sauce was satisfactory.
The King's Tavern is the oldest building on the Natchez Trace (the dangerous 500-mile land route connecting Natchez with the rest of North America in the 18th and early 19th centuries), and shows its scars -- bullet holes, ancient wood beams, an interesting atmosphere in which to dine on steak and seafood; a three-course dinner for two with a bottle of wine is about $50. The King's Tavern, 619 Jefferson, Natchez, Miss. 39120; (601) 446-8845.
The Cafe LaSalle and Juleps Restaurant, both in the Natchez Eola Hotel, (601) 445-6000, are well-designed and unusually pleasant for hotel restaurants. Juleps, open for lunch only, has a daily buffet for $4.95 ($7.95 on Sundays). Cafe LaSalle serves dinner, with an emphasis on seafood; a three-course dinner for two with wine is about $60.
The only restaurant with pretensions to serious cuisine has the off-putting name of The Pompous Palate. Don't be put off, however, for the menu is varied (quail, lobster, shrimp, crawfish enchiladas) and the cooking and service excellent. Address: Jefferson and Pearl; (601) 445-4946.
For a truly spectacular half-hour, I suggest a drink at the Natchez Landing or Cock of the Walk, where you can sip your mint julep while watching the sun set behind the huge bridge that arches across the Mississippi. Natchez Landing, 11 Silver Street; (601) 442-6639. Cock of the Walk, 15 Silver Street; (601) 446-8920. -- C. S.

Expanding a Doll House

 BODY:
Beatrice Behrman began making rag dolls in 1923 and by 1930 they had developed molded heads and limbs, eyelashes, fingers and the grand name their creator had assumed: Madame Alexander Dolls.
The famous little toys, always associated with a familiar story, important women or national costumes, still are produced in Harlem and many have become mother-to-daughter heirlooms.
Now the factory will be moving from 615 West 131th Street to a larger site on West 155th Street between Eighth Avenue and Macombs Place. No moving date has been set.
The New York State Urban Development Corporation is making a $33,500 grant to the New York City Public Development Corporation to help pay for preliminary environmental assessment at the 77,000-square-foot site.
The Alexander Doll Company plans to build a two-story, 121,425-square-foot plant to allow for the expansion of its workforce. The company, which was bought by outside investors in 1988, already employs 585 dollmakers, accounting for about a third of all light-manufacturing employment in Harlem, according to the Urban Development Corporation.
Mrs. Behrman died last year.
Most of the new site is city-owned and will be leased to the manufacturer, which will then buy the remainder from private owners.

HEADLINE: The Rent Tug of War In Commercial Space

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
JEAN KAHN, a Manhattan baker, is a survivor of the real estate boom gone sour. The owner of Patisserie les Friandises, a croissant and cake shop on the Upper West Side, she has gone through four years of tenacious bargaining with her landlord.
She has threatened twice to move. As a result, she said, her rent, $60 a square foot when she signed a 10-year lease in 1986, has been cut almost in half to $32 a square foot.
And the tug of war continues. 
 "It's incredible how much vacant space is available," said Ms. Kahn, whose shop is on Amsterdam Avenue between 92d and 93d Streets. "I still might move."
Efforts like hers to bring down commercial rents are being made across New York City. Tenants, ranging from multinational corporations to tiny corner retailers, are demanding reductions, even before their current leases expire.
Legal skirmishes and financial brinksmanship abound. In a market where commercial leases normally run 5 to 25 years, with their crucial, long-term financial implications for business, experts say commercial tenants are approaching their landlords with an aggressiveness unlike anything in recent memory.
"Tenants see opportunities now that may not be available when the market gets out of the trough," said Steven A. Swerdlow, senior vice president of Coldwell Banker Commercial Real Estate Services, a New York brokerage.
One result is a new dynamic in commercial real estate.
During the mid-80's, owners of retail space demanded 50, 100 or even 200 percent increases on new leases, forcing many small enterprises to move or close, and making "gentrification" a dirty word in the New York vocabulary.
Now the shoe is on the other foot.
"In this market, any tenant who hasn't at least asked for a rent reduction is crazy," said Clark Wolf, a Manhattan consultant to retailers and restaurateurs.
Real estate executives point to many reasons for the shift. Vacancy rates of offices, stores and other commercial space are rising. Large corporations, particularly Wall Street firms, leased more space in the 80's than they needed -- and much more than they need in the current slump -- and are scrambling to sublet to other companies.
Some landlords are under additional pressure from their banks. Those who refinanced their properties in the early 80's, when interest rates plummeted from a peak of over 16 percent, typically did so with 10-year loans, and will soon seek extensions or new financing.
And since real estate lenders regard high vacancies as high risks, any landlord hoping for favorable treatment by his bank must do all he can to keep his tenants in place. All of which may be good for New York City.
"It has be positive," said Herbert Morse, senior managing partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm. "The city remains an expensive place do business, but this should narrow the difference."
TWO major corporate tenants, Peat Marwick and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, scrapped their existing leases on their Manhattan headquarters in January and negotiated long-term renewals. Although neither got a rent reduction, they did get commitments on their current space with little rent increase into the 21st century.
Peat Marwick's prior lease was not due to expire until 1994, but it signed a 15-year extension to 2006. Bristol-Myers's prior lease, not due to end until 1999, was extended to 2009.
Others have been unable to extricate themselves from leases on huge blocks of office space they no longer need and are trying to sublet to other companies, even if that means taking a loss.
One company with too much space is Merrill Lynch, which negotiated 25-year leases in the early 80's for 2.3 million square feet of offices in two new towers at the World Financial Center in lower Manhattan. Soon after the buildings were completed and Merrill Lynch began moving in 1985, it began looking for subtenants.
Merrill Lynch said it set aside $470 million from its its 1989 earnings, in part to cover the cost of its excess space.
In November, it said Nomura Securities International, a Japanese securities firm, had subleased 325,000 square of its space, but it is still trying to find tenants for 170,000 square feet more.
Some corporate tenants, meanwhile, have obtained steep rent reductions.
"For the first time I can remember, the cost is going down," said Bill Skellinger, vice president of Petry Television, which sells television advertising air time. After threatening to move, Petry renegotiated its lease in January on four floors of offices at 3 East 54th Street.
Although Mr. Skellinger declined to specify how much Petry is paying for its space, real estate executives close to the transaction said its rent was reduced more than 30 percent.
To be sure, the bargaining position of tenants is limited by their contractual obligations when they sign leases. Typically, tenants pay security deposits that equal one to two year's rent when they sign leases, an amount that would exceed $1 million for large corporations and over $100,000 for even small retailers. The deposit is immediately lost by those who break leases, and landlords can take legal action to hold tenants to other financial obligations.
Some tenants, particularly retailers and restaurateurs, also have large investments in the fixtures they install, which are normally sacrificed if they break their leases. Although rare, some also sign personal guarantees to landlords, meaning they pledge their personal assets -- as well as those of their business -- to guarantee that their leases will not be broken.
Still, business is business. Comparing what might be saved by breaking a lease to the cost of litigation, some have decided to take a walk.
"We've made a simple business decision," said Christopher Pine, head of real estate for Burke & Burke, a company with 15 Manhattan restaurants and gourmet food stores. Burke & Burke said last week that it had broken a 15-year lease for retail space in a Chemical Bank building at 95 Wall Street.
Chemical said it has sued, citing a $150,000 personal guarantee attached to the lease by Joe Burke, president of Burke & Burke. But Mr. Pine said the company was willing to pay the price of legal penalties.
"There is obviously a price affixed to walking away from a lease," he said. But because of layoffs and the weak economy in the financial district, the cost of operating a store on Wall Street would be higher. "We'll pay a settlement," he added.
SURVEYS indicate office vacancy rates, now over 16 percent throughout Manhattan, have been rising steadily since the mid-1980's. The Cushman & Wakefield brokerage said vacancies in modern, well located midtwon Manhattan buildings had risen to 17.2 percent in 1990 from 6.6 in 1984, and average rents had risen 9 percent to $40.26 a square foot.
Vacancies in the best office buildings in lower Manhattan reached a low of 9.8 percent in 1986, and rose to 16.1 percent last year, the company said. It said downturn rents fell 7 percent, to $32.99 a square foot.
Retail vacancies are also expanding. M & B Resources, a brokerage and consulting firm, said vacancies in Manhattan rose to 10.3 percent in 1990, after having between 9 percent and 9.5 percent in the 80's. It said the average price of retail space had more than doubled in the early 1980s, to a peak of $63.50 a square foot in 1986, but since then has fallen back slightly, to $59.25 a square foot last year.
Real estate executives say the result is clear to commercial tenants across the city. "Any tenant who signed a lease between 1981 and 1985 is now paying a lot more than the market, and any tenant who is at all sophisticated knows it," said Mitchell Steir, senior managing director of Julien J. Studley, a commercial brokerage in Manhattan.
He added that the disparity in rents on new or renegotiated leases now, and those signed in the early 80's, is even higher than the surveys suggest because of generous "escalator clauses" landlords obtained in the earlier transactions. Among these were "porter's wage" provisions, in which tenants agreed to cover wage increases for porters and other building employees.
Some of the provisions meant that the rent due on a lease signed in the early 80's has risen 50 percent, he said. And while tenants now negotiating leases immediately reject inflated escalator clauses, those who agreed to them years ago are demanding relief.
Indeed, not all negotiations have involved legal threats. "It's a double-edged sword," said Michael Hirschfeld, president of M & B Resources. "Landlords don't want their tenants to be forced out of business because they certainly don't want to be sitting on more vacant space in this market."
Stores, restaurants and other small businesses often abide by a formula that dictates spending no more than 10 percent of their gross income in rent. Mr. Hirschfeld said many of the tenant-landlord negotiations are based on the tenants simply demonstrating that their receipts have declined, and their rent has become too big a burden.
Large corporate tenants have a special advantage in dealing with their landlords, whose success rides partially on the prestige of the companies in their buildings.
"AT a time when both local and national economies are experiencing contraction, such leases provide an important expression of confidence in New YOrk City," said Mayor David Dinkins, who in January joined a press conference to announce the lease renewals by Peat Marwick and Bristol Myers. Both companies are headquartered at 345 Park Avenue, a 44 story building.
Although both companies declined to say what their rent bill will be, Lewis Rudin, their landlord, said the lease extensions give them "a firm fix" at what he termed "very reasonable rent."
"My crystal ball may not be any good, and maybe this space will be worth twice as much in five years," Mr. Rudin said. "But they put something on the table and so did we."
"There was no acrimony, no 11th hour threats," he added. "I think this is good testimony to cooperative tenant-landlord relations."
The case of Ms. Kahn, the Amsterdam Avenue baker, reflects how sharply business conditions have changed for many New York City tenants since the peak of the city's economic boom.
WHEN she opened her shop in 1986, paying $60 a square foot, Ms. Kahn said, her block was filled with book, furniture and stationery stores, and appeared to be emerging as a fashionable retailing center, drawing affluent costumers from among the young professionals who had flocked to the Upper West Side.
That began changing the year later, she said, when the stock market collapsed, the city turned a corner toward recession, drug dealers began appearing on the block, and her fellow retailers began going out of business. Now, she said, 40 percent of the stores, on her block are vacant.
James Goldstick, director of retail leasing for Mark Greenburg Real Estate, Ms. Kahn's landlord, said her situation was "a special one" because her block has gone through a "very difficult period."
Ms. Kahn said her business has survived mainly as a wholesale supplier of backed goods to hotels, delicatessens and restaurants elsewhere in the city. Even though her rent has been sharply reduced, she said she had not backed off from a tough bargaining position.
"I told my landlord if he wants me to stay, he better be nice," said Ms. Kahn, whose last round of negotiations with her landlord was in November. For now, she added, she has agreed to honor her lease only on a "month to month basis."

Banding Together for Local Betterment

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
FIRST they were called special assessment districts. Then, after the adoption of legislation by the New York State Legislature in 1982, they came to be known as business improvement districts. Sometimes the term is special services district.
By whatever name, they are commercial or industrial districts in which property owners assess themselves to provide funds to improve their environment. The assessments are mandatory and the money is collected by the municipality on the owners' behalf. 
 A district management association formed by the owners disburses it for purposes specified in a district's plan -- generally security and sanitation services, and street and sign improvements. There are 20 such districts in New York City already and 12 more in planning.
The largest one, the Grand Central Business Improvement District, is now on the verge of adding a new dimension to the concept. Its district management association, the Grand Central Partnership, plans to borrow $28 million to help finance an improvement program. The loan will be secured by the assessments that are paid by the 204 properties in the district to the city's Department of Finance, currently at a rate of 11.4 cents a square foot per year. The assessments are mandatory on owners.
With an inventory of 51 million square feet of space, roughly the same as downtown Los Angeles, the Grand Central district is hardly representative of business improvement districts generally. Most are on a much smaller scale. But the district is nevertheless a prime example of the ever more ambitious collaborative efforts among downtown property owners to improve and sustain the public environment, in their own interest and the municipality's.
And not just locally.
Richard Bradley, president of the International Downtown Association in Washington, says that there are about 1,000 such districts in the United States and they have been forming at an accelerating rate as states adopt the enabling legislation that gives the districts the power to tax their property owners. A total of 38 states have these laws so far.
In New Jersey, improvement districts have "taken off like a rocket" in the last three years, following the adoption of enabling legislation in 1984, said Lawrence Houstoun(cq), principal in the Atlantic Group, a consulting firm in Cranbury, N.J., and Philadelphia. Six are in operation -- in Engelwood, Cranford, New Brunswick, Elizabeth, Trenton and Somerville -- and at least two others are in formation, in Bayonne and, for industrial properties, Kearny.
Property owners in Newark are planning a major district, with about six million square feet of space and an initial budget of $1.2 million. And in Connecticut, where the term is "special services district," state officials estimate that there are 10 to 20, including two in New Haven and one in New Britain.
In New York City, a proposed improvement district for the 34th Street area would embrace 225 properties totaling 36 million square feet of space, with 140 owners. It is under review by community boards at present and could be in operation by next January. Other large districts are in planning stages for the Times Square area and for Metrotech, the large development undertaking in downtown Brooklyn.
Not everyone is sanguine about the growth of business improvement districts. The economist Robert B. Reich sees them as a further example of the "secession of the affluent" in American society, because they enable locations he describes as affluent to provide special services that are not available to the city generally. He cites the Grand Central district as an example.
HISTORICALLY, business associations have tried to assess their members on a voluntary basis to help meet mutual beneficial goals -- Christmas lighting displays in retail areas is a common kind of project. In the 70's, New York City began using community development funds to help local retail districts begin "community revitalization" programs, an effort that continues. The more successful of these have been transformed into true business improvement districts, making use of a 1982 law sponsored by Assemblyman John C. Dearie, a Bronx Democrat-Liberal. The law authorized the tax collection system.
In New York State, districts must have the support of at least 50 percent of the property owners, representing at least 50 percent of the property. In New York City, the district must win approvals from the community-board, the City Planning Commission and, since last year, the City Council. It is an arduous process that depends for success on committed business leadership.
The impetus for the Grand Central district came from the Grand Central Partnership, an association of property owners, at the suggestion of Kenneth Lipper, former Deputy Mayor for Economic Development in the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, in 1985. The partnerships's chairman is Peter Malkin, general partner in the ownerships of the Lincoln Building at 60 East 42d Street and the Graybar Building at 420 Lexington Avenue. Among the large owners who signed on are Olympia & York Properties, Metropolitan Life and Manufacturers Hanover Trust. It took two and a half years to get owner and public approval through Community Boards 5 and 6, the City Planning Commission and the Board of Estimate.
In the district's first year, 1989, assessments of 9.2 cents a square foot produced $4.7 million. The district now collects $5.8 million at its 11.4-cent-a-square-foot rate. (Property taxes paid to the city typically run from $5 to $12 a square foot.) The Partnership's total budget is $8 million, which includes grants and contracts for social services, principally for a program to aid the homeless in the Grand Central area. About half the work force of 185 does street cleaning or security work. Security personnel wear uniforms, but carry no arms.
WHAT lies ahead is a $28 million borrowing through a public agency at tax-exempt rates that will pay for an ambitious program of improvements on city property. After consultations with community boards, the street improvements must be approved by the New York City Arts Commission or the Department of Transportation or the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The first $2.5 million will be spent on the floodlighting of Grand Central Terminal, said Daniel Biederman, president of the Partnership.
New street lights, trash receptacles, signs, plantings and possibly paving insets along 43d Street between Fifth and Vanderbilt Avenues and south to 42d Street are being planned. If approved, installed and successful, similar treatments will be extended throughout the district.
The beneficiaries, Mr. Biederman says, are not property owners, businesses and office tenants alone but, perhaps more conspicuously, average New Yorkers who use the streets. Services and benefits will be provided that would seem an unwarranted luxury if the city paid for them, and it wouldn't, he said.
The model -- the inspiration, it might be said -- for the Grand Central district is Rockefeller Center, whose remarkably well-tended environment covers 22 acres and two miles of underground concourses. The tending is done by almost 2,000 maintenance people, either on staff or under contract, said Lorian L. Marlantes, president of Rockefeller Center Management Corporation.
"Two nights a week we use steam devices to take the chewing gum off the sidewalks," said Mr. Marlantes.
It is at the small neighborhood level rather than in the central business district that most of the business improvement districts have been formed. The city's Office of Business Development and its predecessor agencies have helped 160 commercial districts establish revitalization programs since the 70's. Fourteen of these have "graduated" to self-subsidized business improvement districts, said Barbara Wolff, the assistant commissioner who has long directed the program.
Assessment methods differ. At the Hub in the Bronx -- Third Avenue from 148th to 153d Streets, established in 1988 -- owners pay $85 a front foot. The budget this year is $256,000. On Grand Street in Brooklyn's Williamsburg-Bushwick section, assessments are based on a formula combining front footage with assessed valuation. The budget is $65,000.
"We're encouraging more business improvement districts," said David A. Smith, commissioner in the Office of Business Development. "It's a marvelously flexible tool."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: East Side Rehabilitation;
Creating New Roles For Art Deco Buildings

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
IF not alpha, there was at least omega, and many others besides: lambda, rho, delta, gamma, theta, zeta and pi. Hidden almost three decades behind a "modern" travertine facade, these deeply carved Greek letters came surprisingly to light during the renovation of the Beekman Tower Hotel.
They attest to the origins of the hotel, on the corner of First Avenue and 49th Street, as Panhellenic House, a 28-story residence for young women from out of town who belonged to Greek-letter sororities. 
 During the renovation, which is nearing completion, the letters were revealed, as were two panels with highly geometric, Art Deco-style fountains and the cornerstone, which reads "1928."
These features have now been restored or replicated. Although the owners and their architect did not set out on an archeological mission, their discoveries were of particular interest, since the all-suite Beekman Tower is being considered for landmark status.
It is one of several landmarks or landmark-caliber properties between First and Second Avenues that are being rehabilitated.
The former Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, 304 East 44th Street, is another vivid Art Deco building from 1928, enlivened by painted terra-cotta panels showing the architecture of Athens, Paris and Rome. It is being recreated as the headquarters of the American Federation of Musicians and Employers Pension Fund, a subsidiary of which owns the building, to designs by Milo Kleinberg Design Associates of Manhattan.
Two blocks south is the 21-story Tudor Hotel, 304 East 42d Street. It is on the western edge of Tudor City, which was completed in 1928 by the Fred F. French Company, and is part of the Tudor City Historic District. But unlike the apartment buildings, with their Tudor-style architectural embellishments, the hotel is a much purer, modernistic composition.
In 1989, a rehabilitation and restoration project began, in affiliation with Sarova Hotels of London. "We're hoping to have a four-star hotel operating by mid-spring," said Fred Dinerstein, general manager of the Tudor. There will be 303 room and 14 suites. The architect is Vijay Kale of Manhattan and the owner is Charles Goldberg of Queens.
One nearby building whose much-discussed renovation has gone nowhere is the former United Nations School at First Avenue and 51st Street. This 99-year-old structure was built as Public School 35 and is being used as a shelter for homeless women. Last Monday, 172 women were housed there.
Since 1983, the city has been trying to sell the building -- with a requirement that the Romanesque Revival facade be preserved -- in the hope that it would be redeveloped. But five prospective purchasers, most recently a Florida developer who could not get needed financing, have either walked away from the project or been eliminated.
Today, the city has no immediate plans for the building other than to keep using it as a shelter, said a spokesman for the General Services Department, given the cost of relocating the people who stay there, as well as the building's recent sales history. Eventually, the Public Development Corporation may offer the property again in a negotiated sale.
Meanwhile, work at the Beekman Tower is almost complete. It was undertaken by Manhattan East Suite Hotels, a nine-hotel chain owned by the Denihan family. The architect was Douglas F. Korves of Manhattan.
Benjamin Denihan and Arthur W. Bresciani bought the hotel in 1963. "We gutted the building and turned it into an apartment-hotel," said Daniel Denihan, Benjamin's nephew, who is a managing partner of Manhattan East, which is based in Manhattan.
The hotel drew much of its business from United Nations missions and from large corporations that needed rooms with kitchens for weeks at a time, to house employees who were being trained or relocated.
By the late 1980's, the 170-room hotel was showing its age. "The rooms needed a complete facelift," said Donald G. Denihan, Benjamin's son, who is also a managing partner. Guests had been loyal but the occupancy level dropped between 1987 and 1988. "It was starting to show in the numbers," said Robert Hansen, the general manager.
AS a result of the renovation, the lobby, a dark space with a heavy Victorian feeling to it, was lightened considerably. A giant settee in the form of a geometric sunburst became the centerpiece. The ground-floor restaurant -- Peartree's, for many years -- was rebuilt as the Zephyr Grill, with decoration inspired by the streamlined trains of that name. Upstairs, the guest rooms got new carpets, furniture and paint.
A one-bedroom suite, with a full bathroom, a powder room and a kitchen that includes a dishwasher and microwave oven, can run between $180 and $245 a night.
Panhellenic House was designed by John Mead Howells, who also won the famous competition for Tribune Tower in Chicago. The starkly powerful hotel has none of the Gothicism of Tribune Tower, however.
"In the huge, square monolith, one feels the vertical steel structure under the sheathing of concrete and brick," declared an article in The New York Times in 1928, which described the tower as "an outstanding example of American skyscraper architecture."
Although the building is not an official landmark, it has been proposed for landmark status. Therefore, the Buildings Department would not approve work without review by the staff of the landmarks commission. "We even had to get approval to take the travertine off to find out what was underneath," Mr. Korves said. "The landmarks staff was delighted to hear that we found the fountain panels and Greek letters."
IT happened that Mr. Korves had long admired the Beekman Tower and did not envision radical alterations. "When you work in a building as historic as this -- even if it isn't technically a landmark -- you have to do it with a light hand and respect the original architect," he said.
"The work that the architect is doing is very good design and very sympathetic to the building," said Tracie Rozhon, spokeswoman for the landmarks commission. "This is a wonderful example of why we encourage architects to work with us even before a building is designated."
As successful as the renovation may have been, the Beekman Tower is suffering from the effects of the recession, the war in the Persian Gulf and the collapse of Eastern Airlines. Its occupancy rate in January was 65 percent. But in general, Daniel Denihan said, occupancy had been "pretty strong" in the all-suite Manhattan East chain.

HEADLINE: Sludge: New Focus On Recycling

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
THE day is near, officials and environmentalists say, when the waste flushed down kitchen sinks, toilets and industrial drains will be filtered, processed, packaged and ultimately sold as fertilizer, ground cover and even decorative mulch to be spread around shrubs and flower beds.
Prompted by impending Federal and state bans on ocean dumping of sewage sludge, municipal utility authorities and sewage treatment plant officials across the state are reassessing their long-term plans for disposal of the solid wastes contained in sewage. 
 At the same time, faced with marked increases in costs no matter what alternative disposal method they choose, and aware of the public's opposition to incineration, officials are finding that beneficial uses for sludge are often economically and environmentally preferable to burning or burying it.
Notwithstanding the trend toward the recycling of sludge, however, officials of some of the state's largest sewage treatment plants say they may be forced to adopt incineration unless Federal regulators grant them more time to assess alternatives and to develop stringent pretreatment requirements for industrial sewage.
 
'No Longer the Nefarious Product'
 At the same time, state environmental officials have also expressed a change in attitude toward the burning of sludge, a method that had been previously considered acceptable. The officials are now establishing a task force to look into alternative methods for dealing with the estimated two million dry pounds of sludge that New Jersey residents and businesses produce every day.
 "Sludge is no longer the nefarious product that it has been publicized as over many years," said John Hagerty, a spokesman for the State Department of Environmental Protection. "We feel that we can now treat it as a commodity instead of a waste."
Officials say that compost derived from sludge can be used as fertilizer and cover material on athletic fields, golf courses, highway roadsides and the almost half-million acres of harvested cropland in the state.
 Indeed, in a report issued by the department in last November, officials estimated that markets existed for 100 percent of the sludge now generated in New Jersey. Currently, only 10 percent of the state's sludge is being recycled through land application.
 
Destroying Harmful Organisms
 Dr. Karen J. Giroux, assistant director of the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said that sludge that was relatively clean to begin with -- free of heavy metals often found in industrial sewage -- could be composted and then used as a fertilizer or as a nutrient for non-food-chain crops. Composting is a natural process that destroys harmful organisms by biologically generating heat when wood chips are added.
With effective pretreatment to remove heavy metals, Dr. Giroux said, "the final product of composting is essentially pathogen-free and a useful product for improving soil fertility."
The Camden County Municipal Utilities Authority, for example, now sends all its sludge to a plant in Philadelphia to be composted and takes the compost back when it is finished. The county then uses it for the top layer of several landfills.
"Compost is licensed by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture as a specialty fertilizer," said Dennis W. Palmer, director of operations for the Camden authority. "Nurserymen can use it, and professionals can use it as top dressing around plants."
Camden County officials are so pleased with the results of their sludge composting program, Mr. Palmer said, that they are now designing their own composing plant, which will handle up to 250 wet tons of sludge each day.
But while most experts agree that recycling sludge is preferable to incinerating it, a large percentage of the state's sludge is still scheduled to be burned.
The Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission, for example, which processes almost a quarter of all the waste water in New Jersey, has applied for a permit to build a sludge incinerator for the estimated 500 dry tons of sludge that it produces each day.
"We've calculated that it would be less costly to the taxpayers to incinerate," said Carmine T. Perrapato, executive director of the commission. "But when you mention the word 'incineration,' unfortunately it's not very well received."
As a result, Mr. Perrapato said, though the commission is still going forward with its incinerator permit application, it is also hiring consultants to assess other potential methods of treating the sludge. "Right now," he said, "our aim is incineration until somebody comes to us and says, 'Here is a plan that will work.' "
 Passaic Valley is one of six New Jersey sewage treatment plants that have been dumping sludge in the Atlantic Ocean at a site 106 miles offshore. The five others -- the Bergen County Utilities Authority, the Joint Meeting of Essex and Union Counties, the Linden Roselle Sewerage Authority, the Middlesex County Utilities Authority and the Rahway Valley Sewerage Authority -- along with Passaic Valley, account for almost 58 percent of the total sludge produced in the state.
Several years ago the Federal Government ordered the offshore site closed to New Jersey dumpers as of Dec. 31, 1991. But the State Legislature, concerned that dumping contributed to the pollution that closed several beaches in the summers of 1987 and 1988, imposed its own deadline of March 17, 1991.
Lawsuits generated by the Federal closure order resulted in court-approved agreements among the six authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department of Environmental Protection. Those agreements require the authorities to develop short-term and long-term sludge disposal plans by specific deadlines.
 Most of the short-term plans developed involve shipping the sludge to out-of-state landfills. And while almost all of the original long-term plans initially contemplated incineration, at least three of the authorities now plan to recycle their sludge.
Middlesex County, for example, will be converting its sludge into a soil product that will be used as cover at a county-operated landfill. The county currently has to purchase the cover material it uses.
Despite that savings, however, the change from ocean dumping will still be an expensive one for Middlesex. "It means about $10.6 million in additional costs," said Frederick Kurtz, executive director of the Middlesex County Utilities Authority. Ocean dumping costs Middlesex County about $4 million each year. Recycling the county's daily production of 120 dry tons of sludge will cost about $15 million a year.
 
Sludge Quality at Issue
 The Rahway Valley Sewerage Authority, which originally chose incineration as its long-term solution, recently modified its plans to allow for recycling of its sludge. And though the cost of recycling the sludge is three to four times more expensive than ocean dumping, said Richard Tokarski, executive director of the authority, officials found that it was less expensive than incineration.
 The ability to recycle, however, depends upon the quality of the sludge itself. The quality of a given area's sludge is often adversely affected by the presence of a large number of industrial contributors to the waste stream, whose sludge contains heavy metals like copper, cadmium and lead. The only way to improve sludge quality in such an area is to require pretreatment of the waste water at the point of emission and before it gets to the main treatment plant.
 And that, officials say, takes time and money.
The Bergen County Utilities Authority, for example, is required under its consent agreement to have long-term plans in place by September.
Anticipating that requirement, and proceeding in accordance with previous state policy, officials there developed plans for the construction of a sludge incinerator in Little Ferry.
 
Public Opposition Grows
 Over the last few years, however, public opposition to incineration has intensified while official support for the burning of sludge has dwindled. Indeed, state environmental officials are now encouraging the beneficial use of treated sludge and are discouraging incineration.
But that has left large sewerage authorities like those in Bergen County, Passaic County and the Joint Meeting of Essex and Union Counties with expensive incinerator projects still on the drawing board. And with the time constraints imposed by the consent agreements, those authorities have little choice but to go forward with their original plans unless the Federal Environmental Protection Agency agrees to extend their deadlines.
 Such an extension is needed in Bergen County, said Larry J. McClure, executive director of the Bergen County Municipal Utilities Authority, to give officials there time to improve sludge quality.
 
'Wasting Public Money'
 "We're talking about going out and monitoring all the industrial dischargers and forcing them to upgrade their pretreatment systems," Mr. McClure said. "We probably need at least another year. In the meantime, we are literally wasting public money having to pursue false avenues."
The State Department of Environmental Protection, in an effort to develop a comprehensive state policy for sludge disposal, is now assembling a task force to examine such issues and to propose new regulations.
And while incineration will not be expressly prohibited by the new regulations, greater emphasis will be directed at assessing pretreatment and beneficial-use options, said Judith A. Yaskin, Commissioner of Environmental Protection. Ms. Yaskin will be stepping down as Commissioner on Friday.
Anticipating the one issue that often arises with recycling, Ms. Yaskin said insuring a market for the recycled sludge would also be addressed.
But with 300 landfills throughout the state needing land cover, she said, and with millions of acres of agricultural land needing fertilizer, finding a market for treated sludge should not be a problem.
"We've got the supply, and we've got the demand," Ms. Yaskin said. "And we will never again have to resort to dumping in the ocean."

HEADLINE: Newcomer Creates a Stir in Corridors of Power

BYLINE: By States News Service

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
REPRESENTATIVE Robert E. Andrews has been in Washington only 100 days, but he has already begun causing a stir.
Pundits called Mr. Andrews, Democrat of Bellmawr, the "miracle child" for overcoming the anti-Democratic sentiment that almost unseated Senator Bill Bradley. New Jersey lawmakers have praised Mr. Andrews's instant popularity. And he has attracted attention throughout Congress as one of only two lawmakers to vote against war in the Persian Gulf under any circumstances. 
 "Rob Andrews has made more of an impact in a few weeks than I have seen many members make in a few months or even a few years," said Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of Englewood. "He has become known and established."
Mr. Andrews, 33 years old, is one of the youngest Democrats ever to have been chairman of the Camden County Board of Chosen Freeholders, and now he is the youngest Democrat in Congress. A Camden native with a bachelor's degree from Bucknell University and a law degree from Cornell, he is eager to share his ideas and plans.
He is confident of where the Democratic Party -- even Congress as a whole -- should be going. And he is having a great time.
 
'The Best Job in America'
 "It's the best job in America," Mr. Andrews said, sitting in his office in the House Longworth Building. The bookshelves are still bare; the desk is tidy and uncluttered.
Mr. Andrews is one of 44 new House members and one of two from New Jersey. The other, Representative Richard Zimmer, 47, a Republican, replaced James A. Courter in the 12th District.
Both New Jersey freshmen are lawyers, the class's most popular occupation. The newcomers' average age is 54, and they represent an eclectic mix, from Bernard Sanders of Vermont, a Socialist, to Gary Franks of Connecticut, the first black Republican in the House in 56 years.
But Mr. Andrews has got a jump on most of his classmates, taking over Gov. Jim Florio's former seat in the First District as soon as election results were certified on Nov. 10. Wiry and energetic, Mr. Andrews can hardly contain his excitement. He attends every Persian Gulf briefing, welcomes all lobbyists, returns every reporter's telephone call. The only thing like it that he can remember, he says, is waiting as a child for Christmas morning to arrive.
"I literally woke up one night at 4 o'clock in the morning when I was down here and couldn't go back to sleep, because I couldn't wait for the day to begin," he said. "I mean, all the things I was going to do."
 On a typical day, Mr. Andrews has plenty to keep him busy. One recent day began at 8 A.M. with a briefing on the Persian Gulf from Adm. William J. Crowe, retired, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. For Mr. Andrews, the debate over the war has proved the greatest challenge of his first days in Congress.
"It's hard to imagine a more compelling decision that one would have to be a part of than the decision to send young Americans to die," he said. Like his colleagues, he had to choose between authorizing force in the gulf or calling on President Bush to exhaust diplomacy and sanctions before resorting to force.
 
Both Options Rejected
 After extensive meetings with constituents, who, he said, largely opposed military action, Mr. Andrews rejected both options. The only other member of Congress to do so was Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon. Mr. Andrews said that even the second resolution calling for sanctions and diplomacy did not ultimately rule out war.
"I was not against sanctions," he said. "I took the vote for reasons of clarity, and taking a definite stand. I did not want to be in a situation where I had authorized war, because I felt it was not the proper policy."
Democratic colleagues responded with respect. "It was a very thoughtful and conscientious decision and evoked a lot of admiration on my part," said Representative Thomas Foglietta, Democrat of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Andrews says that now that the United States is at war, however, he fully supports the President. And briefings like the one with Admiral Crowe have helped him explain the war to constituents back home, Mr. Andrews said.
At 9 A.M. Mr. Andrews returned to his office for a meeting with Stephen Minikes, a lobbyist for the City of Philadelphia. The topic: how to save the Philadelphia Naval Yard.
This is Mr. Andrews's top legislative priority this year. With base closings on the horizon, he is worried about the shipyard and the 3,000 people in his district who work there. He and Mr. Minikes agreed on a strategy that would highlight the shipyard's new role in the war. The aircraft carrier Saratoga, which was rehabilitated at the shipyard, has been sent to the gulf, Mr. Andrews pointed out.
"Part of the prior argument against the yard is that these kinds of ships were obsolete," he said. "What has happened in the last 30 days has really put the lie to that argument."
Next, Mr. Andrews headed to the Capitol Building for a meeting of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee. Once there, he had no compunction about asking a guard where to find Room 114. His ego is not on the line, he said, as is the case with some freshmen who pretend to be experts and end up wandering the halls for hours.
"I'd rather get to the meeting and show a little humility," he said.
Mr. Andrews takes care at all times to wear the square gold pin that identifies him as a member of the 102d Congress. "I wear it so people don't think I'm a page, actually," he said.
 
Reviewing the Schedule
 After a pro forma vote to elect Representative Paul E. Kanjorski, Democrat of Pennsylvania, as regional Democrat whip, Mr. Andrews returned to his office for a 10:30 A.M. staff meeting. The first order of business was to review the day's schedule. "So everyone, especially me, knows what they're doing," said Mr. Andrews, who loves to joke with staff members, visitors and friends.
Mr. Andrews admitted to being somewhat scatterbrained about life's more practical details. Day-to-day domestic responsibilities are apparently not his forte. Fran Callanan, Mr. Andrews's scheduling secretary, has a lock on his schedule, and an accountant handles his finances.
But when it comes to discussing legislation with his staff, Mr. Andrews is in his element. One bill on his agenda was a measure, written by Representative William J. Hughes, Democrat of Ocean City, that requires states to follow uniform beach testing standards. The bill has unanimous support from the New Jersey Congressional delegation, but Mr. Andrews had questions.
"Why do we need a Federal law telling us to do that?" he wanted to know. Characteristically, he was resistant to a law that would rob states of local control.
 
Concern for Middle Class
 "I would like to be known as someone who brought middle-class people back into public policy," Mr. Andrews said. "And this is a New Jersey concern, because we are such a middle-class state. But I think it's a concern that plays on the national stage as well."
Mr. Andrews also takes a hard line on protecting the flag. He and his skeptical staff began a debate on First Amendment rights, patriotism, the distinction between action and speech. This easy back- and-forth of ideas and arguments was his favorite part of the day.
But as the time for an appointment approached, Mr. Andrews sent away the staff and welcomed Susan J. Loomis, a lobbyist with the Associated General Contractors of America.
"I wanted to come by and welcome you," said Ms. Loomis, assuring Mr. Andrews that she knew they would not always agree, but that all she wanted was "an opportunity to be heard on the issues."
Ms. Loomis leaned forward to make sure Mr. Andrews understood the association's position. Among other things, the association fears that a new bill discouraging companies from hiring replacements for striking workers could tie employers' hands. Ken Holdsman, Mr. Andrews's legislat ive director, was sympathetic, but Mr. Andrews jumped in.
"I will tell you right up front that I am for that," he said of the bill. With Ms. Loomis, as with other lobbyists, Mr. Andrews made no promises.
 
A Ceremonial Duty
 Just before noon, Mr. Andrews headed back to the Capitol Building for a luncheon with Mr. Torricelli. But first he had a ceremonial duty on the Capitol steps. Michael Owen, a senior from West Deptford High School, was in Washington with the National Young Leaders Conference. Mr. Owen arrived at the Capitol wearing black earmuffs and a New Jersey pin, ready with his camera for a photograph with Mr. Andrews.
Friendly and chatty, Mr. Andrews asked Mr. Owen about his college plans. After smiles and clicks, Mr. Andrews ducked inside to meet Mr. Torricelli, whose advice helped Mr. Andrews land seats on committees with an economic emphasis: the House Education and Labor Committee and the Small Business Committee.
"Rob Andrews represents a lot of what I hope will come to prevail in the Democratic Party," Mr. Torricelli said. "He is idealistic, but he has a clear, practical understanding of how to get things done. Some of his instincts may be liberal, but he has a moderate approach."
The afternoon left Mr. Andrews time to telephone a long list of reporters. But in midsentence he was startled by a nasal, buzzing sound. "What do all those bells and buzzers mean?" he asked his staff, nervously pacing the office.
A quick call established that in 10 minutes, Mr. Andrews would have to vote on whether to condemn Iraq's attack of Israel, its treatment of prisoners of war and Soviet violence in the Baltics.
"We're voting 'yes' on all of these, in case anybody calls," he yelled, dashing out the door.
 
Shouts From Members
 At 3:45 P.M., the House floor was mayhem. Members stood in clusters and pairs, shouting at the top of their lungs while a chairman pounded vainly on the gavel. Mr. Andrews was there, almost indistinguishable from his colleagues in a charcoal gray suit, white shirt and gray tie.
By 5:45, after going through his mail and getting visits from more lobbyists, the office was empty. But for Mr. Andrews, the day was not yet over. Two receptions awaited him, given by important potential allies: the American Association of Retired Persons and the American Federation of Government Employees.
At both, Mr. Andrews was enthusiastically greeted by lobbyists who steered him to leading officials for warm handshakes, greetings and small talk. Mr. Andrews was courteous and attentive, ignoring the ample food and drink.
A quick cab ride took him back to Capitol Hill. Mr. Andrews had no social plans, no wife waiting with dinner on the stove. And so, at 8 P.M., he entered a fast-food place on Pennsylvania Avenue before heading back to his empty apartment.

HEADLINE: Free Acres Journal;
A Haven Where Residents Own the Houses but Not the Land

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

DATELINE: FREE ACRES

 BODY:
COMMUTERS cruising along Interstate 78 as it slices through the Watchung Mountains are likely to be unaware that they have just passed through one of the most unusual little communities in New Jersey.
Behind the trees that fill the gorge to the north of the superhighway, a 70-acre enclave known as Free Acres inches slowly into the 1990's while residents fondly stoke the embers of its quasi-utopian past. 
 Free Acres, not a municipality itself but a small sliver of Berkeley Heights, was established 81 years ago by the son of a Presbyterian minister who disdained the idea of individual ownership of property. The community, which now consists of 84 families, is something like a condominium, something like a cooperative and something like a miniature municipality.
But residents say it is nothing like anywhere else in the world.
"I feel like I'm protected in a little cocoon," said Geraldine Runfeldt, 65 years old, who has lived in Free Acres with her husband, Theodore, for 40 years. "I feel like we're all bound together here," she said.
Mrs. Runfeldt is Free Acres' town clerk. She organizes the monthly meetings, keeps track of residents' suggestions and complaints, and records the births and deaths that make any community a changing thing.
"There's just a feeling of family here," Mrs. Runfeldt said. "I know that if something ever happened to me or my husband, there would be a lot of people around who care. It's a very protected feeling."
 Free Acres was founded on the philosophy of Henry George, a 19th-century journalist and economist who believed that land should be owned by the community rather than by individuals. Residents can build houses on lots they lease, but they can never actually own the land. A single annual tax is charged to cover public services like road repair and maintenance of common buildings.
 
Run by Three Elected Trustees
 In 1910, Bolton Hall, a devotee of George, deeded about 68 acres of land he owned in Berkeley Heights and New Providence to the Free Acres Association, a corporation organized to manage the community. The association, now run by three elected trustees, sets policy, enforces rules, keeps track of finances and collects the annual tax from each resident. The association then pays a single tax on the land to Berkeley Heights; residents pay taxes only on their houses.
Leases, which run for 99 years, are automatically renewed for another 99 years each time a property is "sold," and when a leaseholder dies and passes his or her interest to heirs.
"If you really want to get picky about it, we're a combination between a condominium and a co-op," said Joseph Romano, a Free Acres resident. "But if you read the lease, you'll go crazy. If you just sign it and live here and have a good time, you'll be fine."
In Free Acres, it is not considered a bad investment to build a $300,000 home next to a tiny summer bungalow, nor is it odd to buy a small summer bungalow and then put a $200,000 addition onto the back. But it would be quite startling to see someone chopping down a tree.
The association prohibits cutting down trees more than four feet high and three inches in diameter.
The community represents all levels of occupational achievement. It attracts lawyers and laborers, students and scholars, successful architects and, sometimes, starving artists.
"We rented Jimmy Cagney's cottage," said Dr. Fanny Stoll, 88, a physician who bought a home in Free Acres in 1939 after spending a few summers renting from the actor. "The houses were mainly little shacks then. Now they're a little more elegant."
Laurel Hessing, Dr. Stoll's daughter and the unofficial historian of Free Acres, said the community was originally an artists' colony with "a lot of left-wingers" spending the summer in tents and unheated shacks. Over the years, she said, cottages were built on the tent platforms, additions were built onto the shacks and Free Acres began to take on its eclectic but charming hodgepodge appearance.
"Every house has a distinct character," Mrs. Hessing said.
Indeed, no two houses even remotely resemble each other, in style, age or value. Aside from that, it seems to be anyone's guess as to what makes the place special.
"One of the things that makes Free Acres so unique is simply that it has lasted so long," said Martin Bierbaum, a 45-year-old resident who is a lawyer with a doctorate in urban planning. "This community has remained intact for six generations," Mr. Bierbaum said. "Part of the reason is because the community was never static; it was able to bend. And you can't underestimate the nature of the landholding arrangement either."
Jean Brodgesell, 35, who moved to Free Acres nine years ago, said that part of what made the tiny community different was that residents had a greater sense of control than they would in a larger municipality.
"We get to decide how our money is spent," Mrs. Brodgesell said. "We decide what roads need to be paved, and how we want to deal with our forest and our trees."
Donald Heerens, a financial consultant who moved here in 1974, said that being part of such an intimate community drew people together on issues of common interest.
"When you meet your neighbors once a month, you get to know them pretty quickly," he said, referring to the monthly meetings to discuss issues of interest to the community.
Another thing that brings residents of Free Acres together is its children.
"Before I had kids, I didn't know who anybody was," said Laure Holsten, 27, at a recent meeting of the children's play group. "We were ready to move out, and then there was this major population explosion."
That explosion, Ms. Holsten said, accounts for the more than 20 children who now attend the play group weekly at a community-owned farmhouse, parents in tow. And that has an advantage for the parents as well.
"You can't believe how many people I'm friendly with now," Mrs. Holsten said.
But the Free Acres philosophy is perhaps best expressed by Zelda Benjamin, 92, a former actress who moved here with her husband, an artist, in 1937.
"Children form relationships for life here," Mrs. Benjamin said. "Friendships stay very strong, and anybody who goes away always tries to come back."
She looked out the window and through the trees at the dozens of backyards connected to one another by trails that meander randomly through the heart of Free Acres. "See, there are no fences here," she said. "And we wouldn't want it to be otherwise."

Upgraded Status Urged For Chicano Studies

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The Mexican-American com munity of Southern California last week pressured the University of California at Los Angeles to recognize the region's close cultural ties with Mexico by establishing a full-fledged academic department devoted to Chicano studies.
At a news conference on Olvera Street -- the historic heart of the Mexican community in Los Angeles -- a community coalition called the United Community and Labor Alliance formally joined a U.C.L.A. student group, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, in advocating the elevation of what is currently an undergraduate interdisciplinary major -- and a troubled one at that. 
 U.C.L.A. granted $150,000 for this academic year to buttress the program, which lacked office space, a counselor and, according to one Faculty Senate committee, a viable curriculum structure.
University officials said Chicano studies enrolls between 11 and 15 majors and graduates 3 or 4 each year.
But advocates say that Chicano studies is troubled precisely because it does not have department status.
"A department would help train teachers and social workers who could then serve the Los Angeles Chicano community," said John Fernandez, who is on the board of directors of the teachers union, the United Teachers of Los Angeles.
 
 Suspending Admissions
 Campus debate over a Chicano studies department began last February when a Faculty Senate committee recommended that the university suspend new admissions to the major until the program was strengthened.
Since then, students have been meeting regularly with members of the Los Angeles Mexican-American community, including the alliance, which comprises about 40 labor organizations, merchants and political groups, to muster support for a department devoted to the study of the social, cultural, economic and historical development of people of Mexican descent, both in the United States and Mexico.
Citing their frustrations with U.C.L.A.'s bureaucracy, students have also tried cutting through the red tape by writing letters to administrators and politicians, drawing up proposals, attending meetings of various university committees and organizing rallies, including a candlelight vigil at the campus residence of Charles Young, U.C.L.A.'s chancellor.
While several faculty members support creating the department, administrators question whether it is in the university's best interest. Questions like "Is a department the best use of our resources?" need to be answered first, Raymund Paredes, the associate vice chancellor, said in a telephone interview last week.
 
Hard to Recruit Faculty
 He also said it would be difficult for U.C.L.A. to recruit enough faculty members to begin a department because most professors would rather be in conventional departments, Mr. Paredes said. Mr. Paredes himself occasionally teaches Chicano literature courses in the English department.
Chancellor Young has opposed establishing a department for what he considers to be an unconventional discipline, but he is waiting for recommendations from a faculty committee on what to do next.
Vilma Ortiz, a sociology professor who favors establishing a department, said the large volume of work produced in the last 20 years makes Chicano studies a legitimate field of study.
Proponents also say that many interests would be served by establishing a department. "It is important politically for the Mexican community of Los Angeles to point out to U.C.L.A. that for 20 years they have been requesting this kind of education for our youth," said Marcos Aguilar, a junior history major. Mr. Aguilar is one of the almost 3,000 Mexican-American students who make up nearly 9 percent of U.C.L.A.'s 36,000 undergraduate and graduate students.
But Ms. Ortiz, who is working to develop a strong curriculum for the program, said, "Faculty never had time to devote a lot of energy to better the curriculum, which is important. It needs to be institutionalized in a way that will make it stable."

HEADLINE: Commercial Paper Has Troubles, Too

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Banks are not the only lenders tightening credit in these hard times. Some borrowers are having trouble tapping another source of short-term cash -- the commercial paper market, which some analysts had hoped would give a few companies refuge from the credit crunch.
The $740 billion worldwide commercial paper market is in the throes of a shakeout, as the recession, a series of defaults and a proposed regulation force buyers to keep a stricter eye on quality. Although it grew 500 percent in the expansive 80's by serving as a cheaper alternative to bank financing for large companies, the market has recently grown finicky. 
 Today, investors are shying away from all but the highest-rated issues -- a position being encouraged by the Securities and Exchange Commission. On Wednesday, the commission is scheduled to vote on whether to restrict money market funds, the largest buyers of commercial paper, from investing in almost all but the top-rated issues.
For instance, Chrysler Financial, the finance arm of the Chrysler Corporation, has been all but frozen out of the commercial paper market in the last year, significantly adding to its borrowing costs. Last June, its commercial paper credit rating was cut by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Services, two of the major rating agencies, to the third and lowest investment-grade level. Then, last week, the company withdrew its rating to avoid being formally lowered to noninvestment grade by Standard & Poor's.
"It became more difficult to find buyers so we changed our funding strategy to rely less on commerical paper," said Dennis M. Cantwell, vice president for corporate finance and development.
Indeed, at the end of 1990, Chrysler had just $1.1 billion in commercial credit outstanding, down sharply from $10.1 billion a year earlier. To fill the gap, it has sold some of its automobile loans in the secondary market and, like other troubled issuers, turned to its banks for cash -- $6.2 billion by the end of 1990.
But borrowing from banks costs more than issuing commercial paper -- a short-term I.O.U. that provides cash for up to 270 days to cover costs like inventories. Going to the bank increased Chrysler's costs, for instance, by about $25 million in 1990.
But even better-rated companies are having trouble. Companies that carry the second-highest rating from Moody's and S.& P. -- like CSX, the Marriott Corporation, American Brands and Union Oil of California -- have also been knocked off the buy list of many money market funds, which purchase 35 percent to 40 percent of the commercial paper issued in the United States. Marriott, which slashed its borrowing to $100 million in the last quarter of 1990, from $1.5 billion at the end of September, has been forced to secure new bank loans as a backup.
The banks themselves are having a hard time finding buyers for their paper. The major money-center banks have all had their credit downgraded recently, but had already begun to move to reduce their reliance on commercial paper.
 "Right now all you hear is quality, quality, quality," said John Wetzler, sales manager for short-term products at Citicorp Securities Markets Inc.
Still, the group being squeezed is relatively small. Top-rated companies have always accounted for the bulk of the market -- constituting about 84 percent of the total issues worldwide today, according to Moody's. These companies, with A-1 ratings from S.& P. and P-1 from Moody's, include General Electric Capital, General Motors Acceptance, Ford Motor Credit, Sears Roebuck Acceptance and American Express Credit.
Despite the drop in demand for lower-rated issues, the growth of the overall market has only levelled off because the appetite for top-rated paper remains strong.
Companies with A-2 ratings from S.& P. and P-2 from Moody's account for only about 13 percent of the more than 1,000 companies that borrow in the commercial paper market. And companies in the lowest investment grade levels, A-3 and P-3, account for only 2 percent of the market. Unrated companies or those rated below investment grade make up about 1 percent of the market. According to Moody's, there were about 75 unrated issuers with $5 billion in paper outstanding at the beginning of 1990, up from $3 billion in September of 1989.
That growth came from the burst in new issues in the expansive 80's, when credit concerns were less worrisome, lower-grade and unrated issues, like the paper market in general, grew by leaps and bounds. By 1990, the important measure of risk,the spreads in interest rates on top-rated and lesser-rated paper, narrowed to 10 basis points (100 basis points equal 1 percentage point).
But the boom ended abruptly last year after several companies defaulted on their paper, some of which was held by money market funds. Since June 1989, 11 companies have defaulted on a total of $1.1 billion in paper, marking the first defaults in the market since the Manville Corporation's in 1982.
What followed was a period in late 1990 that John Ward, who is responsible for the origination of commercial paper at Citicorp Securities Markets Inc., called the "height of schizophrenia." People worried about whether even quality issuers could fund themselves through the end of the year. Spreads shot up to as high as 100 basis points.
Seven of the 11 defaults were in the newer commercial paper markets in London, Japan and France, which account for the one-fourth of the paper not issued in the United States.
The defaults, and the prospects that a recession would decrease company earnings and bring on more defaults, led the S.E.C. last July to propose a new regulation to limit commercial paper purchases by money market funds. Under the S.E.C. proposal, no more than 5 percent of a fund's assets could be invested in paper without a top grade from the major rating agencies. And that 5 percent would have to be in paper with the second-highest rating.
The recession is not the only force that could disrupt the market. In an article this month, James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, harks back to the first commercial paper default, that of the Penn Central Transportation Company in 1970. While he does not suggest that the market faces the turmoil that the Penn Central default caused, he is worried about the market's backup -- the commercial banks. Most commercial paper is backed by bank loans that issuers can use to pay off the paper when it comes due if they do not have the cash.
"In the days of Penn Central, the banking system was upright and solvent," Mr. Grant said in an interview. "This vast market is undergirded by the promise of bankers to lend and not all of those banks are going to be solvent at the end of the year."
And banks are not eager to honor credit lines to companies issuing commercial paper because they are leary of any loan with any risk. Given the opportunity, they might back out.In fact, after the credit downgradings of Integrated Resources Inc. and the Mortgage and Realty Trust, banks suddenly withdrew their backing, causing Integrated to default in June of 1989 and Mortgage, in March of last year.
Jerome S. Fons and Andrew E. Kimball of Moody's noted that credit quality standards have tightened since then, reducing investors' exposure to these problems. But, they still conclude, "there are clouds on the horizon." They note that in this recessionary environment there can be quick downgradings of company paper that could lead to the withdrawal of backing from banks.
Many traders, dealers and money market fund managers talk much more optimistically about commercial paper's outlook. The market has settled some in the last few months and spreads have fallen back to the 30 basis point range.
Still, money managers are exerting caution. Jay Mueller, portfolio manager at R. Meeder & Associates in Dublin, Ohio, which manages the Flex Fund money market fund, insists that the commercial paper market is not in disarry. But he has not owned any paper below A-1/P-2 for nine months and is not buying any paper from a company backed by a Japanese bank. John Todd, the portfolio manager for Fidelity's Cash Reserve and Spartan Money Market Fund, has also gotten rid of all paper that is not top-rated.
Joseph DiMartino, president of the Dreyfus Corporation, has been less severe, reducing his exposure in the second-tier to about 2 percent of the Dreyfas Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund.
Chuck Mayer, co-head of the commercial paper department at Goldman Sachs & Company, sums up the state of the market with this slightly backhanded optimism: "I don't see that there has been much change in the acceptance of commercial paper. But it has not gotten worse."
 
 
 
DUCKING THE CREDIT CRUNCH
 For some analysts, the rise in the volume of commercial paper even after recessionary signs multiplied late last year was a worry. Assuming additional debt means more companies are likely to have trouble meeting interest payments if a recovery proves to be late in coming, said Nancy Lazar, senior vice president at C.J. Lawrence Inc.
But other analysts have been less concerned by the continuing volume. In fact, George J. Iwanicki, an economist at Kidder, Peabody, has argued that the commercial paper increase is good because it is helping to fill some of the credit gap left by the decline in lending by banks.
"While some analysts are disturbed by the increase in commercial paper financing, we are encouraged," he said. "This is one piece of evidence that whatever credit gap is being created by commercial bank lending restraint is being at least partially filled by alternative sources of credit."
At the same time, he is not sure if this gap filling will play a significant role in turning the economy around.
James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, does not think the commercial paper market is making the bank credit squeeze any easier. He argues that the top-rated companies are still in a position to borrow in the market and possibly from their banks. But, he said, the lower-rated companies that are being frozen out of the market are also having trouble at their banks.
There is logic to this argument. But the fact that the Marriott Corporation has just secured a $150 million loan commitment from a group of banks shows that some companies pushed out of the commercial paper market can still get some help.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Yin-Yang of Rates and Earnings

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Stock markets around the world rallied last week and several analysts declared that the bear market was over. It will take some time for these bulls to be proved right. In the meantime, the markets are likely to move up and down in response to a tug of war between falling interest rates and falling company earnings.
Falling rates represent all that is positive in the markets and the hope for a growing, rather than a slowing, world economy in the near future. 
 Falling earnings reflect all that is wrong right now. Recessions in the United States and Britain. Sharply slowing growth throughout Europe, except for Germany. Banking problems in the United States and Japan. Political and economic deterioration in the Soviet Union. And the Persian Gulf war, playing more in the background these days but ready with a surprise to shock the markets. With the season for reporting earnings upon us, the reminders of all that is wrong could be quite insistent.
"It is the case of whether the glass is half empty or half full," said Roger Palmer, the overall strategist at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. As for himself, he has joined the analysts who have happily waved goodbye to the bear market much sooner than they might have expected.
At the heart of this bullish view are several factors and assumptions. One assumption is that interest rates peaked in Germany at the end of last month when the Bundesbank raised two key rates by half of a percentage point. A report on factory orders for December, which was released Friday, shows that the German economy is slowing down, although it is not anywhere near a recession, meaning that there is no reason to raise rates further, Mr. Palmer said.
For the 12 months ending in December, the rate of increase in the orders fell to 1.8 percent, compared with a gain of 11.3 percent for the 12 months ending in October. And because of the sharp rise in the German mark and the decline of the dollar -- which continued last week despite heavy coordinated dollar buying by central banks from the United States and its allies -- orders for German factory exports fell 9.8 percent over the year ending in December.
Another factor supporting the bullish view is the apparent change in the psyche of the markets, a metamorphosis that began with the optimistic rally at the outset of the gulf war in mid-January. Before the war, when analysts thought stock markets would drop sharply at the outbreak of fighting, it was wise to be risk averse. Stay out of equities was the message.
Now the risk is not being in equities. Cash positions grew enormously because of the cautious prewar strategy. With the buying spigot fully turned on, that cash hoard is making the rush back into the market even more dramatic. Of course, that means there could be some slowing as institutions and mutual funds get closer to their normal cash positions.
One of the stock markets that has rallied the most during this transition is Sweden's, which has been among the best performers in the world this year. Since the beginning of 1991, the market's Affarsvarlden General Index is up just over 12 percent. But like other markets, Sweden's will feel the tug of falling earnings.
Until the end of 1990, this small market had been off most analysts' lists. Interest rates had soared last fall to defend the krona. Inflation remained a problem, as did Government spending in the heavily subsidized society.
But even before the war began, the market had begun to turn. Interest rates were declining and the Government's budget package, crammed with spending cuts, was positively received. And as was the case elsewhere, large investors were flush with cash and started to pour money back into stocks.
The war gave the market another boost. Then the friendly takeover of Alfa-Laval, one of the world's largest manufacturers of dairy machinery, by Sweden's Tetra Pak pushed the market even higher. The Wallenberg family, which has major stakes in many top Swedish companies, including Alfa-Laval, needs to raise cash to reduce its debt burden. And the 16.25 billion kronor purchase by Tetra Pak, Europe's dominant maker of juice and dairy packaging, raised speculation that other companies might be sold. Investors also hoped that some of the cash from the sale would be plowed back into the market.
Now earnings reports are coming out in Sweden. As expected, the 1990 earnings for one major company, Ericsson, rose 30 percent. But when the telecommunications concern released its numbers on Thursday, it also forecast that 1991 earnings would not keep pace -- and that sent the market down 2 percent. It regained about half that decline on Friday.
"It will be the testing period now," said Sven Hagstromer, head of his own brokerage firm in Stockholm. "In the next month we have the reports from the companies and we expect the results to be under current forecasts."
He also expects the extra cash that was on the sidelines to run out soon. "Then we will see what kind of real strength there is in the market," he said.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Wall Street's Steadfast Faith In the Airlines

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Markets can be so inconvenient. No sooner did George Bush point to the stock market rally as evidence that the recession will be short and shallow than the rally began to sputter.
"The market," Mr. Bush told the upper tier of the New York financial establishment, gathered for a meeting of the Economic Club of New York, "seems to be saying there is good reason to be less pessimistic and more optimistic." The next day, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 20 points. 
 Nonetheless, Mr. Bush is right about what the market clearly believes. The explosive rally that began after the bombs began falling shows no sign of letting up. It has swept along stocks good and bad, and even on Thursday, when the Dow fell, there were a few more stocks rising than falling on the New York Stock Exchange.
 The Dow made back those 20 points on Friday, and ended the week with a gain of an even 100 points, or 3.7 percent, to 2,830.69. It is now just 68.57 points, or 2.4 percent, below its level of Aug. 1, just before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
Unfortunately, the stock market's confident forecast of the future is not yet confirmed by reports of business activity. Sales are bad at department stores, worse at automobile showrooms and all but nonexistent at airline counters.
The airlines, and their shareholders, celebrated last month when the start of the Persian Gulf war brought on lower oil prices and when, soon after, Eastern Air Lines finally gave up and stopped flying. The big airlines responded to the disappearance of Eastern with a sigh of relief and a determination to charge customers more. American Airlines says that its average discount fare is now about 5 percent higher than a year ago, when there was no recession.
Most of what has been written on the drastic downturn in air travel has focused on fears of terrorism brought on by the war. No doubt that explanation has some validity, but fare levels have also played an important role.
As last week ended, it appears there was a rush to buy tickets as travelers scrambled to take advantage of a brief two-for-one sale offered by America West, an airline with mounting losses and so burdened with debt that Donald Trump once called it overleveraged.
Now the big question is whether a new round of fare cutting will begin, or whether the damage to profits will be contained as airlines do no more than match America West on competitive routes. It is no coincidence that Trans World Airlines, which is defaulting on its bonds, took the lead in extending, through today, the deadline for buying half-price tickets. Airlines that are desperate for cash find it difficult to take the long view.
For now, the stock market seems to think that a new era of profitability is on the horizon for the air carriers, propelled by falling fuel prices and interest rates. Since the war began, AMR, UAL and Delta, three airlines that everyone expects to be survivors, are all up 20 percent or so. But so are America West and Continental. Optimism does run deep.

THE ECONOMY
 
Help From Washington for America's Humbled Banks
 
Laws passed decades ago to restrict the big American banks might now be rewritten to help save them. What a change in the bankers' image: from heartless oppressors, vilified in American literature and film, to bumbling spendthrifts and lenders to hopeless causes. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady presented a plan on Tuesday for the first overhaul of the banking system since the Depression. While the laws have remained fixed, the banking world has changed. Foreign banks, once cowed by their American rivals, now account for 29 of the 30 largest in the world. Markets as small as a city or state, once dependable, now are too limited and volatile for consistent profits. Restrictions on underwriting securities and a ban on bank ownership by other industries, once essential limits on banks' influence and risk, now are accelerating their decline. Congressional opposition to several features of the plan is inevitable. Many lawmakers come from states that have restricted the ability of banks to branch out even across county lines. But as Federal officials scramble to bail out the bank insurance fund and loosen bank credit, they recognize that the financing of the nation's businesses and consumers is at stake.

Stripping the F.D.I.C. of Power
 
If you can't hit the soldier, shoot at his horse: the Administration's proposed banking laws would strip L. William Seidman's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of its regulatory powers. The plan would split the F.D.I.C.'s authority over banks between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury, leaving Mr. Seidman to meekly watch over his dwindling bank insurance fund. Fast as a House Budget Committee microphone could be switched on, he was ready to denounce the plan as "an invitation to regulatory civil war." In a skirmish last year, the Bush Administration tried to topple Mr. Seidman from his post; his term runs until October.
 
 An Optimistic Budget
 
The din of war and the plaints of recession echo only faintly through the 1992 Bush budget. The $1.45 billion budget he submitted to Congress on Monday counts on an end to the recession by mid-year and allied aid so generous that the Persian Gulf war will cost the nation only $12.8 billion. Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the Administration will probably have to ask for more war money in a few months. The President, painted by the Democrats as the protector of the undeserving rich, hopes to maneuver them into defending some breaks for the wealthy. He wants to limit subsidies to the rich for agriculture, Medicare, school lunches and student aid -- programs dear to many Democratic politicians.
 
 Productivity Gains - at a Cost
 
If American factories have truly become more efficient, why all the dismal, shuttered Youngstowns and Flints? The Commerce Department said last week that manufacturing productivity climbed at a record 3.6 percent annual rate in the 1980's, matching trading partners' gains. A service economy it may be, but as productivity among white-collar workers stagnates, manufacturing accounts for an increasing, 23.3 percent share of the nation's output. But the decade's improvements in plant efficiency have come with the loss of two million jobs. Industries like textiles have reversed their fortunes by automating, but far lower employment is the result. Nobody would comfort a small, failing farmer by saying that the success of the vast, mechanized spread next-door was all for the good. Manufacturing productivity likewise comes at a cost.
 
 California Runs Dry
 
You farm where there's no rain from April through November, build cities hundreds of miles from the needed water supplies, and sooner or later you're going to run dry. After five years of drought, California's state water project has cut off supplies to Central Valley farmers. Rationing is already the rule in southern California. Several economists estimate that losses to the state's farmers, food processors and factories that depend on inexpensive water will reach $3 billion. This in the nation's most populous and agriculturally productive state.
 
 A Whole New Computer Game
 
A powerful group of companies aims to redesign the personal computer from the chip up. Microsoft, Compaq and Digital are nearing an agreement to produce computers and software based on chips designed by MIPS Computer Systems. The group's main targets appear to be International Business Machines and Apple, which have their own personal computer standards, and Sun Microsystems, which makes competing chips.

 
 
COMPANIES


 Bitter Medicine at G.M.
 
While stock market investors rejoiced at the anticipated return of flush times, General Motors prepared for a long recession. The company announced reductions in capital spending and white-collar staffing last week, and cut its dividend almost in half, the first cut in more than a decade. Scott F. Merlis, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, blessed the actions as "creative destruction," explaining, "Excesses will be purged. You're going to end up with a much more efficient industry." Next to cut their dividends, say many analysts, are Chrysler and Ford.
 
The day after G.M. imposed new economies, sales figures demonstrated that consumers are economizing, too. Sales of vehicles made in America dropped 31.5 percent during Jan. 21 to 31 from the same period last year.
 
 Chrysler's Accounting Gain
 
Chrysler managed to recover in the accounting offices what it lost in the factories and showrooms. The company eked out a $31 million profit in the fourth quarter on a bookkeeping change, as expected losses for plant closings and layoffs were reduced. But borrowing will not be among the costs that auto makers like Chrysler can easily cut. Standard & Poor's reduced the credit ratings of all of auto's Big Three, tossing Chrysler into a category reserved for "junk bonds."
 
 An Energy (Production) Policy
 
The White House wants to rely on increased production more than reduced consumption to slake the nation's thirst for imported fuels. A draft of its new energy policy includes tax breaks and deregulation to increase production of coal, oil and natural gas. Many obstacles that have halted construction of nuclear power plants would be removed.
 
 Sony Wants Orion Pictures
 
Orion needs a sugar daddy, and Sony stands ready to fill the role. Sony, which already owns the Columbia studio, wants to buy Orion Pictures as well. For perhaps $500 million, Sony could acquire the rights to Woody Allen's neuroses and probably Kevin Costner's sensitive machismo. Several elaborately produced flops (anyone see "Valmont"?) have left Orion with low earnings and high debts. John Werner Kluge's 70 percent stake in Orion is only a sliver of his multi-billion-dollar investment portfolio. When Orion ran short of money to complete "Mermaids," starring Cher, last fall, Mr. Kluge kicked in $23 million. Now, he seems willing to let someone else provide the sugar.
 
 McCabe Looks to Fill His Ark
 
The first product any advertising professional must promote is himself. In this sense, Ed (It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken) McCabe is off to a grand start. Comparing his opening of a new agency last week to the Second Coming would have been too obvious. Instead, in full-page newspaper ads, he settled for posing as Noah, at an agency deluged with job-seekers, vendors and potential clients all trying to clamber aboard his ark. Only two accounts are on board so far.

INTERNATIONAL

 
 Japan's Designer Scouts
 
More than 300,000 Japanese beaver scouts, cub scouts, boy scouts, senior scouts and troop leaders can confidently dress in gentrified, all-natural fibers, courtesy of Ralph Lauren. At the urging of Akio Morita, the former chief executive of Sony, Mr. Lauren designed new uniforms for everyone. "Just a gesture of goodwill," with no profits to the designer, said Peter Strom, vice chairman of the Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation. The colorations include an earthy khaki with forest green trim, olive with red and royal blue with gold. Plenty of pleats, plackets and pockets to set a rugged but refined tone; no pony insignia, though. American styles are far more popular in Japan than American cars. In an agreement with the Seibu chain, Ralph Lauren sells his other fashions at 11 free-standing shops and the nation's major retailers, with revenues of $700 million a year. Uniform sales have been strong since his designs came out late last year.Next, the scouts will want Philip Johnson to design their tents.
 
 Outfoxing the Supply Lines
 
Just as some Soviets are trying to learn American ways of business, Americans are learning the Soviet ways. An undersand economy has flourished among the troops in Saudi Arabia. Same problem as in Russia: plenty of goods, but a clogged distribution system. Written requisitions, the currency of military supply, have plummeted in value as piles of unfilled orders accumulate. The best-stocked units boast supply officers who are the most conniving. They think nothing of stockpiling camouflage fatigues to swap for some help from forklift operators, or jumping into empty trucks and simply driving them away. "Most people go to prison for this," said one sergeant. "I get promoted."

HEADLINE: An Aging Dancer Fights to Keep Up

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
Does Silicon Valley have a future?
For the first time in its adult life, this storied crucible of research and development in northern California is experiencing a crisis of confidence, questioning whether it can remain the world center for technical innovation. 
 Causing the jitters is a growing fear that companies here are falling behind the Japanese in the race to develop the next generation of computers: one-pound palmtop marvels so portable that they can transmit and receive data from anywhere and so user-friendly that they will dispense with keyboards and take orders from even the most cramped handwritten instructions.
The first of the new machines could arrive within a year and mark the end of the era of deskbound computers.
If the palmtops come with a Japanese name on the box, they could also mark the end of an era for this region, the fertile source for the past two decades of nearly all of the world's most important home and business microelectronic innovations, including videocassette recorders, video games and personal computers.
Although dozens of Valley companies are scrambling to design the software and hardware for the new machines -- and one may yet come from behind to emerge the winner -- the race may already have been lost, many experts say.
"Japan has sensed a lot quicker than anyone else what's going on with these products," said John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer Inc., one of the Valley's first citizens. "The only chance that we have is to leverage our software technology with some of their hardware."
A failure to be first with what many believe will be the next blockbuster technology could consign the Valley to second-class status, forcing companies here either to follow the Japanese lead in product development or to concentrate on niches that the Japanese don't care about.
The Valley is on the verge of becoming a "techno-colony," dependent on innovation from Japan, said one Valley pioneer, Andrew S. Grove, co-founder of the Intel Corporation, at a recent industry dinner in San Jose, Calif.
And since the Valley is seen by many as the archetype of American competitiveness -- as well as one of the key engines of the country's economy -- a decline in its status would produce ripples throughout the nation, affecting everything from factory automation to weapons development.
<> <> A second-place finish in the palmtop derby would also greatly accelerate the pace of investment here by the Japanese, who are eager to tap into the Valley's still-strong stores of software expertise. Many of the most innovative Valley companies are already in partnership with the Japanese and more will have to do that to survive, executives, engineers and computer scientists say.
The growing importance of the Japanese -- and, to a lesser extent, high-tech companies from other countries like Korea -- could actually result in more jobs for the Valley, just as the opening of factories in Kentucky and Ohio by Japanese auto makers has buoyed those areas.
But there are dreadful dangers as well, some Valley veterans say. As the Japanese presence becomes more pervasive, they say, the research effort here could be redirected, captive to a foreign agenda geared to foreign products and priorities.
Indeed, a victory for the Japanese in developing palmtop machines could speed the shift of economic power to Asia, said Jacques Attali, a French writer and theorist who heads the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
With so much on the line, it is not surprising that the Valley seems obsessed these days with checking its pulse. For example, a recent issue of the California Management Review, a publication of the University of California at Berkeley, was largely devoted to the growing debate over the Valley's future.
The pessimists believe that the next generation of computers, referred to as nomadic devices because of their full-service portability, will particularly favor Japanese designers because of that nation's long experience with microelectronic miniaturization. Fully 40 percent of all personal computers in Japan are portables, a number that is expected to soar to 60 percent by the end of next year. In this country, the Japanese already dominate the market for pocket computers -- simple low-end calendars and notetakers like the Sharp Wizard and Casio B.O.S.S.
What's more, the Japanese several years ago wrested away from the Valley large parts of the computer hardware market and they are now the undisputed leaders in the manufacture of semiconductors, the heart and brains of all computerized equipment, as well as most consumer electronics products.
But not everyone in the Valley is prepared to throw in the towel, even if the Japanese win the first round of what will ultimately be a decade-long race to perfect the palmtops.
"I wouldn't count Silicon Valley out yet," said Apple's Mr. Sculley. "If start-ups are going to have a role, then Silicon Valley will continue to be important."
The creativity of the Valley will persist, its boosters say, because no other region in the world can duplicate the hundreds of informal research networks that sprouted here.
"There is such a huge critical mass of very talented engineers here who don't think the same," said Sheridan Tatsuno, a consultant at Neoconcepts, a market research firm in Fremont, Calif. "They're independent-minded and on the leading edge. In Japan there is still a herd mentality: If Sony does it, everyone follows."
Among the optimists is the economist George Gilder, who has argued that each new generation of semiconductor technology spontaneously generates start-up companies, thereby insuring the vitality of the United States microelectronics industry.
But critics counter that while Valley companies are still ahead of the Japanese on the software front, the growing Japanese lead in hardware could cost the Americans their edge in product development and ultimately contribute to the demise of high-tech industry in the United States.
"The United States has developed a system of making technological breakthroughs, but in fact we're falling behind other countries in learning how to manufacture the stuff," said Richard Florida, a management professor at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. The separation of manufacturing from product design, which is particularly evident in the Valley, is a potentially fatal weakness, he added.
 
Inevitable Rendezvous
 In a sense, the Valley has spent a generation preparing for its date with the palmtops. Indeed, for almost two decades, the vision of a portable supercomputer dubbed the "Dynabook" has served as the Holy Grail for the best computer designers here.
First proposed in the 1970's by the computer scientist Alan Kay and a small band of associates at the Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center, the Dynabook has long been envisioned as a notebook-sized device that would be less like today's portable computers and more of a savvy electronic assistant. Unlike current computers, which have to be told exactly what to do, a Dynabook would come with a dollop of intelligence of its own, making it possible to perform certain filing chores and search functions with a degree of flexibility.
When the Xerox researchers built their first prototype of the Dynabook in the late 70's, it was the size of a hefty sewing machine. And at $50,000 each, it could not be manufactured at a reasonable cost. What got developed instead, a few years later, were the first commercial portables from Valley stalwarts like the Osborne Computer Company and Morrow Designs.
In the ensuing decade, portables became increasingly smaller and more powerful. Current state-of-the-art machines, like the American-designed model from the Poqet Computer Corporation, package the functions of a desktop computer in a box the size of a notepad. Now the Sony Corporation and some American companies are introducing pocket-size computers designed to be controlled with a stylus rather than a keyboard.
These tiny powerhouses still do not have the software to act as an electronic assistant; nor are they yet able to communicate through radio and satellite links. Moreover, their ability to "read" handwriting entered by stylus is quite rudimentary.
 
Coming Soon
 But clearly, the Dynabook will soon become a reality, and Sony, Toshiba and Sharp are all thought to be ahead of anyone in the Valley in designing the hardware for it.
Why are even the Valley's most successful companies behind Japan? The answer, at least in part, may have less to do with the Valley than with the very nature of innovation in the computer industry. New companies may sprout with each technological advance, as Mr. Gilder says. But something else also happens: the companies responsible for the previous generation of machines usually are not able to recast themselves to design the next one.
In an effort to reinvent the creativity that characterized the small group of engineers who designed the Macintosh computer -- the machine that marked the last big advance with its ease of use -- Apple recently spun off a small start-up company called General Magic Inc., based in Mountain View, Calif.
The new company, led by veterans of the Macintosh design team, is working on a stylus-based palmtop connected to the world by a wireless radio system.
Apple's engineers were jolted into action last year shortly after the company introduced its first portable model, which weighed a hefty 18 pounds. Another American company, the Houston-based Compaq Computer Corporation, then offered its own 6-pound notebook machine. Compaq had designed it in partnership with Citizen, a Japanese consumer electronics and watch manufacturer.
 
'We Were Stunned'
 "We took it apart and we were stunned because we realized that Apple couldn't make anything similar," said one Apple executive.
Now Apple is planning a lighter portable, but this time many in the industry believe the company, based in Cupertino, Calif., intends to enter the market either by licensing its Macintosh technology to a competitor or working with a Japanese partner. Likely candidates include Sony and Toshiba, which have expertise, unlike the Americans, in making flat-panel display screens, a key component of the tiny machines.
Apple is not the only Valley company struggling with the challenges presented by miniaturization. The Go Corporation, which has designed a new software system for stylus-based computers, recently surprised many in the industry when it announced that it had no plans to build the hardware for such a machine. Instead, it formed an alliance with the International Business Machines Corporation to finish the development of the software, which it would then license to both Japanese and American palmtop makers.
"Today the computer hardware industry is desperately competitive," said Gerrold Kaplan, Go's founder, referring to the great difficulties smaller Valley companies have had in turning a profit in hardware.
By contrast, software can be quite profitable, said Mr. Kaplan, because operating systems have become a larger and larger component of a product's total cost with each new generation of computers. And software is where the Valley is still ahead of the Japanese.
American software that controls the display and manipulation of data on computer screens -- systems pioneered by Xerox and then commercialized by many companies, including Apple, Metaphor Computer Systems, Next and Sun Microsystems -- is simply unrivaled by any Japanese computer maker.
Known as interfaces, these systems will be critically important to the development of a palmtop and its ability to read handwriting -- and they could prove to be the missing ingredient that could revive the Valley's chances.
Some start-ups are betting on that possibility. The Japanese may dominate portable computers with models compatible with the standard MS-DOS desktop operating system, but they will be very cautious about committing themselves to an interface for palmtops, Valley executives say.
 
Memories of Beta
 The reason, they say, is the painful memory of Sony's failure with videocassette recorders a decade ago. Sony latched on to the Beta video format only to see the rest of the industry choose VHS, a mistake that cost it hundreds of millions of dollars.
The Japanese tentativeness is underscored, some Valley executives say, by Sony's reluctance to market its existing stylus-equipped portable in the United States, a signal that it is holding back until it feels more secure about its software choices.
"The Japanese have been real scared to introduce products in the United States that are nonstandard," said Kamran Elahian, founder of the Momenta Corporation, a Sunnyvale, Calif., start-up. "When they've done so in the past, they've paid a heavy price."
And that could be just the opening that the Valley needs.
At Momenta's offices, for instance, a plaque on the wall announces a company goal: "1,000 days to immortality." The vehicle to fame and fortune is a stylus-based portable that Momenta is designing. Down the hall, a calendar indicates there are less than 600 days to complete the design and make a machine.
Momenta is just one of many startups working feverishly to create new standards for stylus machines. Taken together, Valley supporters say, they are the best evidence that the crisis of confidence afflicting some of the older companies is simply self-inflicted.
"My sense is that there is still a lot of optimism in the Valley," said AnnaLee Saxenian, a researcher in economic development at the University of California at Berkeley.
Indeed, the number of new start-ups backed by venture capital rose sharply in 1989, to 853. Despite the decline of traditional semiconductor manufacturers in the Valley, chip makers generated 25,000 new jobs and more than $2 billion in additional annual sales in the past decade by creating new markets. And the total number of high-technology jobs in Santa Clara County, the center of the Valley, reached a new peak of almost 340,000 in 1989, Ms. Saxenian said.
"The Valley still looks really good to me," said Harry Vertelney, a designer in Apple Computer's advanced-technology group. "This is still the center of the computational universe."
The question, though, is whose universe? In a sense, that universe increasingly is going to be controlled by the Japanese, even if the Valley somehow pulls a palmtop out of its hat, many experts say.
Japanese giants like Fujitsu, Hitachi and Sony are already expanding their operations here, and others are expected to follow soon.
They have no choice, said Mr. Tatsuno, the consultant at Neoconcepts. Software is Silicon Valley's strength -- and Japan's Achilles heel. A similar imbalance has been drawing Japanese consumer electronics companies, including Sony, to southern California and the special "software" that Hollywood produces.
"The Japanese have to be here," Mr. Tatsuno said.
 
A DUBIOUS FORMULA?
 For years, communities and industries all over the United States have tried to copy Silicon Valley's formula for high-tech development. But in a recently published book, two economists question the wisdom of that approach.
In "The Breakthrough Illusion: Corporate America's Failure to Move From Innovation to Mass Production" (Basic Books), Richard Florida and Martin Kenney argue that the "start-up mania" that has characterized Silicon Valley has contributed to the demise of the American economy's competitiveness as much as it has bolstered it.
Mr. Florida and Mr. Kenney particularly fault the pattern of dozens of "me too" start-ups rushing after each new technology fad. The inevitable result, they say, is a shakeout with huge losses and layoffs.
Me-too start-ups weaken the development of the entire industry by dividing market share and engineering talent among too many companies, the authors contend. The resulting fragmentation leaves American companies vulnerable to more integrated international competitors, they say.
Moreover, even the best parts of the Valley's economic model -- innovation and flexibility in technological and industrial organization -- have done little to transform basic manufacturing industries in the United States, they argue.
"It is as though high technology start-ups and large industrial companies are operating on entirely different planets," they say.
 
CAN THEY REKINDLE THE MAGIC?
 During the heady days seven years ago when they were racing to finish the design of the Macintosh computer, engineers at Apple Computer Inc. wore T-shirts that read, "Working 90 hours a week and loving it."
If Silicon Valley retains its technological edge, many believe it will be because new start-up companies are able to duplicate the passion and intensity of that Macintosh team. By all accounts that is what 14 Apple veterans are trying to do at General Magic Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., start-up that was founded last year.
General Magic is attempting to design what it calls "personal information communicators" -- palmtop machines that permit users to take a powerful personal computer with them wherever they go.
So far, General Magic's founders are saying little about their planned product or which major companies besides Apple they are hoping will back their venture. But according to several people close to the company, General Magic has recaptured much of the enthusiasm that characterized the Macintosh effort.
One of the company's three founders, Bill Atkinson, helped develop the Macintosh and then gained a reputation as Apple's best programmer after he designed an innovative computer language called Hypercard.
Now, at General Magic, Mr. Atkinson is said to be working for as long as three or four days at a stretch without sleep.

HEADLINE: All About/Oil Services;
A Lean, High-Tech Industry Poised for Postwar Growth

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
During the oil boom of the early 1980's, most companies spent more than $10, some more than $20, to find and produce a barrel of oil in the United States. Since then, the service companies that provide equipment and crews to drill for oil, and for the natural gas often found with it, have improved the process vastly. They have introduced supercomputers to spot drilling sites and sophisticated equipment that can even drill sideways (box).
For the three years that ended in 1989, the average cost to produce one barrel of oil in the United States was just $4.82, according to John S. Herrold Inc., an oil research firm based in Greenwich, Conn. 
 That still doesn't match the $2 a barrel cost in Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf nations, where huge deposits lie relatively near the surface. But achieving the decline in the United States, where most of the remaining petroleum lies deep indeed, demonstrates the service industry's technological leadership.
The high-tech pioneers -- the major international service companies like Schlumberger, Halliburton, Dresser Industries and Baker Hughes -- have steadily improved their profits over the three years through 1990. By slashing their payrolls and curtailing operations, they survived an unprecedented collapse in oil drilling activity from 1986 through 1989 that ruined or crippled many of their debt-laden rivals.
 
The Rig Count
Boomlet Follows Bust in the U.S.
The fortunes of the oil field service industry can be tracked by the rig count. As oil prices soared in the early 1980's, the number of operating rigs in the United States rose to more than 4,500. The count fell to a post-World War II low of 869 in 1989, but rebounded last year to 1,010, according to Baker Hughes Inc. Outside the United States, the rig count has been far less volatile. The international average, excluding Canada, was 907 rigs in 1990 -- the first year since 1985 that the United States has beaten that average.
Many analysts expect higher oil prices, more drilling and higher revenues for the service companies by the mid-1990's, as oil prices rise from the current $20 a barrel or so to more than $25. The analysts assume that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will again restrict output after the current war ends. They say that the United States rig count will gradually increase to an average of 1,200 in 1993, with 2,400 worldwide.
The service companies provide drill bits, drill pipe, special muds and fluids, offshore equipment, geological mapping software and the personnel to deploy it all. A huge source of new orders for them might be the rebuilding of Middle Eastern facilities. The extent of damage to oil fields, refineries and petrochemical plants will known for certain only when the war in the Persian Gulf ends. But some analysts estimate that just repairing the damage to Kuwaiti facilities so far is likely to cost $40 billion. The Kuwaiti Government, with investments estimated at $100 billion, has more than enough to bankroll postwar reconstruction. "At some point, there will be an enormous rebuilding plan required there," said John J. Murphy, Dresser's chairman and chief executive.
Meanwhile, the industry's main customers, the major oil companies, plan to increase their worldwide drilling budgets this year by nearly 14 percent, according to James D. Crandell, a Salomon Brothers analyst. And Government-controlled oil enterprises, which have been increasing their purchases by more than 30 percent a year, according to Suzanne L. Cook, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, contributed 40 percent of industry revenues last year. These national oil organizations, in places like Mexico, Indonesia and Venezuela, accounted for only about 10 percent of business in 1980, she said.
 
Where the Work Is
Postwar Rebuilding In the Middle East
 Although the long-term prospects are reassuring, until recently the outlook for oil service companies was dreary. When Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members quickly stepped in to make up for the Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil supplies lost to war, fears of scarcity promptly turned to fears of glut. Some analysts felt crude prices might plunge below $15 a barrel after the war ended.
Investors quickly showed their disenchantment with OPEC members' production increases. The shares of 25 representative oil service companies fell an average of 34 percent from an early August peak through Jan. 17, according to Mr. Crandell. For 19 months before the peak, the sector had led the market, as worldwide energy demand appeared to be rising.
Since the first bombing raids over Baghdad, shares in the oil service sector have bounced back up by about 12 percent. Aside from the implications of damage to oil production equipment in Iraq and Kuwait, year-end earnings reports have improved investors' confidence somewhat that the industry's recovery will continue.
One still urgent, and palpable, problem is the collapse of natural-gas prices, which developed independently of Middle East politics. The price of natural gas depends heavily on demand for heating. "Warm weather has overwhelmed the market with problems," said James L. Carroll, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc., in New York.
High temperatures, especially in the Northeast, have restricted demand in the last three months. February prices in the spot market have ranged between $1.10 and $1.40 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price had averaged $1.71 in 1990 and nearly $1.80 the year before.
In the Gulf of Mexico, which produces mostly natural gas, offshore drilling specialists including Marine Drilling, Cliffs Offshore and Oceaneering International have suffered, said Mr. Carroll of PaineWebber. Lease rates for modest rigs operating in 250 feet of water or less off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana have fallen in the last month by $2,000, to as low as $10,000 a day. So rig operators are pulling up their equipment and hauling it to areas with more oil -- including Venezuela, West Africa and the North Sea.
 
The Technology
More Precision At Greater Depths
New technologies are helping oil companies to recover more oil and gas from deeper, more precisely drilled holes even as lower costs have increased the demand for rigs.
In the last few years, supercomputers using sophisticated software have sharpened many a driller's aim, locating and mapping reservoir sites by analyzing sound waves sent speeding through layers of rock. The Halliburton Company has installed a version of this technology on a ship launched last year to pinpoint offshore drilling sites.
Innovative equipment is also allowing oil companies to drill in deeper water. Traditional rig supports, built from the sea floor up, allow drilling in no more than 1,300 feet of water. But Conoco Inc. has pumped oil and natural gas for more than a year from a rig tethered to the Gulf of Mexico seabed by giant cables in water 1,700 feet deep. Shell Oil has ordered rigs with the same technology to operate in depths exceeding 3,000 feet.
Schlumberger Ltd. and Halliburton have each introduced foaming compounds that act like timed-release medications. Deep in a well, they can unlock trapped oil and promote its flow from a reservoir toward the bottom of a well shaft, where it can be reached for pumping to the surface.
 
 
THE HORIZONTAL BOOM
 Years of declines in Texas oil production apparently ended in 1990 for one reason: the high amounts of crude pumped from horizontally drilled wells. Texas oil production, which peaked at 3.6 million barrels a day in 1972, had fallen to 1.68 million in 1989 as the fields were depleted. By last November, the lastest figures available, it was up to 1.8 million barrels a day.
Since the 1940's, a few oilmen have dabbled with the technique of drilling a well straight down, then trying to tap more oil by angling the drill bit until it moved laterally. But broken drill bits and pipe frustrated them.
Several technologies have combined to make horizontal drilling more practical. Modern drill bits -- driven by motors in the bits instead of above ground -- can be precisely directed with the help of computers and precision mapping. They have minimized the frustrations of dry holes and damage to equipment.
Drillers usually employ these techniques in aging fields where geologists think earlier explorers missed oil trapped in narrow, vertical rock formations. With horizonal drilling, a single bore can tap several vertical deposits. Some companies have used the technique to search for new discoveries in North Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado where rock layers are similar to ones in Texas fields. But for now, most drillers are confining their efforts to a proven source: Texas itself.
The nation's largest independent oil producer, the Oryx Energy Company, recovered 58 million barrels of oil and barrel-equivalents of natural gas last year by drilling 68 horizontal wells in Texas fields southwest of San Antonio. Oryx plans to drill 70 more wells this year.
"Texas has had a turnaround and that has come clearly because of horizontal drilling," said Robert Krueger, a member of the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates oil fields. The agency granted 1,098 permits for horizontal wells in 1990, up from 127 in 1989.
Baker Hughes Inc., which sold about half the equipment and services used in the nation's horizontal wells last year, estimated that as many as 5,000 horizontal wells will be drilled worldwide by the year 2000. Sales of horizontal-well equipment by its subsidiary, Eastman Christensen, are growing 40 percent a year. Eastman provided $100 million of Baker Hughes's total revenues of $2.6 billion in 1990.

HEADLINE: Bringing Haiti's Shattered Economy Back From the Brink

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: PORT-AU -PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
When Jacques Auguste returned here in 1960 armed with an engineering degree and visions of founding his own building materials company, he quickly discovered how little of what he had learned at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute prepared him for the rigors of doing business in his native Haiti.
Not long after opening a small cinder-block factory in 1961, Mr. Auguste found his workers besieged by the Tontons Macoute, the militia of the recently enthroned dictator, Francois Duvalier. 
 Looking back now, Mr. Auguste, a vigorous, deep-voiced 62-year-old, describes the repeated run-ins with the gun-toting thugs without alarm. Their monthly visits to extort payroll money, he says, were merely the most egregious of many bad encounters with agents of the Haitian Government. Eventually, the episodes of official harassment and theft forced him to flee the country for five years in the late 1960's, he adds, and they have discouraged legions of other investors from taking more interest in Haiti.
"The problem has been that nobody in Government considers you a taxpayer to whom they owe a service," said Mr. Auguste, whose company, Prefab, has since expanded handsomely, despite all the obstacles. "Being in business often seems like living under an occupation army. They owe you nothing. You owe them everything."
Now, Mr. Auguste and many other local entrepreneurs have their fingers crossed. The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a left-leaning Roman Catholic priest and political neophyte, was sworn in as President last Thursday. The hope is that Father Aristide will somehow overcome his inexperience and the country's seemingly intractable problems and rebuild the shattered economy of a nation that has grown accustomed to chaos.
Few details are known about the economic plans of the 37-year-old Father Aristide. In his speeches and writings before entering politics, he urged land redistribution for peasants and higher wages for industrial workers. Since then, however, he has made a war against corruption the centerpiece of his economic statements, while repeatedly stressing that his Government will welcome private investment.
It will also welcome more aid from the United States -- and American diplomats say they are eager to provide a substantial increase in assistance, both as a show of goodwill to a new democracy and to help resuscitate its anemic economy.
Haiti received about $55 million of United States aid in 1990, according to the State Department, just a bit more than half of what was given before elections were aborted in violence in 1987. Before assistance can return to its former levels, however, Father Aristide's Government must adopt "macroeconomic policies that are sound," American officials say privately.
That would be a stark change for Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest country, with a per capita gross domestic product of less than $400. A rush of local and foreign investments made Haiti's fast-growing industrial sector the envy of the region in the late 70's, and a model for the development strategy pushed by the United States through its Caribbean Basin Initiative. But instability, corruption and decay have long since regained the upper hand.
Haitian leaders began falling in dizzying succession amid the coups d'etat and popular uprisings that began with the flight into exile of Jean-Claude Duvalier, Francois's son, in 1986. Since then, the Government has refined its corrupt practices somewhat, becoming less crudely menacing, if more insidious, Mr. Auguste and other businessmen here say.
Where they once faced what amounted to armed holdups, entrepreneurs in Haiti's scrappy indigenous industrial sector now labor instead under a heavily overstaffed bureaucracy. For many businessmen, that bureaucracy seems organized to do little other than enrich itself, albeit by manipulating rules and perquisites instead of weapons. Although long incapable of functions like seeing to the cleaning or policing of the streets, the civil service has shown a gift for organizing wholesale smuggling and elaborating ever more arcane codes to extract "favors" from businesses, many here say.
"When I returned to the country in 1985, I opened a new branch of my business and decided I would try and see if I could do everything strictly according to the books, so that I could avoid having to pay bribes," said one businessman who, like many when discussing details of Government corruption, asked to remain anonymous. "Pretty soon auditors were coming at me with apprenticeship taxes for my workers -- all kinds of things that have been forgotten for 100 years. Finally I had to bribe them."
Similar tales of Government-induced sloth and corruption pour forth from Mr. Auguste as he describes each step of the relatively simple production processes he uses at Prefab, which now makes concrete flagstones, terra cotta roof tiles and bars of laundry soap in addition to cinder blocks.
HE lays much of the blame for this waste at the feet of the highly unpopular military governments that have run the country since 1986. Seeking to placate a population eager for democratic rule, the generals began padding the payrolls of already sluggish state-owned enterprises, from the national cement factory and flour mill to the port and electricity and telephone companies, Mr. Auguste and other businessmen said. Hundreds of unnecessary workers were added, and significant wage increases were granted as well, Government critics charge.
"This is why our cement costs us so much," Mr. Auguste said, his voice booming over the groans and belches of a large rock-crushing machine that churned out sand and clouds of white dust in the yard of his sprawling complex. Mr. Auguste pays $6.40 for a 94-pound cement bag, which sells for $2.50 elsewhere in the Caribbean. "If we are going to be socialists, fine, but if we want to reduce the cost of living for the people, this is ridiculous," he said.
The story of the tallow he imports from Florida to manufacture soap has a similar ring. Government regulations, he said, require that once dockers begin an unloading job, they must complete it the same day, even if it means that long overtime hours, which kick in at 4 P.M., must be paid.
Even without its costly overtime rules, Haiti's port is one of the world's most expensive, economists here say, with 1,100 workers doing a job that about 150 could handle.
As bad as the reputation of Haiti's port has become, the state corporation that has fallen the furthest into ill repute, many feel, is Electricite d'Haiti. The utility monopolizes electricity generation, or degeneration, as one wry joke has put it since the number of hours without power has begun to outstrip the number of hours with electricity for many customers.
In recent weeks, Haiti's newspapers have been filled with reports of workers at the electric company denouncing their superiors for taking under-the-table payments from affluent customers and quietly sweeping their large bills off the books.
While these corporate officers, several of whom were forced to resign, were reportedly enriching themselves, the company, which many see as a metaphor for the entire country's infrastructure, has simply abandoned many basic maintenance tasks. In one instance, poor land management around the basin that feeds the country's major hydroelectric dam has led to a severe silting problem that frequently knocks the dam's turbines out of service. Backup generators have also been poorly maintained and the company frequently lacks money to buy the oil that fuels them.
"For the last 15 years they have known about the problem of soil erosion at the dam, but nobody has bothered to do anything about it," said Leslie Delatour, a free-market economist who served briefly as a reformist finance minister in the mid-80's. "There is no sanction for failure in the civil service."
FOR businesses like Mr. Auguste's, where profit margins for a product like soap are measured in pennies, the failure to produce more than eight hours of electricity each day has meant critical production losses. "We will have problems as long as the electricity is in the hands of the Government," Mr. Auguste said. "Everything has to be privatized or we will remain lost."
While foreign investors and local businessmen are largely united in their desire to see Father Aristide brake the country's freefall, and privatize or somehow streamline the wasteful state monopolies, their visions of an ideal business environment veer off in near-opposite directions beyond that point.
For many of those who produce for the local market, like Mr. Auguste, the classic International Monetary Fund advice -- eliminate tariff barriers and devalue the currency to make export industries more competitive -- amounts to little more than devices intended to allow foreign interests to take over their fragile market.
These entrepreneurs hope that Father Aristide, whose message is strongly nationalistic, will heed their call to resist changes they see as hurting their interests.
"The Americans, the I.M.F. and everyone else want us to push our doors wide open, to lower the barriers, even encourage smuggling, if necessary, to lower prices," said Mr. Auguste, who advocates continued protectionism for many products. "Well, that is just nuts to think that you can solve all of our problems just by opening our doors."
Others, however, insist that as long as Haiti resists efforts to liberalize its trade, foreign investors will shy away from the country while local producers will hold on to their small, sure shares of what will remain a stunted market. "The first thing an elected Government will have to do is decide whether encouraging investment is a good thing," said Mr. Delatour, the former finance minister. "As for the domestic producers, I am sorry, but there are a lot of businesses they have no business being in."
 
 
THE UNSETTLING EXODUS OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT
 For foreign investors, Haiti's costly inefficiencies and political turmoil have so tarnished the country's reputation that the nation has fallen in the space of a decade from leading the pack of industrializing Caribbean islands to a stagnant backwater.
Despite the $3 minimum daily wage that makes industrial labor among the least expensive in the hemisphere, production by Haiti's manufacturing sector, traditionally concentrated in textiles, toys, electronics and sporting goods, shrunk in eight of the last nine years through 1989, the last year for which complete data were available, according to the Inter-American Development Bank.
In recent months, as this slide has continued, several large American companies have pulled up stakes, citing concerns about instability. Among those leaving: the Rawlings Sporting Goods Company, whose operations in the country's industrial zone made Haiti the world's largest producer of baseballs.
"There is an unfortunate perception among customers that because of the chaos they won't get their orders filled on time," one Western diplomat who has sought to promote foreign investment in the country said of companies like K Mart that have begun canceling orders for Haitian-produced clothing. "The fact is that even with all of the changes of Government and strikes and everything else, most of the producers somehow manage to get their goods out."
That has been the case with the Inter-American Leisure Products Company, according to its American owner, Morton Karten. "We have had very few instances of not being able to get our shipments out on time," said Mr. Karten, a 20-year resident of the country whose company, based in Port-au-Prince, makes fishing tackle, embroidered rugs, pillows and tapestries.
"Our customers come here very infrequently nowadays, but happily, they continue to send us their orders," Mr. Karten said, explaining that one result of Haiti's image of violence and instability is that he must travel regularly to the United States and elsewhere to meet with clients who in other times would have made the trip to Haiti themselves.
Like many in the business community in Haiti, Mr. Karten expressed cautious optimism that President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's new Government will be able to turn the country around. "Things could not get much worse than in the last five years," Mr. Karten said. "Even people who favored another candidate for President will tell you it is better to have someone who was elected and is popular than the unelected people we had been having."

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Why Rich New York Is So Poor

BYLINE: By EDWIN S. RUBENSTEIN; Edwin S. Rubenstein, an adjunct fellow of the Manhattan Institute, writes on economics for National Review.

 BODY:
In his latest budget, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York proposes sizable cuts in Medicaid, local aid and the state payroll, which fiscal conservatives have been urging for years. Yet even after these cuts are in place, New York will still be spending more per capita and relative to income than most other states. And the Governor's tax increases insure New York's standing as one of the highest taxed states in the nation. Mr. Cuomo has to do better.
The last eight years saw a historic resurgence of New York's economy. Real personal income rebounded from no growth to average annual increases of more than 3 percent. Per capita income in the state zoomed to 20 percent above the national average in 1989, up from 12 percent above in 1983. Despite the current recession, there are nearly one million more New Yorkers working today than eight years ago. The state's unemployment rate edged to 5.5 percent in December; when Mr. Cuomo delivered his first State of the State message, it was 9 percent. 
 The economic expansion pushed tax revenues up a startling 89 percent since 1983. This represents a tax hike of $760 per capita, a figure larger than the total tax collections of some states. While the recession has reduced revenues below prior projections, so far revenues are ahead of last year.
Had state spending merely kept pace with personal income, Albany would have a surplus today, recession or no recession. But the opportunity was squandered. Spending has consistently outpaced the incomes of New Yorkers, even in boom years.
Department of Commerce data show that from 1983 to 1988 (the latest years for which data on all states are available) total New York State spending rose from $31.9 billion to $50.4 billion, or from 14.7 percent of state personal income to 15.7 percent. The other 49 states managed to cut spending relative to income over this period.
The fiscal crisis in Albany clearly stems from too much spending rather than too little revenue. New Yorkers can be excused for not understanding this, however. As State Comptroller Edward Regan has repeatedly pointed out, the state budget conceals the true size and growth of spending with a bewildering array of special funds.
Albany can claim to "cut" tax-supported general-fund spending with creative accounting. Since 1983, for example, many state agencies long considered general-fund expenses have been switched off-budget, to special-revenue funds. The Public Service Commission, the Banking Department, the Consumer Protection Board, parts of the Departments of Agriculture and Social Services have all disappeared from the state budget.
While the Comptroller has criticized this practice in official reports, it has become standard operating procedure. Over the past eight years, off-budget spending has risen nearly five times faster than the general fund.
The off-budget trick can be dismissed as simply another game politicians play. But the massive use of one-shot revenue gimmicks to sustain a spending level far beyond the state's fiscal means is a recipe for future disaster. The 1991 budget is "balanced" with $1.8 billion worth of these Rube Goldberg revenue raisers, including the sale of a highway to the State Thruway Authority, the use of the teachers' pension fund contributions to support current operations and the siphoning off of reserved funds that were set up to support future debt service. Each one provides temporary budget relief at the cost of a larger future liability.
Many New Yorkers believe these heroic revenue-raising measures are justified in light of the vast array of unmet social needs. This view ignores waste and abuse.
Medicaid, for example, Albany's most uncontrollable spending program, costs twice as much per recipient in New York as it does in the rest of the nation. Again, despite extensive advice from the Comptroller on how Medicaid costs could be cut, Albany has resisted meaningful reforms.
New York's welfare spending ranks first in the nation as a percentage of personal income, though New York ranks only eighth nationally in the percentage of the population living in poverty. Administrative costs are partly to blame. In 1988, it cost about $1,118 to administer one case through Aid to Families with Dependent Children, compared with an average of $628 nationally.
Social pathology, an aging population and crumbling infrastructure have each been cited as a reason why New York must spend more than other states. Yet disinterested scholars have found that even when needs and local costs are accounted for, New York stands alone.
The best-known of these studies on state spending was developed by Robert W. Rafuse Jr. of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, a nonpartisan research group supported by New York and other states. Mr. Rafuse's analysis adjusts actual spending levels for such factors as population characteristics, crime rates and even the number of miles residents drive on state roads.
Data for fiscal 1987, the latest available, show that even after adjusting for the state's extraordinary needs and higher costs, Albany and the local governments still spend 52.4 percent more than the national average.
Although the Governor has blamed the recession, the cutback in Federal aid and even the Senate Republicans for the fiscal imbalance, he in fact wields both a line-item veto and broad impoundment powers for spending control. It's time these measures were put to use.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dinner;
For Francophiles, La Cuisine at Its Best

 BODY:
This listing is compiled by Bryan Miller from his restaurant visits, his reviews and articles in The Times and entries in his Diner's Journal column. Review and article dates are in parentheses. Prices are current. Here are some French restaurants in Manhattan.
 
Cafe Un, Deux, Trois
 123 West 44th Street, (212) 354-4148 -- One of the better bets for Broadway theater-district dining, this cavernous brasserie can be loud at peak hours before and after theater, as the din amplifies off the bare walls and tile floor. But it's a great spot to argue about a play or movie you have just seen -- and you can even illustrate your points on the paper tablecloths with crayons set out in a glass.
The vast open dining room is a visual pun of sorts, with its faux marble columns, mustard-colored walls painted to look as if they are peeling, sky murals wrapped in trompe l'oeil frames, deliberately chipped moldings and playful mismatched colors. Waiters and waitresses are extremely well-poised and diction-conscious -- they even sing "Happy Birthday" in five-part harmony.
The service is snappy and efficient under fervid conditions. The short regular menu is supplemented by many daily specials. Among appetizers are the house pork-based terrine, crab cakes with tartar sauce, homemade gravlax, and Caesar salad. Entrees include shrimp in a creamy peppercorn sauce, chicken florentine with spinach in a Dijon mustard sauce, half a roasted duck stuffed with wild rice and served with an orange-Cognac sauce, and a competently prepared steak tartare.
Desserts are straightforward and satisfying. Among them are profiteroles, tarte Tatin and a walnut basket filled with ice cream and fresh fruit, topped with a raspberry sauce and set in a pool of chocolate sauce. Appetizers range from $4.50 to $6.95; entree,s $10.50 to $18.50; desserts, $5.25 to $5.50. Sunday dinner is from 4 to 11 P.M. (Article, Oct. 19, 1990.)
 
Ferrier
 29 East 65th Street, (212) 772-9000 -- This gleaming little bistro just east of Madison Avenue is owned by Alain Chevreaux, who also has Chez Ma Tante in Greenwich Village. Ferrier has a lively little bar up front and a neighborly rectangular dining room in the back with colorful French prints on the walls and a bank of mirrors to minimize claustrophobia.
At peak lunch and dinner hours, the mob here can make Ferrier's chic neighbor, Le Cirque, look underbooked. Early or late reservations are recommended. On the current menu, you might start with baked tomato with mild goat cheese and warm vinaigrette; tuna tartare; snails with eggplant, tomato and garlic butter nested in pastry crust; and terrine of goose foie gras.
For main courses there are chicken breast sauteed and served with a Champagne sauce, artichokes and mushrooms; pan-fried shell steak with crushed peppercorns and a Cognac cream sauce; roasted salmon with a fennel-citrus vinaigrette; and medallions of veal accompanied with a lemon-tarragon sauce and sauteed endives. Desserts include chocolate Charlotte, creme brulee and tarte Tatin.
A $19.95 prix-fixe pre-theater menu is offered featured on Sunday evenings from 5:30 to 6:30 P.M.
Appetizers range from $5.95 to $9.95; entrees, $15.95 to $19.95; desserts, $4.50 to $6. Sunday dinner is served from 6:30 P.M. to midnight. (Diner's Journal, Dec. 1, 1989.)
 
Restaurant Florent
 69 Gansevoort Street, a half block west of Greenwich Street, (212) 989-5779 -- It's an Edward Hopper painting come to life, this World War II coffee shop turned French bistro in the heart of the gritty West Side meat-market area. Formerly the R & L Restaurant, a stainless-steel-and-Formica hash house that catered to butchers and truck drivers in the market's heyday, it was taken over by a genial young Frenchman, Florent Morellet. The new owner changed the name to Restaurant Florent but left the period decor largely intact.
The menu has abandoned "Adam and Eve on a raft" (poached eggs on toast) for French onion soup gratinee, duck mousse, couscous, sweetbreads, grilled calf's liver and other homey Gallic fare. Not only is much of the food surprisingly well prepared, it's also a bargain. On Sunday nights Florent is offering a "menu recession" at two different prices: $14.95 from 6 to 7:30 P.M., and $16.95 from 7:30 to 11:30 P.M. The a la carte menu is also available.
For starters, duck liver mousse is freshly made, creamy and well seasoned; and rillettes of pork are appropriately rough-textured and peppery. Other dishes include the inky and oniony boudin noir; steak au poivre; and choucroute garnie, which is a Sunday special. A vegetarian plate is also offered every night, according to fresh produce availability. For desserts there are sour-cream chocolate cake, apple tart and creme caramel. Appetizers range from $3.95 to $6.95; entrees, $8.50 to $16.75; desserts, $4 to $5. Cash only. Open 24 hours a day; Sunday dinner menu served from 6 to 11:30 P.M. (Article, March 24, 1989.)

The Times Restaurant Line offers capsule reviews by cuisine, price and location (in New York City and suburbs), published in the last 18 months. Touch-tone telephones only: (1-900) 998-0101 (75 cents a minute).

HEADLINE: How to Teach Arithmetic So That It Stimulates Young Minds

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Jan. 14 article on the effect of proposed budget cuts on one north Bronx school displays vividly a principal cause for the low levels of interest and attainment in mathematics and science by American students. The photograph shows a blackboard on which five arithmetic problems have been worked. As far as can be checked from the partly obscured writing, only one of the five was done correctly. But the mistakes don't indicate what's wrong in that schoolroom; for that you have to think about the exercises. They are all multiplications of four-digit numbers by three-digit or four-digit numbers. Nobody in his or her right mind would undertake such an exercise outside the schoolroom, or expect to get the right answer. The calculator has banished such tedious tasks. Why subject students to them in the classroom?
The standard answer is: To teach the principles of arithmetic. Hogwash! Tedious exercises can't teach principles. What they teach is that arithmetic, and by extension mathematics, and by further extension most other school subjects, is stultifying drudgery. The only escapes are to close your mind, play hooky or drop out. Students resort to all three. 
 There are alternatives to teaching by drudgery, and they don't strain scant resources. What goes on inside the calculator can be conveyed perfectly well by two digit times two digit examples without burying the logic in mounds of rote operations.
And there are more important and more stimulating things to be taught in the arithmetic class. The most important is a sense of proportion and a feeling for magnitude. The significant thing in multiplying 6,158 X 387 (the exercise shown most clearly on the blackboard) is to see that the result must be about 6,000 X 400 or 24,000 X 100 or 2.4 million, so that the answer on the blackboard is at a glance implausibly low. The person who did that multiplication got the last three digits right, precisely the ones that aren't worth computing.
So the art of estimation should be emphasized: staying awake and using common sense instead of applying memorized rules mindlessly. That's how the scientist or mathematician does his or her arithmetic, and it is fun rather than drudgery. It would not drive the students out of the classroom. Some of them might even find that approach challenging and interesting.

HEADLINE: Using Borrowed Money to Defend Foreign Economies

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In the Business Diary on Jan. 20, the headline on the lead item read, "Why Can't America Make a VCR to Match Its F-117?" The article cited the manifest technological superiority of American weapons and asked: Why can't America "make the world's best VCR's? Or compact cars?"
The answer is very simple. We put our best brains and much of our research money into designing high-technology weapons of destruction. Our competitors, in contrast, put theirs to work to develop computer technology and consumer goods. And they do that while we are spending money to defend their oil sources -- and having to borrow the money from them to do it.

HEADLINE: Hindu Party in India Seeks a Governing Image

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Feb. 9

 BODY:
In a move that could strengthen its image as an alternative government for India, the conservative Bharatiya Janata Party has named a shadow cabinet in preparation for the opening of a crucial session of Parliament later this month.
Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, whose party commands only 56 seats in a lower house of 517 members, is expected to face strong challenges on domestic and foreign issues, including the decision to allow the refueling of American planes bound for the Persian Gulf. The Government could easily topple ifthe Congress Party withdraws the support that gives Mr. Shekhar its ruling majority in Parliament. 
 Bharatiya Janata, a Hindu party, leads the opposition in Parliament to Mr. Shekhar's minority Government. L. K. Advani, the party's legislative leader, has already upstaged two former Prime Ministers, Rajiv Gandhi and V. P. Singh, on the floor of the lower house.
Mr. Singh's National Front Government fell in November after Bharatiya Janata withdrew its support on issues of affirmative action for lower castes and of Mr. Singh's opposition to the campaign by militant Hindus to build atemple on the site of a Muslim mosque in northern India. Mr. Shekhar defected from Mr. Singh's party and claimed the prime ministership with the backing of the Congress Party, which did not want to contest an election.
Atal Behari Vajpayee, a Bharatiya Janata leader, said that the fielding of an organized alternative cabinet in the tradition of the British Parliament will be an innovation in Indian politics, where Parliament debate has lately degenerated into chaos.
The opposition's shadow ministers -- or spokesmen -- will be backed by expert panels in various areas of government like foreign policy, domestic affairs, the economy, and law and justice.
"Debates do require some preparation and some expertise," Mr. Vajpayee, the party's leader in the upper house and a former Foreign Minister, said in an interview.
The party just concluded a national convention, during which it made an effort to project itself as the first national alternative to the dominant Congress Party.
The Bharatiya Janata Party -- its name in English means Indian People's Party -- considers itself liberal, in favor of private enterprise and reformist in social policy, Mr. Vajpayee said. The party also supports a nuclear weapons program for India.
Indian political analysts, even those who fear that religious harmony and secular democracy are threatened bythe growth of the Bharatiya Janata Party, concede that the party appeals to many voters, including young people, because of its reputation for discipline and incorruptibility.
But its involvement in the campaign to build a temple to the god Rama in the northern city of Ayodhya, while popular among militant Hindus, dampened enthusiasm among other voters.
With another national election expected, the party is working to temper its image. A physics professor at Allahabad University, Murli Manohar Joshi, has been elected party president.
Mr. Vajpayee, the Bharatiya Janata Party leader in the upper house, said: "We are not a religious party; we have never been a religious party. But we do take note of the changing Hindu psyche."
"There is a feeling that Hindus aretaken for granted," he went on, "and there is now a reaction to this." More than 80 percent of Indians are Hindus.
With Mr. Gandhi's Congress Party consumed by internal disagreements and Mr. Singh's Janata Dal split after the defections that brought down his Government in November, the disciplined Bharatiya Janata Party is confident. It controls the governments of three states -- Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh -- and is organizing down to the local level in most others.
Mr. Singh and his allies among the Communist parties are not counted out by political analysts, however. Last week, the Communist-led state government of Kerala swept local elections with the help of Mr. Singh's campaign appearances. The Congress Party lost nearly everywhere.

HEADLINE: Assault Charge Sends Pickets to Queens Grocery

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
A group of black Queens residents called for a boycott of a Korean-owned grocery store in Elmhurst yesterday after a Korean employee was arrested and charged with assaulting an 11-year-old black boy. The police said the store worker said he thought the boy was shoplifting.
The store owner acknowledged yesterday that his worker may have overstepped his bounds, but said the boy had caused trouble in the store and shoplifted for several months and had just splattered detergent all over one of the aisles. 
 About 25 people, including a dozen children, marched in front of the C-Town Supermarket, at 57th Avenue and 97th Street near the Lefrak City housing complex yesterday afternoon, yelling "Boycott C-Town." They carried signs and urged people not to enter the store.
Earlier yesterday, about 40 demonstrators led by the Rev. Herbert Daughtry rallied in front of the store. "If anything else like this happens again, they should either close it down or let us take it over," said Mr. Daughtry, pastor of the House of the Lord Pentacostal Church in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn.
 
Calls for Calm
 But several prominent blacks from the Queens area called for calm, saying they met with the store's owner, Francis Ahn, on Friday and were satisfied that he was working to remedy the problems that caused the incident. They said they hoped to avoid a boycott like the one of a small Korean grocery in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.
"The people don't want to see what happened in Brooklyn happen here," said Assemblywoman Helen M. Marshall, a Democratic representing the 35th District, which includes Elmhurtst. "We feel we don't have to do a massive demonstration. We can work with him."
But she added, "If the man doesn't cooperate, he might have to close his store down."
Throughout the protest, customers -- many of them black and Hispanic -- continued to shop at the store as the protesters were kept behind police barricades.
Residents said the protest sprang from the same bitter roots of cultural misunderstanding and economic envy that fed the long, bitter boycott of the Red Apple Grocery at 1823 Church Avenue in Flatbush. That yearlong conflict, which began after a Korean employee was accused of assaulting a black patron, came to symbolize racial tensions between blacks and the Korean immigrants who have become proprietors of many stores in black neighborhoods. It drew national attention and put pressure on Mayor David N. Dinkins, who was criticized for not settling the dispute quickly.
 
Employee Spoke Little English

On Jan. 31, Pong Ok Jang, the 32-year-old manager of the Red Apple, was aquitted of misdemeanor assault charges. He had been accused a year earlier of slapping Gieslaine Felissaint, a 47-year-old home-care worker born in Haiti.
The police said the confrontation in Queens started about 4:45 P.M. on Tuesday after the boy, Bobby Yates, went to the store with his mother, Cynthia Yates. The boy wandered away from his mother in the full-size supermarket and became embroiled in a dispute with a 53-year-old employee who spoke little English, the police said.
The employee, Kim Yon Cha, cuffed the boy on the left ear, accused him of shoplifting and then took him to a back room. The police said he kept him there for nearly a half-hour until his mother was located.
After Ms. Yates discovered what had happened, she took her son to Elmhurst General Hospital, where he was treated for a minor cut, the police said. Mr. Kim, of 79-11 41st Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens, was arrested on misdemeanor assault charges and released on his own recognizance.
Ms. Yates said yesterday that Mr. Kim came up behind her son, grabbed him by the hair, twisted his arm behind him and threw him into a rack of shelves, causing bottles to fall on his head. She also said Mr. Kim locked the boy in a freezer for a half-hour.
"I believe it's part of a racist thing that goes on in there," Ms. Yates said. "He is very traumatized. He was badly beaten."
The owner of the store, Francis Ahn, 46, gave a different account. He said Mr. Kim chased Bobby and grabbed him after the boy ran down an aisle, knocking things down, and spilled a large plastic bottle of detergent on the floor. He said the boy was well-known to employees as a trouble-maker who ran through the aisles and sometimes stole small things.
"This kid is extraordinary," Mr. Ahn said. "Every time he comes in he does aggravating things."
He said Mr. Kim caught Bobby after he slipped and fell in the soap, and pushed him into a back room "for a talk." The clerk told the boy he would call his parents and the police if he kept running through the aisles, he said. But Bobby burst into tears, and Mr. Kim's resolve melted, and he let him go after two or three minutes, he said.
"It was just a simple talk," Mr. Ahn said. "We never locked him in the freezer as they are claiming." He refused to say anything about whether Mr. Kim had hit the boy because he did not see it, he said.
Mr. Ahn said that, under American standards, his employees may have done something wrong, but in Korea, his actions would have been acceptable. There, he said, adults often scold or punish other people's children, he said. "We treat all the kids as our own son," he said. "We can say something. Here it is against the law."
 
Suit is Planned
 A spokesman for the police, Officer Kim Royster, said there was no evidence the boy had been put in a freezer or seriously hurt.
Ms. Yates said she planned to sue the store, an independently owned outlet of the C-Town chain, and she declined to discuss what evidence she had that her son had been locked up and mistreated.
Several leaders of community organizations said there was growing animosity among black residents toward Korean store owners in the area because in the last five years many black business owners in the area have suffered economic setbacks and have been forced to sell their establishments. At the same time, Korean families have bought many businesses along 57th Avenue that serve the huge Lefrak housing complex. There is a widespread perception, the leaders said, that Korean entreprenuers have an easier time getting business loans than blacks.
"It's our community and everything is owned by people other than blacks," said Albert Blake, a paralegal who is a member of the Lefrak tenants' council. "There are no stores in the community owned by blacks any more."
 
Differences in Customs
 Mr. Ahn said he had 60 employees. Twelve are Korean; the rest are black or Hispanic, he said.
Mr. Blake and other residents said that some blacks are frustrated because few Korean merchants speak English and several have customs the Americans do not understand. For example, Koreans consider it impolite to smile during a business transaction.
Mr. Blake and others said such cultural gaps were raised at a meeting on Friday between Mr. Ahn and LeFrak tenant leaders.
"We had to explain to him that 'this is not your country; this is not your culture,' " Mr. Blake said. "When you can't communicate with people you're spending money with, it creates problems."
A group of 12 tenant leaders, local politicians and members of the clergy are to meet with Mr. Ahn on Wednesday to discuss ways to improve relations. Several said Mr. Ahn has cooperated in the past.
"There have been complaints of people going into this store and not being treated the way they should," Ms. Marshall, the assemblywoman, said. "But he's been very responsive. He's fired people on the spot."

HEADLINE: RHODE ISLAND GETS BANK BAILOUT LAW

BYLINE: AP
LP>Gov. Bruce G. Sundlun has signed into law a measure aimed at resolving the state's banking and credit union crisis and putting refund checks into the hands of depositors at 14 failed state-chartered institutions within two months.
The legislation was signed by the Governor on Friday, 30 minutes after it had cleared the State Senate on a vote of 31 to 17, and a day after the House had passed it by 60 to 30.

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Feb. 9

 BODY:
 The new law creates a bailout agency, the Depositors Economic Protection Corporation, which will take over and then liquidate the assets of the 14 failed institutions and provide refunds to their depositors, whose money has been frozen for the last month.
Depositors with accounts of $100,000 or less will get all their money back. For each increment of $100,000 above that, a depositor will lose 10 percent. This incremental scale has a floor of 50 percent, which will apply to that portion of an account above $500,000.
 
$150 Million Bond Issue
 The bailout will be financed by a $150 million bond issue that the state will pay off by keeping the state sales tax at 7 percent instead of rolling it back to 6.5 percent next July, as had been planned.
Mr. Sundlun, a Democrat who defeated the Republican incumbent, Edward D. DiPrete, in November, said he would appoint a board for the new agency on Monday or Tuesday. The takeover and the liquidation of assets are to begin immediately afterward.
The Governor said depositors with accounts in institutions that voluntarily go into receivership with the Depositors Economic Protection Corporation could expect checks within 45 days. Accounts in institutions involuntarily taken over will be refunded within 60 days, he said.
The state's crisis dates from Jan. 1, when Mr. Sundlun, a few hours after being sworn in as Governor, closed 45 banks and credit unions because of the collapse of their private insurer, the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation.
Of the 31 institutions not addressed by the new law, 27 have since reopened with insurance coverage by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Adminisitration, and the four others have either gone out of business or become rechartered as loan origination offices, which accept no deposits.
The 14 institutions addressed by the new law were all rejected for Federal insurance, largely because the proportion of real estate holdings among their assets was deemed too high. Their deposits total $1.3 billion.

HEADLINE: AIRLINE NEAR PACT WITH PILOTS' UNION

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Feb. 9

 BODY:
American Airlines and the union representing its 8,900 pilots said today that they had tentatively resolved a 16-month contract dispute in which many pilots were prepared to strike if demands for higher pay and other terms were not met.
Details of the new pact were unclear, but people close to the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said both sides agreed to take to Government-sponsored arbitration their continuing differences over whether the pilots should pay part of their medical insurance costs. 
 American's negotiators offered the pay increase just hours after talks appeared to break down early Thursday, in a shift that appeared to move the two sides toward the tentative agreement. The deal was completed this morning at 8:45 in Washington, after the talks went through the night, both sides said in a statement.
A strike by pilots would have inflicted heavy losses on American, which like other airlines has lost money from higher jet fuel costs, the recession and a decline in passengers on its international routes since the Persian Gulf war started on Jan. 17.
 
Flights Had Been Trimmed

"We're pleased to have this agreement," Al Becker, a company spokesman, said. "We want to put this whole period behind us and move forward."
American trimmed the number of its daily flights by 250, to 2,050, last month, after accusing pilots of disrupting hundreds of flights over the Christmas holidays through delays on runways, absences that the pilots attributed to illness, and other actions.
The airline had planned to continue flying in the event of a walkout, using those who crossed picket lines as well as newly hired pilots to replace those on strike.
Final terms of the pact are to be completed next week. The 20 pilots who are directors of the Allied Pilots Association, the in-house union representing the American pilots, are to vote on the pact after a final, legal draft is completed later next week, said Wally Pitts, a union spokesman.
The outcome of the vote by the 20 pilots did not appear to be in doubt. Approval by them would make the contract final, since it does not have to be approved by the pilots' association.
In their joint statement, Fred Vogel, the union president, and Ralph Craviso, American's head of employee relations, said they were satisfied "that a long and difficult period of negotiations had been successfully concluded with a mutually beneficial contract." Details of the pact should be made public soon, they added.
 
Wanted to Match Delta

The pilots were seeking a pay scale to match one obtained last July by pilots at Delta Airlines making them the highest paid in the airline industry. Under that plan, high-ranking captains on wide-body aircraft, like Boeing 747's or McDonnell Douglas DC-10's, are paid $176,130 a year after 12 years.
American had proposed a pay scale last November offering similar captains $165,569. American raised the offer to about $170,000 when the talks moved to Washington on Jan. 7 under the supervision of a Federal mediator.
The November plan matched the pay for pilots at Northwest Airlines. American is the nation's largest airline, ranked by revenue, followed in descending order by United, Delta, Northwest and USAir.
American said last month that the higher, revised offer would have added more than $1 billion to salaries for the pilots over five years, with the average pilot's salary rising to $105,000.
 
Bonus Formula Offered

American also offered a bonus formula based on the airline's yearly profits that, in its view, could have given pilots more money than Delta's pilots in years when American was highly profitable.
American described the offer as its final position, but negotiatiors for the pilots rejected it on Jan. 30. At that point, Harry Bickford, the Federal mediator, recessed the talks for four days and, according to the airline-union statement today, "greatly facilitated" discussions this week that led to the accord today.
Mr. Bickford, who entered the talks in March 1990, could have advised the National Mediation Board to declare an impasse after the stalemate on Jan. 30 and begin a 30-day "cooling off" period that could have resulted in a pilot walkout early in March.
The dispute over medical insurance, which the airline and union have handed to binding arbitration, should be resolved within 90 days after an agreement on other issues is signed, said Mr. Pitts, the union spokesman.
American wants the pilots to make payments, starting at an average of less than $300 a year, toward rising insurance costs. The union opposes making any medical payments.

HEADLINE: Environmental Tax Urged for Some Products

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
The Worldwatch Institute, a leading environmental research group, said today that governments should impose heavy taxes on "products and activities that pollute, deplete or otherwise degrade natural systems."
By taxing products like the carbon in coal and oil and activities like dumping hazardous wastes, the United States could raise more than $130 billion a year while protecting the air, water and other natural systems that support life, the institute said in its 1991 "State of the World" report.The report acknowledged that such taxes would be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices for things like gasoline, paper, waste disposal, drinking water, farm produce and electricity. To offset the effect on low-income families, it said, income taxes could be reduced. 
 It identified eight potential "green" taxes: $100 a ton on the carbon content of fossil fuels like coal and oil; $100 a ton on hazardous wastes; $64 a ton on paper from virgin pulp; a tax of 50 percent of total sales of pesticides; $150 a ton on sulfur dioxide emissions; $100 a ton on nitrous oxides emissions; $5.83 a kilogram on chloroflurocarbon sales, atax already in effect in the United States, and $50 per acre-foot of water for depletion of water under the ground.
 
'Correcting Market's Failure'
 "Taxes are appealing because they offer an efficient way of correcting for the market's failure to value environmental services," the report said. "Taxing products and activities that pollute, deplete or otherwise degrade natural systems is a way of insuring that environmental costs are taken into account in private decisions -- whether to commute by car or bicycle, for example, or to generate electricity fromcoal or sunlight."
The report said a tax on the carbon content of fossil fuels was "urgently needed" to slow the onset of global warming caused by the carbon dioxide that results from burning them.
A study by the Congressional Budget Office last year found that although such a tax could be effective in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, it would be "hazardous for the economy if imposed too rapidly."
But the budget office said that phased in gradually over the next 10 years and reaching $100 a ton by the year 2000, such taxes would reduce the gross national product growth by as little as 1 percent and no more than 2 percent over that period. The $100 a ton charge maintained over the longer run would hold the G.N.P. 1 percent below what it would have been annually, thebudget office estimated.
Congress is not considering environmental taxes, and the draft energy plan being circulated by the Bush Administration pointedly omits any new taes on fuels like gasoline.
 
One Environmental Tax Working

There is relatively little experience with environmental taxes in this country. The Federal Government did impose a $5.83 a kilogram tax on chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, two years ago as incentive to industry to find substitutes for these widely used industrial chemicals that endanger the earth's protective ozone layer. The tax is expected to raise about $5 billion over five years.
Kevin Fay, executive director of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy, an industry lobbying group, said that the tax was effective at raising revenue but was probably not needed to force producers to make less harmful substitutes. Production of CFC's is "way down," Mr. Fay said, adding that the chief reasons were the slack economy and the pressure from scientists and environmentalists to find substitute chemicals, as well as an international treaty requiring that use of the chemicals be ended by the year 2000.
A variety of environmental taxes have been introduced by Western European countries in recent years. A report by the Commission of the European Communities last year found that many of them had achieved their purposes. For example, an 8 percent tax on leaded gasoline, introduced in Britain in 1989, led to an increase in the market share of unleaded gasoline to 30 percent from 4 percent in one year.

HEADLINE: Calling Bank Supervision Archaic, Greenspan Seeks Major Change

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOCA RATON, Fla., Feb. 9

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, called today for major changes in the way Federal bank examiners supervise lending practices at commercial banks. He said that by often failing to recognize banking's true nature, the examiners had played a significant role in making banks reluctant to lend.
"They are responding inappropriately," Mr. Greenspan said. "Even if we did not have a credit crunch, it would be wise to look at this process because the very structure is an archaic one." 
Mr. Greenspan said he had "never been interested in bank supervision as a technical issue until" it restricted bank lending and affected the economy.
In a luncheon speech at the semiannual meeting of the directors of the National Association of Manufacturers, and in a brief interview afterwards, Mr. Greenspan offered an endorsement of banking's special role in society that he had not made so explicitly in the past.
Although bank supervision was the main thrust of his speech, he said a lack of demand for new loans was the most important reason for the cutback in lending that has hit the economy in the past eight or nine months. Consumers and companies, in effect, are intensifying the recession because they do not want to borrow for spending and investment. "We do not see any evidence that lending is opening up," he said. He noted that the Federal Reverse's recent interest rate reductions were aimed at encouraging lending, and his concern that lending has not picked up left open the possibility of more interest rate cuts.
 
Example of Real Estate
 Aside for the weak demand for loans, the Federal examination process plays a significant role in limiting credit, a role best illustrated in real estate lending, Mr. Greenspan said. The examiners have encouraged loan appraisals that can miss the point of a bank's role in society.
"There is an increasing tendency to look at deposit institutions and say we should mark to market the loan portfolios, meaning trying to regain the values -- in real estate, for example -- that the loans represent if we sold them in the market tomorrow," Mr. Greenspan said.
This tendency produces two problems, the Federal Reserve chairman said. One is that just as bank appraisers overvalued real estate in the mid-1980's, expecting prices to keep rising, they are "low balling" a property's value because of expectations that prices will continue to fall. Partly as a result, banks are offering inadequate loans.
 
The Nature of Banking
 The entire procedure, in the mid-1980's and now, conflicts with the true nature of banking, Mr. Greenspan said. Banks should not be treating long portfolios as if they believed that they "have to be out of business tomorrow," he said.
"This is fundamentally wrong because commercial banking, and savings and loan activities as well, are a very special form of activity," Mr. Greenspan said. "Commercial banking is the practice by which you make illiquid loans."
Bankers should determine the profitability of a loan over its lifetime, even 20 years, and not the day-to-day value of the underlying real estate and, when borrowers get into trouble, the banks should work with them to solve the problem, Mr. Greenspan said. The bank examination process should reflect this role of banking.
 
Long-Term View
 "The basic process is not to get paid back immediately or to sell the loan," but to carry the loan for its full life, Mr. Greenspan said. Accounting practices, as well as the examination process, should reflect this, he added.
The Federal regulators and the Treasury "are trying to figure out what types of regulatory changes should be instituted," Mr. Greenspan said. "We are trying to get some sense of how what we conceive of as a mistaken process is adding to the credit crunch."
In his remarks to more than 140 top executives of manufacturing companies, Mr. Greenspan made no references to the economic outlook, to how soon the recession might end or to the impact of the Persian Gulf war on the economy. In the past, he has blamed the recession primarily on the Gulf crisis and the damage it has done to consumer confidence.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Washington's Plan To Funnel City Aid Through the States Enrages the Mayors

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN the Depression year of 1933, when people were starving in the streets, three mayors came to Washington, met with President Franklin D. Roosevelt and asked for emergency assistance. Over the objections of governors, who argued that aid should be funneled exclusively through the states, Congress in 1933 earmarked 25 percent of each state's road funds for municipal projects.
The perennial tension between governors and mayors exploded again last week in their responses to President Bush's proposal to turn over $15 billion of Federal programs to the states. In a move to celebrate the "innovative power of states as laboratories," Mr. Bush proposed to strip away Federal restrictions on use of the money, a relatively small portion of the $171 billion that the Federal Government expects to distribute in grants to state and local governments for an immense array of programs next year. 
 Many governors expressed interest in the proposal. The idea of gaining more flexibility in the use of Federal money is "very attractive to the states," said Gov. Booth Gardner of Washington, chairman of the National Governors Association.
But mayors complained that it was, in the words of Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, another salvo in Washington's "10-year steady assault on America's cities."
 
Tapping the Pipeline
 Mayors now fear that Mr. Bush's proposal would permit the states to siphon money from the pipeline that carries cash from the United States Treasury directly to hundreds of cities.
Mayors were apoplectic last week when they learned, for instance, that Mr. Bush's budget proposal included the Community Development Block Grants on a list of the programs that might be turned over to the states. The program provides $3.1 billion a year for housing, street repairs, parks and playgrounds, child care, shelters for battered women and other public services to benefit people with low or moderate income. Cities and urban counties now get two-thirds of the money; states get the remainder.
In his State of the Union Message on Jan. 29, President Bush said transferring such programs to the states would move "power and decision-making closer to the people." But Mayor Robert M. Isaac of Colorado Springs, president of the United States Conference of Mayors, said that under the proposal power would actually be further removed from the people because decisions about how to spend community development funds would be made by state officials, rather than at the local level.
For their part, states, in fiscal distress themselves, need every dollar they can find. Even as Mr. Bush proposed devolution of Federal programs to the state level, governors were begging Washington to pay more of the cost of Medicaid, the fast-growing health program for poor people.
Apart from the tensions between governors and mayors, the outlook for Mr. Bush's proposal is fraught with other problems.
John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said last week that the Administration wanted to negotiate with the governors and with the National Conference of State Legislatures on which Federal programs should be turned over to the states. Surely, he implied, they should be able to agree on a package.
After all, there are 478 Federal grant programs that distribute more than $100 billion a year for specific activities narrowly defined by law. Each "categorical grant" program is a separate spigot. There are 17 for highways, 22 for pollution control, 65 for health services and 98 for education.
Some might think it would be easy to consolidate the six Federal grant programs for urban mass transit, or the 16 for education of handicapped children. But such an expectation ignores the political reality: Behind each grant is at least one member of Congress, zealously interested in the program and responding to hundreds of thousands of people who benefit from it.
Another obstacle will be the committees of Congress, which are unlikely to approve Mr. Bush's proposal to turn over $15 billion worth of programs to the states "in a single consolidated grant." Nearly every committee has some grants within its purview and would fight to retain control of the money.
But it is conceivable that Congress might revise Mr. Bush's proposal by merging some of the smaller grant programs into a new or expanded block grant for a broad purpose like mental health, highways or elementary education. At the very least, Congress could give states more leeway to shift money between similar grant programs.
Whether the proposal survives in its current form or not, Ralph Tabor, a lobbyist for the National Association of Counties, commented: "If you put all this money together into one pot and the governors can transfer funds from one program to another, there is no assurance the original purposes of the current grants will be met."
The unanswered questions already being raised about Mr. Bush's block grant proposal suggest that it was hastily devised to put flesh on the bones of his domestic policy. White House officials said the aid formula could be written so that each state would receive a lump sum roughly equal to the total amount it now receives from all the separate grants being consolidated. But many details have yet to be worked out. It is impossible to say whether any particular city or state would be a winner or a loser.
President Bush said that if he transfers Federal programs to the states, they would be "fully funded" for five years. His vow was meant to pacify state and local officials who know that Washington likes to give them new responsibilities with no new money.
But what did Mr. Bush mean?
There would be $15 billion a year for five years, without any allowance for inflation. In promising this amount, the Administration assumed that costs would soar in some categories while spending would be slashed in others. Thus, states are asked to take full responsibility for the cost of administering welfare, food stamps and Medicaid, and the Administration asssumes those costs will grow 62 percent, to $8.3 billion, in 1996. Over the same period, it assumes that states can get along with a 56 percent cut in Federal grants for construction of sewage treatment plants and an 83 percent cut in Federal money to help poor people heat their homes.
City residents might well notice a difference.
Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group, notes that 80 percent of the program funds suggested for consolidation into a block grant are now used to help people with low incomes.
"The Administration's proposal thus could pose a significant risk to poor families" because they have historically had less political influence at the state level than at the Federal level, he said.
"State legislatures tend to be dominated by suburban and rural interests," said Mayor William J. Althaus of York, Pa., a Republican. Calling Mr. Bush's block grant proposal "very ill-conceived," Mr. Althaus spoke for many mayors when he said at a news conference last week that he thought there was no reason to tamper with a system that was working.
States, of course, are repeatedly mentioned in the Constitution. Cities and counties are not; they exist as agencies of the states. Presidents have given differing degrees of recognition to the cities. Some mayors say they never had a better friend in the White House than Richard M. Nixon, who promoted revenue sharing, community development grants and operating subsidies for mass transit. By contrast, President Ronald Reagan, a former governor, preferred to do business with the governors. He often acted as if he believed that no one, not even the Federal Government, should tell sovereign states how to behave.
In his new budget, Mr. Bush likewise celebrates that sovereignty.

HEADLINE: Adding It All Up;
Battle Plans Are Deadly Simple; The Strategic Weapon Is Politics

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FROM the chain of command, all the way up to George Bush, the word to the public last week was that the war in the Persian Gulf was going according to plan -- as if the Bush Administration had subverted the military maxim first uttered by Count Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, the Prussian Chief of Staff who said no battle plan survives contact with the enemy.
In fact, though, the first three weeks of the war had illustrated the ability of combat to surprise those who plan it -- from the need to divert air power to hunt down mobile Scud missile launchers, to the ability of Saddam Hussein's Republican Guards to dig in and resist, to the chanting of mobs in the streets of Morocco, Jordan and Yemen. 
 All of these developments reflected the extent to which this has been a war in which political imperatives, both in the United States and abroad, have played an extraordinary role in shaping strategy. And that only promised to continue this week, when President Bush is to sit down with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and General Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to confront the tough decision of when to initiate a ground campaign against the world's fourth largest army.
Part of that decision would be determining what kind of ground campaign would stand the best chance of ending the war with the fewest American casualties. Mr. Cheney, on the ground in Saudi Arabia, already was hinting at strategies to put allied forces on the flanks of Iraq's army to draw the enemy out of its fortifications into the killing fields of allied air power. Other military officials said allied forces would wage a ground war on the margins of Iraq's brute dug-in power, nibbling away from a safe distance and following a ground strategy called "destruction in detail."
So far, this has been a very different kind of war: the first over-the-horizon war, fought by two military giants of completely different form, and fought in heavily scheduled phases; one party, the United States and its allies, has controlled the pace and the timing of destruction by virtue of its control of the airspace over the theater of operations.
Of the two powers, one, Iraq, is comparatively low-tech, ground-based and completely dependent on a strategy of damage absorption, attrition against the attacking force, perseverance without resupply and the use of unconventional weapons to incite political terror. Ultimately, it is in this ability to absorb punishment and survive that Iraq's leader places his hopes for victory -- not the military victory of prevailing on the battlefield, but the political victory that might be wrung from outlasting an onslaught from the world's greatest military powers.
The other giant, the American-led coalition, relies on a technology-based strategy of stand-off destruction with precision weapons to protect its manpower base, to which it attaches the highest premium. For it, too, the definition of success is in large part political: The allies are prosecuting a war under a political imperative of casualty limitation as great or greater than in any previous American conflict.
The closing phase of the war still lies in the murky distance. But with the continued destruction of Iraq's national infrastructure -- roads, bridges, power plants, refineries and basic industries, much of which have served military as well as civilian purposes -- some important voices inside and outside the coalition have begun to question the scale of the allied bombing strategy beyond the Kuwaiti border.
If the Bush Administration has begun to address such questions as how Iraq will feed itself the morning after the war ends, it is not apparent in the President's public diplomacy. This remains narrowly focused on the villainy of Saddam Hussein, a tenacious adversary who many experts believe is likely to survive, firmly in control of his power base, still sitting on the world's second largest pool of oil and still rampant on the Arab political landscape.
Last week's offer by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to assist any postwar Iraqi regime so long as it is not headed by Mr. Hussein appeared more as a political ploy to undermine the Iraqi leader than a genuine offer of help, telegraphing as it did an assumption of punitive treatment of Iraq in the event that Mr. Hussein survives.
In a strictly military sense, the strategy unfolding in the Persian Gulf is not surprising to people who have watched military doctrine evolve at the Pentagon over the last decade. Mr. Bush's generals are peeling back the layers of a "relentlessly simple, almost pedestrian" blueprint, as one White House official called it, to murder the body of Iraqi military power with a thousand well-aimed cuts.
The plan was on the shelf in the text of the Pentagon's Air-Land Doctrine, 40 linear feet of strategy and tactics written over the last decade as technology, complexity and Congress all forced the services to operate jointly on the battlefield, with all the services arms of each other under a unified theater command.
On the Arabian Peninsula, the classical rules of warfare have been adapted to microchip weapons, desert geography and the peculiar mismatch of strengths and weaknesses between the adversaries. Even General Powell's bumper-sticker description betrayed the simplicity of the concept when he described the plan for defeating Iraq's 30-division force around Kuwait: "First we're going to cut it off and then we're going to kill it."
But radiating out from this simple strategy is the real tension of this war, and the basis for the observation by one former Pentagon intelligence official that General Powell may be winning the war he is fighting while Saddam Hussein may also be winning the war he is fighting.
Unquestionably, Mr. Hussein is pursuing a political-military strategy, seeking to make his place in history as an indefatigable Arab warrior holding out against the greatest military onslaught that could be served up by the superpowers. He intends to stand as the leader of an Arab Sparta, a personification of third-world aspirations who, in his own dangerous way, dared to be great.
He has not hidden his battle strategy from the West, but has gloried in its strength and simplicity.
"They will tell you that America is developed in terms of missiles, developed in aircraft, and developed in its ability to jam the Iraqis," Mr. Hussein told an Islamic conference five days before war broke out.
"They have weapons that strike from afar," he said, but added that "under all circumstances, one who wants to evict a fighter from the land will eventually depend on a soldier who walks on the ground and comes with a hand grenade, rifle and bayonet to fight the soldier in the battle trench.
"If you go to the theater of operations now," Mr. Hussein said, "you will not see the thousands of tanks and the millions of people. You may see traffic on public roads; the rest are all well fortified under the ground so that when they direct fire towards them to allow their tanks and infantry to advance, the fighters will emerge safe and able to fight.
"All this technological superiority, which is on paper," he said, "will eventually be tested in the theater of operations. We are not people who speak on the basis of books; we are people with experience in fighting."
As he holds out in his bunker, Mr. Hussein has not left the briefings to his generals, as Mr. Bush has done. The Iraqi leader uses no pointer, no charts; he briefs with rhetoric, distortion and his own social mythology about the subjugation of the have-nots by the haves -- all of it designed to inflame Arab and other third-world sensibilities about the return of the colonial powers to visit destruction on Arab lands and Islamic shrines.
In the ground war ahead, Mr. Hussein has promised the "Mother of All Battles," an Islamic Armageddon to join all Arab grievances into one holy war. He has wrapped his defiance in Kuwait in the mantle of Palestinian nationalism; his struggle has thus fused his cause with the plight of a people who feel the United Nations has left them in the torpor of resolutions unenforced and expectations unfulfilled. In addition, he has joined to the Palestinian struggle his own paranoid view that the West was out to bring Iraq low after his "victory" over Iran, to unleash Israel against his arms industries and to undermine his economy in league with the "corrupt" oil sheiks in Kuwait.
If the bearish American field commander, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, has come as Hector with lasers and cruise missiles to smite Iraq, then Saddam Hussein has set himself up as Saladin, the Muslim avenger resisting a Western crusade to re-enslave Islam.
Military officers hate it when their achievements are judged against political yardsticks. But political factors intrude on all wars, and that is especially evident in this one. Mr. Cheney told an audience of mining executives last week that he does not buy the argument that the Iraqi leader is winning by losing, even though there is precedent for such an outcome in the Arab-Israeli wars.
"Our plan is mathematical and it has its schedule," a White House official said last week, "and Saddam Hussein has his battle plan with its schedule.
"There are two curves," the official continued. "On one you measure how long he can hold out and on the other you measure our campaign to go after the skeletal structure of his military, and then the muscle and flesh. At some point those curves intersect and I just don't see how he can keep on his schedule."
The Scud attacks may have been the first attempt to change the schedule of the war for political gain. This is the reason General Powell altered the course of the air war when Israel started taking incoming missiles that threatened to bring it into the conflict, followed perhaps by Jordan and the implosion of the Arab alliance against Iraq.
To military officers, the Scud threat was militarily insignificant, because random explosions in residential neighborhoods cannot defeat an army. "We've never been worried about Scuds," one military commander said. "They are so inaccurate that if you get hit with a Scud, you were going to have a bad day anyway."
But General Powell, with the political acuity gained in two tours at the White House, has reinforced to his field command the inexorable Realpolitik of warfare by coalition.
The same military insignificance attended Iraq's ill-fated assault on Khafji, but for Mr. Hussein the battle had some effect nevertheless: It rattled the allied military, left 11 American marines dead, taught Mr. Hussein something about the allied front lines and showed the Arab world that he was fighting.
A measure of its impact on Washington was the speed with which the allied commander, General Schwarzkopf, bolted from his war room into the studios of every American television network and major news organizations to press the military view that the world had witnessed a mosquito bite on an elephant.
 The ultimate test for the political cohesion of the coalition may come if -- or when -- Iraq introduces chemical warfare as a final spasm of defiance.
So far, the military has had an answer for everything, except how and where the campaign will end. To be sure, the United States and its allies fully expect that their victory will come with the strangulation of Iraq's war machine, the military outcome that seems the most likely; meanwhile, the possibility that Iraq will be able to claim its own dark victory, even in the event of military defeat, is seeking form in the murky distance.

HEADLINE: The Region;
Dinkins Is Running a Deficit In His Credibility Account

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
IF Credibility Gap were a place, David N. Dinkins might be its mayor.
As it is, Mr. Dinkins is the Mayor of New York City, which is as much a state of mind as a political jurisdiction. And, beginning last summer, the avuncular Mayor whom many New Yorkers had been inclined to give the benefit of the doubt seemed, to some, to be generating more doubts than benefits. Mr. Dinkins had entered higher office with a credibility deficit. However irrelevant, it was rooted, in part, in his personal affairs -- his income tax filing lapses decades ago and a questionable stock transfer to his son that reverberated again last month when an independent investigator's failure to find evidence of criminality was hailed by the Mayor as vindication. Moreover, Mr. Dinkins's previous government experience had been largely unremarkable. 
 Trust is a fragile commodity. The public is fickle; the first scent of blood can send the press into a feeding frenzy. By summer, Mr. Dinkins was starting to hemorrhage.
The undercurrent of skepticism surfaced with his failure to bring to a timely conclusion the boycott by a group of blacks of a Brooklyn grocery store owned by Korean immigrants -- a failure that was magnified because it contrasted with the promise that his city would be more harmonious than his predecessor's. Mr. Dinkins's maddeningly deliberate response to surging crime underscored earlier concerns about indecisiveness and even about his compassion. Last October, three mayoral announcements instantly elevated one roller-coaster week to legend in the annals of governance: A contract settlement with the teachers union that some outside monitors considered imprudent; an ambitious but expensive public safety program, and the prospect of as many as 15,000 layoffs to close a growing budget gap.
Mr. Dinkins seemed no more irresolute than President Bush had been about his budget, no more disbelieved by some people in and out of government than many other elected officials had been. But confusion was compounded by several subsequent events. One was the disclosure that the Dinkins administration, the City Council and the state Legislature had, perhaps unwittingly, not fully disclosed that a proposed extension of the city's personal income tax surcharge to pay for the public safety program might produce more revenue than necessary. Another was that property taxes might have to be increased by more than had been stated explicitly. Still another was that the city had negotiated a relatively modest agreement with two more municipal unions -- relatively modest in less austere times, at least -- at the same time that it was contemplating budget cuts that could result in, among other economies, the closing of 41 firehouses.
To a great extent, what the Dinkins administration seemed guiltier of than deliberate deception was poor timing, inattention to detail, attempted cover-ups when it apparently had little to hide and, primarily, miscommunication. It seemed unable to place in context positions that might be intellectually defensible individually, but which, collectively, seemed contradictory. That Mr. Dinkins himself is circumspect and believes the media cannot be trusted didn't help.
"Much of it is a bad rap," Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker, said of the credibility gap. "The problem is the arrogance of his staff and the inability to communicate. I can't believe that the Mayor personally knows what's going on." The last remark seems a back-handed compliment.
Last fall, Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the State Financial Control Board, declared that the city was facing not another fiscal crisis but a crisis of confidence.
"There's been a 180-degree change since then," Mr. Proctor said last week. "The issue in the fall was, do they have a handle on what their problems are and what would make them better? I think that's not an issue any more. If there's someone who's worrying, it's a different worry: Does the city have the management capacity and the governance capacity to achieve what it announced?"
The layoff debate was "a sideshow," Mr. Proctor said, since the city's goals were clear even as it debated how much could be achieved by attrition. Similarly, the income-tax-surcharge question "comes to the issue of tactics rather than substance," he said, and "reflects incompleteness." "As to what the implications of incompleteness are, people can differ." (Or, as Philip R. Michael, the city budget director, said: "We're not such clods that we attempted to hide it and we hid it badly. If anything, it was just the opposite.")
"They're not perfect," Mr. Proctor said, "but I'm not sure they need to be perfect."
Their blundering in last October's surprises prompted Standard & Poor's Corporation to place the city on a credit watch. Last week, in a vote of confidence, the rating agency revoked its caveat, while cautioning that the long-term outlook remained negative.
"I think he's learned a lot from the October experience," Hyman C. Grossman, a Standard & Poor's managing director, said of Mr. Dinkins. "He's better briefed, more confident and understands much more than he did 6 months ago or 12 months ago. I give anybody at least two years to get the complete range and scope of understanding the ramifications of being chief executive of the City of New York."
Last week, in fact, seemed nearly as triumphal for the Mayor as the week last October was catastrophic. The Standard & Poor's verdict was followed by a tentative agreement in Albany on Mr. Dinkins's public safety program, which, if it is finally hatched, might well erase memories of a difficult incubation.
Lingering perceptions can shape reality, though, even for a Mayor whose perceived decency often mitigated nagging doubts about his performance. Bridging gaps in credibility, whatever their cause, may be more challenging than the budget gaps that Mr. Dinkins must hurdle over the next several months. Belatedly and begrudgingly, he has been taking tentative steps to prevent his administration from being defined by default. One such step was acknowledging the role of the press in shaping the image of public officials. "Sometimes," Mr. Dinkins said, "we are what you say we are."

As Soviet Borders Open, the West Braces for an Economic Exodus

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
THE withering of the Soviet empire and the economic strains that accompany it may produce the largest migration since World War II, demographers say, and that will present Western governments that have long pressed Moscow to open its frontiers with the uncomfortable problem of what to do about a flood of would-be immigrants.
Most are in search of work, food, a better life, sometimes safety. They include Soviet Jews heading for Israel, Germany and the United States, Armenians going to France, German-speaking Poles and Hungarians entering unified Germany, Albanians scrambling into Greece. 
 The exodus has been manageable so far, but barely. From a maximum of 100,000 a year in the 1970's and middle 1980's, immigration from the Warsaw Pact countries to the West jumped to 1.3 million in 1989, the last year for which figures are available, and it was probably higher in 1990.
But now Western countries fear an even larger exodus as the Soviet Union starts lifting travel restrictions just when economic hardship and ethnic tensions are on the rise.
 
Specters of Famine and War <>
Last month Vladimir Scherbakov, chairman of the Soviet state Committee on Labor and Social Services, told West European governments that 1.5 million to 2 million Soviet citizens are likely to move west in search of work in the next few years. This is well below the more extreme estimates of 25 million to 30 million immigrants that some experts in the United Nations High Commission for Refugees have warned could head west if famine combines with civil war.
Those who believe the migration from the East can be absorbed say most of those leaving come from finite ethnic groups -- the roughly 2 million Germans in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the 2 million or so Soviet Jews, the million Armenians living outside Armenia, an estimated 3 million displaced Hungarians and some 3 million gypsies. The great mass of the Soviet people, according to this theory, have no tradition of migration and remain attached to the soil. But some 25 million ethnic Russians already live in other Soviet republics -- including 9 million in predominantly Moslem Central Asia and Azerbaijan, where they are often considered unwelcome foreigners -- and they might decide to flee.
Other experts warn of a steady stream of Easterners taking advantage of their new freedom to travel and study abroad, overstaying their visas and joining the underground economy.
Bimal Ghosh, an expert with the Geneva-based International Organization for Migration, warns that the switch to a market economy could put 14 million people out of work in Eastern Europe and 30 million to 40 million people in the Soviet Union by 1994.
The prospect of rising migration creates a dilemma for Western European governments and for the United States, Canada and Australia, the countries that have absorbed most recent migrations. With the cold war over, immigrants are unlikely to qualify for political asylum as refugees facing "well-founded fear of persecution." But it is equally difficult for Western governments to keep them out after telling the Soviet bloc for decades to open its frontiers.
More Western countries, however, are closing the door to potential migrants from the East, requiring visas, return tickets and a minimum amount of cash. And Austria, a traditional haven for refugees in cold war days, has sent 4,000 soldiers to seal its borders.
Many argue the real answer is for the West to do more to help the east make a success of capitalism quickly so its people stay home.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Nature Humbles a State of Mind;
5-Year Drought Is Only the Latest Trouble in Paradise

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
CALIFORNIANS yet again have cause to ponder the consequences of the profligacy, recklessness and greed that have long dulled the California dream of hope, renewal and optimism. In what the historian Kevin Starr has called "the intensified pursuit of human happiness" that marks the energetic history of California, insult after insult has been inflicted on this earthly paradise. The great Gold Rush left the mountains scarred like a battlefield. Lumbermen denuded the magnificent stands of redwood to the point that the few remaining trees are tourist curiosities. Automobiles have exhausted the air of Southern California. And now, it seems, the water is nearly all gone.
It did not have to be this way. For four dry years, water officials gambled that the rain and snow would resume soon, treating drought as a temporary inconvenience. To maintain near-normal deliveries, they drew down reservoirs to dangerously low levels. Even as drought tightened its grip in 1990, California farmers racked up record receipts and income. California remained the nation's second largest grower of rice, a monsoon crop that can be grown here only with cheap subsidized water and Federal crop supports. And there seemed plenty of water for Angelenos to fill their pools and wash their sidewalks. 
 Only now, well into the fifth dry year, when it may be too late, has concerted reaction set in with panicky attempts to conserve water and find additional sources. A few days ago, the Napa Valley wine town of St. Helena, with only a 125-day supply left in its reservoir, imposed rationing for the first time in history. In the San Joaquin Valley, the city of Merced adopted an odd-even outdoor watering rule on Monday, the same day the State Water Project cut off supplies to all farmers. Cities throughout Southern California last week were preparing rationing plans.
The state government's response so far has been hesitant and confused. The Water Resources Control Board twice set dates to impose statewide restrictions and twice postponed them amid doubts about its authority, ultimately deferring to Gov. Pete Wilson, who has appointed a special water panel to make emergency recommendations by Friday. His short-term options are limited, the long-term ones painful.
Few places on earth offer a more improbable setting for vast industrialized cities and prosperous farms than this mostly desertified state. Even as the American settlement of the Pacific frontier was gathering momentum a century and a half ago, a United States naval officer, Lieut. Henry Augustus Wise, pronounced California's future bleak. "Under no contingency," he wrote in 1849, "does the natural face of Upper California appear susceptible of supporting a very large population; the country is hilly and mountainous; great dryness prevails during the summers, and occasionally excessive droughts parch up the soil for periods of 12 or 18 months."
With great disdain for such negativism, Californians rearranged the environment to get the water they needed. Dams and reservoirs snatched water from the snows of the Sierra of Northern California and funneled it into thick aortas, the mighty aqueducts that course through the deserts, making rich farms out of the malarial bogs of the Central Valley and sprouting powerful cities where none were naturally meant to be. Not even mountains stood in the way of the engineers. Huge pumps, like throbbing heart muscles, throw the water over the Tehachapi Mountains and down into that arid tract known as the Los Angeles Basin, land of car washes, swimming pools and now home to 15 million. The result is perhaps the most problematic and vulnerable urban conglomeration in America today, threatened by the twin terrors of earthquake and drought.
"There is something disturbing about this corner of America, a sinister suggestion of transience," wrote the British author J. B. Priestly. "There is a quality, hostile to men in the very earth and air here. As if we were not meant to make our homes in this oddly enervating sunshine." He went on: "California will be a silent desert again. It is all as impermanent and brittle as a reel of film."
That may or not be true. But the means by which the water problem is solved will speak volumes about whether California, in its maturity, will learn from its youth or repeat its mistakes.
"In Iowa there is a humility about the farmer's reliance on nature -- he embraces nature and allows himself to be embraced by its generosity," J. S. Holliday, historian of California's rambunctious Gold Rush past, said in an interview. "But here there is an entirely different attitude. The miners brought the attitude that nature had to be cracked open, that nature is a bounteous force from which we will take whatever we can get however we can get it. We were so flagrant, so arrogant, so profligate."
Already, history is repeating itself. Five years of water profligacy in the face of drought have taken an environmental toll. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco, striped bass counts in the Sacramento Delta and San Francisco Bay are at their lowest levels in history, and numerous birds, sea animals and plants have become candidates for the endangered species list because reduced fresh water flows to estuarine waters have raised salinity.
 But the solution that is so obvious to conservationsists -- to change the outdated system of water rights and impose new incentives for more efficient agriculture -- may not be the most politically feasible outcome. It is sobering to realize that even if every household in California, population 30 million, cut its annual water use by 25 percent that would reduce overall use by only 2 percent; agriculture consumes 85 percent of all available water.
"It is an empty exercise to put cities through elaborate conservation exercises," argues William L. Kahrl, author of "Water and Power," the definitive chronicle of California's water wars. "That picks the course that causes the maximum inconvenience to the largest number of people, rather than looking at the reality of the deliveries. The lesson is they are very likely going to say: 'I don't care about the Sacramento Delta. That's a long way away. Give me more water.' "
Southern California, with the bulk of the population and political power, has long coveted the water of the north. The largest new potential for water would come from building the long-delayed peripheral canal that would channel more water to the south from the Sacramento Delta, water that would otherwise flow into San Francisco Bay. Talk about tapping the rivers of rural far-northern California has also been revived, a course that would please the farmers as much as urban leaders, but that would rearrange the environment even more than it has been.
"I do not have any thought of giving up water -- it's a matter of how we get it," said Carl Boronkay, the general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. His is the largest and most politically powerful of the state's 2,000 water districts, supplying half the water used by 15 million people in the fast-growing region from Ventura to the Mexican border. Mr. Boronkay talks of taking water away from rice farmers, of voluntary transfers between regions -- easier said than done because water cannot be transferred like money between accounts. Reclamation, rationing and conservation are fine, he said, but "we need wet water."
The water crisis gives Californians one more reason to contemplate the state's failure to prepare for uncertainty and for growth that seems as inevitable as it is unwanted. Schools, social programs, freeways, bridges, prisons -- none has kept pace with the exploding population. "There are a full raft of problems we have failed adequately to plan for," said Bill Bradley, author of the forthcoming book "The United States of California." "California is the quintessence of the American dream," he said. "Its history has been based on betting on the prospect of things going one's way. There is a lot of strength in being optimistic. But the down side is what we are confronting now."
 
THE FIGHT FOR MORE WATER
 WITH the announcement last week that irrigation authorities were cutting off all water to farmers, including those in the huge Central Valley, and with Southern California cities preparing rationing plans, the drought that is now in its fifth year has exposed more starkly than ever the precarious assumption on which California's civilization is built: that even in a desert an endless stream of water is an inalienable right.
Even in the wettest times, providing water for California's agriculture industry and its growing megalopolises is a heroic (some would say hubristic) act involving hydrology, geography and power politics that sometimes seems to border on civil war. Northern California may have been born in the Gold Rush but the resource that has become the most coveted is the water that falls on its mountaintops. But while three-fourths of the state's rain and snow falls north of Sacramento, three-fourths of the population is in the southern part of the state. In a mammoth feat of civil engineering, water is funneled by a labyrinth of dams and reservoirs into aqueducts that lead to the politically powerful south.
The Northerners ask why they should make such a sacrifice for the Southerners, whom they like to stereotype as water-guzzling users of swimming pools and car washes. And both the Northerners and the Southerners resent having to share water with the farmers, who have long insisted on growing cotton, alfalfa, rice and other crops requiring huge amounts of water. About 85 percent of the water in California is, or rather was, used by farmers, who produce half the fruits and vegetables in the United States.
And so the effects of the drought ripple beyond California. Halfway through the so-called rainy season, the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada stands at 13 percent of normal, making hopes of a spring runoff seem an elusive dream.

Cubs Favored, and Frey Is Relieved

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Some of the early -- foolhardy? -- prognostications are out, and the Chicago Cubs are among the teams touted for a division championship. Jim Frey, their no-nonsense general manager, is sort of relieved.
 "If you spend $26 million and it doesn't make you a contender, there's something wrong," Frey said. "We ought to be called a contender because we think we helped our ball club and we should have as good a chance as anyone." 
 The Cubs, in the space of four weeks, signed Danny Jackson, George Bell and Dave Smith as free agents for a total of $25.2 million guaranteed. The total comes to $30 million if option years are included.
 Their foray into such stratospheric economic territory was uncharacteristic for the Cubs. This is an organization, after all, that had to be embarrassed into signing Andre Dawson as a free agent four years ago, and then filled in a paltry $500,000 when he signed a blank contract. This is an organization that had been more accustomed to signing free agents on the level of Paul Moskau and Wayne Nordhagen.
 "The public seems surprised that we did what we did to the extent that we did it," Frey said. "There was always a perception on the part of many people that the Tribune wouldn't do that with free agency. I think the people were a little bit surprised not only that we went into the free-agent market but that we came out with three quality guys."
 Authorization by the Tribune Company, owner of the Cubs, for the large expenditure was surprising. Credit for the stunning departure should go to Frey, the 59-year-old executive, who can be more persuasive than most.
 (In 1984, for example, the Cubs plodded through a horrendous spring and whenever Manager Frey was asked what he was going to do, he said, "I have a plan." He sounded convincing, but he admitted after the team's championship season, their first since 1945, that he had had no plan; it was all he could think of saying that would satisfy people and keep them off his back.)
 "We talked about it," Frey said, discussing the evolution of the Cubs' off-season expenditures, "and after going through all the possible trade scenarios and trying to upgrade everything the best we could, we found out if you upgrade the pitching, you're probably taking away from the offense and vice versa.
 "I started to campaign a little bit to add a couple of free agent pitchers. I felt we had to improve our pitching with a quality left-handed starter and a right-hander to stabilize the bullpen. I thought if we didn't have to give up any of our position players to acquire them, we'd be one of the teams to beat. Then we went beyond that and got the left fielder, Bell."
 
They Need a Healthy Jackson
 The additions to a questionable pitching staff and an already solid offense have put the Cubs in position to compete with the defending champion Pittsburgh Pirates and the always-contending Mets. For the newcomers to help, however, Jackson has to remain healthy (he has missed significant parts of the past two seasons), Smith and Mitch Williams have to coexist peacefully in the bullpen and Bell has to avoid incurring the wrath of Wrigley Field's Bleacher Bums by playing better defense than he did recently for Toronto.
 Frey, who scoffs at much of what fans and reporters perceive or believe, could not offer a guarantee on Jackson's health, but he adderessed the other two matters.
 On the possibility of ego problems with the Smith-Williams relief tandem: "The only problem will be from guys coming into the clubhouse and asking Williams if he's teed off. Keep asking and one night he will be. The notion that everybody has to be completely happy all the time is a new idea. Everybody has to be happy and contented. It's not very often the case where everybody on a ball club is happy with their lot. The young guys always are trying to be in a better position, trying to be recognized and make more money, and the older guys are trying to hold on."
 On Bell's defense: "I'm not concerned about that. I don't think what some people say is accurate. I don't know that he's as bad as his image has developed in the last couple years. Baseball people I talk to don't see it the same way as writers and fans. Anyway, we haven't exactly had Joe DiMaggios running around in left field since I've been in town."
Will Frey's job, in effect, be on the line because he convinced his employers they should spend all of that money?
 "I haven't given that a whole lot of consideration," Frey said. "I don't feel that that's the natural consequence of spending money. If that was the case, there would be 25 clubs at the end of the year where the general manager should probably feel uncomfortable."
 
The Durability of Morris
 With a stretch of 235 or more innings pitched in 9 of the past 10 seasons (excluding strike-shortened 1981), Jack Morris has proved himself to be one of the most durable pitchers of his time. How does he account for his durability?
 "Training, clean living," Morris said. "I love the game. I want to play. I have goals and idols and heroes like every kid. My heroes are guys who pitched more innings than I have."
 Who might his heroes be? He named Phil Niekro, Nolan Ryan, Steve Carlton, Jim Palmer and Tom Seaver. All had remarkable records for durability and, in most cases, longevity:
 Niekro -- Pitched more than 200 innings for 19 successive seasons (excluding 1981), including four of 300 or more innings and seven others over 250; averaged 262 innings per season in that period.
 Ryan -- Has pitched more than 200 innings 14 times, surpassing 300 twice and 250 four other times; averaged 266 2/3 innings in a 10-year stretch and 240 2/3 the last 18 years (excluding 1981).
 Carlton -- Pitched 229 or more innings for 16 consecutive seasons (excluding 1981), including more than 250 innings 12 times; averaged 270 innings in the 16-season stretch.
 Palmer -- Pitched 274 or more innings in eight years of a nine-year span, exceeding 300 four times, including three seasons in a row; averaged 287 2/3 innings during that time and 266 1/3 over a 12-year stretch.
 Seaver -- Pitched 236 or more innings in 12 successive seasons, surpassing 250 the first 7 of those seasons and 11 of the 12; averaged 270 innings in that time.
 Morris added one pitcher to his personal hall of fame: Frank Tanana. "He's one of my heroes," Morris said of his former teammate. "I love him like a brother. He'd be embarrassed to hear me say that. He's a power pitcher turned into a finesse pitcher. His conditioning program is great. He's a survivor."
 
Santiago Joins $1-Million-a-Year Club
 When Benito Santiago's salary arbitration case was decided Friday, he became the 200th player to have a salary of $1 million or more for this year.
 With more to come, Oakland leads with 13 such players and the Mets, Los Angeles and San Francisco each have 12. The Yankees, the Cubs and Boston have 11 each. Baltimore has only two while Cleveland, Seattle and Houston have three each. The Red Sox have the most players at $2 million or more, nine, one more than the Mets and the Dodgers.
 The Athletics, the Dodgers and the Red Sox have watched their payrolls soar past the $30 million mark, with the first two clubs approaching $32 million. And Oakland faces a possible $3.3 million loss to Mark McGwire in salary arbitration.
 
Clemens and the $6 Million Plateau
 In the right set of circumstances, Roger Clemens could become baseball's Lee Majors: the $6 million man.
 That's the salary Clemens could earn in 1996 if the Boston Red Sox don't exercise their option for a fifth year in his contract, but he does, which would be his right if they don't and, in 1994 or '95, he pitches 220 innings or places in the top three in the Cy Young Award voting.
 But even if Clemens does become baseball's $6 million man, would he be the first to reach that plateau? Very likely not if the current contract escalation continues.
 When Jose Canseco signed a contract last June for an average of $4.7 million a year, baseball executives figured no one would top that number. It took nearly seven months, but Clemens has done it, catapulting past Canseco by more than $600,000.
 Now those executives will wait with dread, wondering when the next challenger will come along and topple Clemens as king of the money hill.
 Maybe it will be somebody already high on the salary charts, Will Clark, for example, whose $3.75-million-a-year contract expires after the 1993 season. Clark has a $4.25 million salary in that last year, and it wouldn't be too far a jump to reach $6 million in 1995, a year before Clemens could get there. Clark also plays for the right team. San Francisco pays its players exceedingly well, especially to keep them from straying.
 Perhaps it'll be Eric Davis, whose contract expires after the 1992 season. Davis, like his friend Darryl Strawberry, has had eyes for Los Angeles, and the Dodgers may not be able to resist having the two in the same outfield. A five-year contract, at mid-'90s numbers, could put Davis at $6 million by 1995.
 One last guess: Nolan Ryan, the first $1-million-a-year player. The remarkable Ryan will be only 48 years old in 1995 and a mere kid of 47 in 1994. His salary this year is $3.3 million, and it wouldn't be an unthinkable leap for him to get to $6 million one of those years.

Clemens Gives Mets Dilemma

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Craig Fenech, agent for Frank Viola, considered the record contract signed by Roger Clemens on Friday and said, "I'm probably having a better weekend than Al."
 Fenech referred to Al Harazin, the man charged with negotiating the Mets' contracts. The day after Clemens and the Boston Red Sox agreed to a four-year deal worth $21,521,000, or more than $5 million a year, Harazin was at home in Scarsdale yesterday wondering where the Mets should go with Dwight Gooden and Frank Viola. 
 The pitchers each have one year remaining on their contracts, and the Mets have begun negotiations with their agents. They have made one offer to Viola and they mailed a second offer to Gooden last Thursday. No one has disclosed details of the offers, but they are undoubtedly for three years each and fall more than $1.5 million a year short of the $5.38 million Clemens will average in his contract extension.
 
Position to Be Determined
 The problem for the Mets, as they enter the once-again new world of baseball economics, is not just the amount of money they should offer Gooden and Viola but the length of the extensions.
 "I haven't had a chance to talk to Frank extensively to determine what our bargaining position is going to be," Harazin said, referring to Frank Cashen, the general manager. But the Mets face a dilemma in determining the length because of Darryl Strawberry.
When Strawberry became a free agent last fall, the Mets steadfastly held to their so-called policy of not having anyone, even their star players, under contract for more than four years. They offered Strawberry $15.5 million for four years, and he instantly bolted to Los Angeles for five years and $20.25 million with the Dodgers.
 
An Obvious Problem
 Now, if the Mets hold to their four-year policy and offer Gooden and Viola no more than a three-year extension, they risk losing them as free agents after the 1991 season. If, on the other hand, they abandon their "policy" and offer the pitchers four years on top of the one each has left, they risk incurring the wrath of fans who would be critical for not having offered Strawberry five years just three months earlier.
 "We've been very consistent not wanting to offer more than four years at a time," Harazin said. "The problem is an obvious one. It's a dilemma."
 The Mets had hoped to avoid the dilemma, crossing their fingers that the Red Sox would not sign Clemens until they had completed their negotiations with Gooden and Viola. But the Red Sox went about their business while the Mets took their time with theirs.
 
Market Is Volatile
 "They wanted a counterproposal from us," Fenech said. "I held off because in a market this volatile, to make a proposal before Clemens and Gooden signed would have been premature. I would have had to put numbers together that they would have scoffed at."
 The Mets can agonize over the Clemens numbers -- "I'm sure it's a great thing for Roger Clemens," Harazin said. "I'm not sure it's good for the rest of baseball" -- but they cannot scoff at whatever Gooden and Viola might now propose.

More Than a Token of Love

 BODY:
If, despite the recession and the war, anyone is still throwing money around the way they did in the 1980's, the American Greetings Corporation has the perfect valentine. Before the economy slid and before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, the company commissioned 2,000 oil paintings of roses by artists in the Far East, which it is offering to moonstruck Americans for $100 apiece.
For $100, you get a 17-inch-by-21-inch painting in a gold-colored frame with a fold-out generic greeting in rhyme on the back, ready for hanging. The rhymes are all the same, but the pictures are different, and thus each one is designated as a "Treasured Original"; the artists' instructions were only that the works should focus on red or pink roses in a vase. 
 Valentines are typically priced higher than other cards, but not that high. The average for paper valentines, of which American Greetings has more than 1,000 different designs this year, is just under $2. The average for its non-valentine cards is $1.40.
Sales figures for the $100 specials aren't out yet, but one customer in Cleveland bought three. That's real love.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
Sununu vs. Scientists

BYLINE: By Leslie H. Gelb

 BODY:
The answer: John Sununu, White House chief of staff.
 The question: Why are Administration officials like Secretary of State Baker and William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, afraid to speak their minds about the greenhouse effect -- those gases widely believed by scientists to be trapping heat and dangerously raising global temperatures? 
 And why are they all so quiet just when 130 nations are meeting near Washington on how to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide?
 The curtain on these matters lifts slightly with the following piece of high liturgy issued in Mr. Baker's behalf:
 "Even though officials with oil and gas interests are not as a rule required to recuse themselves from general policy actions that may have a financial impact on those interests, Secretary Baker has removed himself generally from global climate change questions out of an abundance of caution, on a case-by-case basis, to avoid the appearance of any impropriety."
 This remarkable "abundance of caution" comes from the very former Texas oil man who actively and sensibly participates in framing Persian Gulf policy and national energy strategy, who himself placed global warming among his top diplomatic priorities two years ago and who serves a President remembered for his greenhouse oratory during the last Presidential campaign.
 Mr. Baker, like most pros (and in this case like Mr. Reilly and a host of Administration environmentalists and scientists), backed away from the greenhouse cause when he saw Mr. Sununu's ferocity. John Sununu showed he would take no prisoners here when he ordered the dismissal of a State Department official foolish enough to take seriously the Bush- Baker pledges on global warming.
 Mr. Sununu seems to find most specialists in energy and environmental policy to be hysterics, bolstered by bad scientists and unreliable economists. Regarding global warming in particular, he believes that scientists have failed to prove that there is a warming trend, that the recent increase in temperatures is being fueled by greenhouse gases or that temperature rises of 1 to 3 degrees centigrade would badly damage the global climate. He is also convinced that available solutions to the problem are far too costly, and that cheaper ones will appear in time to prevent calamity.
 Perhaps Mr. Sununu, who has installed a global warming computer model in his personal computer, is right in his skepticism. He and others argued that the dangers of acid rain were greatly exaggerated, and recent findings suggest they were correct. But such skeptics initially waved aside the ozone problem, and two years ago the perils of increasing ultraviolet light became so palpable that the world community mandated deep cuts in chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, to reduce holes in the ozone layer.
 Arrayed against Mr. Sununu are people like Margaret Thatcher, solid professionals like those in the World Resources Institute in Washington and most of the scientific establishment. The hard-nosed chief of staff has held them all at bay and threatens to stymie the nations gathered in Chantilly, Va., with a transparent gimmick.
 The Administration began the conference last week with a pledge to stabilize its production of greenhouse gases. But as everyone at the meeting well understood, that could be accomplished simply by keeping a prior commitment to reduce CFC's. The Administration proposes to do nothing about the burning of fossil fuels like oil and coal, the main sources of carbon dioxide. In fact, U.S. production of carbon dioxide will signficantly increase in the coming years, more so because of the new energy policy. By contrast, Western European nations have already promised steep cuts in fossil fuel burning.
 What is disturbing here is not Mr. Sununu's public relations ploy, but his lack of practicality. He can retain all his skepticism about global warming, but the point remains that the very steps needed to reduce the supposed greenhouse effect are justifiable in their own right: carbon dioxide fouls the air. An oil-burning economy means continued dependence on imports. Destruction of forests harms life itself.
 Has Mr. Sununu been enforcing Administration silence about such considerations on his own tack or in behalf of Mr. Bush? If Mr. Bush has interest in global warming besides campaign bluster, he might go to the Chantilly conference and hear how the alarm bells sound for himself.

HEADLINE: Kids at Risk in Mr. Bush's Budget

 BODY:
In memory and in the occasional novel, the 1980's are seen as an Age of Affluence. But for America's children, they were the Age of Indifference. And if President Bush's budget message is any guide, more years of official neglect lie ahead.
A nationwide survey just released by the Center for the Study of Social Policy contains a few shreds of good news. The infant mortality rate went down several points. So did the child death rate. And more kids are graduating from high school. But every other important indicator of children's well-being tells a sad story. 
 The percentage of low-birth-weight babies is up. So is the percentage of babies born out of wedlock to adolescent mothers. The percentage of babies living with both parents went down. Moreover, life improved little as the children grew older. The violent death rate for teen-agers rose 12 percent from 1984 to 1988. And the juvenile incarceration rate rose 41 percent from 1979 to 1987.
Over all, the percentage of American children in poverty rose 26 percent between 1979 and 1989, and whites suffered along with blacks. Although black and Hispanic children are far more likely to be poor, the percentage of white children living in poverty rose 36 percent.
There's little reason to believe that these figures will soon improve. With one big exception, Mr. Bush's budgetary proposals involve more sleight-of-hand than substance. The exception is his proposal for generous increases in the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and smaller increases for childhood immunization. Both proposals could further reduce the childhood death rate.
Mr. Bush also proposed to lower the tragically high infant mortality rate in 10 American cities. But to achieve that result he may put poor infants in other parts of the country at risk. That's because the money for the cities initiative will be siphoned away from some community health centers -- specifically the centers' year-old rural outreach program -- as well as from the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant. Mr. Bush thus flouts the recommendations of his own Task Force on Infant Mortality, which last fall urged increased funding for both.
Although he has been extravagant in his praise for Head Start, the President is reluctant to put money where his mouth is. The suggested increase for the program is more than enough to stay ahead of inflation but nowhere near enough to realize Congress's goal for Head Start -- enrolling every eligible child in America by 1994.
And the proposed 16 percent cut in foster care will have a cruel effect on the kind of preplacement services that make it possible for a child to stay out of foster care, like counseling for families and various prevention activities.
What is truly sad about this aspect of the President's budget is that the money is coming out of programs that work. If America is still not certain about how to help its troubled teen-agers, it has more than a few good ideas about how to help the very young. Help them today, and there'll be fewer poor and desperate kids tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Is Victory Over Iraq Really a Sure Thing?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Most of the skepticism on the outcome of the war in the Persian Gulf has focused on its political and economic consequences. There seems widespread disagreement whether in the long-term these will be beneficial or harmful to United States interests. 
 But the result of the military campaign against Iraq is taken as a fait accompli. There are, however, reasons for questioning whether or not a military victory is a sure thing.
Perhaps the most obvious of these is the possible use by the Iraqis of decoys for their tanks and artillery. Decoys are a lot cheaper than smart weapons, and it is within the technological capabilities of the Iraqis to make them in large number. When I asked a well-known defense expert about this possibility soon after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, he said the Bush Administration doesn't believe the Iraqis have the technical sophistication to make decoys that can fool our synthetic aperture radars.
As it has turned out, though, the Iraqis do have the technical sophistication to hide their mobile missile launchers in a way to make them almost impossible to detect with our radars or any other means, and have successfully deployed missile decoys. We cannot assume that the Iraqis are incapable of hiding their real tanks and artillery, and of producing realistic decoys. If the Iraqis make extensive use of decoys, the war will be very expensive to pursue, and a complete victory may cost more than most Americans are willing to pay.
An even more worrisome reason to doubt the military outcome is the possible use by Iraq of nuclear weapons. Although the possession by the Iraqis of usable nuclear weapons is widely discounted, I don't think it can be ruled out. In late 1989, the Iraqis were caught trying to acquire detonators that can be used in nuclear weapons. One might wonder why they were interested in acquiring detonators if they didn't have, or weren't soon to acquire, sufficient quantities of the nuclear materials to make nuclear bombs. I think it can be assumed that the Iraqis are frantically working to produce nuclear weapons.
What the actual state of affairs is may be known at the highest levels of government, but I doubt that the Bush Administration is willing to divulge what is known. The public statements by the President that the Iraqi nuclear capability has been almost eliminated strains credulity. It seems to me more likely that the Iraqi centrifuges for producing enriched uranium are whirring away inside deep bunkers or mines.
If the Iraqis start to lose the conventional war, they may well be inclined to use whatever nuclear weapons they have on hand.
The United States military action can be viewed as a bet that we can defeat Iraq and impose some kind of mandatory inspection condition before Iraq can use nuclear weapons against the coalition forces and possibly Saudi Arabia. I hope we win this bet but the expected doesn't always happen.

HEADLINE: ANTIQUES;
Offbeat Settings Enhance Winter Show

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
When the 37th annual Winter Antiques Show ended last Sunday, most participants were relieved, and some were jubilant. Business, while down from a year ago, was better than many dealers had expected, considering the war and the recession. Although the East Side House Settlement, the sponsor of the 10-day bazaar at the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan, reported fewer tickets were sold than last year, the decline was less than had been projected. Even the new floor plan, with its wider aisles and shallower booths, was praised more than condemned.
Not everyone felt upbeat about the show. Critics focused primarily on the 66 dealers' stock, which, they said, was short on variety and memorable artworks. 
 "There should be fewer things and more significant objects," said Michael Ward, a Manhattan antiquities dealer, after visiting the fair. "There's too much stuff -- it's like a shopping mall."
Said Herve Aaron, a former exhibitor at the Winter Antiques Show who heads the Manhattan gallery of the furniture dealers Didier Aaron of Paris: "If they want to make it a great show, they have to get more dealers who have great things to show."
Yet most vistors were enthusiastic. "This show looks the best I've seen in the 11 or 12 years I've been coming here," said Brian Haughton, a London ceramics dealer. Mr. Haughton and his wife, Anna, organize the International Antique Show each October at the armory, on Park Avenue -- the biggest competitor of the more glamorous and commercially successful Winter Antiques Show.
"All the dealers seem to have paid more attention this year to the design of their booths," said W. Graham Arader 3d, a New York print dealer at the show. Why? "They had to pay double or triple the booth rent. There is nothing like pain to sharpen one's attention to details."
Several of the show's 17 new dealers devised offbeat settings. At Bauman Rare Books, a Philadelphia dealer, a mahogany library wall invited browsing and buying. The proprietors, David and Natalie Bauman, sold numerous leather-bound books, an Abraham Lincoln legal manuscript and a copy of the lavishly illustrated 15th-century "Nuremberg Chronicle," a gilded volume bound in pigskin, which was bought for about $60,000.
An aisle away, at the booth shared by two San Francisco silver dealers -- Argentum and the Leopard's Head -- warm gray walls heightened the ambiance of polished shimmer.
Leighton Longhi, at the show for the first time, exploited the six-foot depth of his booth, the shallowest at the fair. He hung a stunning pair of gilded 17th-century Japanese screens wall to wall at the back, placing a few choice Japanese art objects, including 30-inch-tall carved dragons, in front. The screens sold swiftly to a Japanese collector for about $800,000.
The most spectacular piece of furniture at the fair -- a boldly carved 18th-century English library table with gilded embellishments -- was the centerpiece of Carlton Hobbs's booth. Mr. Hobbs, a London dealer, kept things simple and curiously somber, curtaining the walls in dark green glazed chintz and installing a pair of marble busts of Roman emperors on either side of the seven-foot-long library table; the table was made for Charles Jennens, one of Handel's librettists, around 1750. The price of the table was the highest at the fair -- $2.8 million. It did not sell.
Americana dominated the booths of 21 dealers and accounted for many major sales. Two paintings by Edward Hicks -- a "Peaceable Kingdom" at Marguerite Riordan and "Penn's Treaty" at Hirschl & Adler Folk -- were bought for more than $1 million each. Thomas K. Woodard's prize objects -- an imposing life-size zinc elk from the 1870's, at $75,000, and a 1920's Amish quilt of brightly colored squares, at $40,000 -- were sold at the opening-night preview.
"It's been our best show to date," Mr. Woodard said. "We had no idea what to expect with the world situation. I think it proves our business is a fluke."
Mr. Arader said he sold at least four prints by John James Audubon at $15,000 to $32,000 each. "There is no question that there is a recession," he said. "Everyone wants to know what the wholesale value at auction is of what they look at."
Arie L. Kopelman, an East Side House board member who is president and chief executive officer of Chanel, said the show is due for changes. In addition to selecting a successor to Mario Buatta, who resigned as chairman this year, a system has to be set to vet each item for authenticity at next year's show.
Another top priority, Mr. Kopelman said, is to increase the amount of money raised by the Winter Antiques Show, the charity's most important vehicle for financing its activities in the South Bronx. According to East Side House, ticket sales at the show declined for the third year in a row. This year, the revenue from tickets to the previews, which were $500 and $250 each, totaled $435,000, down from $515,250 last year. Tickets for the event, at $10 each, also dipped, bringing $245,960; this compares to $268,000 in 1990.
"There will always be ups and downs," Mr. Kopelman said, "and some disagreements."

HEADLINE: Plantation Mansions on the Mississippi

BYLINE: By CAROL von PRESSENTIN WRIGHT; CAROL von PRESSENTIN WRIGHT is the author of "The Blue Guide to New York," the second edition of which will be published this spring (W. W. Norton).

 BODY:
ALONG the stretch of the Mississippi between Baton Rouge and New Orleans runs an old two-lane highway known as the River Road, until the ascendancy of the steamboat in the early 1800's an important route between the two cities and the plantations marshalled along the river. The highway, actually two roads on the two banks of the river, reflects the errant ways of the Mississippi, meandering to follow the levees, changing its name and its number as it winds past isolated villages, towering chemical plants and occasional stands of sugar cane.
Here and there flourish groves of aged live oaks, planted to shadow the manor houses of the plantations that the road originally served. Here and there remain the great mansions themselves, once the focal point of Louisiana's social and economic life. Although you can travel more swiftly on the 80 miles of Interstate between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, a trip on the River Road, which snakes for about 115 miles along a parallel route, has its own rewards. 
 On trips in August and December, I visited five major houses in two days, a good pace that allowed time for dawdling. Don't expect to travel fast: although the homeward-bound factory workers who are conversant with every dip and bend drive with intolerant haste, traffic often moves slowly. Don't expect to see the Mississippi: the levees that contain its flood waters also obscure it from sight. Occasionally you may glimpse the superstructure of a freighter looming above you, but you can see the water only by climbing the levee.
Finally, do not expect the River Road to look like an antebellum theme park, where everything is repainted every year and there is plenty of money to invest in artifice. Heavy industry has replaced the former agrarian economy; gargantuan refineries and chemical plants now stand beside the old mansions, which often seem stranded in unsympathetic environments. While the remaining antebellum homes are without exception beautiful in their forms and proportions, they are not all in good condition; some have been restored, but others seem to be barely hanging on as the economy changes around them. And yet each house has something individual to offer -- distinctive architecture, history, fine furniture, or insight into a past about which it is difficult not to feel ambivalent.
The oldest house in the lower Mississippi Valley is Destrehan, in the town of the same name, about eight miles from the New Orleans airport. Begun in 1787, Destrehan exemplifies the raised cottage or Creole style; it is a two-story house with a wide hipped roof and large shady galleries to protect against the heat, a living floor raised above ground to protect against moisture (including floods), and dormers to ventilate the attic. The Spanish in the Caribbean developed the style and transported it to Louisiana where it was supremely suited to the tribulations of the climate. A later owner updated the house with Greek Revival refinements, encasing the columns, adding the capitals, and the moldings, mantels and door surrounds that have been restored today.
The small flanking garconnieres were probably built for Jean Noel Destrehan de Beaupre, who married the granddaughter of the original builder and fathered 14 children. When the boys of a family reached adolescence, they moved from the main house to their own quarters, where they were provided with personal servants, and, sometimes, mistresses .
Destrehan's economy, based first on indigo, later on sugar cane, and finally on oil refining, epitomizes that of southern Louisiana as a whole. After serving a succession of oil companies in the 20th century, the house remained vacant for 12 years, while vandals stripped it of everything remotely portable, sparing only the one-ton marble bathtub. Today the River Road Historical Society owns Destrehan and has restored it with scholarly scrupulousness, furnishing it with handsome period antiques and replicas.
If Destrehan is the oldest, San Francisco, in Garyville, about 22 miles upriver from Destrehan, is the most decorative of the plantation manors. Begun in 1853 or 1854, it is built of plastered brick and topped off with a massive roof. Although the Greek Revival style had supplanted the Creole by 1853, the San Francisco's builder clung to the old ways for the interior floor plan, while garnishing the outside of his house with copious ornamentation and Gothic Revival windows that were right up to the minute. The house is still described as Steamboat Gothic.
The name has a French derivation; according to one story, the builder's son, Valsin Marmillion, inherited a modest house and decided to do it up right, lavishing money on the interior decoration and thus finding himself, in the vernacular of the period, sans fruscins, without a penny. A later owner corrupted the name to San Francisco.
Outside stand two cypress cisterns with fanciful copper roofs that provided running water to the end rooms of the house. While startling to some visitors, the exterior colors -- peach or ocher and cerulean blue -- are historically accurate, determined by careful scraping to the original layer of paint.
The interior is famous for its five painted ceilings and for its false marbling and false wood-graining, now carefully restored. The ceiling paintings were executed around 1860 on the cypress-board ceilings in a variety of designs -- medallions, architectural motifs, fleurs-de-lis.
Because plantations were businesses, their owners frequently treated the manor houses as parts thereof, carefully tracking expenditures and assets. The Marmillion household inventories, for example, noted the location of every piece of furniture each time the family held a significant social event; while this may suggest a mistrust of the guests, it has helped the San Francisco Foundation.
At one time, San Francisco looked at the Mississippi across an expanse of formal garden, but successive setbacks have brought the levees closer to the front door. When the plantation houses were built, each owner was responsible for the levees on his own property, a system ensuring that one's own engineering failures would wreak havoc with one's neighbors; as early as 1879 construction and maintenance of the system was assigned to the Army Corps of Engineers and the levees were standardized.

 HOUMAS House, in Burnside, about 29 miles upriver from San Francisco, was built a decade earlier and better conforms to the popular notion of the white, columned, antebellum mansion. Its unusual name harks back to the Houmas Indians, who lived here before one Alexandre Latil purchased land from them. Latil built himself a small dwelling in about 1790, while Louisiana was still under Spanish domination; later owners built the Greek Revival mansion (1840) and joined the old dwelling to it.
Just before the Civil War, the plantation grew to 20,000 acres and became the nation's premier sugar producer. Because the owner was a British subject and apparently a persuasive man, Houmas House was spared occupation by the Union forces and remained intact and profitable until the turn of the century. In 1940 Dr. George B. Crozat, a New Orleans orthodontist, bought Houmas House.
Dr. Crozat enjoyed gardens, maps and antique furniture -- especially armoires and trunks -- all of which are in evidence at Houmas House, from the four ancient live oaks and the formal gardens, to the antique maps in the upstairs hall (some of which show land grants from Louis XIV to a Monsieur Antoine Crozat), to the collection of armoires. It is not surprising that so beautiful a house should have been the setting for several movies, including "Hush Hush, Sweet Charlotte," whose star, Bette Davis, presented Dr. Crozat with a handsome chandelier for his trouble.
In far less happy condition, though of significant interest if you don't mind a certain amount of upheaval, is Ashland, also known as Belle Helene. It is situated between Darrow and Geismar, about 10 miles upriver from Houmas House. Designed by a notable New Orleans architect, James Gallier Sr., for a notable citizen, Duncan Kenner -- lawyer, statesman, cane planter, and horse breeder -- Ashland with its haunted, vacant beauty has enthralled more than one photographer and served as the site of such movies as "The Foxes of Harrow," "The Long, Hot Summer" and "Fletch Lives," where it played the decrepit plantation Chevy Chase inherits.
As this casting suggests, Ashland's beauties are largely unrestored. Outside are wide galleries on all four sides supported by a colonnade of 28 square columns that rise to a six-foot parapet concealing the pitched roof. Inside, a central hall on both the first and second floors opens onto spacious rooms. At the rear an elliptical staircase of cypress wood with a walnut balustrade ascends through the second floor and to the attic.
While no costumed guides will lead you through a series of perfectly appointed rooms, you may take a self-guided tour aided by a floor plan, wall placards and a pamphlet. You will learn that Spanish moss belongs to the pineapple family and was used to stuff mattresses and that Duncan Kenner named Ashland for Henry Clay's plantation as tribute to a man he admired. You will also discover that the second owner renamed it Belle Helene in honor of his first granddaughter, whose heirs still own the home.
If you are interested in how mansions were built, Ashland is the place to find out, since it is in the midst of a slow, privately financed restoration, its downstairs floors taken up and its foundations exposed. You can see the brick footings set 15 feet into the ground; you can see the mortar crumbling and discover that it was made of river silt, horsehair and some form of lime -- probably burnt clam shells.
If you prefer undimmed elegance and spectacular interiors, Nottoway, on the west bank of the Mississippi near the town of White Castle, will be more to your taste. (To get there you will have to cross the river, either at Baton Rouge or downstream at the Sunshine Bridge near Donaldsonville.) Built by John Hampden Randolph in 1859, Nottoway, the largest plantation house in the South, was once the centerpiece of a 7,000-acre sugar cane plantation. Randolph, who had moved to the Deep South from the Nottoway River area of Virginia, at first farmed cotton on a smaller inland plantation, but turned to sugar, a riskier but potentially more profitable crop, before he bought the acreage on which Nottoway stands.
Today Nottoway's property has been broken up and sold off, but its setting, in a flat, sparsely populated rural area, still suggests its former expanse and isolation. The house was designed by New Orleans's other great society architect, Henry Howard, in the Greek Revival and Italianate styles -- the latter the newest comer in the parade of changing fashion. Outside and in, from its large semicircular wing and 22 immense square columns, to its coal-burning fireplaces, indoor plumbing and gas lights, Nottoway manifests its owner's wealth and success and indeed Randolph seems to have been inspired by nearby Belle Grove (completed three years earlier but gutted by fire in 1952) to build a bigger and better house than his neighbor. Like other successful planters, Randolph was an exquisite record keeper and left detailed instructions as to the mansion's construction. We know, for example, that Nottoway was finished with four coats of paint, that the windows and blinds were finished in a color called Paris-Green.

 THIS attachment to detail, along with the refurnishing, makes the interior of Nottoway a special pleasure. There are 4,200 yards of plastering, with 140 feet of scroll ornaments in the parlors alone, as well as eight medallions and friezes in the parlors, the main hall and at the stair landing. The original crystal and brass chandelier hangs in the entrance hall (it cost Randolph $138).
The jewel of the house, however, is the white ballroom in the oval wing of the house, adorned with hand-carved cypress columns and ceiling medallions. The original gas fixtures and chandeliers still provide light, just as the silver pulls for the servants still hang by the fireplaces with their original white marble mantels. Randolph had eight daughters to marry off and six of them were wed in the ballroom.
Randolph died at Nottoway in 1883, successful again after devastating losses during the Civil War, leaving his wife to run the plantation, which she did for six years before finally auctioning the property. She is said to have been seen on her last day in the house moving from room to room in her black dress, closing each of its 200 windows before she left.

GUERRILLA PRINCE
The Untold Story of Fidel Castro.
By Georgie Anne Geyer.
Illustrated. 445 pp. Boston:

 Georgie Anne Geyer closes her provocative biography of Fidel Castro with a dire prediction: "Some kind of terrible striking out lay ahead -- an attack on the United States, a mass suicide within, a bitter war within the military between the generations, something rightfully commensurate with the greatness and drama of Fidel Castro." Borrowing from Wagner, she writes that unless Mr. Castro dies suddenly in his sleep, "his would be a Gotterdammerung end."
As Communism collapses around the world, and Cuba competes with North Korea for the dubious honor of being the last Stalinist state, no one can predict what Mr. Castro's future will be -- only that it will probably not be a long one. Cuba's economy is cracking, and with it Mr. Castro's mystique and popularity. A series of foreign-policy reversals has forced him to bring home his troops and advisers from Africa and Central America. Show trials involving important military figures and a sweeping shake-up of his security apparatus in 1989 suggest that Mr. Castro is not confident of his power base and that a coup is possible.
The time has come to analyze the Castro legacy, for surely he reached his peak about 10 years ago and he is now fading fast. "Guerrilla Prince" is a good beginning, but Ms. Geyer, a syndicated columnist, falls into the trap of many biographers by overestimating the importance of her subject. According to Ms. Geyer, Mr. Castro was responsible for revolutions in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia. Had it not been for him, she maintains, military dictators would not have destroyed democracy in South America's southern cone and the United States would not have invaded Grenada. And there would have been no "supernational 'drug state' " protected by Cuban-trained guerrillas.
There is a grain of truth to this argument. Mr. Castro did transform his small island nation into a world power. A beacon to two generations of third world revolutionaries, he sent 57,000 troops and military advisers to Angola and tens of thousands more to Ethiopia, South Yemen, Libya, Mozambique, Syria, Equatorial Guinea, Tanzania, Guinea-Bissau, North Korea, Algeria, Uganda -- and the list goes on. He served as a mediator between Panama's Manuel Antonio Noriega and the Medellin drug cartel, and he may even have had a hand in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. But Ms. Geyer's claim that since 1959 "wherever the United States had a watershed foreign policy crisis, Castro's formative hand could be found" is clearly overstated.
Stretching her argument leads Ms. Geyer to stretch some of her facts. The red and black colors of the Sandinista party flag were not copied from Mr. Castro's 26th of July Movement, as she claims, but were adopted from the banner of Spanish anarchism. Indeed they are the same colors Augusto Cesar Sandino flew in the 1920's and 1930's when he and his band of guerrillas challenged the United States Marines occupying Nicaragua. The matter of a flag's colors would be inconsequential if they weren't reflective of the deep roots of the Nicaraguan revolution. Nicaragua, like El Salvador and much of the rest of the third world, was in conflict long before Mr. Castro came to power.
Still, this is a book worth reading. Ms. Geyer is an experienced observer of Latin America, and the best passages of "Guerrilla Prince" portray a nuanced understanding of Cuba's political culture. She sheds her great-man theory of history long enough to describe artfully the social milieu that created the anti-Yankee dictator. Since its days as the colonial center of Spain's Caribbean domain, Cuba has long aspired to a great destiny. But Cubans were cheated on the eve of their independence from Spain by the United States, which first occupied the island and then made it a dependency for half a century. Mr. Castro's personification of Cuba's frustrated nationalism was only heightened by the fact that his father was born and grew up in the proud Spanish province of Galicia, where the Spanish-American War is still refered to as "el desastre."
Ms. Geyer is sketchy on recent developments in Cuba, but she is exhaustive in describing the tawdry details of Mr. Castro's womanizing and treachery. Much of her account is new and surprising: as a youthful rebel, Mr. Castro reportedly admired Hitler's tactics and faked at least one police beating to get attention. He furtively fed his infant son three times the recommended amount of formula to make him stronger faster. Before he succeeded in overthrowing the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, he once asked a Costa Rican labor leader he suspected of receiving Central Intelligence Agency financing how he might get on the agency's payroll. Unwilling to share the spotlight after taking power, he sent Ernesto (Che) Guevara off to Bolivia and then cut off his supplies.
Above all else, Mr. Castro hates the United States with a passion and would destroy it in a second if he could. Fortunately for Washington, his time is running out.

HEADLINE: The State of the Governor

BYLINE: By Elizabeth Kolbert; Elizabeth Kolbert is Albany bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
It is the last day of the year, and Albany, living up to its cheerless reputation, is gray and frigid. Nevertheless, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has decided to walk to his swearing-in ceremony. He marches down the hill from the State Capitol, a powerful figure in a shapeless fedora, his aides trailing behind him, hugging themselves against the cold.
In deference to the state's bare treasury, Cuomo has forsworn the traditional inauguration party, opting instead for a modest ceremony at the State Court of Appeals building. The whole exercise lasts less than 10 minutes. After it is over, Cuomo is about to plunge out into the cold again when a group of reporters blocks his way, and he stops to talk to them under the courthouse dome. 
 The scene seems, at first, much like an ordinary news conference, with the Governor in the center and a throng of reporters stretching microphones toward his lips. But for Cuomo, it is clearly something more. He is standing in the building where he began his career 35 years ago as a law clerk, and now he is about to embark on his third term in New York State's highest office. When he is asked to reflect on the challenges facing him as the state goes through a dizzying financial decline, his tone is elegiac.
"This state has overcome fire and floods and depression and wars, always bringing us to a higher ground," he says. "Sixty years ago this state showed the whole nation the way out of the Depression. So if you remember your history and if you remember the people who came before you, it gets a little easier to look forward to the challenges you have to face."
Cuomo is not a man to draw casually on history, and so this answer, like so many of his remarks, invites speculation. "If you remember the people who came before you. . . ." Are these people like Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt, whom historians consider to have been unexceptional governors, but who went on to be great Presidents? Or are they people like Alfred E. Smith and Thomas E. Dewey, who imposed their vision on New York State but then lost their bids for higher office?
Since the day of his first inauguration, Cuomo has seemed destined to make his mark according to one of these two models. His tremendous eloquence made him almost immediately a national figure, and within two years of becoming Governor, he was invested with the aura of a potential President. At home in New York, he enjoyed an equally exalted stature -- his political sovereignty uncontested, his popularity unmatched.
But now, after eight years in office, Cuomo's destiny no longer seems so clear, and his relation to his predecessors has a poignant, almost morbid quality. As he begins his third term, Cuomo, the "Hamlet" of American politics, seems oddly suspended at the edge of history.

CUOMO'S UNEASY RELATIONSHIP TO higher office has been well documented by a national press corps that has tracked his moves with open fascination. When the Governor has traveled around the nation denouncing the Republican administration in Washington, reporters have happily spied signs of a nascent campaign. When he has drawn back, there has been speculation about secreted skeletons and weak knees.
Far less attention has been devoted to the equally curious record of Cuomo's governorship. But it is a record that reveals many of the same themes: an unusual set of opportunities, a mysterious hesitancy to seize them and a genius for confounding popular expectations.
Some of these opportunities have been created by Cuomo himself; others have been handed to him by good fortune. When Cuomo took office in January 1983, the state was in the final stages of one of its periodic fiscal emergencies. Within a year, however, there were clear signs of economic improvement, and as the 1980's wore on, the recovery turned into a boom. Personal income rose at a startling rate, and state revenues grew apace. In the first five years of the Cuomo administration, the state budget, in constant dollars, increased by almost 20 percent.
For the Governor, this rare economic windfall was matched by unusual political security. Throughout his tenure, Cuomo has maintained phenomenally high ratings in the polls, and in 1986, he was re-elected by the largest majority in New York State history. In contrast to Cuomo's robustness, New York's Republican Party has for more than a decade been slowly dying of internal injuries. Last year, the party could barely even muster a gubernatorial candidate; at least 19 Republicans turned down the nomination before Pierre A. Rinfret, an economist and political oddball, finally agreed to take Cuomo on. Politically bedridden, the Republicans have allowed Cuomo to monopolize media attention in the state while raising only a quavering voice in opposition.
Presiding over a time of affluence and lacking a serious rival, Cuomo was well positioned to confront a new generation of needs that accompanied the lavish economic growth of the mid-1980's: AIDS, crack, homelessness. So devastating were these problems that they seemed to demand responses more inventive, and more risky, than traditional government solutions.
Yet Cuomo's response to these problems has been largely incremental, largely business as usual. He has failed to draw on his immense popularity to make New York a leader in new and experimental programs, nor has he undertaken the kind of ambitious capital projects that characterized the administration of Nelson A. Rockefeller in the 60's. Instead, he has chosen to build cautiously on what was already in place, acting as a conservator of the state's extensive network of social services and its aging infrastructure.
"You have a state that's a perfect laboratory to do something visionary," says Russell Sykes, a senior policy associate with the State Communities Aid Association, a nonprofit advocacy group. "But we have just been taking baby steps."
In the late 1980's and now the early 1990's, New York's economy has been contracting almost as fast as it had earlier expanded, presenting Cuomo with a new opportunity to leave his stamp on the state. Tax collections in New York, as in most Northeastern states, have been dropping precipitously over the last few years, leaving gaping holes between the cost of existing programs and the sum of existing taxes. The impetus for re-examination and reorganization of government services in the state has rarely been greater.
But Cuomo's response to the contraction has been as modulated and circumspect as his response to the years of growth. When money was plentiful, Cuomo distributed it generously and evenhandedly, increasing spending on liberal-minded social programs like welfare, and also on more conservative, law-and-order programs like prison construction. Then he cut income-tax rates and took steps to reduce the state's chronic borrowing.
Now with revenues
shrinking, Cuomo is meting out the pain just as broadly. He has cut programs for the poor, like Medicaid, and programs for the middle class, like aid to private colleges. He has raised a battery of taxes and then, for good measure, he has raided reserve funds and racked up record deficits.
Perhaps as a result of Cuomo's guarded handling of the state's purse strings, New York has managed to maintain a sense of equanimity in the face of hard times, while many of its neighbors, like New Jersey and Massachusetts, have fallen to bitter squabbling. Cuomo himself has remained remarkably popular despite the pains of retrenchment, and in a period when other governors have been felled, he is still standing. He has retained his power, but some would ask: for what?
"He's holding his political capital tight to him," says Eve Brooks, executive director of Statewide Youth Advocacy, a nonprofit group that keeps a watchful eye on Cuomo. "He's trying to speak to a lot of constituencies and create as few enemies as possible. But the question is, where is he going with all this?"

FOR HIS ENTIRE tenure as Governor, Cuomo has had to cope with a divided State Legislature: Democrats in the Assembly, Republicans in the Senate. To hear Cuomo tell it, this one fact explains most of the limitations attributed to his record. If he has not been as daring as some would have liked, the Republican Senate is to blame. " 'The Senate wouldn't do it,' " says Richard C. Wade, a professor of urban history at the City University of New York and a longtime Cuomo associate. "That's his first response to everything."
That the divided Legislature is an impediment to innovation in New York is indisputable. Indeed, many officials in Albany would argue that the sole aim of the Republican Senate is to gum up the gears of state government. But there are many who argue that Cuomo, too, is responsible for the standstill.
Cuomo has always spoken ardently of his desire to win control of the State Senate for the Democrats. But his actions on behalf of Democratic candidates have often seemed to fall short of such passion. In 1986, for example, a year when many Republican seats seemed vulnerable, Cuomo's efforts were so anemic that many in his own party accused him of bad faith. In 1990, the Democrats' last chance to seize the Senate before redistricting, Cuomo played a more active role in the campaign. But when it came to contributing money from his own swollen campaign treasury, he held back, saying the money had not been donated for him to give away.
When it comes to pushing legislation through the Republican Senate, Cuomo's efforts have been similarly tentative. As anyone who has dealt with the State Legislature knows, it is not enough to lay out your case for a bill and then hope for the best. You have to exert constant pressure, to wheedle and threaten and then, finally, make deals. You have to be willing to take risks and alienate some of your supporters to achieve your objectives. This Cuomo has rarely done.
At the start of the year, when he unveils his legislative agenda, Cuomo resubmits the same bills that the Senate rejected the year before: legislation to redistribute school aid, to overhaul the state's election laws, to introduce a system of public campaign financing. Each year, he proclaims that this year will be different. The tide has turned, he proclaims, a new day is dawning, the bills will finally pass. But by the time the Legislature recesses in July, these bills have, once again, been unceremoniously killed off.

THE GOVERNOR LAYS out his agenda each year in the State of the State Message, presented to a joint session of the Legislature in early January. The message outlines the Governor's hopes and aspirations for the coming year. In 1982, the last year of Gov. Hugh L. Carey's administration, the State of the State Message ran to 24 pages. By 1986, the message had grown to 137 pages, reaching a high of 178 pages last year before dropping back to 121 pages last month.
The expanding State of the State Message is a remarkably apt illustration of Cuomo's style of leadership. Enlarged almost every year, the message has become a statement of inclusivity. Like the Governor's mythic "family of New York," which is supposed to enfold all groups, the elastic State of the State insures that no one will feel left out. But while the appeal of the message has been broadened, its effectiveness as a statement of the Governor's aims has been dissipated. By the hundredth page, it becomes almost impossible to figure out which of the proposals represent serious policy goals and which are merely wishes that will dissolve on contact with the brutal realities of politics.
Even when pressed on the matter, Cuomo shies away from laying out clear priorities. Shortly after Cuomo delivered one of his State of the State Messages, his staff, responding to reporters' calls on the subject, tried to come up with a list of the Governor's top 10 goals for the year. But the task proved too daunting; the Governor's staff could not limit its priorities to just 10. "Under No. 1," a former aide to the Governor recalls, "there was 1a, 1b, 1c."
Cuomo entered politics through the side door, first attracting attention as a negotiator in a vicious battle over low-income housing in Forest Hills, Queens. It is a role that he has never entirely abandoned. Assailed by interest groups on all sides, Cuomo often portrays himself as the referee in the great game of government. If one group is unhappy with a call this time, next time it will be the other group. All of the groups have a claim on his attention, and none of them particularly deserve to win.
"One of the failures of our politics is that it has been simplistic," Cuomo said in a recent interview. "So when you have a struggle over the air in the city of New York and it comes down to environment versus economic development, the politicians more often than not will choose one of the sides, and one will be an environmentalist who says, 'The clean air is more important than the jobs,' and the other will be an economic development person who says, 'No, the jobs in the Hudson Valley are more important than the trees,' and both are wrong. Trees are important and the economic development is important."
Cuomo dismisses the idea that his inclusive style of government has liabilities. The press corps's demands for clear priorities is, he charges, simply self-serving. "Reporters have to summarize you at one point," he said. "They have to define you and it's easier if you're in one area and they can call you 'the Education Governor' or the person who failed to be the Education Governor." As far as Cuomo is concerned, it seems, the only result of having no well-defined priorities is that his public relations are not as good as they might be. "We have a very long list of accomplishments that I think have not been properly noted, because I have never focused on just one issue," he said.
But others see more serious consequences flowing from the absence of priorities. They look at state government, with its tricky politics and its bureaucratic inertia and its many competing interests, and they say coaxing this vast machinery to accomplish anything substantial requires a crystalline goal and a steely single-mindedness.
"The political system doesn't have the capacity to address a lot of important issues simultaneously," says Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science at the State University of New York at New Paltz who is active in Republican politics. "What is necessary is to make a dramatic commitment to something and to focus the energy. You have to choose something and be measured by it."
The costs and the benefits of Cuomo's style are clear from his handling of virtually every major issue of the last eight years. Take, for example, the state's fiscal problems, which first emerged in the spring of 1988. Almost immediately, financial analysts urged Cuomo to make systematic, long-term spending cuts to prepare for even harder times to come. But the Governor, hesitant to antagonize the municipal governments, school districts and other vast constituencies that depend on state dollars, demurred. Instead, he made temporary cuts that left the long-term problems unaddressed. Then he dipped into reserve funds and allowed the state to spend its way into enormous deficits.
It was not until late last year, with a national recession well under way and half the states in the country awash in red ink, that the Governor proposed the kind of budget cuts that others around the state had called for from the start. (Late last month the Governor proposed an additional $4.5 billion in spending cuts.) The price of waiting was high: New York's credit rating dropped to its lowest level ever and became the third-lowest of any state in the nation after Massachusetts and Louisiana. But by waiting, the Governor effectively minimized opposition to the cuts: the problems had become so enormous that the cuts were unavoidable, and everyone, liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat, acknowledged it.
This tactic -- delaying until a consensus finally presents itself -- is typical of the Governor's response to controversy. While other governors, like Jim Florio of New Jersey, simply try to overpower their opponents, Cuomo attempts to win them over, no matter what the cost. "What he really likes to do," Wade says, "is defang the opposition."
One of the Governor's favorite strategies for "defanging" his opponents is to appoint a commission to advise him on a controversial issue. At their best, these commissions provide a forum for all sides to vent their anger, and they lay the groundwork for compromise. But too often, critics of the Governor complain, the commissions become a substitute for doing anything at all.
Such was the case with the Governor's commission on the Adirondack Park, a collection of private and public lands that together make up the largest wilderness area east of the Mississippi. Under heavy pressure from environmentalists, Cuomo appointed a commission in early 1989 to suggest ways to preserve the park from what he called "an era of unbridled land speculation and unwarranted development." Last May, the commission issued a set of sweeping recommendations, including a yearlong moratorium on new construc-tion in the park and permanent changes in its zoning. Adirondack residents, wary about the impact of the proposals on the local economy, tied up traffic in Albany in protest. Cuomo not only backed away from the recommendations, but even questioned the very premise on which the commission had been founded.
"I didn't assume the park was in trouble," he said. "I said I wanted to know if the park was in trouble." To pacify those who lived in the park, Cuomo turned to a second group, which recommended ways to water down the original commission's plan. It is now two years since the initial commission was appointed, and nothing has been done.
CUOMO IS extremely sensitive to charges that he has not imposed a clear vision on the state or lived up to the high standards of achievement set by some of his predecessors. Such criticism, he claims, is an unfortunate consequence of speaking up for what he believes.
Nearly seven years ago, Cuomo delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. The speech, a ringing condemnation of the Reagan era, not only transformed Cuomo, then a new and relatively untested Governor, into a national figure; it furnished him with what seems to be a perpetual spot on the list of potential Democratic Presidential candidates. Now, Cuomo claims, he regrets ever having made the speech. "Frankly," he says, "I'm sorry I went."
The 1984 keynote address, Cuomo asserts, made him the target of a terrible form of injustice, which he has labeled the "dumb blonde syndrome." Like the proverbial "dumb blonde," the Governor says, he is the victim of an insidious prejudice that works like this: if she's beautiful, she can't type; if he gives great speeches, he must be a lousy Governor. "I think once I made a speech at the keynote that was well received, that became a problem for us," he says. People began to criticize his record, according to Cuomo, saying that it fell short of the rhetoric. "They said, 'See, he gives a speech, what else can he do?' "
Cuomo certainly is right about being treated more critically than your run-of-the-mill Governor. What he seems unwilling to accept is that such criticism follows inevitably from his position as a national leader and potential President. Or it may be that he chooses not to realize it to make a point.
Treating criticism as a fault of the critic is one of Cuomo's favorite tactics. It puts the critic on the defensive ("Gosh, I didn't realize I was prejudiced against great orators"), and it blurs the issue under debate. But the tactic has been only half-effective: Cuomo continues to feel harassed by criticism of his record -- and to take offense at such criticism. When pressed on the issue, Cuomo can become defensive, measuring himself against some of his more illustrious predecessors -- Dewey, for example, or Rockefeller -- and suggesting that they have been overrated. (Dewey is credited with building the state's thruway, Rockefeller the state university system.)
"If I had wanted to be the guy with the edifice complex and never mentioned children and never mentioned prisons and never mentioned the environment, I could have talked only about the state university building I've rebuilt and the roads and bridges I've rebuilt," Cuomo said in an interview last year about his record. "Fifty billion dollars worth. You look it up. Where in the Rockefeller years did they do that much in eight years? Dewey didn't do that much."
To further confound his critics, Cuomo has recently taken to chronicling his accomplishments in long, encyclopedic lists. These lists include everything from the significant -- "unprecedented prison expansion" (Cuomo has presided over the largest prison construction program in state history) -- to the justifiably obscure -- "Quebec license reciprocity."
The irony of these lists is that Cuomo rarely takes credit for what is perhaps his greatest accomplishment. When he became Governor, Cuomo inherited a state that was already a hothouse for urban problems: crime, drugs, relentless poverty. During his administration, these problems have grown dramatically. Crack arrived and decimated whole neighborhoods. AIDS exacted a ravaging toll. Reagonomics helped push the state's vast legions of poor further into misfortune.
Much of Cuomo's energies over the last eight years have been devoted to preserving the fabric of New York society in the face of these new threats, a task that has not been easy. AIDS and crack strained the state's safety net; racial tensions grew; the gulf between rich and poor widened. Yet at a time when, in Washington, government was being portrayed as the problem, Cuomo maintained in New York that government was part of the solution.
This message is perhaps Cuomo's greatest legacy to New York State. In a period when the social contract seemed constantly threatened with annulment, Cuomo continued to press for a society in which everyone had a stake and no one was abandoned. He set the tone for the state. When it was easy to sow division, he preached caring and compassion. This achievement is more abstract than most that history records. It is a rhetorical victory, but nonetheless one with real consequences.
Mel Miller, the State Assembly Speaker, is, next to the Governor, the most powerful Democrat in New York. Miller has often battled with Cuomo, but he expresses a grudging respect for him and his ability to sustain a benevolent vision of government in troubled times.
"Cuomo has a traditional Democratic viewpoint that the basic role of government is to help people who need help," Miller says. "His real talent is that he can articulate these issues in a 1990's way. At a time when a lot of people have started to walk from this, he has said that New York is still committed to its progressive tradition, even though times have changed, and this has created a kind of hopefulness."
WHEN CUOMO TOOK office in 1983, he did away with the standard pyramidal model of executive authority and replaced it with a more egalitarian wheel. "I want myself in the center of the wheel," he said, "and a lot of spokes out to the agencies."
The metaphor was a good one for a state government as vast and far-flung as New York's. It stressed co-operation over hierarchy, and it suggested that Cuomo would grant his commissioners the automony to exercise their own judgment. But as anyone who has ever had sustained dealings with the Cuomo administration will attest, the reality has never lived up to the metaphor. In the Cuomo administration, "there are no real players," one former administration official says. "There's just him."
Under Cuomo, power has been consolidated to an almost unprecedented extent in the executive offices on the second floor of the State Capitol. No major decision is made by the head of a state agency without Cuomo's clearance, and even many mid-level decisions must await the approval of the Governor or one of his top staff members, a group referred to collectively as "the second floor."
This is a narrow circle, one totally under the Governor's control. Most of its members are able and committed public servants, but their ability to stand up to someone of Cuomo's stature and temperament is limited. Perhaps the highest compliment that can be paid in Albany is to say of a Cuomo staff member: "He argues with the Governor."
One of the few administration officials with enough clout to wrangle with Cuomo -- and to speak for him -- is Gerald C. Crotty, the Secretary to the Governor, who functions as a chief of staff. Evan A. Davis, until recently Cuomo's counsel, was viewed in Albany as a talented and thoughtful lawyer, but in discussions with the Legislature he was perceived as little more than a mouthpiece for the Governor's position. Many of those who have left the administration over the years look back at the 16-hour days they worked for the Governor and question whether he ever took notice of all the effort they put in.
To call Cuomo a "hands on" manager is to grossly understate his role in running state government. Cuomo is his own chief negotiator (in a recent fight with the state's public-employee unions, he went head to head directly with the union leaders), and he often serves as his own press secretary (he has been known to talk on the telephone with the same reporter two or three times in one day). He calls his aides dozens of times to remind them about one thing or another and asks: "How come I'm the only one who's thinking of these things?"
Cuomo is not fond of internal dissent, and that which exists in his administration is kept under wraps. Criticism emanating from officials outside the administration is harder to silence, but Cuomo is not averse to trying. Recently, for instance, a reporter from Time magazine confronted him with a disparaging remark attributed to Assembly Speaker Miller. With the reporter in his office, Cuomo phoned the Speaker and asked him point-blank if he had made the remark, which pointed to a gulf between the Governor's rhetoric and his performance. (Miller reluctantly had to acknowledge that he had.) On days when critical comments appear in the press, legislators, lobbyists and civic leaders have all come to expect threatening phone calls from the second floor.
The contrast between Cuomo's domineering, closed-off style and his open, expansive vision of government is one of the great contradictions of his administration. There is the public Cuomo, pushing a family style of politics that is embracing and compassionate, and then there is Cuomo in private, isolated and unforgiving.
It is the contradictions of his tenure -- the record vs. the rhetoric, the politics vs. the personality -- that have left Cuomo, after eight years in New York State's most visible office, still with an aura of mystery about him. Attempts to categorize him become entangled in his own internal conflicts, and even those who have watched Cuomo over many years can only shake their heads and conclude that nothing about him is simple or straightforward.
As Governor of New York and the leader of the state's Democratic Party, Cuomo is frequently asked to comment on the political implications of a particular event -- an election, a demonstration, an indictment. Just as frequently, he declines. "I'm not good at politics," he says, shaking his head regretfully. "It's not my strength."
This is the not the kind of ordinary prevarication that politicians often use to duck tough questions; it is a grandiose lie so patently false that it can hardly even be considered deceitful. Cuomo is a master at such magnificent deceptions. His response to the most direct question is usually not an answer, it is more a form of entertainment, a kind of performance art for the press.
OVER THE LAST FEW months, the speculation about a Cuomo candidacy has been resurrected, providing the Governor once again with a national audience for his circumlocutions. The war in the Persian Gulf has called attention to the Governor's major Presidential weakness -- his inexperience in foreign affairs -- and remarks Cuomo made in the fall advocating a negotiated settlement to the conflict struck some experts as dangerously naive. But the war has also created new vulnerabilities for President Bush and made a Cuomo candidacy seem, under certain circumstances, that much more plausible.
Cuomo has been playing the part of the candidate-in-spite-of-himself with characteristic elan. In a recent interview with the author William Kennedy, a friend of his, Cuomo said he couldn't rule out the Presidency even if he wanted to, and he didn't want to: "If I did say convincingly that under no circumstances would I ever run, that would be so unreasonable a position that people would say, 'There must be something in his closet.' Now I wouldn't mind if they said it was a 28-year-old blonde, but they don't say that. They say, 'His uncle is Mafia.' "
Cuomo is acutely sensitive to the peculiar slights suffered by Italian-Americans in public life; indeed, there are few politicians who take their ethical standing more seriously than he does. Cuomo and his wife, Matilda, attend church every Sunday morning, and, according to one of the ushers, the Governor always deposits a $10 bill in the collection basket. The Governor speaks reverentially -- and often -- about the homespun virtues that his immigrant parents, Andrea and Immaculata, taught him behind the counter of their Queens grocery store.
Nothing, in fact, infuriates Cuomo more than the suggestion that there is a chink in his integrity, or that of his family. Last year, for example, several newspapers reported that the Governor's youngest daughter, Madeline, had been tooling around -- and had managed to get into a car accident -- with a lapsed driver's license. The Governor's ire was so all-encompassing that even reporters who had not covered the story were told that he would not be answering their phone calls for a few days.
To Cuomo's credit, and immense satisfaction, little damaging evidence about his personal dealings has ever been discovered, despite the best efforts of many in the press. As Cuomo likes to point out, a team of Newsday reporters once spent several months trying to uncover corruption in his administration, poring over state contracts and expense records and conducting lengthy interrogations of his aides. The team came up essentially empty-handed. Reporters who investigated rumors about Mafia connections in the Governor's family were similarly disappointed.
These repeated failures have diminished one mystery only to open up another. Cuomo's Presidential hesitancy does not, it seems, have the easy logic of Gothic concealment. Like the disparity between his public vision of government and his private style, Cuomo's relation to the Presidency appears to be wrapped in some strangely personal enigma.
As Cuomo himself notes, enigmas are usually effaced by history, which is remorseless in its demand for decisiveness. Thus, history portrays great leaders as unwavering in their pursuits, when, on closer look, one finds that many were consumed by doubt.
Cuomo is eloquent when he describes his heroes, men like Abraham Lincoln and St. Thomas More, who at the crucial moment, he says, were forced by events to transcend their uncertainties: "One of the reasons I enjoy knowing Lincoln and Thomas More is that they were both terribly human, even to the point of suffering fits of ambiguity, ambivalence. Lincoln on the subject of slavery was often perceived as less than totally committed to the idea of the destruction of slavery in this nation. Indeed, he was perfectly prepared to allow it to continue in parts of the U.S., as we all know.
"The thing about Lincoln and More that makes them appealing to other human beings is that they are like all human beings, capable of not being totally lucid, totally clear, totally in control intellectually of their position on a given issue at all times. Sometimes it evolves, sometimes they slip and slide, sometimes they go sideways."
As 1992 draws close, and as New York enters a time of crisis, it may be that Cuomo will encounter events that will force him to resolve his own ambivalences -- and take his place in history. Or it may be that he won't. Events may prove too kind to him, or too cruel.

HEADLINE: BROWN U. RECEIVES GIFT OF $25 MILLION

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Thomas J. Watson Jr., the 77-year-old chairman emeritus of the International Business Machines Corporation and former United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union, gave $25 million yesterday to Brown University, where a dean once told him, "It doesn't look promising for you in college."
The gift, $10 million in cash and the rest in bequests, is the largest contribution in the 227-year history of the Providence, R.I., university. 
 Vartan Gregorian, the president of Brown, said that to acknowledge Mr. Watson's generosity and his 45-year involvement with the university, during which he has served as trustee, adviser and vice chancellor, the Brown Corporation voted yesterday to rename the university's Institute for International Studies the Thomas J. Watson Jr. Institute for International Studies.
The institute was established in 1986 and consists of 13 affiliated centers and programs, including the Center for Foreign Policy Development, which researches ways to improve relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.
 
A Most Generous Donor

Mr. Watson, who graduated from Brown in 1937, has been the university's most generous donor.
His first contribution to Brown was $750 in 1946, when he was named a trustee, Mr. Watson said in a telephone interview Friday from his office at I.B.M.'s headquarters in Armonk, N.Y.
His donations have continued and grown since then and, with this latest gift, now total more than $42 million.
"The reason for this gift is that they're having a major drive," Mr. Watson said. "I have great respect for the new man, Gregorian. I thought he deserved a good start."
 
$500 Million Endowment Drive

Dr. Gregorian, who headed the New York Public Library from 1981 to 1988, when he took over at Brown, said the $25 million gift would help start a campaign to raise as much as $500 million for the university's endowment.
That would more than double Brown's current endowment, estimated at $400 million. The university's endowment fund is the smallest of any of the eight colleges or universities in the Ivy League.
The endowment at Yale University, for example, is $2.3 billion. Yale has nearly 11,000 graduate and undergraduate students, as against Brown's total enrollment of 7,000. Harvard, with a total enrollment of about 18,000, has the largest endowment in the Ivy League, and in the nation, with $5 billion.
The size of its endowment means Brown faces more difficulties than other similar institutions in this time of rising costs. Other universities can rely on substantial interest income from their endowments to balance their budgets; Brown must generate most of its revenue through tuition and fees.
 
$2.7 Million Budget Deficit

The cost of an undergraduate year at Brown, including tuition, room and board, and fees, is slightly more than $20,000.
Dr. Gregorian said the university faces a $2.7 million budget deficit this year. So far, he has applied $1.3 million from the president's contingency fund toward the deficit and has imposed a hiring freeze that is expected to result in savings of up to $900,000. The remaining $500,000 will come from cuts in funds for nonacademic areas, he said.
"Private sector higher education cannot survive without enlightened support from civic leaders such as Tom Watson," Dr. Gregorian said.
Mr. Watson, the son of a founder of I.B.M., ran the company from 1956 to 1971. In his memoirs, "Father, Son & Co." (Bantam), published last year, he describes four years at Brown unfettered by the rigors of academic life or the economic hardships of the Depression.
"At Brown, I spent so much time flying airplanes and fooling around that I barely graduated," he wrote in the book's introduction.
After his first semester he was upbraided by Samuel T. Arnold, the dean of undergraduates. For the remainder of Mr. Watson's college career Dean Arnold continued to both reprimand and encourage him.
"In his wise old way he would say, 'You've got to do less of this and more of that,' " Mr. Watson said. "My getting through Brown was due as much to Dean Arnold as anyone else."
In memory of the dean, Mr. Watson has financed a program of Arnold Fellowships, which support students who are studying abroad.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE BASKETBALL;
All Paths Led to Las Vegas

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev.

 BODY:
Larry Johnson stood in a parking lot outside the Thomas and Mack Center where an hour before he scored 23 points to lead Nevada-Las Vegas to another lopsided victory. This time it was by 40 points over Fresno State.
In the chilly night desert air, away from the glare of cameras and crowded interview rooms, Johnson reflected on the circuitous path that had brought him from an area in south Dallas he once called "the baddest part of town you ever saw," to Odessa College in Texas to Las Vegas.
 
 Had someone told him when he was 13 years old that 9 years later he would be the star player on a national championship team, and that he would be projected as a lottery pick in the National Basketball Association's draft and that he would be graduating with a degree in communications, Johnson said he wouldn't have believed it.
"Did you ever watch the movie 'A Raisin in the Sun?' " he asked referring to the 1961 adaptation of Lorraine Hansberry's play about a black family living in cramped quarters on the South Side of Chicago. The movie centered on the struggle of a mother to keep her family together in the face of economic hardship and social pressures.
 "That lady was my mom, she was the spitting image of my mom," Johnson said. "I saw that movie a couple weeks ago in Santa Barbara at 3:30 in the morning. I went and got on a pay phone and called my mama. I ask her about stuff like that: 'When I was 12, 13, did you ever think I'd be in this position?' "
"I usually tell him no, I didn't think so," Dortha Johnson said. "That's what makes me so proud of him. All of a sudden he decided he wanted something, and straightened up and tried to get it."
 The paths that have carried Johnson's teammates to Las Vegas have been equally oblique. Two of the six players in the starting rotation -- Greg Anthony and Elmore Spencer -- began their careers at four-year colleges. Johnson and George Ackles attended junior college, and Stacey Augmon and Anderson Hunt came directly from high school.
 They have come here from Pasadena, Calif.; Manteo, N.C.; Detroit, Atlanta and Portland to form what some think -- pending the outcome of this afternoon's game with Arkansas -- may be one of the best college basketball teams in the last 15 years.
 It is also one of the most controversial because of its image as an outlaw school and its battles with the National Collegiate Athletic Association over the last decade. It is currently on probation for violations in the program.
The players, however, view themselves and their program in a more positive light.
"Coach Tarkanian has brought in hardworking, blue-collar type players," said Spencer, the 6-foot-10-inch junior from Atlanta. "Not your prima donnas, not your all athletic, naturally gifted athletes. Inner-city kids with problems who have struggled. There have been success stories to come out of this program: people who have gotten their degrees, and there have been successful stories with people who haven't gotten their degrees.
"When things go well on campus, on the court, little things like N.C.A.A. probation, illegal recruitment, illegal payment, all of that stuff seems trivial because the things that are bringing me joy don't even apply to the N.C.A.A. rules."
In many ways, who they are and where they come from helps explain their amazing success through hard work and making the most of an opportunity and overcoming adversity to achieve a common goal. Here's a closer look at the men of U.N.L.V.
 
LARRY JOHNSON, 6-7 forward

"I play basketball because I like it, but the most important thing I want to do is help my family," he said. "I get $700 a month for a scholarship check. I'm living good. The thing I'm worrying about is my family living good. No more working for my mom or my aunt.
 "When I was 15, 16, it was all about having fun and trying to survive in my neighborhood, day to day. I used to run the streets, my mom used to be crying all the time, coming to get me out of the police station all the time. Sports took me off the street."
After his junior year in high school, his mother hand-delivered him to Skyline, the largest high school in Dallas, and entrusted him to Coach J. D. Mayo. Mayo said that Johnson was "rough around the edges, like most 14-year-olds. But he was one of the most incredibly focused young people I'd ever met. He'd take one thing and work on it and work on it until he got it right. People don't realize it, but Larry was an overachiever."
Although Johnson, an all-American, promised that he would stay in school after leading the Runnin' Rebels to their first national championship last April, a number of people were surprised when he did return.
"One of my goals is to get my degree, get my education and stay healthy," he said. "I'm trying to please my family, keep my mom happy, make sure she's proud of me. I just don't want to do anything to make my team look bad, make me look bad, make my family look bad."
 
STACEY AUGMON, 6-8 forward
 While Pasadena is only 280 miles from Las Vegas, those who knew Augmon as a gangly, introverted 14-year-old say he has traveled as far as any of his teammates to reach this point in his life.
 "Basketball has opened doors for Stacey that he would not have even come close to, much less gone through," said Eddie Newman, an assistant principal at Muir High School who has known Augmon since his freshman year there. "He was a nice, quiet, even-tempered young man. He wasn't strong academically when he came in, but he got through because he worked hard and he listened."
Augmon was raised in northwest Pasadena, a predominantly black, poor section. "Coming up, I was very shy, I stayed at home a lot because of my shyness," he said. Augmon was raised by his mother, but he credits his older sister, his oldest brother and basketball with keeping him from getting caught up in neighborhood street life.
"It's really unbelievable the success I've had on this team," Augmon said. "I would have never thought that this would have happened when I came to college."
 
GREG ANTHONY, 6-1 guard
 Anthony is the antithesis of the world-class athlete: bright, politically active, socially conscious. He is vice chairman of the Young Republicans of Nevada, has his real-estate license and owns his own company. He interned in 1989 in the Washington office of Representative Barbara Vucanovich and served as an aide at the World Economic Summit in Houston last summer.
Yet, in a more fundamental way, Anthony is a hungry athlete who is driven to succeed by a fear of failing and falling back into the directionless life of North Las Vegas.
 The search for something new and different is what took Anthony from Rancho High in Las Vegas to the University of Portland. He played shooting guard and earned freshman-of-the-year honors. But he knew he would never receive visibility and publicity there, so he transferred to U.N.L.V.
"I think there's too much emphasis on just getting that piece of paper, instead of enhancing the person as an individual, instead of learning more about life, which is what the college environment should be all about," he said.
 
GEORGE ACKLES, 6-11 center
 "I thought I'd be working right now, doing a 9-to-5 job," said Ackles. "I never thought I'd be able to play basketball, to tell you the truth, because I didn't start playing until my junior year in high school."
The summer that Ackles turned 15 his mother moved him and his twin sisters from a Pittsburgh suburb to Virginia, where she had found work as a cook at the Calvary Pentecostal Camp. Not only did Ackles not share his mother's religious commitment, he was somewhat miffed that just when he was developing a feel for basketball she moved to a place where the game wasn't played. When Ackles made friends with someone from Manteo, N.C., he convinced his mother that Manteo was where he needed to be.
 "I cried for two days after he left," Marva Ackles said. "It's hard to cut those apron strings, but I knew if I didn't let him go, he'd rebel."
 Ackles played two seasons at Manteo High School and then shocked his mother again by announcing that he was going to Garden City Community College in Kansas.
 At U.N.L.V., Ackles started in 1988-89 season and set a school single-season record for blocks with 64. He suffered a broken wrist the following summer and sat out as the Rebels won the national championship.
 
ANDERSON HUNT, 6-1 1/2 guard
 Although he's the youngest starter, Hunt is probably the oldest and truest Rebel at heart. In fact, he knew as early as his freshman year at Southwestern High School in Detroit that he wanted to come to U.N.L.V. Hunt grew up as the youngest of three children in a stable, working-class neighborhood. His father died when he was 9. That was the last major trauma until his senior year in high school when Southwestern, with a 27-1 record, was upset in the championship game.
Then Hunt took the Scholastic Aptitude Test a day after his senior prom and failed to make the 700 score to be eligible to play as a freshman. Meanwhile, all of his Detroit buddies played. "Seeing Mark Macon play and Doug Smith, Steve Smith all having great freshman years, that hurt a lot," he said. "But I bounced back and studied harder and I'm here today."
When U.N.L.V. played Duke for the national title, Hunt made 12 of 16 shots, had 30 points and was the most valuable player of the Final Four.
 
ELMORE SPENCER, 7-0 center
 Elmore Spencer grew to be 6-10 by his senior year when he led Washington High School in Atlanta to the state title and an impressive victory over Skyline, led by Larry Johnson.
 During the previous summer, his mother suffered a fatal heart attack while talking on the phone to a college recruiter. Suddenly it was Spencer and his younger sister.
 "As soon as she died it was an abrupt maturation process, overnight," he said. "I know that I could still have humor and live a happy life, but I also knew that when she died I was a young man with responsibilities."
 Spencer made a commitment to attend Georgia, but the summer before he was to report he was diagnosed as being manic depressive and spent 36 days in the psychiatric ward of a hospital. He enrolled at Georgia sat out the first year, played the following year but then suffered a broken foot. Spencer enrolled at Connors State Junior College in Warner, Okla.
Spencer, who is married, said he had found peace in the desert. "I'm content," he said. "I'm happy with my classes here. The teachers are very coperative. Athletically I play with a group of ballplayers who love each other, love playing the game at a fast pace. We jive well off the court, we help each other in time of need. It probably exceeded my expectations."

HEADLINE: Businesses' Enthusiasm For the State Said to Drop

BYLINE: By BARBARA STURKEN

 BODY:
AFTER a decadelong boom in the state's economy, New Jersey's business associations say they are detecting a new streak of pessimism in the private sector. Although the economic picture is generally bleak throughout the nation, some businesses say that conditions in New Jersey are worse than in other states, prompting them to reassess their commitment to remaining here.
What seems to worry many business leaders is the growing perception that New Jersey is not a good place to do business anymore, and that this perception in itself could drive companies away. And while state officials argue that this view is not supported by any hard evidence, several recent polls of businesses have revealed a sharp increase in dissatisfaction with their treatment by the state. 
 "The bloom is off the rose," said Elissa McCrary, vice president for communications of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, which surveys its 13,000 members at least once a year.
In a recent poll, which drew the most negative results in years, she said, 71 percent of the 3,100 companies responding said that conditions were worse in New Jersey than in the rest of the nation, up from only 27 percent a year ago. The state did not fare any better in another survey, by the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce and Price Waterhouse, which found that 87 percent of the 500 companies polled thought that actions by the state's government would hurt their business over the next five years. Some critics argue that New Jersey is already losing its competitive edge, pointing to the decision by several large employers to leave the state.
Maxwell House, a division of Kraft General Foods, for example, is planning to close its Hoboken plant and transfer some of its operations to Jacksonville, Fla., a move that affects 600 jobs. The company avoided any direct criticism of New Jersey in its announcement, but it did cite lower labor costs elsewhere as a factor.
"There is no question that there are businesses leaving the state and that manufacturing has dropped in New Jersey more than in other states," said Frederick Westphal, president of the State Chamber of Commerce. Although 70 percent of the businesses polled by the chamber said they were satisfied with their New Jersey locations, about a third of that group said they had considered moving.
And the Business and Industry Association, in a survey it did in mid-1990, asked a similar question and found that 88 percent said they were unlikely to expand in the state. Asked whether they would cease operations in New Jersey, 14 percent said they would. The group said a number of its members were reacting to what they felt was an "antibusiness" attitude in state government.
State officials answer these complaints by pointing out that even if some companies are leaving or putting on hold expansion plans, others are moving in. BASF, a German chemical company, for example, is building its North American headquarters in Mount Olive, and Pepsico said it would construct a bottling plant in Piscataway. But while most businesses are not about to pull up stakes, many say that their displeasure goes beyond the normal complaining in an economic downturn.
Mr. Westphal of the Chamber of Commerce said that what New Jersey businesses objected to were a rise in state and local taxes, increased health insurance costs and what has been perceived as an onslaught of costly environmental regulations.
He singled out some elements of Gov. Jim Florio's tax package as particularly damaging, like the new 7 percent telecommunications tax. "That makes us a locker room ballplayer," Mr. Westphal said. "We can't compete with surrounding states."
 
Concern Over Negative Thinking
 Yet at the same time the Chamber of Commerce is concerned that this sort of negative thinking not get out of control, Mr. Westphal said. "A perception can become reality, and that certainly is not what we're trying to do," he said. "We're trying to put a positive spin on it."
He said the chamber was also working to promote the very things that have drawn record numbers of companies to the state in recent years, like foreign trade zones and its being in the densely populated Northeast corridor, which provides a ready market for goods and services.
Dennis Marco, Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Commerce, Energy and Economic Development, said he believed that the surveys might be picking up businesses' traditional suspicion of government, rather than any new anti-New Jersey sentiment. The Governor's budget actions have given the state a triple-A bond rating, which should help accelerate economic recovery, he said.
"This administration came into a situation where we were left with an enormous deficit," Mr. Marco said. "We have now taken care of our fiscal house, and we haven't proposed raising taxes this year, unlike other states."
Many business officials do give Governor Florio credit for getting the tax issue behind him quickly, no matter how unpalatable it seemed at the time. Now the spotlight is shifting to New York, Connecticut and other nearby states, which are agonizing over the same unpopular revenue-raising measures that brought the business community's wrath down on Mr. Florio more than a year ago.
 
Disagreement With Pessimism
 Beatrice D'Agostino, president of the New Jersey Savings Bank in Somerville, said she did not share the bearish outlook of many of her colleagues.
"I don't hold with these dim economic forecasts," she said. "The economic situation in the whole Northeast reflects a deepening recession, but we have weathered these storms in the past."
Some of the pessimism may be due to the inevitable contraction that follows a boom, she added. "Many businesses came here for the tax benefits and a great employee base," she said. "But businesses expanded so quickly and what they are really doing is purging the excesses of that expansion, and that is not necessarily saying that they don't want to be in New Jersey."
The severity of the state's economic slowdown was confirmed in the Chamber of Commerce survey, in which 70 percent of the respondents said their business was down, with 41 percent estimating that things would not improve until 1992. And 42 percent said they were likely to reduce their staffs this year.
One commonly voiced concern is that New Jersey may be losing its status as a state that companies would move to, rather than flee. New York City, for example, has seen a sizable number of businesses move across the river to take advantage of tax breaks and lower costs. But the amount of negative publicity over New Jersey's tax increases may have damaged the state's image as a more friendly environment for business than some of its neighbors.
 
'Our Tax Advantage Is Gone'
 Joseph Hoffman, a partner in the Roseland law firm of Hannoch Weisman, said that "our tax advantage is gone" and that "our tax structure is now pretty much like New York's, and not as good as Pennsylvania's."
Even worse than the increased taxes are the environmental laws that are now on the books, said Mr. Hoffman, a formerNew Jersey Commissioner of Labor. Among the laws he and other critics mention are the Clean Water Enforcement Act and the universal labeling law, which recently went into effect after being held up by legal appeals for a number of years.
"These laws have one by one tightened the noose around New Jersey's businesses," he said.
 But even if New Jersey is seen as being less advantageous for business, state officials say statistics contradict any suggestion that companies are departing in droves. The Commerce Department's most recent figures show that New York-based businesses are continuing to move to New Jersey, and, in fact, that the number rose 30 percent last year, with 51 New York companies announcing moves or expansion to New Jersey.
Mr. Marco said New Jersey would fight to keep jobs in the state by giving companies an incentive to stay. As an example, he cited the negotiations that preceded Maxwell House's decision to close its New Jersey plant.
"The region came together to save the facility," he said, with a plan that involved the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and state and local governments. Mr. Marco said that terminal operators had agreed to give favorable terms to the company and that an arrangement had been made to bring coffee beans to the plant by barge from Brooklyn.
 
Views on Maxwell House Move
 Although Kraft General Foods, which is based in White Plains, did not comment on the specifics of the Maxwell House negotiations, Mr. Marco said New Jersey lost out because Florida had lower labor costs and had less stringent rules on air quality than New Jersey.
"The bottom line is that they can pay $3 less an hour," he said, "but I think they are being very shortsighted to move out of the biggest market in the country for their product."
Nan Redmond, Kraft's director of corporate affairs, said that while the company did take labor costs into account, "a whole lot of other things were involved; it was not a one-dimensional decision."
A recent New Jersey Labor Department report on the state's economic indicators also noted the decision of several companies to move plants to other states. The Ciba-Geigy Corporation, the chemical and pharmaceutical giant, is moving one of its Toms River divisions to California and Alabama.
Another example provided by the Business and Industry Association is the decision of the Clorox Company to close its household products manufacturing operation in Jersey City by the fall of 1993, the same time it is opening an expanded production center in Perryman, Md. The move affects 160 employees.
The report noted that New Jersey had already been losing manufacturing jobs to other states, citing New Jersey Department of Labor statistics showing that the state has lost about 43,000 manufacturing jobs since the end of 1988. But until 1990 service industries had more than made up the difference, it said.
With the recession now spreading nationwide, New Jersey businesses should look to other markets, particularly overseas, Mr. Westphal of the Chamber of Commerce said. The Business and Industry Association,for its part, has urged closer communication between the state officials regulating business and the companies' executives. If this occurs, both groups say, perhaps the results of their annual surveys will not be so unflattering to New Jersey next year.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Another Opening, at a New Address

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

DATELINE: ELMSFORD

 BODY:
WHEN times are hard, have a theater built. That appears to be the credo of William B. Stutler and Robert J. Funking, the producers of An Evening Dinner Theater, which opened here in 1974, the beleaguered year of an energy shortage, a bear market and multiple monetary crises.
Now, in a new decade that financial analysts are already referring to as the "economically lean 90's," Mr. Stutler and Mr. Funking are about to open a new, enlarged showplace. 
 In a burst of assertiveness, they have named it Westchester Broadway Theater. Moreover, they are changing the address, from 75 Clearbrook Road, one block north of the theater they are leaving, to 1 Broadway Plaza. There, preview performances of "A Chorus Line" are scheduled to begin on Wednesday, in preparation of a formal opening night party on Friday and a run through June 2.
 
Success and Risk in Westchester
 During a tour of the new 449-seat theater last weekend, Mr. Stutler and Mr. Funking were surrounded by about 60 carpenters, painters, woodworkers and plumbers. (The cast and crew of "A Chorus Line," meanwhile, were rehearsing in the old space.) They talked about the formula of their success and the risk of a new theater operation in Westchester where, they said their research indicated, 27 professional theater companies "have come and gone" in the 16 years since An Evening opened.
"Westchester is not a county that experiments," said Mr. Stutler, who has lived in Croton-on-Hudson for 27 years. "And it doesn't have a strong theater history. Our audiences want to know what they're going to see, and that it's been successful."
Mr. Funking, a Scarborough resident for 16 years, added: "We give them what they want: a great service that's pleasant, easy and convenient, with no parking problems. People don't want hassles. And they resent the prices -- and the fear -- of going to Broadway. So even though we're using the cachet of Broadway for professionalism and glamour, we're different."
 
A 15-Year Lease
 Mr. Stutler and Mr. Funking hold a 15-year lease on the new building, which is owned and was built by the Robert Martin Company of Elmsford. The cost was $4.5 million, $1 million of which was raised by the producers.
"In reality we couldn't build it ourselves -- banks don't lend money to theaters and restaurants," Mr. Stutler said. "But we have the largest commercial landlord in the county, and we've been their tenant for 16 years. We felt a need to improve, and all businesses have to be recycled, redesigned, jazzed up."
The new theater, at 32,000 square feet, is almost twice as large as the old one and has a stage that is four feet wider and twice as high. The lobby is three times the size of the one at An Evening. There is an expanded orchestra pit below stage level, an electrical grid for more than 500 lighting instruments, and a "floating" stairway as well as an elevator. The rehearsal room will no longer double as a lounge or a place for private parties, and there are plentiful restrooms.
"The interior is painted dark red, which has been found by restaurant magazines to be the most appetizing and flattering color," Mr. Stutler said.
When An Evening opened, the top ticket price was $11.95; the current top price of $50 on Saturday nights ($41.24 on weeknights) will continue at the new theater. But now five private boxes, named after famous composers, will be available with what the theater is calling an "enhanced menu" for $88 a ticket.
 
Fewer Shows, Longer Runs
 "We started with short runs -- 'Kiss Me, Kate' for six weeks, 'Barefoot in the Park' for five," Mr. Funking recalled. "But the comedies were not supported. People wanted only musicals. Now fewer new ones are available, and they're running longer."
This has been the case since 1985, when "Evita" ran at An Evening for 21 weeks. Since then "La Cage aux Folles" and "My One and Only" each lasted 24 weeks. The current "Me and My Girl" will have run 26 weeks when it closes today.
The musicals play Wednesday through Saturday evenings with matinees on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. On Mondays and Tuesdays, special shows will continue to be offered: Big Band concerts, comedy nights and outside productions of usually light plays.
The producers declined to reveal recent figures about audience demographics or disclose the monthly cost of running the new theater. "It's very high and double the rent we've been paying," Mr. Stutler said, who added that there was "a yearly gross of $6 million, and we're profitable -- 1989 was more so than 1990."
"But our profit margins are small and getting tighter. The rising cost of insurance and health plans and pension and welfare for actors can add 30 percent to the Equity minimum, which is now $323 a week for chorus members. But 'A Chorus Line' has only four cast members who are on a chorus contract. The rest are principals and our pre-production costs will come to $200,000."
 
Whence the Audience
 Mr. Stutler said the theater's audiences "come mostly from Westchester," but he added: "There's the tri-state area, groups from fire departments, bowling leagues and various corporations; and busloads from the Bronx and Philadelphia and Dutchess County."
Addressing the theatrical status of dinner theater, Mr. Funking said: "We're a theater that serves food, not a restaurant that puts on a show. There's a lot of snobbery about that and it's been hard to overcome. But now we're accepted in the theater world and agents send us the same people they send Hal Prince -- and that took years to accomplish."
Performers who have appeared at An Evening include Kevin Gray, who has the title role in "Phantom of the Opera" on Broadway and played one of the leads in "Kiss of the Spider Woman" when it was produced by New Musicals last year at the State University of New York at Purchase -- both productions directed by Mr. Prince.
"When we started planning three years ago, times were terrible." Mr. Funking said. "If we had to start that all over again now, we probably wouldn't. But our timing was good before. If you ever want to know a recession is on the way, just have us open a theater."

Design for a Post-Cold War Company

BYLINE: By RICHARD FLORIDA and MARTIN KENNEY; Richard Florida and Martin Kenney are authors of "The Breakthrough Illusion: Corporate America's Failure to Move From Innovation to Mass Production."

 BODY:
Japan's leading microelectronics companies are opening state-of-the-art research and development laboratories in the United States and are trying to steal away America's best scientists. Is the American computer industry -- the last bastion of American technological superiority -- about to succumb to the Japanese threat? A number of analysts think so. But it is not the Japanese we should be afraid of. We are our own worst enemy.
American companies, held hostage by the illusion that breakthroughs are the key to technological superiority and industrial competitiveness, have failed to employ a winning formula. To be competitive, big new ideas must be turned into products and that requires an ability to follow through. This is where we, as an industrial nation, fail. And this is where the Japanese succeed. 
 To address our competitiveness problems, we must make changes in three fundamental areas:
First, we must tap the collective intelligence of all our workers, from research and development scientists to factory workers. This is absolutely essential for success in an age of rapid technological change and perpetual innovation.
There can no longer be a one-way flow of information from "all-knowing" scientists, engineers and managers to the "know-nothings" on the factory floor. The shop floor must become an extension of the lab, and the lab an extension of the shop floor.
Second, American companies must realize that workers will continue to resist corporate efforts to tap into their brains if they do not have real guarantees that their jobs are safe. Many companies sold off their labs and moved their factories to the third world, resulting in massive layoffs and disaffection among those who remained.
Third, even with the success of the high-technology weapons used in the Persian Gulf war, America must transform itself from a military to a civilian economy. We must mobilize all the resources we can muster to build a more effective technology system and economy.
This means dismantling the old cold war military research, development and manufacturing system and embarking on a comprehensive effort to rebuild our industrial plant.
Huge amounts of government money and generations of our best engineers and scientists have been devoted to developing military breakthroughs. The Pentagon has created a technological welfare state, the most expensive industrial subsidy program in all of human history. This has enabled American corporations to prosper, while avoiding the restructuring they need to make them globally competitive.
The real reason Japanese companies are opening labs in the United States is not to steal our breakthroughs, but to incorporate them into their already well-established manufacturing plants. We have the opportunity to do the same.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Rally's Continuation Is Questioned

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
With long-term interest rates at their lowest levels in more than a year, some credit market analysts are beginning to wonder whether the bond market rally that began in mid-January has run its course.
Bond yields have fallen by more than half a percentage point in scarcely a month's time, and since much of the $11 billion worth of new 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds sold at last week's Treasury refunding auctions remain in Wall Street's hands, dealers are watching to see whether retail investors will step up and buy the securities. 
 "The Street has a very real interest in keeping the rally going," said William N. Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm. "But at the moment there does not seem to be any clear sign of overwhelming retail demand. Do investors believe that this is about the end of the decline, and that rates could turn around?"
 
Lower Yields Expected
 Despite the seeming lack of enthusiasm by investors, Mr. Griggs and other analysts said the recession and an anticipated sharp slowdown in inflation this year would probably push bond yields lower.
"The bullish posture of the dealer community is absolutely appropriate," said James M. Benham, chairman of Benham Capital Management Group, a Mountain View, Calif., firm with a fixed-income portfolio of $7.5 billion, most of it in Government securities. "The bond market rally is real. The weakness in the economy is clearly evident, and talk about a turnaround this spring looks like a hope to me, not reality. I think bond yields are destined to fall to 7.75 percent at least and possibly as low as 7 percent by year-end, depending on what the economy does and how the Fed responds."
Because the drop in short-term rates has been so much more pronounced than in bond yields, Mr. Benham said more and more investors in his funds were lengthening the maturity of their holdings to capture additional yield.
 
Salomon Assessment
 "The most compelling argument in favor of lower yields stems from the forces that are undercutting inflation," Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers, noted in the firm's weekly newsletter Comments on Credit.
Because of the recession, wage pressures are easing, Mr. DiClemente said. And a slowdown in other industrial economies, many of them crucial American export markets, will impede a quick recovery in the United States.
Still, there are signs that investors, who grew increasingly conscious of credit quality as 1990 progressed, are now willing to take on more risk in exchange for yields that are much higher than those offered on AAA-rated Treasury securities.
Despite the recession, prices of a wide variety of corporate bonds have been rising for much of the last month, from high-yield "junk bonds," to medium- to high-quality corporate issues.
 
Corporate Yields at a Low
 Corporate bond indexes compiled by Merrill Lynch show that yields on high-quality corporate bonds with maturities of 10 years or more are now at 52-week lows, at just over 9 percent. So, too, are yields on riskier investment-grade corporate debt, securities rated A to Baa. At the end of last week, Merrill Lynch's index showed those issues were yielding about 9.80 percent.
The improvement in the corporate market has much to do with the overall decline in interest rates. But analysts said the declines in many corporate issues in the fourth quarter turned them into bargains.
"In the fourth quarter the whole corporate market got cheap, too cheap relative to the economic fundamentals," said Thomas J. Sowanick, senior fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch.
"With the general level of bond yields down, and the fact that long Treasuries are now yielding under 8 percent, investors have been given a reason to take on incremental yield."
 
Views on Corporate Market
 Given the economic outlook, participants in the corporate market said prices would probably improve further.
"For the first time probably since 1982, people think they should buy corporates because the Fed is lowering rates and, while credit quality looks bad now, it will improve in six or seven months," said one corporate bond trader. "Prices in this market are not the equivalent of being 6 percent or so from their all-time peak, as they are in the stock market."
Analysts said that upcoming economic reports this week should be favorable to prices in almost all fixed-income markets.
"We are looking for a whole string of weak numbers, from industrial production to retail sales to producer prices," said Steven Slifer, a senior vice president and financial market economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. "If we get that string, the market might begin building an expectation that the Fed will ease again before the end of February."
 
Possible Stumbling Block
 The producer price report that Mr. Slifer referred to might prove a stumbling block.
Most analysts, including Mr. Slifer, anticipate that the Producer Price Index for January, which is expected to be released on Friday, will show that prices fell last month, in large part because of a decline in energy prices.
Some analysts noted, however, that much of that decline occurred after the onset of fighting in the Middle East. In early January, the period when data for the report were collected, wholesale gasoline prices actually rose, they said.
As a consequence, Brian Jones, an economist at Salomon Brothers, is estimating that producer prices probably rose by two-tenths of a percentage point last month, after a decline of six-tenths of a point in December.
Excluding food and energy, however, the core inflation rate probably increased by a mere one-tenth of a percentage point, Mr. Jones said, compared with an increase of three-tenths of a point in December.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Washington;
Baker and Dole Disagreeing On Warning by Gorbachev

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today brushed aside Soviet complaints that the United States was on the verge of exceeding United Nations resolutions by destroying Iraq and not just liberating Kuwait, but a top Republican Senator said the Soviet position might be correct.
The conflicting assessments by Mr. Baker and the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, reflect what is likely to be growing debate in the anti-Iraq coalition about exactly what are Washington's war aims, as long it continues to depend on air power to wear down Iraq's military without any movement on the ground to liberate Kuwait. 
 President Mikhail S. Gorbachev added fuel to that debate on Saturday when he declared in Moscow that the air war against Iraq was assuming "an ever more alarming and dramatic scope" and that the "logic" of American military operations threatened to exceed the limited United Nations mandate of liberating Kuwait.
"I would disagree with that," Mr. Baker said when asked on the CBS News program "Face the Nation" about Mr. Gorbachev's complaint regarding the United Nations mandate. "The language calls for the use of all necessary means to implement the U.N. resolutions, which call for Iraq's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait and restoration of the leadership. So by taking on primarily military targets in Iraq, we are moving in that direction, and we're doing so in a manner that's going to reduce coalition casualties."
 
Domestic Audience Seen
 Asked whether he was worried that Mr. Gorbachev might be drifting away from the anti-Iraq coalition, Mr. Baker indicated that this was not a concern and that Mr. Gorbachev appeared to speaking more to some of his domestic constituencies than signaling any major policy change.
"The Soviet Union gave us prior notice of this statement," Mr. Baker said. "It is true that the position, the principled position, they have taken alongside the United States has not been popular with many segments of Soviet society. So there is a significant amount of public opinion in the Soviet Union, particularly in some of the Muslim republics, with some of the military, that are very much opposed to the position they're taking, but they're sticking with that position."
Mr. Baker said Washington did not object to a planned visit to Baghdad by the Soviet Middle East envoy, Yevgeny M. Primakov, to try to persuade President Saddam Hussein to withdraw fully from Kuwait. If the Soviet envoy succeeds, Mr. Baker said, "more power to them."
While Administration officials publicly have to welcome any diplomatic efforts by the Soviet Union, privately they are more ambivalent. Although they never admit it publicly, Administration officials acknowledge in private that American interests will be served if Kuwait is not only liberated but Iraq's armed forces are sharply cut down in size, its ability to produce weapons of mass destruction is eliminated and Mr. Hussein is removed from power.
If Mr. Hussein survives this war, officials say, no matter how badly his army is mauled or driven out of Kuwait, he will still pose a threat to his neighbors and therefore victory will be incomplete until he is toppled.
 
Four Stated Goals
 Given these private sentiments, the current American military strategy of using weeks of aerial bombardments to sap the strength of Iraq's military before moving on Kuwait is ideal from the Administration's perspective, since it can accomplish its stated objectives while also accomplishing its unstated objectives. The Administration's four stated objectives are liberating Kuwait, restoring its legitimate Government, safeguarding Americans in the Persian Gulf and stabilizing the region.
Senator Dole, speaking on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," virtually confirmed this distinction between the Administration's explicit and implicit goals when he remarked: "I think, to some extent, when we say in addition to the four objectives set out by President Bush, we're going to, in effect, destroy Iraq militarily, that was not one of the original objectives. So there is a bit of truth to what Gorbachev says."
Mr. Dole went on to say that he did not think that Mr. Bush had formally expanded any of his initial goals, but that "just by happenstance, to get them out of Kuwait, we've had to repeatedly go after targets in Iraq, because he is not moving out of Kuwait."
"I don't see anything wrong with it," he added.
Judging from Mr. Gorbachev's remarks, the Soviet Union is ready to play along to a certain degree with Washington's explicit and implicit objectives, since at this stage it is virtually impossible to distinguish between a military strategy designed simply to liberate Kuwait and one that involves a wider objective of destroying Iraq's armed forces.
But Mr. Gorbachev's complaint, if it picks up more international support in the coming days, could force the United States into a ground campaign sooner rather than later, to maintain international support for the war to liberate Kuwawit. Mr. Gorbachev seemed to be saying to Washington that Moscow could not tolerate weeks more of devastating Iraq without any apparent movement on the ground to free Kuwait.
 
Hoping for Hussein's Ouster
 Mr. Gorbachev's warning aside, Mr. Baker did not shy away from sending yet another signal to the Iraqi people that although Washington did not have the explicit objective of removing President Hussein, postwar Iraq would benefit enormously if the Iraqis themselves deposed him.
Mr. Baker said that "as President Bush says, 'Nobody would shed any tears' " if Mr. Hussein was ousted.
"And it's going to be important in terms of what can and cannot be done in that area in the aftermath, whether it's economic reconstruction or what it is, but I do not believe that we should amend our war aims or our war goals to make that a war aim of the United States," he said.

HEADLINE: BRAZIL SKEPTICAL OVER PRICE FREEZE

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Last March, Brazilians thrilled to hear their dynamic new President announce that he had "one bullet to kill the inflationary tiger."
Almost one year later, a cartoon in the Rio daily Jornal do Brasil last week reflected a diminished public assessment: President Fernando Collor de Mello taking aim with a popgun, the barrel plugged with a cork on a string. 
 As Brazilians embark on their fifth experience in five years with wage and price controls, the political byword is credibilidade -- credibility.
"Collor II is working only in the land of make-believe," Brazil's most influential newsweekly, Veja, wrote last week of the President's second major economic shock plan since taking office on March 15.
 
Skepticism Is Rampant
 In January, only eight months since the end of the last freeze, prices jumped 20 percent. Today, only 10 days after the freeze was imposed, shortages are spreading through markets and shopkeepers are charging under-the-table commissions to sell hoarded goods in short supply. Among Brazilians who have lived through this cycle before, skepticism is rampant.
"There will be a short-term drop in inflation, but then it will return to be worse than before," predicted Roberto Campos, an economist and a conservative member of Congress. "The problem is that the plan attacks the effects and not the causes of inflation. The cause is excessive monetary expansion."
In a DataFolha poll made public on Saturday, 49 percent of the respondents said the price freeze was not working. Another large group, 60 perccent, predicted that unemployment would increase.
In a Gallup poll made public on Thursday, 56 percent of respondents predicted that the plan would not reduce inflation.
Indeed, with high monthly inflation and a sharp recession, Latin America's largest economy had already slipped into what economists here call stagflation -- inflation and economic stagnation. Last year, industrial activity in Sao Paulo fell 11.2 percent, the worst performance in the 15 years that the Sao Paulo Federation of Industries has charted industrial performance.
Factory owners, long accustomed to creative mathematics from Brasilia, are now struggling to discover how they can absorb gasoline and electricity increases of 50 percent, pay mandated salary raises at the end of February, maintain prices frozen at the levels of last Thursday and make money.
 
The Orthodox View
 Orthodox economists say Brazil's inflation persists because Mr. Collor did not follow through on vows to shrink government.
"They did not make the serious cuts in spending that they said they would," Norman Gall, executive director of the Fernand Braudel Institute of World Economy, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. "They bailed out state banks that were going to close, and there was a 58 percent explosion of money supply in December."
In New York, Brazil's foreign creditors did not give the plan a warm welcome when debt talks resumed on Thursday. The private bankers seek payment of $8 billion in interest arrears. Brazil's foreign currency reserves are almost $9 billion, but the economic team says domestic priorities should come first.
One priority is to sell gold on the local market to artificially repress the local value of the dollar as money floods out of money market accounts now crippled by negative interest rates.
Last week, 81 tons of gold traded hands in Sao Paulo's market as the Central Bank sought to prevent a surge in the dollar. The dollar held steady, and Sao Paulo's stock exchange index soared.
Next Wednesday, after Brazil's four-day Carnival holiday, Brazil's Congress is to address the economic plan.
 
Inflation's Biggest Cause
 Looking beyond approval of wage and price controls, it is unclear whether Mr. Collor will be able to win congressional approval for measures to attack what is viewed as inflation's biggest cause -- the need to privatize money-losing state companies and to dismiss federal employees who now are guaranteed lifetime employment after five years of service.
In the 584-seat Congress, Mr. Collor's National Reconstruction Party controls only 45 seats, or 8 percent. But a recent survey of the new Congress indicated that in the presidential runoff vote in December 1989, 53 percent of Congress voted for Mr. Collor and 31 percent for Luis Inacio da Silva, his socialist opponent.
With foreign private creditors unwilling to lend money and the Government technically broke, the President's only remedies may be to print more money or to increase domestic borrowing, which pushed inflation in 1990 to 1,795 percent.
Facing a new Congress, Mr. Collor appears to be mapping out an aggressive strategy that will draw on his residual personal popularity.
"In public opinion polls about credibility, politicians generally come in last," the 41-year-old President asserted in the Jornal do Brasil interview. "The President of the republic comes in third, after the church and radio. There is an enormous distance in popular perception between policies made by the President and policies made by Congress."

HEADLINE: Japan Pressed to Buy More U.S. Awacs Jets

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Heating up another front in the continuing trade disputes with Japan, 70 members of Congress complained last week that Tokyo has dragged its feet in assuming responsibility for the defense of its air space and sea lanes.
At issue is whether Japan needs the radar surveillance plane built by the Boeing Company -- the Airborne Early Warning and Control System, or Awacs -- and if it does, how many it needs. 
 Japan's budget for the next fiscal year is expected to provide for the purchase of four Awacs planes. But Boeing has said that unless it receives authority by March 31 to begin work on at least 14 more Awacs planes or the supporting tanker aircraft that use the same body, it will shut its production line. It now has no orders in hand.
Boeing, based in Seattle, has more than 105,000 workers in that area and smaller operations in Kansas and elsewhere. The Awacs operation is a small part of its business, and its construction of commerical airliners is doing extremely well. Last year, the company reported a $1 billion profit.
The 70 legislators first pressed their point in a letter in September to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in which they asserted: "Defense experts on both sides of the Pacific agree that comprehensive coverage of the vast area Japan has agreed to defend requires between 12 to 14 Awacs planes and at least 20 tankers."
Last week, those same legislators introduced a bill to press the case for more Awacs. It urges the State Department to start negotiations with Japan "leading to the successful assumption by Japan of the 1,000-mile defense mission."
At Japan's Embassy in Washington, Hideaki Ueda, the minister for public affairs, strongly denied that Japan was not meeting its commitment. "We can't increase our defense capability at once to cover everything," he said, adding, "I don't think we have enough money to buy more."
The Bush Administration is playing down the issue. A State Department official who insisted on anonymity pointed to Japan's "steady progress" in fulfilling the military role it has set for itself, and other officials have noted that Japan's military budget calls for the purchase of two Aegis missile-firing cruisers in addition to the Awacs planes.
 
No Fight Wanted
 Bush officials made clear they had little inclination to pick a fight with Japan on this issue at a time when Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu is battling antiwar protesters as he seeks to send an additional $9 billion to support the war against Iraq.
"There are some major sensitivities here," one Administration official acknowledged.
Yet Washington has not been shy about criticizing Tokyo on other fronts, including what it says are Japan's delays in fulfilling agreements to open its construction and semiconductor markets and to fight Japanese antimonopoly practices more aggressively.
Largely because of resentments against Japan, some members of Congress last month introduced a Trade Agreement Compliance Act, mandating sanctions against countries that do not meet their military commitments. It has won the support of a majority of the members of the Senate Finance Committee.
 
10-Year-Old Commitment
 Japan's commitment for self-defense stems from May 1981, when Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki, responding to demands from Washington that Japan assume part of the cost of its defense, said his country would assume responsibility for defending its sea lanes and airspace out to 1,000 nautical miles from its shores.
The Reagan and Bush Administrations attached great importance to the commitment, calling it hard evidence of Japan's willingness to share the burden of defending the Pacific. And Tokyo's pledge has never been modified or abandoned.
Japan has steadily increased its military spending in the last decade and now spends about $30 billion a year. That is about one-tenth the size of the American military budget.
 
13 Radar Aircraft
 While Japan has never ordered an Awacs aircraft, it has 13 of the E2-C Hawkeye short-range radar aircaft, as well as 2 Aegis missile systems.
Many military analysts say the Hawkeye planes are adequate for patrolling Japan but not for monitoring the sea lanes out to 1,000 miles. Citing studies made by the United States Fifth Air Force, which is based in Japan, these analysts say the duties Tokyo assumed 10 years ago cannot be adequately met without the longer-range Awacs planes.
The Japanese commitment did not specify that it would buy Awacs aircraft, nor did it establish a timetable for specific purchases.
 
Meeting 'Full' Responsibility
 The Center for Security Policy, a Washington-based military policy research organization, said the purchase of only four Awacs means that Japan would be unable to meet its "full responsibilities until after the turn of the century."
The center's director, Frank J. Gaffney Jr., a former senior Pentagon official, said that Japan is continuing to balk at acquiring military hardware from the United States that is essential not only to meet Prime Minister Suzuki's commitment but also to "backstop U.S. forces and allow them to be deployed far more flexibly in future contingencies."
Four Awacs cost about $1 billion. The entire package cited as necessary by the military experts would cost about $5 billion.
 
Gaining Commercial Advantage?
 But many members of Congress see this as another case where Japan, which in the last two decades has developed the world's second most powerful economy and which is running a trade surplus of $50 billion a year with the United States, is shirking responsibilities in order to gain commercial advantage.
Backers of the bill introduced last week say they are worried in part by the possible demise of an aircraft regarded as a stunning performer for airborne surveillance and command, control and communications functions.
The plane's ability to detect and track hostile aircraft and to identify and control friendly aircraft, for example, has made it invaluable in the war against Iraq.
 
Affecting the Agenda
 "I hope the legislation importunes our Government to put this issue higher on the agenda, and that it shows the Japanese how important these issues are to Congress and the American people," said the leading sponsor, Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn.
Sixty-eight Awacs have been sold since 1977. The customers have been the air forces of the United States, the other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Saudi Arabia, Britain and France.
Discussing the plans to shut the Awacs production line, Donald B. Brannon, a Boeing spokesman, said the company "is not pointing any fingers at anybody," adding: "It's just a matter of timing. We have run out of work."
 
Orders From Saudia Arabia
 Saudi Arabia has put in a request for four Awacs and seven tankers as part of a military package worth an estimated $12 billion to $14 billion. Those 11 planes and the 4 that Japan is expected to order would be one more than the number Boeing says it needs to keep the production line open.
But the State Department has notified Congress that the Saudi deal will be delayed until after the gulf war, when there will be a reassessment of the region's military needs. One reason for deferral is the strong opposition of Israel.
A Pentagon official declined to comment on whether Japan's expected order of Awacs was adequate. He said Boeing had been in touch with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who "obviously hopes the line doesn't go down."

HEADLINE: Economic Watch;
Does Government Have the Stuff to End a Recession?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Many analysts fear that a legacy of chronic budget deficits, insolvent banks and dependence on foreign capital has undermined Washington's ability to keep economic growth on track. "We're in a recession with no tools to get out," said Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics.
A pickup in business and consumer demand, modestly augmented by Pentagon spending on the Persian Gulf war, will probably carry the economy out of the current recession. But most economists are worried that the Government's ability to cope with economic shocks is more limited than in the past, and that the margin for error has narrowed. 
 This new-found humility is reflected in President Bush's 1992 budget, which offers no policy initiatives for fighting the recession and may actually retard the recovery. And it lies behind the warning last week by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that an extended gulf war would probably tip the economy into a nasty decline. Tracing the sources of the situation, however, is easier than figuring a way out.
 
Managing the Economy
 The idea that Washington could prevent ups and downs in the economy first gained popular credibility in 1962, when a tax cut engineered by the Kennedy Administration brought a recession to a speedy end. Since then, policy makers have made frequent use of two very different approaches to keeping total buying power roughly equal to the economy's productive capacity.
Congress and the White House could change tax rates or Government outlays, altering the incomes of businesses and individuals and inducing them to change their spending. Or the Federal Reserve could change the quantity of money to induce changes in interest rates, indirectly influencing everything from factory inventories to housing construction.
Schools of economic thought have come and gone, and with them have come changes in the Government's reliance on fiscal and monetary tools. Plenty of mistakes were made. "The record of discretionary fiscal policy is not very impressive," noted Lawrence Summers, chief economist of the World Bank.
 
An Integrated Economy
 But a near consensus prevailed in both Government and academia that Government could and should take steps to prevent unemployment or temper inflation. As President Richard M. Nixon said in 1969, "We are all Keynesians now."
But even as the interventionists celebrated their ascendency, forces were at work that would greatly complicate the task of doctoring a sick economy. Integration of the world economy made it as easy for Shell Oil, or for that matter the United States Treasury, to borrow in London or Tokyo as in New York, weakening the Federal Reserve's grip on the money supply. Equally important, spectacular expansion in world trade allowed a good chunk of purchasing power to spill beyond national borders.
Some analysts worried that the big economies would no longer be manageable without hand-in-glove coordination with other industrial powers -- an elusive goal, even among the closest of allies. At the very least, economists contended, the apparent redundancy of fiscal and monetary tools had been lost.
A clear division of labor was needed: those who drew up the Federal budget would fine-tune demand with taxing and spending policies; the Federal Reserve would focus on the international economy, changing interest rates to control the dollar's exchange rate, and with it, trade and capital flows.
 
Reagan Did Not Go Along
 But President Ronald Reagan never signed on. Big tax cuts without complementary reductions in spending generated enormous deficits, locking the fiscal tap at the full-on position. For the last decade, said Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution, "we've been relying on the Fed to regulate the economy alone."
The Fed, effectively forced to choose between stable exchange rates and a stable domestic economy, tilted toward the latter. There followed seven years of economic growth, a success that Robert Hall, an economist at Stanford University, attributes to the Fed's abandoning purist doctrines in favor of a pragmatic search for a balance between low inflation and steady economic growth.
But with most eyes focused on the domestic economy, the dollar ballooned in value in the mid-1980's, weakening American exports and attracting a flood of competitive imports. America was transformed from the world's largest creditor to the largest debtor.
 
Trap for Monetary Officials
 But the Fed's domestic luck ran out last year and the economy sagged into recession. Many economists, notably those who advise President Bush, believe the Fed waited too long to ease credit, and then acted with excessive caution. But as Mr. Bergsten points out, monetary officials were trapped. "Large cuts in interest rates could put in jeopardy the huge capital inflow that remains essential to fund the trade deficit," he said.
In recent months, the Fed's room for maneuver was narrowed still further by the banking crisis. Its primary method for reducing interest rates is buying Government securities for cash, thereby expanding the deposits that banks have on hand to lend.
But with many banks struggling to stay afloat in a sea of delinquent real estate loans, and most of the rest under pressure from regulators to raise private capital before expanding their loan portfolios, the response was less than impressive.
Many analysts assume that the disruption in the money mechanism is temporary. But temporary may translate into quite a while. Could fiscal policy take up the slack?
Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, notes that Congress and the President have discretion to cut taxes or raise spending in economic emergencies. Indeed, last year's budget agreement requires Congress to vote on a resolution suspending budget restrictions whenever it is formally notified of a downturn in the economy. But that is apparently not the Bush Administration's plan.
While its budget forecasts a whopping $280 billion deficit for the 1992 fiscal year, Charles Schulze of the Brookings Institution says it is actually more restrictive than the budget now in place. By Congressional Budget Office estimates, $98 billion of the new budget will go to pay off insured depositors at failing savings and loans. That money will not make anyone richer -- insured depositors never thought they had lost the money in the first place -- and will thus not spur demand.
 
Best Policy: Neglect?
 It is possible, perhaps likely, that neglect will prove the best policy. The Administration and the Congressional Budget Office are forecasting a quick rebound of private demand, ending the recession before prospective fiscal or monetary actions would have any effect. And Isabel Sawhill of the Urban Institute says added spending for the gulf war plus continuing downward pressure on oil prices will probably have a modest expansionary effect in the months ahead.
But Mr. Greenspan is making no secret of his nightmare that a lingering conflict will lengthen and deepen the recession. The war, he fears, will drive up oil prices and slam consumer confidence, more than offsetting the beneficial effect of Pentagon orders for supplies. And with the banks in terrible shape, a fresh injection of cash may have little immediate effect on private investment.
Even if the economy negotiates the recession in good form, Mr. Bosworth wonders whether the Federal Reserve chairman's troubles will be over. Once the recovery is complete, the Fed's primary worry will switch from unemployment to inflation. Will Washington be able to tighten credit, Mr. Bosworth asks, when the fate of hundreds of banks is tied to the hope of rising prices for houses and commercial real estate?

HEADLINE: The Talk of Teterboro;
Tax Haven in New Jersey, In Bind, Plans to Drop Police

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TETERBORO, N.J., Feb. 7

 BODY:
All was tranquil in this square-mile tax haven until Borough Manager Michael W. Tedesco proposed disbanding the eight-member police force.
Home to 55 businesses, 10,000 jobs, 7 houses and 23 residents, as well as one of the lowest property-tax rates in the state, the borough had hummed along serenely for many years, whizzing traffic on Route 46 and roaring airplanes at Teterboro Airport notwithstanding. 
 But Mr. Tedesco has stirred things by proposing to eliminate the $465,000-a-year Police Department. Just like officials in New Jersey's other communities, Mr. Tedesco said, he is trying to watch dollars and keep down taxes in sour economic times.
Much as they love low taxes, some of the borough's smaller businesses seem to love local police protection more.
"We're saying, 'Raise our taxes, we don't care,' " said George Green, owner of Club 80, a bar and restaurant. "I pay less taxes here than on my house." The Club 80 tax bill is $1,900.80, according to tax records.
The police are not objecting to the plan. The Bergen County Police Department would absorb four of the officers. Teterboro would pay their salaries and benefits, and the county would patrol here on weeknights and weekends. The savings for the borough would come from allowing the other four officers, who would patrol on weekdays, to retire by the middle of the decade, Mr. Te desco said. For now the plan is in limbo. A budget squeeze is forcing the county to lay off seven of its own officers, leaving no room for those from Teterboro. Mr. Tedesco said he was willing to talk with other towns.
The complaints come from executives without private security forces. They are grumbling about a closed and indifferent government and wondering whether friction between Mr. Tedesco and Police Chief Otto Flaig, and not cost-cutting, has doomed the department.
The executives also fret that eliminating the force could revive a move from the 1960's to dismember Teterboro and parcel its industry to four surrounding towns to reduce their tax rates. Those rates are at least two times Teterboro's.
"We're very sensitive to our police," said Thomas W. Marschall, the loudest critic and president of the Marschall Warehouse Company, a grocery wholesaler. "We regard local response as essential."
Eliminating the police could snowball into a municipal doomsday, Mr. Marschall said.
"You could then farm out the magistrate and the tax collector and other officials," he said. "Essentially you'd be dissolving yourself. Teterboro is a very attractive target."
Mr. Green of Club 80 wants more say at Borough Hall. "There's not a taxpayer in town who has a vote," he said, referring to the fact that all the residents are renters. "They're making decisions on our security and saying, 'We can do what we want.' "
Mr. Tedesco dismissed the dissenters as a minority and said most businesses were quiet about disbanding the police. "I guess they trust we're going to keep the tax rate stabilized," he said.
He also scoffed at the notion of dismembering Teterboro. "The trend is for consolidation and sharing of municipal services," he said. "Annexing towns is out."
The police cost of $465,000 is the largest item in the $2.3 million budget. Prudence is required now, Mr. Tedesco said.
Times are bleaker than the 80's. Several businesses, including Sylvania-GTE and the Wella Corporation, a cosmetics manufacturer, have left. Seven others, including the Great Bear Spring Company, which bottles water here, have appealed their new assessments.
And the six old water pumps near West Riser Ditch need replacing, at a cost of $1.5 million. They prevent flooding in the southern half of borough and the airport by draining marshes during heavy rains.
 
Huckleberries to Jets
 The airport, the town landmark, was created by Walter Teter, its namesake, in aviation's infancy about 1917. It was built on 715 acres of farms and huckleberry brush he bought from neighboring Little Ferry, Moonachie and Hasbrouck Heights. Charles A. Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart were early fixtures.
Now the field is a hub of corporate jets, recreational aircraft and courier planes that carry billions of dollars worth of canceled checks each night for banks and the Federal Reserve System.
After World War II, another developer, Alexander Summer, forged the industrial zoning that all but prohibited housing and, consequently, children. The few that grew up here were educated in neighboring towns. School taxes have always been a pittance. The total education budget for this school year is $8,665.
Although the airport takes up half the land, the owner, the tax-exempt Port Authority of New York and New Jersey pays the borough $13,500 a year in lieu of taxes.
Mr. Tedesco said that he often asked the authority for more money and that "they just keep putting you off."
Last year, the agency said, flights dropped 11 percent, to 160,370, apparently because of the recession. The authority estimates that the airport lost $410,000 for the year before depreciation and interest payments.
 
Big Fish in Small Pond
 The Bendix division of Allied-Signal Inc., which manufactures electronics for the aviation industry, is the town colossus.
It pays the most taxes, $370,000, and is the biggest employer, with 2,700 workers. Its realty arm, Realdix, owns the five one-family houses, whose taxes are $864 each, and two duplexes, whose taxes are $1,728 each, and rents them to Mayor Delmar E. Watt, the four Council members, Town Clerk Margaret J. Cahill and James E. Hall, who is both tax assessor and Board of Education secretary.
Traditionally, a Bendix retiree becomes town manager. Mr. Tedesco is one.
Bendix says it is neutral on the police issue.
"We have our own security force, and we're pretty self-sufficient," a spokesman, Armand DeLuca, said. "They're not getting any pressure from us."
 
A Lonely Dissenter
 Edith Lillo, who also rents from Realdix, is the political gadfly. She has challenged incumbents for a Council seat two times.
"I'd like to be part of the town because I'm the only one who isn't a job holder," she said. "But I only get four votes, six really, with our own."
The other Council members capture all the others, usually between 12 and 15 each election.

HEADLINE: A Lot of Big Names At a Collector's Event

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Presidents' Day is a week away, and Brian Kathenes is ready. He has a tie clip engraved with Richard M. Nixon's signature. He has an envelope with Millard Fillmore's signature where the stamp should have been. He has a form that Woodrow Wilson signed when he was a college president, which he was before he was that other kind of President.
What Mr. Kathenes does not have anymore are his two favorites, a letter from Gerald R. Ford and a baseball autographed by the Detroit Tigers in 1968, the year they defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series. 
 "I sold them to pay the rent," said Mr. Kathenes, whose first few months after quitting the cosmetics industry to become an autograph dealer did not make him a millionaire, as he had hoped.
Yesterday, with the prosperous confidence of someone who knows the difference between a John Hancock on a piece of parchment and a John Hancock on an insurance policy, Mr. Kathenes was once again all sell, sell, sell. There he was at the New York Autograph Show at the Sheraton City Squire Hotel, at Seventh Avenue at52d Street, showing would-be buyers everything from the check President Warren G. Harding wrote to pay his 1921 income taxes to such nonpresidential items as a photograph of Louis Armstrong and an aviator's license signed by Orville Wright.
Everything is relative, even among the 35 dealers and several hundred collectors who attended the daylong show. One Marilyn Monroe is worth 10 George Bushes. A letter from Giacomo Puccini ("Bravo," it begins) is worth two Elvis Presley photographs. A bona fide Elvis impersonator's signature might be worth $10, said Thomas E. Platt Jr., a coordinator of the show.
 
$1 to $10,000
 "The attitude we want to create is that autographs are not expensive," he said.
There were boxes of autographs priced at $1 or $5. But one person's idea of expensive was another's idea of unaffordable. Mr. Platt, for example, was selling everything from an original sketch of the television cartoon character Bart Simpson for $375 to an Indian adoption document for $10,000 ("signed by the chief who's on the Pontiac emblem").
At the lower end of the scale, collectors could get a Tommy Kirk for $6, with the ink still wet. Mr. Kirk was a child actor in Walt Disney films like "Old Yeller," "The Shaggy Dog," "The Absent-Minded Professor" and "The Swiss Family Robinson." Then he grew up, made B movies and became a waiter, a chauffeur and a carpet-cleaning-service owner. The Universal Autograph Collectors Club, the nonprofit group that sponsored the show, invited him to come and autograph pictures of himself.
Mr. Kirk was asked how many autograph requests he gets on a normal day. "Not that many," he said.
"One reason we have him is he is obscure," said Al Wittnebert, the club's treasurer.
 
More Fillmore-abilia
 The value of an autograph is usually determined by supply and demand -- the more there are, the less they tend to be worth. But there are exceptions, like Millard Fillmore. Mr. Kathenes was selling a Fillmore letter for $250. "He had a tendency to abuse the franking privilege," Mr. Kathenes said, which might drive the value down. But "the fact that a President of the United States would do something that's not on the up and up" seems to have bolstered its value.
Some collectors buy widely -- Presidents, gangsters, opera composers. Not William Randel, a retired New York City Housing Authority employee. He said he had 390 of the 583 generals who fought in the Union Army in the Civil War. "The Confederacy, I couldn't afford," he said, "and since I'm a Northerner, I'm not missing anything."
 
Spotting the Fakes
 Fakes and forgeries are a concern, though Mr. Platt said that most established dealers can spot the obvious ones and back what they sell with guarantees of authenticity.
The dealers seemed divided on whether the recession had thinned out the crowd at the show. "The recession is not affecting quality items at all," said Herman Darvick, a third-grade teacher at Public School 188 in Brooklyn and an autograph collector and auctioneer in his spare time. "I had an auction last week where every quality item went for 50 to 100 percent above the estimate."
Grace Weitman, another dealer, said the atmosphere was different from past shows because this time there was a $2 admission charge.
"It used to be that there were Damon Runyon types with the knitted caps exchanging these scraps of paper," she said. "Guys who stand at stage doors and get autographs. And then they'd come in here and shout, 'Hey, have you got Sally Rand?' And somebody else would say, 'No, but I've got Buster Keaton.' "

HEADLINE: Must Whistling Skyscraper Change Tune? Hearing to Decide

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
For 48 years, Frank Siegfried played the violin professionally, from the Artie Shaw and Radio City Music Hall orchestras to the pit band of "Jesus Christ Superstar." Mr. Siegfried loves music, but even he has had to draw the line at a building that whistles, generally an octave above middle C.
"It is horrendous," he said, sounding a complaint made by hundreds of midtown residents in recent months. 
 Mr. Siegfried, of 357 West 55th Street, lives two blocks west of Cityspire, a 72-story tower on West 56th Street off Seventh Avenue. Last December the building was cited by the city's Department of Environmental Protection for producing an annoying, loud whistle. Inspectors suspect the whistle is made by wind blowing over louvers on the building's green, eight-sided dome, 800 feet above ground.
The building's owner, Ian Bruce Eichner, plans to contest the citation today at an Environmental Control Board hearing at 1250 Broadway, at 32d Street. He faces an $880 penalty and an order to stop the noise if the hearing officer rules against him.
Mr. Siegfried and others who live near Citispire plan to pack the room as Mr. Eichner's representatives argue that the reputed violation -- unnecessary noise -- is unfounded.
 
'Not Unnecessary Noise'
 "It's not unnecessary noise," Howard Hornstein, a lawyer for Mr. Eichner, said without elaboration. "I don't think the city can justify the violation from a legal point of view."
Tell that to the agitated members of the West 56th Street Block Association.
"I think you can drive New Yorkers just so far," said Portia Clark, the group's secretary-treasurer. "There are people who can't sleep. They've called me, near to tears."
Mr. Siegfried has kept a detailed log since Dec. 9 of what he says are Cityspire's whistling sessions.
"I was really beside myself for three or four nights and days," he said. He counted 13 days during which he heard the piercing sound, including 20 consecutive hours on Jan. 31. The pitch of the whistle, he said, is most often the note sounded on a piano one octave above middle C. But occasionally, he said, the building also hits B and C sharp.
The Department of Environment Protection has said it received hundreds of complaints about the sound. After several visits to the midtown area last fall, department inspectors zeroed in on Cityspire.
In an interview last month, Mr. Hornstein said complaints about the noise were exaggerated.
"The project has a number of economic problems, and it would be silly to spend money on amelioration," said Mr. Hornstein, who did not detail what work might be needed to dampen the sound.
The Environmental Control Board adjudicates civil violations of air, noise, sanitation and building codes, and a decision in such cases usually comes within a week, said Anne McCarthy, the board's deputy director. Both sides can appeal a decision within 30 days.
Alex Larys of 120 West 58th Street did not wait for the hearing. On Jan. 22 he sued Cityspire's management in Small Claims Court, seeking payment for apartment soundproofing. That hearing is scheduled for Feb. 27.
Meantime Mr. Larys said he had employed an electric air freshener for the hum it produces.
To muffle the Cityspire noise, he said, "I have to sleep with white noise."
 
A Building's Song
 
Neignbors of Cityspire, a 72-story building east of Seventh Avenue between 55th and 56th Street, have complained that the building whistles, mostly one octave above middle C.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: PUBLISHING;
Seeking Stars, Hollywood Is Spending Freely on Books

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
Forget about book advances. After rising sharply in the 1980's, they are now stagnant or even slipping. But options are hot.
All around New York's publishing world, idea-starved producers, directors, actors and actresses are on an extensive prowl, looking for books, manuscripts and even the first glimmerings of an author's idea that they might be able to "option." 
 "I never really felt this hunger on the part of movie producers that we feel today for books," said Gail Hochman, a literary agent at Brandt & Brandt. "They need ideas and characters, and they want the story line even before it's out of the author's brain."
For authors, options represent another means to stave off poverty. The options provide money in exchange for reserving the right to make a movie of a book.
An option is generally valid for a year and is usually renewable. It can be worth from $5,000 to more than $100,000. If all goes well -- and it rarely does -- this first payment will be followed by an outright sale of the film rights worth several times the option price. But because of the complexity of getting a movie into production, an option, even a costly one, is more likely to yield nothing -- except the cash in the author's pocket.
Where options were once the exception rather than the rule, now "you get the feeling there is a frenzy for good material, and just about everything is optioned," said Maria Campbell, a New York literary scout who finds material for the director Steven Spielberg's company, Amblin Entertainment.
For example, Irene Webb, a vice president of the William Morris Agency in Los Angeles, said she had just optioned "See Jane Run" by Joyce Fielding to Sally Field and the MGM-Pathe Communications Company. Although the book will not be published by William Morrow until the fall, the option was a six-figure sum.
"The movie business is cyclical, and we're in a heavy book cycle," Ms. Webb said.
Even first books can now command big options. Last year, Dennis McFarland's "The Music Room," a well-reviewed novel that did not get onto best-seller lists, was optioned by the Guber-Peters Entertainment Company for close to $100,000. And "Friday Night Lights," H. G. Bissinger's best-selling study of a high-school football season in Odessa, Tex., was optioned to the director Alan J. Pakula for more than $50,000.
The sudden hunger for manuscripts reflects two important factors: a change in Hollywood's mood and increased competition.
The mood is swinging away from the so-called high-concept movies, which rely on the presence of a big star and a story so simple it can be summed up in a single line. An example of such movies is "Top Gun," starring Tom Cruise. These were movies for the flashy decade of the 80's, which put a premium on simple thrills.
In their place, said David Lonner, a motion picture literary agent at International Creative Management in Los Angeles, movie makers are looking for solid story telling, strong characterization and a powerful plot. Life, after all, has turned complex in the 90's. "Presumed Innocent," Scott Turow's best-selling novel and a successful movie last year, illustrates the trend.
At the same time, the number of people in the market to option manuscripts or books has soared. A decade ago, there were just the seven or eight major studios. But now, said Amanda Urban, a literary agent at International Creative Management in New York, "there is more demand because there are more outlets."
These outlets include the movie-of-the-week market, the mini-series market, movie studios, independent producers, actors, Home Box Office, Showtime and foreign companies like Canal Plus of France, all of which are becoming increasingly aggressive.
Moreover, in tight economic times, these potential buyers often feel happier with a book manuscript than mere story lines from screen writers because they have a surer idea of what they might end up with. "Producers are realizing that a popular book tells you something about what movies people want to see," said Morton Janklow, a literary agent.
As a result of this interest, New York agents are working more and more closely with co-agents in Los Angeles to sell options. Many work with the agent Michael Ovitz's company, Creative Artists Agency. Even if no film materializes, an option can be useful for a publisher in promoting a book. And when the option is taken early, it can help an agent sell a manuscript to a publisher.
When the appetite for a book is really hot, authors can sometimes do even better. They manage to skip the option stage entirely and sell a book outright. Although still rare, this is happening more.
For example, Kim Wozencraft's "Rush," a novel about a woman working as an undercover narcotics cop who becomes addicted to drugs herself, was sold last year through International Creative Management to the Zanuck Company for $1 million several months before the book was published. In fact, the book did not even do particularly well. And Dominick Dunne's novel, "An Inconvenient Woman," was sold through William Morris to ABC Television for $500,000 without ever being optioned.
Of course, such a big and direct sale does not always mean a big and successful movie. Tom Wolfe's best-selling novel "The Bonfire of the Vanities" was a seven-figure direct sale, but the movie has been a box-office disaster.
"There is a frenetic feel now to getting your hands on good material," said Jean Naggar, a literary agent, "but that does not mean more good movies are being made or even more movies.".

HEADLINE: Seeking a Place on Santa's List

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Hide this newspaper, Mom and Dad, and blindfold the children. Here is what Santa Claus is bringing next Christmas, or at least that is what the toy industry hopes.
Formally, the 88th Annual American International Toy Fair, which opens this morning, is a 10-day exhibition of the hottest new toys by nearly 1,400 toy makers for more than 20,000 buyers from retailers like Toys "R" Us, Wal-Mart and Macy's. 
 In reality, the toy fair is a giant schmooze-fest of worried adults trying to figure out what is happening to their industry and why 10-year-olds around the country did not want their toys at Christmas. The biggest buyers have already peeked at the lines of toys from the major toy companies and may have already signed orders, so they do not need to see most of the exhibits.
Notably, the fair is off-limits for exactly the people the products are meant for. "Absolutely no one under the age of 18 will be admitted to the toy fair," warn the materials supplied to visitors.
As the nation's toy makers gather today at the Toy Center of the World, at 200 Fifth Avenue, at 23d Street, and nearby 1107 Broadway, as well as at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center at 11th Avenue and 34th Street, the industry is having its troubles. Christmas was sluggish for most toy makers and retailers, and disastrous for some. The industry's consolidation continues apace.
Child World, the second-largest toy retailer after Toys "R" Us, said last week it was close to finding a buyer for the company. Last month, the Tonka Corporation, the nation's third-largest toy maker, agreed to be acquired for $516 million by Hasbro Inc., a deal that would make Hasbro the nation's largest toy company.
At a news conference this morning, the Toy Manufacturers of America, an industry trade group, will disclose just how bad the Christmas season was, and whether sales exceeded the $14 billion posted in 1989.
While the toy industry bends metal, cuts paper and molds plastic, it is hardly a traditional manufacturing business. It is more like advertising in that it depends on catchy ideas and imaginative marketing. But like manufacturing, the industry needs repeatable products to lower production costs and fatten profits. That is why a perennial like G.I. Joe or Barbie is worth 10 flashes-in-the-pan like Teddy Ruxpin or Masters of the Universe.
Mattel Inc. last year had revenues of nearly $1.5 billion, almost half from Barbie dolls -- a toy that is 32 years old. This year, Mattel is bringing out Lights and Lace Barbie, a hip version of the doll, which is being promoted with a doll of the rap music star M. C. Hammer. Mattel is also coming out with Shani, a black doll with a Barbie-like fondness for fashion, albeit African-influenced. Shani means marvelous in Swahili, Mattel says.
Inexpensive is also a byword at this year's recession-conscious toy fair, as companies try to introduce toys that are smaller and usually sell for less than $15.
Mattel has a whole line of toys smaller than a youngster's hand and built around the cult film, "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes," in which crazed fruit wreak havoc on San Diego. Hasbro is also introducing Tell Me Tots, tiny talking dolls less than 5 inches tall that use microchip technology.
 
'What We Will Take'
 "Toy Fair is an opportunity for Charles Lazarus to say, 'Here's what we will take and here's what we won't,' " said Sean P. McGowan, a toy industry analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company, referring to the chairman of Toys "R" Us.
Children and parents, speaking through the sales rung up on computerized inventory systems, will make the real decisions for toy retailers later in the year.
"The smart buyers will get a little bit of this and a little bit of that," Mr. McGowan said, "and then let their checkout scanners determine what they'll buy a lot of."
Topic A at the fair is likely to be how Hasbro's acquisition of Tonka will affect the competitive position of other toy makers.
Tonka's Parker Brothers game-board business, with popular perennials including Monopoly, is expected to fit well with Hasbro's Milton Bradley subsidiary, which has had strong recent hits like Shark Attack. One new Milton Bradley game will be Splat!, The Bug Squishin' Race Game, in which hapless arachnids are dispatched with glee.
Judging by past fairs, these annual get-togethers are not particularly accurate indicators of what will be the hot toys and which toy companies will come out ahead.
Neither Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles nor Slap Wraps, the wraparound bracelets, were products from major exhibitors, yet both were sensations in 1990.
And the biggest toy company of all does not even have an exhibit at the fair. Nintendo of America had 7 of the 20 best-selling toys in the country last month. The subsidiary of the Japanese company, the world's largest maker of computers and video games, and its licensees posted 1990 sales of $3.4 billion, or more than the combined total of Mattel and Hasbro, the top two United States toy companies. Nintendo showed its wares at a consumer electronics show in Las Vegas last month.

HEADLINE: Car Dealers Struggling To Survive

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DORON P. LEVINATLANTA, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Auto dealers have been going out of business in droves, and those who remain are adopting survival tactics. The intent is not only to lure customers, but to slash costs, motivate sales forces and bring more business to service departments.
Nearly all the dealers interviewed here over the weekend at the annual convention of the National Automobile Dealers Association said they were cutting employees and asking managers to do extra work. Others are providing entertainment to motivate their sales people, dismissing those who do not make enough sales, installing sophisticated financial controls and canceling advertisements. About 9,000 of the nation's 23,000 dealers attended the convention, a drop of 20 percent from last year. 
 Because more than half of the profit at many dealerships comes from operations like parts and used-cars sales and mechanical and body repairs, some dealers are going so far as to give away some services in the hope of attracting more business.
 
Free Oil Change
 Anyone who wants an oil change at no charge can stop by one of Vincent and Karen Radley's four dealerships in northern Virginia. While the oil is being changed, mechanics take note of potential problems, and nearly every customer is told that additional service or maintenance is needed.
"Ninety percent of the time, something needs to be taken care of," Mrs. Radley said, "even if it's only the Virginia inspection sticker."
And to save $500 a month on utility bills, the Havill-Spoerl Ford-Mercury service garage in Fort Atkinson, Wis., is now being heated by a $2,800 furnace that burns used motor oil.
About 1,200 dealers closed their doors in 1990, and J. David Power, an automotive consultant in Agoura Hills, Calif., predicts that 2,000 will close this year. Last week, the Chrysler Credit Corporation closed three Los Angeles dealerships belonging to Pete Ellis, one of Chrysler's biggest dealers.
Since the war started in the Persian Gulf, the already sluggish auto market has plunged to levels not seen since the oil embargo of 1979. The Big Three auto makers are posting huge losses and tens of thousands of auto workers have been laid off.
And while the economic climate is grim, it could be far worse, since interest rates are relatively low, making car payments relatively cheap, and gasoline prices have fallen while supplies have remained plentiful.
Part of the downturn is cyclical, since strong car sales never continue indefinitely, and the war has depressed sales by about a third. But marketing consultants, auto executives and even the dealers' trade group contend that automotive retailing is undergoing fundamental changes like those that have painfully altered the department store business.
The profit margins on new cars have plunged because the manufacturers have too much capacity in their factories, compared with the demand for cars. Also, many dealers invested in expensive real estate to enter the business, and the value of that property has plunged in many areas of the country.
 
Fortunes on Main Street
 While speculators struck it rich on Wall Street in the 1980's, many car dealers were building fortunes on Main Street. Dealerships were the most prosperous retail businesses in many towns, responsible for a significant number of jobs and tax revenues. Today, as before, their business depends on the confidence of retail customers, which several surveys have found to be at an all-time low.
Dealers also rely on their sales people, whose normally relentless enthusiasm has been dampened as the economy slowed and the gulf war began, leaving their showrooms deserted of potential buyers. "I'm convinced everyone is home watching CNN," said Mary Gezon, a Mitsubishi dealer in Grand Rapids, Mich.
While some dealers seek to build up their service operations, others seem content to wait out the recession, in the belief that new-car sales will soar with an economic recovery.
"As a group, dealers and sales people try to stay positive," said Allan Wilbur, public affairs director of the dealers' association. "They're suckers for positive news -- hope -- anything they can look forward to" that might re-ignite sales. "Like the end of the war," he added.
 
Enormous Monthly Outlays
 With investments in land and buildings running into millions of dollars and enormous monthly outlays to finance their inventories of unsold vehicles, few dealers can afford to wait idly for buyers to reappear. Mr. Radley said he must pay about $330 a month in interest to keep an Acura Legend sedan in his showroom.
Like many large corporations, some dealerships have grown fat and bureacratic. They have had to cut expenses drastically and try to increase revenue in some unusual ways.
Dealers have been able to raise profits in tough times by selling products like rustproofing, paint sealants, fabric protection and extended warranties to new-car buyers. But in recent years, auto makers have improved paint, upholstery and warranty protection, reducing the need for many of the products. "Besides, there's too much competition to gouge customers," said Scott Norman of NCM Associates, an automotive consulting concern in Overland Park, Kan.
Jerry Slonsky, a General Motors dealer based in Kingman, Ariz., is spending $20,000 to install his own "quick change" oil bay in one of his service departments to attract new customers. Instead of paying another company to fix about 20 nicked windshields each month, he is considering buying a kit so that one of his workers can do the job, saving $5 or $10 for each windshield.
To save money, Mr. Slonsky has also stopped buying pizzas for his sales staff on Saturdays.
Mr. Radley, on the other hand, contends that it is essential to keep his sales people in good spirits. "The other night we took everyone bowling," at a cost of $120, he said. "And afterward, everyone was laughing and happy. It carried over to the next day. When you're selling, attitude is so important."
But Mr. Radley has also sent another message, dismissing the sales people who brought in the fewest sales at each of his dealerships.
The dealers' association is receiving scores of telephone calls a week from dealers around the country eager for advice on how to prevent their businesses from failing, Mr. Wilbur said. Ray Green, a Chevrolet dealer from Springfield, Ill. who is president of the group, has suggested that "the dealer and top managers should rent a motel room, to separate themselves emotionally from their businesses, and go over everything item by item -- parts, service, sales -- and make the tough changes."
 
'Cut From the Bottom'
 "One trick," Mr. Norman said, "is to list everyone in the dealership in the order of whom you would hire back, and then cut from the bottom."
With every customer so precious, dealers are going to what would once have been considered extremes to shed their image as slick operators willing to deceive customers. Mr. Slonsky invites buyers back to his dealerships for forums "where they can tell us about the floormats the salesman promised them and they've never received."
Will Graves Jr. went so far as to post his home telephone number on every car he sold, part of an elaborate effort at his Chrysler dealership in Falls Church, Va., to convince customers that they were receiving straightforward, fair treatment and could find him if they had a problem.
 
A Dealer's Luck Changes
 But the dealership's sales dropped from more than 70 a month in 1988, when he bought the outlet, to about 20. As his cash dwindled, he said, he tried without success to get more credit from Chrysler's finance subsidiary. He fell far behind on his interest payments for cars he had not sold, he said, and in December half of his 36 employees agreed to work temporarily without pay.
Then on Jan. 24, at the request of Chrysler, Fairfax County deputies rushed into the dealership, blocked the driveways, seized more than 100 vehicles and padlocked the doors. Mr. Graves, who is married and has two children, said he lost his car and his house, had no money and owed Chrysler $2.6 million.
Mr. Graves said he had begun working as a consultant to help other troubled dealers.

HEADLINE: BRITISH AIR TAKES A THIRD OFF FARE TO CROSS ATLANTIC

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
A major fare war erupted over the North Atlantic yesterday when British Airways cut its main trans-Atlantic fare by a third and greatly reduced the penalties for cancellations. The moves sharply increase the financial pressure on Trans World Airlines and Pan American World Airways, its ailing rivals.
A spokesman for T.W.A. promptly said the airline would match or beat British Airways' reduction in its advance-purchase fare. Pan Am is likely to do the same. 
 That British Airways is offering the steep fare reductions to Britain throughout the peak summer travel period is a highly unusual move for a major airline. Summers are often the time when airlines pile up profits to sustain themselves through quieter periods.
 
Fall in Airline Traffic Cited
 British Airways said its decision reflected the steep fall in airline traffic that has resulted from fears of terrorism and weakening economies on both sides of the Atlantic. By acting first, British Airways, the largest and financially strongest airline flying the Atlantic, put Pan Am and T.W.A. in a bind.
If they do not match the lower fare, they will lose travelers to British Air. If they do lower their fares, their already dismal profit margins will shrink.
Pan Am has already filed for bankruptcy protection, while T.W.A. last week defaulted on some payments to bondholders. "This is just about the final blow for both of them," said George W. James, the chairman of Airline Economics, a Washington-based consulting firm.
The fare announced yesterday is $521 for a weekend roundtrip flight from New York to London in late spring and $628 during the summer. Tickets must be bought by March 15 and at least 30 days before traveling. British Airways and Pan Am have been charging $778 and $938 for the respective periods.
John W. Lampl, a spokesman for British Airways, said the fare cuts would benefit the entire travel industry by breaking a deep slump in international travel.
The British Airways decision comes on the heels of rancorous negotiations between the United States and British Governments over the proposed sales of most of Pan Am's London routes to United Airlines and all of T.W.A.'s London routes to American Airlines.
Both Pan Am and T.W.A. fly to the congested Heathrow Airport near London, and the British Government has banned any new airlines from flying there since 1977.
Pan Am and T.W.A. had arranged the deals to obtain cash to meet interest payments on their debts. But the British Govrnment argued that if strong United States carriers like United and American were allowed to compete at Heathrow, then the United States should allow British Airways to compete more broadly in the United States.
Specifically, British Airways wants to be able to fly passengers on domestic routes in the United States and to own more than the 25 percent of the voting stock of American carriers that is currently allowed, Mr. Lampl said.
 
U.S. Government Policy
 Samuel K. Skinner, the United States Secretary of Transportation, has expressed a willingness to allow foreign airlines to hold larger stakes in American carriers, though not with corresponding voting rights.
It would require an act of Congress to allow incoming international flights of foreign airlines to pick up passengers in one American city and carry them to the flight's final destination in another American city.
The Department of Transportation has approved Pan Am's deal with United Airlines and T.W.A.'s sale of its Chicago-London route to American Airlines.
A department spokesman last night declined to comment on the British Airways' move.
British Airways is cutting by a third its advanced purchase excursion fare to London from the 18 United States cities that it serves. The new fares also apply on nonstop flights to Manchester, England, and to Glasgow.
The Apex fare is the most common rate paid by vacation travelers, who typically make up about three-quarters of the air traffic over the North Atlantic. Full coach fares, which are used most frequently by business travelers and which can be bought right up to flight time, are not being reduced.
 
14-Day Cancellation Offer
 Besides offering the lower fares, British Airways said it would give refunds to anyone who canceled a ticket at least 14 days in advance, instead of the usual 30 days. Anyone canceling less than 14 days in advance will receive a voucher equal to the value of the canceled ticket that can be used to buy any British Airways ticket for 12 months, the airline said.
T.W.A. has been charging the same as British Airways for tickets purchased at least 30 days in advance, but it has allowed no refunds except in cases of personal emergency.
Yesterday's price cuts leave British Airways' Apex fares less expensive than they were last summer, more than compensating for the company's several recent fare increases because of higher jet fuel costs, Mr. Lampl said.
 
Effect of Fuel Costs
 Airlines never raised their ticket prices enough to recoup their higher costs for jet fuel, particularly last autumn, he said.
Mr. Morrison of T.W.A. said the airline had kept its trans-Atlantic flights fairly full despite the recession and worries about terrorism. But it has sharply cut back the number of its trans-Atlantic flights to do so. British Airways has also eliminated many flights to reduce surplus capacity.
British Airways claims to hold 39 percent of the British-American market. Pan Am has 15 percent, T.W.A. 14 percent, and Virgin Atlantic 7 percent.
Mr. James of Airline Economics said that since war began in the Persian Gulf on Jan. 17, passenger traffic has been down by 15 percent to 40 percent from last year's levels, both on most domestic routes in the United States and on routes to Western Europe.
"And a year ago wasn't all that great," he added.

HEADLINE: At State Universities, Wounds From Budget Cuts Are Visible

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BINGHAMTON, N.Y.

 BODY:
At the State University Center at Binghamton, courses once limited to 25 students now have 45. Sophomores trying to fulfill lab requirements in physics must wait until senior year because of cutbacks in the equipment budget. The running track has so many potholes that sprinters practice in a parking lot.
At the main campus of New Jersey's state university, Rutgers, in New Brunswick, class sizes are also growing, library hours have been cut and the wait for students to use a computer has stretched to as much as 36 hours. 
 At these universities and at dozens of other public colleges and universities in New York, New Jersey and surrounding states, the term "budget crisis" is no longer an abstract threat. As state governments cut spending to deal with growing budget shortfalls, the effects are being felt on campus.
 
Withering of 'Public Ivy'
 As a result, another crisis is growing: one of confidence in the ability of public colleges to maintain their hard-won standards.
"We are pulling every trick we know to keep up with our reputation as a public Ivy," said Peter E. Wagner, provost and vice president for academic affairs at Binghamton, one of the State University of New York's four flagship university centers. "But our ability to keep doing so is very limited."
Students and administrators complain of the erosion in quality that stems from cutbacks in everything from maintenance to faculty hiring. Alison Gillespie, a senior English major at Rutgers, said: "What bothers me is this feeling that you really have to put up a fight to get your education. Since I first came here, class sizes have increased unbelievably. You're not just competing for electives; you're competing to get into your required courses."
New Jersey's direct support to its universities and community colleges was cut to $765.4 million this fiscal year from about $800 million the year before. Gov. Jim Florio recently recommended a budget of $703.8 million for the coming year, representing a two-year drop of 12 percent.
Rutgers's appropriation is $216 million this year, down from $238 million the previous year, and a further 8 percent cut is expected for the next year.
In New York, the university system is preparing to cut nearly 10 percent from its $1.5 billion budget. At Binghamton, which says it needed $74.6 million this year to maintain all programs, a series of cuts left the campus with a revised 1990-91 budget of $71 million.
 
Connecticut Also Hurting
 The University of Connecticut has been told its $150 million state appropriation will be cut to $137 million. And Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has warned state agencies that a 20 percent spending cut may be necessary. That would reduce state financing for UConn by an additional $17 million. A university spokeswoman, Karen Grava Williams, said a $30 million cut could force the university to limit enrollment to 21,000. It now has 25,000 students.
Similar strains have been felt in all but a handful of states in the last few years, as the rate of increase in state financing for higher education has dropped to a 30-year low, according to a survey by the Center for Higher Education at Illinois State University.
But the effects have been starkest in the Northeast. The survey found that in maintaining spending compared with two years ago, Massachusetts ranked 50th, New Jersey 49th, Rhode Island 48th, New Hampshire 47th, Connecticut 46th and New York 44th.
The budget cuts are affecting every public campus, including the jewels of the systems, like Binghamton, which accepted only 36 percent of its applicants in 1989, and Rutgers, where its University College accepted only 29 percent.
 
Cutbacks in Engineering
 At Binghamton, budget cuts mean the engineering school will offer 20 fewer classes, down from 260, this semester, all because of delays in hiring replacements for departing faculty members. The nursing school has made similar reductions. The size of remaining classes has been increased by 5 to 15 percent, officials said.
The engineering school is already considering cutting the number of students it accepts next fall.
In the history department, lack of money for new faculty has left it without full-time appointments in colonial history and constitutional history.
In the library, subscriptions for more than 600 academic journals were canceled in the last year -- about 10 percent of the library's total.
 
Legacy of the 80's
 In some ways the campuses struggling with questions of where to cut are victims of their own past optimism. Having expanded programs and even enrollment during the 1980's, when department budgets sometimes grew well beyond the rate of inflation, they now have to scale back.
But to a large degree the schools are constrained in how they can deal with new fiscal realities. Personnel costs, which account for more than two-thirds of the budget at Binghamton, are mostly beyond the university's control; salaries and benefits of nearly all employees are negotiated by unions and the Cuomo administration.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo recently called for a $500-a-year increase in annual tuition at the university, to $2,150. That would come on top of a $300 increase approved at the end of last year. At Rutgers, tuition for New Jersey residents has increased about 10 percent a year since 1982, to $2,856.
Tuition at private colleges costs thousands of dollars more, but students at public colleges argue that the increases they must pay, coupled with state cutbacks, means they end up paying more for less.
 
Layoffs in New Brunswick
 The tuition increase at Rutgers has come as New Jersey has cut its appropriation to its higher education system, which includes Rutgers's three campuses in New Brunswick, Newark and Camden, nine smaller state colleges as well as a network of community colleges. For Rutgers, tuition increases have only partly offset those cuts.
To further deal with them, the school's sprawling New Brunswick campus has also dismissed about 360 people out of 6,000 on the payroll.
The average size of a class has increased over the last decade by more than 10 percent, from 38 to 42, and it is expected to go up more with the next round of cuts. Some classes are even larger than that, and overcrowded. Some English classes had enrollments of 450 last semester for lecture halls that seat 400; in December, some students were forced to take their final exam while sprawled out in the aisles.
 
Postponing the Deferred
 "We're working very hard to preserve quality, especially the quality of our faculty," said Paul L. Leath, the provost at New Brunswick, where 33,000 students are enrolled. "But after a while it's like administering a house of cards. There's a feeling that the whole structure could come down."
Such an analogy may not be so figurative. At Rutgers, for instance, a long-range program to catch up on deferred maintenance projects -- leaking roofs, crumbling masonry and dozens of other needed repairs -- has itself been deferred, indefinitely.
But beyond the physical plant and the size of classes, top administrators at the schools say that something else that holds their campuses together -- morale -- is also imperiled. And as teaching loads and class sizes increase, the ideal at the heart of any teaching university -- an open relationship between students and faculty -- also appears to be under strain.
Kathy Wise, a 21-year-old English major from Brooklyn, said that few of her seminars had fewer than 40 people in them. "The professors don't really know you at all," she said, even though they are expected to grade students in part on their discussion skills.
 
Down to One Term Paper
 A political science professor at Rutgers, Michael Shafer, now has 95 students in his lecture courses in international political economy and 190 in a class on American foreign policy, both up considerably from a few years ago.
That increase, combined with cuts in the budget for teaching assistants, has forced him to change how he assesses students. Where most of his classes used to require two papers, a midterm exam and a final exam, they are now down to a paper and a final "for the simple reason that I can't grade that many papers," Professor Shafer said.
What students are getting for their money is an issue separate from, though related to, an emotional one now sweeping campuses: How much they should pay to begin with.
Students appear to differ on whether they are willing to pay more tuition. Some say yes, but others say no because they believe that the state would just use the extra revenue for needs outside the university and that campus budgets would be cut anyway. Whatever the view, however, the concern that education is suffering now appears to rival tuition as a protest issue.
At Rutgers, a group called the Campaign for an Affordable Rutgers Education maintains that the real menace to their education is not just budget cuts but the university's investments in high-technology research centers that most undergraduates never step foot in.
"This should not be set up as a split between science and humanities," said Mia Ji, a spokeswoman for the group and a sophomore anthropology and political science major. "It's a split between expensive research and its mission to provide undergraduate education."
Another area of possible cutbacks, described as retrenchment in academic circles, is a political minefield. When SUNY's Chancellor, Dr. D. Bruce Johnstone, warned recently that budget cuts might require the closing of some of the system's 64 campuses, the idea was shot down in the Capitol.
Despite the severity of the state's budget problems, Governor Cuomo said he saw no reason to close any campuses. Lawmakers, many of whom represent districts where campuses are important social and cultural centers, also vowed to oppose closings.
In the State University system, the largest in the nation with about 400,000 students and one that guarantees a spot to anybody with a high school degree, another debate may be at hand. Because the state subsidizes $6,500 of each student's education each year, some officials fear it may wind up abandoning the open-access policy.
"New York has long prided itself on access, and the dual value of access and quality is what has made the state great," said President DeFleur at Binghamton. "There's no question about that. But those values are very much coming into conflict right now."

Leath, said.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Financing;
U.S. Has Received $50 Billion in Pledges for War

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
For the first time since the American Revolution, the United States is accepting financial contributions from other countries to pay for a war.
Thus far, Administration officials said, the United States has received pledges of more than $50 billion to cover military costs through the end of March, and more money will be forthcoming if the war lasts longer. The main contributors are Saudi Arabia, which has pledged $16.8 billion; Kuwait, $16 billion; Japan, $10.7 billion, and Germany $6.6 billion. 
 "I think what people who are concerned about this have not realized is that we are getting significant support committed from overseas," President Bush said at a news conference on Tuesday.
That statement seemed to be part of an effort by the President and top Administration officials to convince Congress and the public that while this country was providing a major share of the troops, planes, ships and weapons for the war with Iraq, most of the tab, at least in the beginning, would not be picked up by American taxpayers.
 
Breakdown of Aid Given
 The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Richard G. Darman, gave Congress the first complete breakdown of how much allied countries had pledged and actually donated since American troops began arriving in Saudi Arabia in August.
The Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, David C. Mulford, called a news conference to describe how the United States had solicited billions of dollars more to help Middle Eastern countries whose economies had been damaged by the war, principally Egypt, Turkey and Jordan.
And John H. Sununu, the President's chief of staff, said in an interview that the Bush Administration was not in the least uncomfortable about passing the hat to raise money to fight a war for the first time since the French and the Dutch helped pay for George Washington's troops. "Only one country can conduct high-technology hostilities, and that is the United States," Mr. Sununu said. The other countries, he added, will benefit from it and can well afford to pay for it.
 
Deployment Cost $11 Billion
 By Mr. Darman's calculations, the United States spent $11.1 billion more on defense last year than it would have if American troops not been sent to the Persian Gulf.
Allied countries promised to contribute $9.7 billion in 1990, Mr. Darman said, and as of last week the United States had received $5.3 billion in cash and $1.3 billion worth of fuel, equipment and other materiel. Mr. Darman said he was confident that the rest of the commitments would be met, meaning that the cost to the United States for operations in the Persian Gulf last year would total $1.4 billion -- less than the $2 billion Congress appropriated.
Mr. Darman declined to say which countries had not met their pledges for last year. But through the end of January, according to the Congressional Budget Office, Saudi Arabia had given $1.61 billion of its 1990 pledge of $3.3 billion; Japan had given $1.08 billion of a pledge of $1.74 billion, and Germany had given $340 million of a pledge of $1.07 billion.
The Kuwaitis donated $2.5 billion last year by transferring $250 million to the United States Treasury each week for 10 weeks beginning in early October.
 
War Costs $500 Million a Day
 No one knows how much the actual war, which began Jan. 16, will cost, but officials have said that they expected the average cost to be about $500 million a day.
To fight the war for the first three months of this year, the allies have pledged $41.78 billion, a figure Mr. Darman told the Senate Budget Committee would likely "turn out to be a very, very substantial portion of the actual cost incurred."
The pledges for January through March break down this way: Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, $13.5 billion each; Japan, $9 billion; Germany, $5.5 billion, and Korea, $280 million.
Administration officials said that all of the donations, except possibly part of Saudi Arabia's, is to be in cash. "There is a specific payment schedule agreed to, and we expect that to be honored," Mr. Darman said.
 
Opposition in Japan
 In Japan, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has met considerable parliamentary opposition to his pledge to the United States for the war effort, but he is expected to win approval eventually. To help him with his political difficulties, Mr. Kaifu got an agreement from the United States this week that the Japanese money would be used for noncombat purposes such as food, transport and medicines.
The Governments in Japan and Germany have said they plan to increase taxes to raise their war contributions.
In addition to the military assistance, Mr. Mulford said last week that the United States had commitments of $14.3 billion for financial aid to economically hard-hit countries in the Middle East. As of Feb. 6, $6.7 billion had actually been disbursed, almost all of it to Egypt, Turkey and Jordan. Last week, after King Hussein of Jordan announced his support for Iraq, the State Department said it would review American aid to the Jordan. Treasury officials said they did not know whether the allied assistance would be affected.
Of these pledges, wealthy Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait promised $9.5 billion; countries in the European Community, $2.3 billion; Japan, $2.1 billion and other countries $400 million.

HEADLINE: New Industry for Outer Banks: Home to Retirees

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAGS HEAD, N.C.

 BODY:
Bill and Abelina Reid came here from Vermont for the sea and the solitude. Bill and Betty Logan came from New Jersey for the memories: the dunes and marshes of the Outer Banks were the landscape of their honeymoon. Francis Rogallo, an aeronautical engineer who developed the hang glider, came for the winds, just as the Wright Brothers did 80 years before.
The Reids, the Logans, Mr. Rogallo and 2,000 or so others who move like them are part of the Outer Banks' newest industry. All retired, all with some money put away and all besotted by the timelessness of these elongated islands, they are a driving force behind the boom that brought about 9,000 new residents to Dare County, making it one of the fastest-growing rural counties in America. 
 Dare County is a prime example of one of the demographic trends reshaping the country: retirement to the scenic corners of rural America. While half of the country's 2,383 rural counties lost population during the 1980's, the decade was a period of robust growth for new retirement and recreation areas.
 
Now Towns Look to Retirement
 "Some towns that might have gone after a shirt factory before to boost their economy are now looking for retirement communities," said Calvin Beale, a senior demographer at the United States Agriculture Department who follows rural population trends. "It's a clean industry. It's a renewable resource."
Mr. Beale, who estimated that the population of rural retirement areas grew by nearly 16 percent over the decade, calculated in an article to be published soom that "movement of older people into rural and small-town areas has become so common" that a fifth of all rural counties are classed as retirement counties.
The Outer Banks did not have to seek people. As the sands of the Atlantic seaboard from New Jersey to Virginia were filling with people, the Outer Banks began to inherit the overflow. While Mr. Beale classifies the county as "recreation-retirement," the retirees are only the leading edge of an influx of urban refugees of all ages.
According to the new census figures, Dare County grew by 70 percent in the past decade, its population rising from 13,400 to 22,800.
About one in four residents is 55 or older, as against a national average of slightly more than one in five. But school enrollment, a reflection of the migration of younger families, also rose by 51 percent in the decade, from 2,150 to 3,250.
The passionate attraction that brings people here to cast for bluefish in the surf or to soar from high dunes in a hang glider makes the town's inevitable growing pains all the sharper. As each new person arrives to enjoy the tranquillity, a little is lost.
"It was only supposed to be a one-year thing, my staying here," said 26-year-old Carl Curnett, an actor who first visited the Outer Banks as part of the troupe that performs a summer play about the first English colony in America. "Now I'm planning on a second year."
Now he is a tour guide on the "Elizabeth II," a model of the 16th century ship that brought the first colony that brings tourists to its dock on Albermarle Sound. But the tourists, like the new residents, are changing the landscape. Each new septic tank strains the marshy, sandy soil, and the more the fishermen, the fewer the fish.
Development divides the residents into smaller and smaller interest groups with often conflicting financial and emotional attitudes about growth.
Michael Daniels, a fisherman and scion of one of the oldest and largest families on the Outer Banks remembers "when you got boats coming in with 80,000 pounds of fish. Now on a big day you'll get maybe 15,000." He suspects that runoff from the newly paved areas is carrying chemicals into the offshore waters.
 
Some Profit From Growth
 But his family and other natives, owners of vast tracts of the area two generations ago, were among those to profit from the growth when real estate prices soared. Sybil Basnight, a cousin of Mr. Daniels and the president of the environmental group Friends of Roanoke Island, said many natives used to feel that restrictions on growth were an intrusion on their property rights. Now, she says, some are not so sure.
If there were no controls, development could leave wells dry. Maps of the Army Corps of Engineers indicate that 85 percent of the county is marshland. There are controls, but they have not always been effective. "We have a coastal management program approved in Washington, D.C.," said Mrs. Basnight. "These are public trust waters. There's a tolerance level. You can take only so much development without real severe deterioration."
There are strong -- and mixed -- feelings among the newcomers, too. Some 10-year or 15-year residents wince at every new mall that goes up. But other newcomers are busily building malls or selling imported kites to the tourists who flock here in the summer by the tens of thousands.
The one binding force is opposition to tax increases. But some newcomers have arrived in once-rural North Carolina with a taste for the public services available in the suburbs they left.
A gleaming new adult services center was built about two years ago at a cost of more than $500,000, so retirees have a place to make pottery or do low-impact aerobics. Staffing and maintenance of the center cost the county about $150,000 a year. And two new schools have been built; officals are now looking for the money to furnish them.
The county's overall budget has climbed fourfold since 1980. with the greatest increases in planning, now $632,000, up thirteenfold from 1980; sanitation costs, up eightfold, to $1.84 million; schools, up thirteenfold to $11.2 million, and emergency medical services, up sevenfold, to $1.87 million.
There is no local hospital. The state health authorities have turned down two requests for a certificate of need, said Ray Sturza, the county's planner. said. Emergency petients are taken either by ambulance to Elizabeth City, more than an hour away, or by helicopter to Norfolk, Va. The helicopter service costs the county more than $1 million a year.
Although the pace of growth has slowed in these days of recession, the demand for services has not slackened.
But Mr. Sturza says the county government's ability to raise revenue is limited since 84 percent of the land in the county is publicly owned.
The squeeze became intense two years ago and a property reassessment sent taxes soaring. The anger from that change exploded during the last election, and Mr. Daniels, chairman of the county board, was voted out of office.
Opposition to new taxes is something all factions in the county can agree on. Development is not.
"I don't know that there's that much terrible opposition to development," said Louise Dollard, the new chairman of the county's governing board. Like many others, Ms. Dollard moved here when she retired. "Frankly, when I first arrived, there wasn't a doctor and you couldn't get your teeth done. When all these people started moving in, it improved our life."
But she has become concerned about overbuilding. "It hurts for the county commissioners to issue permits for what shouldn't be. Certain regulations should be tighter."
Some newcomers are among the most adamant of those who want to slow the pace of new growth.
"Once you get in your residence, you don't want any more of that development," said Mr. Rogallo said.
"A developer couldn't be elected to the city council in Southern Shores," said Bob Oliver, 81. How does he feel about the man who built his home? "He is an artist."

HEADLINE: Dependence and Sovereignty Pull at Panama's Equilibrium

SERIES: After Noriega: Panama Adapts

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA

 BODY:
More than 13 months after the United States invaded Panama and arrested Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, most of the problems that have plagued the nation for years remain. Panama is still searching for its own identity and seems linked more than ever to Washington.
The economy here has rebounded and political freedoms have expanded since General Noriega's ouster, arrest and extradition to Florida to face trial on drug trafficking charges. But cocaine continues to be smuggled through Panama on its way to the United States and other destinations. 
 Popular support for the Government has weakened, as have the cheers for the American invasion. And President Guillermo Endara, who was installed on the day of the invasion, remains highly dependent on the 10,000 American troops in the country, relying on them, as he did two months ago, to thwart attempts by some in the security forces to retake power.
Panamanian officials say they want to assert an independent identity, but their failure to construct an effective and popular Government appears to insure that Washington will not be able to withdraw the shadow it casts over this small nation of 2.3 million people any time soon.
"No matter how good the invasion was for us, it was a trauma we can't shake," said Roberto Troncoso, president of the Panamanian Committee for Human Rights. "The United States overthrew the generals they tolerated for so many years, but this Government hasn't been able to put the word 'democracy' back in our dictionary."
With its many glistening shopping centers, banks, high-rise condominiums and Dairy Queen drive-ins, the capital of Panama could be a city in Florida.
The resemblance is more than cosmetic. In its essential political character, Panama has not changed since President Theodore Roosevelt, seeking a subservient country in which to dig a transoceanic canal, encouraged the rebellion that separated the isthmus from Colombia.
Just as the first President of Panama was installed by United States forces, so was President Endara. Panama's unit of currency remains the United States dollar.
 
Local Sovereignty Vs. Relying on U.S.
 Mr. Endara conceded that democracy in Panama is weak, but said it is "getting stronger by the day." He said it would be more stable if the $461 million aid program from the United States had only come through faster to "jump start" the economy.
Even while the Endara Government affirms its dependency, it must assert its autonomy to obtain popular support. The United States is demanding tougher enforcement against drugs and money-laundering, or routing illicit profits through intermediaries to disguise the source of the money. Panama officials say such demands are intrusions on their sovereignty.
Sniping between Panama City and Washington has risen to the point that Foreign Minister Julio Linares and the United States Ambassador, Deane Hinton, engaged in a public shouting match at a recent party at the Vatican embassy over a proposed agreement to crack down on money-laundering.
Washington has frozen $84 million in aid for agriculture, education and health until Panama agrees to open Panamanian bank accounts to United States officials investigating money-laundering, much of it related to drug trafficking. Mr. Endara says he has no objection to provisions of the Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement to fight money-laundering, but says provisions to combat insider trading and tax evasion offend his nation's sovereignty.
Two United States officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believe some Panamanian authorities are covering for some of the banks. They noted that several senior officials have served as directors and lawyers for banks allegedly involved in past money-laundering. Senior Government officials denied that they or others in responsible public positions had ever been involved in the practice.
 
Ghosts of Past Haunt Endara
 More friction has been caused by Panama's refusal to sign an agreement providing joint naval patrols to stop drug trafficking in Panamanian waters. United States officials said that, while Panamanian drug arrests have increased, Panama City alone cannot control the increased amounts of cocaine being shipped through Panama and Central America now that international law enforcement has improved in Caribbean waters.
"Their dignity is intact," Ambassador Hinton commented sarcastically, "but the drugs continue to pour in."
"I think the frictions come from too high expectations by the United States of what the Panamanians were going to do, and too high expectations by the Panamanians of what the United States was going to do," he said.
Mr. Endara said the Governments would work out their differences. His more serious task, he said, is to guarantee that democratically elected civilians succeed him.
In his office, as he gazed through a crystal chandelier at the ornate, inlaid portraits of past leaders, including Brig. Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera, the former Chief of Government, and Noriega's figurehead presidents, on the wall of his office, Mr. Endara waved his finger through the air and sighed, "He was thrown out, he was thrown out, he was thrown out.
"When I first got here," he said, "I wanted to climb up a stepladder with a can of spray paint and wipe them out."
 
Rebel Uprising Reveals Weakness
 The fragility of Panama's democracy and the persistence of its dependence were revealed Dec. 4, when 50 former members of the Panama Defense Force of General Noriega revolted and First Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon called the American military for help in putting down the rebellion, centered on the Tinajitas barracks outside Panama City.
Col. James Steele of the United States Army, then commander of the United States Military Support Group, instructed the civilian commander of the Public Force to surround and retake Tinajitas. But the Panamanian commander found that most officers either tacitly supported the uprising or sat on the fence. The rebels then occupied the Public Force national headquarters, where they were resisted only by Colonel Steele and other American military advisers.
Hundreds of American troops put down the rebellion.
Ebrahim Asvat, commander of the Public Force, said the revolt was "an anachronism. It was like they were dancing a tango in an era when rap music is in fashion." He has dismissed 100 Public Force members since then and says he is confident of the unit's loyalty.
But other Panamanian and American officials said the rebels' underground whereabouts are known by the Public Force, which indicates continuing coordination. American offiicials say they believe about 200 former Noriega troops to have formed terrorist groups.
 
New Security Force Full of Old Guard
 Fearing that a complete purging of Noriega's defeated 16,000-man army would unleash an uncontrollable force of well-trained, resentful thugs, the Government is trying to reform the old force with a training program designed by the United States Justice Department. The Government says 60 percent of all Noriega officers with the rank of captain and above have been purged, but many Panamanians remain fearful because more than 90 percent of the current Public Force members served in the Panama Defense Force.
"Do you know a tiger that has ever converted into a vegetarian?" asked Miguel Antonio Bernal, a law professor at the University of Panama. "The December uprising is proof they are still tigers."
Conversations with several Public Force members suggest that the attitudes inculcated during the decades of military rule linger.
As they patrolled the steamy, garbage-strewn barrios of Colon, Patricio Martinez and Gerardo Morales, Public Force corporals who are veterans of the Noriega force, expressed reservations about the civilian Government and nostalgia for the old regime. "The Government is too close to the gringos," Mr. Morales said. "Sincerely speaking, the invasion was a massacre of the people."
Mr. Martinez said the Government would have to raise police salaries or there would be trouble.
The Government, in arrears by $540 million on its $4 billion debt, says it has too little money for its needs. It must refurbish the ports and railroad that serve the Panama Canal before the international shipping community transports more of its goods by train across the United States. Judges must be appointed and courts built to rehabilitate a judicial system that has more than a thousand people jailed for months without being charged.
 
Trouble Blamed On Infighting
 But many problems, Western diplomats and aid officials said, come from the infighting of the coalition Government, particularly between Mr. Arias of the center-left Christian Democratic Party and Second Vice President Guillermo Ford of the center-right Molirena Party.
The Treasury, which is in the hands of the Molirena Party, is halting funding earmarked for ministries under Christian Democratic control, which is slowing many social projects, diplomats said. Christian Democratic leaders are so angry that they are considering withdrawing from the Government.
Mr. Endara, the diplomats say, has failed to demonstrate the leadership needed to glue the coalition together. Cabinet members say he appears inattentive at meetings. The newspapers show the President no respect, depicting the 250-pound leader in front-page photographs eating hefty slices of chocolate cake. He is the butt of jokes about his hunger strikes for more United States aid and about his new wife, Anna Mae, who at 25 is less than half the age of the 54-year-old Mr. Endara.
Still, Panama's annual per capita income of $2,000 is substantially higher than that of most of its neighbors, and its hospitals and schools are among the best in Latin America. Political parties now operates freely. After routinely disobeying the law, Panamanians are beginning to pay their taxes and even obey traffic lights.
A retail and construction boom led to a 4 percent increase in the gross national product last year. Panamanian bank deposits increased by more than $3 billion last year, indicating that capital flight is beginning to reverse. The casinos and hotels are filling up as foreign investors and deep-sea fishermen return. Independent economists, however, question how much the poor are benefiting from the growth, particularly since the Government has cut thousands of public sector jobs.
 
Economic Forecast Fails to Ignite Hope
 United States and Panamanian officials say unemployment has dropped from 31 percent to 20 percent since the invasion (it was 12 percent before the two years of United States economic sanctions leading up to the invasion), and that brighter days lie ahead.
"Nobody expected that Operation Just Cause would eliminate all of the corruption and inefficiencies that had grown up in Panama after 20 years of dictatorship," said Bernard W. Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Interamerican Affairs, "but what it did do was open up the possibility of change and hope."
But hopes among the poor and lower middle class who make up two-thirds of the population have evaporated, recent polls indicate. In interviews, they say they resent the lawyers and bankers who hold the top posts in the Government as descendants of the oligarchy overthrown in 1968 by Mr. Torrijos, then a colonel in the National Guard.
Many poor people say that, despite its excesses, the old military regime at least looked out for their economic interests. Noriega's corruption and repression drove a wedge between the masses and the military, but now many poor people say they feel let down by a President they once hoped would see to their interests.
Graffiti asserting "Torrijos Lives" is appearing on barrio walls across Panama City, reflecting the disappointment in the new democracy. Voter turnout was exceedingly low in the special elections on Jan. 26 in nine of 67 legislative districts where the 1989 balloting was annulled because of fraud. Three parties tied to the Noriega regime won five seats, while President Endara's Arnulfista Party won none. Analysts said they did not believe the results signified that Noriega is making a comeback, but that the Government is totally discredited.
"We know they are only interested in serving themselves, the rich and the United States," said Franklin Bedoya, a 32-year-old boxing trainer at Panama City's Maranon gymnasium. "Panama is a better place now than it was before the invasion, but the Government is firing thousands. I see more young boys come to the gym all the time. It's a form of escape, and where else are you going to get a job?"
 
People Reassess U.S. Invasion
 In the rundown Colon slum of El Vaticano, where the overcrowded wooden Victorian-style tenements are sagging from rot, local Roman Catholic priests say that increasing family violence, alcoholism, and drug abuse are symptoms of growing alienation.
"Endara said he was going to give us jobs with help from the American Government," said Robert Anthony Simons, a 33-year-old unemployed dock worker of Jamaican descent. "But now all he does is fire us." Sidestepping children playing barefoot in a stream of raw sewage, he recalled, "People here voted for Endara in 1989 because we wanted to get rid of Noriega, but we wouldn't now."
"If we ever rose up, Endara would simply call in the Rangers," he said, referring to the United States Army.
The perceived failures of the Endara Government are rubbing off on the Bush Administration, and some Panamanians are reassessing their once unquestioning support for the 1989 invasion.
Late last year, a musical opened in Panama City entitled "Meastra Vida" (Teacher Life). In one scene an invading unit of American soldiers offered first aid to some Panamanians wounded in the rocketing of the El Chorrillo barrio. At the opening performance, the audience began to jeer at the actors. "People cried," recalled Norman Douglas, the director, "because they felt impotent."
The playwright adjusted the script to satisfy his audience. For the next six weeks of performances, the same American troops roughed up the Panamanians. The show was a hit.

HEADLINE: Germany Stands Alone on Rates

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Feb. 10

 BODY:
The German central bank's surprising decision to increase interest rates last month has raised new questions about Germany's commitment to international cooperation in general and to Western Europe's goals of economic integration and monetary union in particular.
In the week after Jan. 31, when the central bank, the Bundesbank, raised two important rates by half a percentage point each, the dollar fell to new lows against the mark. 
 The decline of the dollar was hastened by the decision a day later by the Federal Reserve Board in the United States to cut its discount rate, also by half a percentage point. The dollar's decline came despite three days of intervention by the world's central banks to stem the American currency's fall.
 
Attractive to Investors
 The widening difference, as German interest rates rise and American ones fall, bothers American officials because it makes Germany more attractive to international investors. The United States is preoccupied by a recession and thus cannot raise rates to remain more competitive.
But the lower dollar helps American exports by making United States products cheaper overseas. Conversely, it hurts European exports to the United States because they become progressively more expensive as the dollar weakens.
The German currency's growing strength has also increased pressure for a realignment of exchange rate parities in the European Monetary System just as other European Community nations want to maintain the status quo.
That is why many foreign officials and economists saw the move by the Bundesbank as a message that national concerns still far outweighed any international considerations.
"There are those who think of others, and there are those who think of themselves," Pierre Beregovoy, the French Finance Minister, said last week.
 
Shifting Priorities
 Some economists said the Bundesbank might also be signaling that the European Community's plans for economic union, a European central bank and a single currency were not high on its agenda.
"The increase was a reminder that when these things come about, it will be on Germany's terms and that for now, the Bundesbank can dictate policy to Europe," said A. Gary Shilling, the president of Shilling & Company, an economic consulting and investment advising group based in Springfield, N.J.
"I think it is bound to slow down the move toward a single European Community market in 1992 and the plans for economic integration," he added. "In times of turmoil, like now, internationalism goes by the boards."
Bundesbank policy makers justified the increase on domestic grounds. They said it was needed to counteract the inflationary potential of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's plans to finance the reconstruction of eastern Germany through intense public-sector borrowing. The friction between the central bank and Bonn over the soaring German budget deficit and the need to cut spending and raise taxes has rarely been greater.
 
An Awkward Position
 But the Bundesbank directors are in the awkward position of having to curry support in Bonn for their plan for reorganizing the bank to reflect the increased size of a united Germany. The reorganization was mandated by the German unity treaty and must be done in 12 months. It is likely to become a subject of political debate.
The German move also spotlights the fact that monetary and economic policy among the 12 European Community nations is still so divergent that it has to be adjusted through individual interest-rate and currency-rate moves, economists said.
Giles Keating, the director of economics at Credit Suisse-First Boston in London, said Germany currently looked like an island.
"The Bundesbank is obviously no stranger to feelings of isolation," Mr. Keating said. "When it is a time of strong economic growth, people tend to be with them. But with a shift of the economic cycle toward slower growth, the Bundesbank often comes under attack for being inflexible."
Bundesbank officials argue to the contrary, saying their policies are intended to provide a stable base for growth in Europe, not a damper. The same officials quickly note, however, that by law their first obligations are to preserve the stability of the nation's currency, the mark, and keep prices from rising too quickly.
 
Benefit to All Nations
 The Bundesbank's president, Karl Otto Pohl, has staunchly defended his bank's actions to foreign audiences. Last week in Switzerland at a meeting of world economic leaders, Mr. Pohl asserted that the increase was in the interests of other European nations because their currency exchange rates were tied to the powerful mark through the European Monetary System.
"Without a stable Deutsche mark, you can't have a stable E.M.S.," he said.
A governor of the Federal Reserve, Wayne D. Angell, supported Mr. Pohl's view of the contrasting German and American actions on interest rates. "It seems to me that both actions may be explained by price stability considerations," he said.
Mr. Pohl also offered a few ideas on what the Bundesbank's economically united Europe might look like. He suggested that the 12-nation European Community be expanded to include Austria and the nations of eastern Europe after their economies have been converted to capitalism.
The community could then be transformed into a three-tier federation with six or seven hard-currency nations forming a core and creating a European central bank, he said.
 
Minimal Loss of Sovereignty
 Such changes would minimize the Bundesbank's loss of sovereignty to the European central bank, since most of the core nations already peg their monetary policies to Germany's, directly or indirectly.
The Bundesbank has an excellent track record in battling inflation and keeping the currency stable. But from Mr. Pohl on down, Bundesbank officials have repeatedly hammered home their view that the economy is in danger of overheating and that the Government's fiscal policy carries great inflationary risks.
The consensus in German banking circles is that the rate increase was part of that campaign. These bankers say the Bundesbank will raise rates again if the Government does not come up with a convincing package of spending cuts and tax increases.

Roaming Los Angeles With One Who Loves It

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
John Gregory Dunne confesses more than once in tonight's edition of "Travels" that he loves Los Angeles. It's not catching. "L.A. Is It," at 8 on Channel 13, is a partly familiar, partly eccentric visit that is not likely to change anyone's opinion for the better.
Mr. Dunne, who has written some good screenplays ("True Confessions"), knows the town. He drives along the famous freeway (yes, he loves the freeway, too) and along Sunset Boulevard, detouring for glimpses of movie hotshots at a power breakfast, gang members hanging around their turf in south central Los Angeles and sitcom writers in the throes; he visits with a Chinese real estate agent, an Armenian storekeeper, an aging surfer, an actor who teaches safe driving to people who have got too many tickets and a chef who is proud of his matzoh balls. 
 The idea is to direct attention to the town's ethnic, racial, social and economic mix. He calls it "a gazpacho of nationalities" rather than a "gorgeous mosaic," but it comes down to the same wishful tribute even though our guide confesses that he never spent much time in Watts after dark. He also loves the horizontal city's "freedom of movement," although he grants that he would probably be less enthusiastic about the freeway ("like a river, alive, sinuous") if he had been among the masses who had to navigate it every day.
 He does toss off some catchy alliterations, particularly in his description of Echo Park, which he thinks of as Raymond Chandler and James M. Cain territory. Amid its "subtropical seediness" behind "the sunbaked stucco," he imagines adulteries flourishing.
 The many assertions of affection in this hourlong tour, which benefits more from its jazzy score than from the generally unremarkable photography, raises a suspicion that Mr. Dunne is trying to justify having lived in Los Angeles for 24 years. He seems to have more fun when he is kicking around Beverly Hills and Bel Air, "the most ridiculed and most envied neighborhood in the country." He calls them "this Oz of affluence," where residents enjoy "the sweet fruit of the Hollywood hustle." His rhapsody to the Pacific Ocean, by contrast, is standard travel-writer stuff.
 Mr. Dunne begins the hour by promising to correct the misconception of outsiders (does he mean New Yorkers?) that Los Angeles is composed of "kooks and cults and loony politics" and ends it by mentioning that he has moved elsewhere. Who can blame him? "L.A. Is It" makes the city seem more leavable than lovable.

HEADLINE: Orion Looks for Ways To Turn Its Recent Success Into a Trend

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 10

 BODY:
After a long box-office drought that plunged it into the red, the Orion Pictures Corporation is savoring the success of "Dances With Wolves," a $100 million hit the rest of Hollywood was convinced would never work. But the company needs several more hit movies quickly if it is to assure its survival, studio executives and financial analysts say.
A two-year dry spell has left Orion, often described as Hollywood's smallest studio and as its largest independent film producer, with more than $500 million in debts, or more than double what all of its movies earned in 1990. This financial crisis has made Orion the leading buy-out target in Hollywood, with Columbia Pictures Entertainment of the Sony Corporation said to be the latest suitor. 
 Hollywood's directors, actors and writers are watching the drama with intense interest, since they regard Orion as one of the movie industry's last remaining artist-friendly havens for unconventional high-quality films. The company has distributed such Academy Award winners as "Platoon" and "Amadeus" and most of Woody Allen's movies along with providing a base for such actors as Kevin Costner and Jodie Foster.
 
Counting on a Thriller
 On Thursday, Orion is to release "The Silence of the Lambs," a much talked about thriller starring Ms. Foster and Anthony Hopkins and directed by Jonathan Demme. If the movie turns out to be the big hit that most industry executives predict, Orion could gain additional breathing space in its effort to find a solution to mounting financial problems.
The last year has been one of turmoil at Orion. New chiefs of production and distribution were installed, and news reports that John W. Kluge, who owns 70 percent of Orion and who is the chairman of the Metromedia Company, wanted to unload his Orion stock led to concerns that Orion would be without money to make and market movies like "Dances With Wolves," the western directed by and starring Mr. Costner as an Army officer who joins the Sioux tribe.
Until recently, Orion was Hollywood's most stable film production company, largely immune from the rapid staff turnovers common at many studios. Founded in 1978 by a group of executives who left United Artists after a dispute with that studio's parent company, Transamerica, Orion quickly established itself under the leadership of its chairman, Arthur Krim, who is now 80 years old, and its president and chief executive officer, Eric Pleskow, who is 66.
"It could always happen, but I was never worried about their financial strength," Jim Wilson, who co-produced "Dances With Wolves" and who is Mr. Costner's business partner, said of rumors that Orion is on its last legs. "Kluge is a billionaire, and if the company needs a cash infusion there are places to find it. So the situation didn't seem as tenuous to me as everyone else said."
Still, the deepening financial crisis at Orion has severely limited the company's ability to market films that by Hollywood standards are often hard to sell to a mainstream audience, executives at other studios say. With advertising and promotional budgets soaring at major studios, Orion does not have the resources to market its films as aggressively as do its competitors, said several marketing specialists in Hollywood.
On Friday, Variety reported that Orion was trying to raise as much as $90 million by selling part of its interest or all of it in five movies now being filmed or edited, including "The Addams Family" and "Robocop 3" to another studio. Orion would not comment on the report, but executives at other studios said their companies had been approached informally about such an arrangement.
The success of "Dances With Wolves," released in November, came as a relief after a string of failures. "Robocop 2," the company's main summer offering, earned $45 million at the box office but cost about the same amount of money to film and market; "Valmont," "The Hot Spot," "State of Grace" and "Everybody Wins" all flopped, each one earning less than $2 million.
 
Romance and Fantasy
 In the months ahead, Orion's fortunes rest on movies that range from "Married to It," a romantic comedy about three couples, to "Love Field," which stars Michelle Pfeiffer in the story of a white woman and black man who meet in Dallas on the weekend of President John F. Kennedy's assassination. For the summer, Orion is to release "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure II" and "Clifford," with Martin Short as a 10-year-old visiting his bachelor uncle.
Thanks to its willingness to take a risk on Mr. Costner, Orion can also look forward to "China Moon," a thriller starring Ed Harris and Madeleine Stowe, which Mr. Costner's production company is to deliver under a two-year agreement expiring in May. As part of that arrangement, Mr. Costner is developing two other movies, tentatively entitled "American Sportsman" and "The Mick."
In addition, Orion has been busy signing first-look agreements with actors looking to expand their horizons and several directors regarded as talented but somewhat offbeat. Such arrangements would give the company the right of first refusal on any project the artists develop. Ms. Foster has already directed "Little Man Tate," in which she also stars, in such an arrangement, and Mr. Demme, Jessica Lange, Alec Baldwin, Ray Liotta and the directors Phil Joanou and Frank Oz have similar agreements with Orion that give them the creative control for which Orion has made its reputation.
"They have that history, and that was the experience we had with them," Mr. Wilson, Mr. Costner's partner, said of Orion. "There was no accountant sitting by. Hands-off is not even a strong enough word to describe their approach."

Waking Up a Complacent America

The Next Century
By David Halberstam
126 pages. William Morrow & Company. $16.95.
The title of David Halberstam's engaging new book, "The Next Century," is a shade on the coy side. One expects him to have drawn on the broad knowledge of various worlds he has stored up while writing such books as "The Best and the Brightest," about America in Vietnam, "The Powers That Be," about the rise of certain media giants in this country, and "The Reckoning," about the eclipse of Detroit's automotive industry by Japan's. 
 Photo: One expects that from this knowledge he will have projected what the next century will be like, or at the very least which societies will be dominant in the world.
But not at all. Instead, Mr. Halberstam takes a tour of this past century. He begins his book with a governors' conference early in 1989 where he was one of two speakers, and he describes how he disagreed with the other speaker, Henry A. Kissinger, who spoke of the Gorbachev revolution in Eastern Europe condescendingly and was "even more condescending about those poor Americans who were taking it all so seriously."
Mr. Halberstam then travels to Eastern Europe and examines the economic prospects of the newly liberated countries. He concludes that prosperity may well come to them sooner or later, but that whatever opportunities finally arise, it will be Germany, not the United States, that will be in a position to exploit them.
Because we have been bemused by the cold war. We have been locked in combat with the Soviet Union like "two scorpions in a jar," as Mr. Halberstam paraphrases J. Robert Oppenheimer, "each able to give a nuclear sting to the other, but only at the price of its own death." Yet despite the "marvelous opportunities squandered" and the "unseemly national arrogance manifested by both sides" in this struggle, "future historians will sum up the 40-year struggle with the Soviets not harshly but in fact quite gently," Mr. Halberstam writes.
They "will concentrate on something altogether different in this period: the rise of nonwhite nations first to political independence and then somewhat more slowly and erratically to genuine economic independence." Which takes him to the other side of the world and into an analysis of the rise of Japan economically and the comparative decline of the United States.
In short, Mr. Halberstam's essay is a variation on the theme whose most pointed expression he credits to Chalmers Johnson, the Japanologist: "The Cold War is over; the Japanese won." But it remains to be seen to whom the next century of Mr. Halberstam's title belongs. Judging from his tantalizing conclusion, it could be Japan or Germany, the Eastern European countries or the "Little Tigers" of Asia. It probably won't be the United States, unless it can finally get its act together, which Mr. Halberstam seems rather to doubt.
But the question remains, if the ground Mr. Halberstam covers is so familiar, why should one bother to read "The Next Century"? The answer is simply that by the time you discover he's not going to describe the 21st century, one is too engaged by his discussion of the 20th to stop.
As readers of his previous books well know, he has a way with seductive generalizations, even if they are not always his own. So he writes of the Vietnam War: "America was, in the words of the German writer Gunter Grass, twice punished by Vietnam -- first, because we had done it and, second, because we never came to terms with what we had done." And on World War II: "Japan's military strike throughout East Asia was the beginning of the end for the mystique of the white man's power, and it accelerated the demand for independence."
Whether or not such observations are true, they serve wonderfully to focus the mind on Mr. Halberstam's perspective, which of course is the significance for America of Japan's triumph in this century. Not the success of Japan's economy, by the way, but the triumph instead of Japan's educational system, and the relative decline of the United States's.
And just as you begin to worry about his swooping from one overview to the next, he plummets to the ground and tells a firsthand anecdote about how the Solidarity movement in Poland learned how to make use of Western reporters. Or he details the remarkable career of a businessman named Kazuo Inamori, who is the head of a spectacularly successful ceramics manufacturer called Kyocera (Kyoto Ceramics) that the Japanese believe will be the Sony of the 21st century, and who worked so hard during his company's rise that he was known as Mr. A.M. because he never left work until the small hours of the morning.
The example of Mr. Inamori, who on his visits to New York City used to eat at Tad's Steaks off Times Square to stay within his budget, brings Mr. Halberstam to the heart of his concern for America's future, the loss of a sense of urgency to compete with the rising economies of the world.
"I still do not think we as a nation get it," he writes. "Again and again we look for excuses why the Japanese do things better than we do. If we are being beaten, then the rules must be wrong; someone must be cheating." But: "Their success, I think, is of a whole; it has no one secret."
As one prominent Japanese he talked to sees it, what America needs is some sort of shock to jar it "out of its complacency, an event on the order of Sputnik." "The Next Century" is far from shock therapy. But by addressing readers intelligently instead of bludgeoning them with dire statistics, it catches the ear.
Mr. Halberstam quotes a colleague of Kazuo Inamori's on the industrialist's capacity to dream: "But he does not dream up long-term visions. He dreams in tiny increments." Maybe it is possible to be shocked in tiny increments. If it is, then Mr. Halberstam, with "The Next Century," will have done his share to bring us to our senses.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Mr. Bush Hires a Writer

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
To a sailor, a telltale is a strip of cloth attached to the mast to indicate the wind's direction; to a railroader, a telltale is a ribbon hung over a track before a tunnel to warn trainmen off the roofs of cars; to a pundit, a telltale is some seemingly insignificant sign that is a portent of a change in political emphasis -- as when a President hires a new chief speechwriter.
 Last Halloween, as Chriss Winston prepared to take her 2-year-old out trick-or-treating, the White House reached her with a hurry-up assignment. Little Ian, dressed in his bunny suit, fell asleep on the couch as his mother cranked out a statement. That was it; early this year, Ms. Winston let her bosses know that her immediate future would be as mother and freelancer. 
 Chief of staff John Sununu and the pollster Robert Teeter seized the opportunity to search for a writer with a harder edge. The half-dozen other writers were passed over -- one, Mark Davis, was leaving to be word-smith to Gov. Pete Wilson of California -- because the President's men were looking ahead to 1992.
 In six months the war will be over and the sky-high Bush ratings will begin to sink; unemployment will be up, whether or not the recession bottoms out as soon as hoped; and Democrats will be taking pot-shots at "the first President to lead us into both a war and a recession." Partisanship time.
 Needed: not a heavy hitter with a big reputation and a lot of baggage, but a hard hitter not known for speechwriting, relatively young, and with independent right-wing credentials.
 Mr. Sununu's choice, not yet announced but who was introduced to the man in the Oval Office last week: Anthony Snow, 35, a Cincinnatian who worked at The Detroit News and for the past three years has been editorial page editor and columnist at the conservative Washington Times.
 Articulate enough for TV opinionfests, Mr. Snow has already begun to clam up: the F.B.I. is now visiting his kindergarten teachers, and Mr. Sununu would be proud of the way his choice parries press queries, even from certified bigfeet. Apparently Peggy Noonan's irreverent memoirs have set insiders' teeth on edge, and the new man is expected to revert to what F.D.R.'s Louis Brownlow called "a passion for anonymity."
 Most members of the Judson Welliver Society, the club of former Presidential speechwriters, would go along with that, even as we wince at the thought of a polemicist who has never written a speech -- and who doesn't know the principal's thinking intimately -- starting at the top. I hope op-editors seek out my colleagues (Clifford, Sorensen, Valenti, Cater, Schlesinger, Price, Herzberg, Elliot, etc.) for their guidance, but here is one old hand's advice to the new superspook:
 1. Don't look for a hot new phrase: stick with the New World Order. Of course it's vulnerable -- every time some plan falls apart or some tinpot hollers at Washington, critics will hoot, "You call this a new world order?" -- but it's Bush's baby, even if he shares its popularization with Gorbachev. Forget the Hitler "new order" root; F.D.R. used the phrase earlier.
 2. Fight for the Union. Up to now, the most pellucid prose to come out of Mr. Bush's mouth has been by the National Security Council's Richard Haass, in a news-conference statement of war aims; he also drafted the powerful letter to Saddam Hussein. But Professor Haass is merely a policymaker, not a card-carrying speechwriter; insist that N.S.C. stuff be routed through the writing shop, lest you wind up in a domestic backwater.
 3. Discover the Bush domestic design and lay it out in a series of speeches. Under all those Pinkerton paradigms and Darmanesque ditherings must be some pattern of decisions: find that gestalt, give it a Weltanschauung, and push it with some passion. Even moderates stand for something; the rhetorical trick is in divining the drift and declaiming the direction.
 4. Don't be haunted by Reagan's Ghost. Mr. Bush is fearful of comparison with Reagan speechifying, and instead shows off his ad-libbing advantage over his predecessor -- perversely boasting of his inadequate speech delivery. Enough of that; you've been brought aboard not for sound bites and snippets, but for serious red meat and potatoes.
 As the Ides of March approach, in prime time the President will solemnly come before us to explain this war's endgame. He has the sense of history in his head but not on the tip of his tongue. It's your enviable job to help him make weapons out of his words.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
Is It Our Leaders, or Is It Us?

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: HONOLULU

 BODY:
Hawaii is, and feels, remote from mainland America. But for all its exotic quality, the concerns on people's minds are not so different from those in Boston or New York or Los Angeles. People worry about the war, about the recession, about racial tension.
In three days at and around the University of Hawaii, I found conversations coming back to one puzzling question. Why is it that the United States can rise so quickly to challenges abroad but seems utterly unable or unwilling to meet challenges at home? 
 Whatever one thinks of the policies that have led us to war in the Persian Gulf, the speed and energy of the American commitment have been remarkable. In six months the United States has sent a force of more than 400,000 and a vast array of modern weapons halfway around the world.
But in six months or six years we have made no progress on a host of domestic problems. Indeed, we have made no real commitment to address them -- no commitment of mind or resources.
* American public education is a scandal. In a world where learned skills are increasingly important, our children leave school far less educated than those in France or Korea or a dozen other countries.
* Our system of medical care -- our non-system -- is the most expensive in the world yet leaves millions with no assurance of care. Alone among the industrialized nations of the West, we have no universal medical insurance. Medical costs are breaking state and national budgets, and we do nothing but tinker here and there.
* In the richest country on earth, poverty is a mass phenomenon. We have so many poor families that the infant mortality rate, related to poverty, is higher than in less affluent countries. The Bush Administration wants to experiment with a program to reduce infant mortality -- by taking money away from programs to help poor pregnant women and children.
* Homelessness is another result of poverty and inadequate social programs. In cities across the country we are met by the sight of the homeless. Private and public efforts have provided, at best, palliatives.
* Two decades after the death of Martin Luther King Jr. our major cities have black ghettos that are centers of hopelessness and social disorder. A powerful United States Senator can be re-elected by appealing bluntly to anti-black feelings.
* Investment in our industry is at a low level, and we are falling way behind other countries in research and development of domestic products. We can make smart bombs and Patriot missiles, but we no longer make video cassette recorders.
All of those problems, and more, have been festering for years. None is a secret. But where is there any sign that we are about to tackle them? Why not?
Leadership is one possible answer. Most Presidents find foreign affairs a more congenial place to invest their energy. President Bush is more candid than most, saying openly that he finds foreign challenges more exhilarating than the often frustrating political struggle of domestic policy-making.
But on the whole we get the leaders we deserve. We voted for Ronald Reagan because we wanted to believe that greed was good, that cutting taxes and disabling government would make us all richer. We cheered even as he did lasting damage to this country.
Perhaps we have concluded, most of us, that the problems are just too daunting to face. Perhaps we have decided to deal with them by closing our eyes. Existential blindness, a Roman Catholic bishop in South Africa once called it: blindness because seeing is too painful.
Or perhaps the problems at home are too long and slow to awaken energetic response from us. If there is an invasion abroad and the President tells us that it is a defining moment, the country responds. Perhaps it will take a domestic trauma to waken us, as the Depression did in the 1930's.
Still, leadership matters. We have seen how Mr. Bush has been able to rally the country to the cause of fighting Iraq and freeing Kuwait. Whether his policy proves wise in the end or not, there is no doubt that he cared.
Someday we may again have a President who cares about the country's economic decline, about its stricken schools, about poverty and sickness. Someday we may have a President who will rally us to care, by saying something like what Franklin Roosevelt said in 1937:
"I see one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished."

HEADLINE: Polish Debt: Don't Even Ask

 BODY:
Poland's overnight leap from centralized economic control to markets has been painful. By stripping away price controls and Government subsidies, prices soared, unemployment rose and living standards dropped at least 10 percent. But Polish endurance is paying off. Export earnings are rising, the currency and inflation have now stabilized, and Poland is about to launch a radical plan to privatize factories and farms.
One big hurdle remains: $45 billion of foreign debt, largely loans by foreign governments to the former Communist regime. Polish debt payments are enormous, even compared to other heavily indebted countries. The Poles cannot afford to pay back these loans. If they try, their economic reform will be destroyed. 
 The U.S. -- prodded by Congressman David Obey of Wisconsin -- has been fighting for a substantial write-off of Poland's debt, perhaps as high as the 80 percent figure requested by the Poles. The Europeans, who hold most of the loans, are balking. The French are considering write-offs under 40 percent; the Japanese argue for zero. The Europeans say they are reluctant to establish a regrettable precedent for third world debtors.
Regrettable? The West ought to be deliriously happy if other debtor nations junked their centralized control and leaped to capitalism. Debt relief would be a trivial price for drawing the third world toward capitalism.
Without large debt write-off -- probably close to 80 percent -- Poland will face large outflows of capital. Foreign investors will stay away as long as Poland's resources are pledged to foreign governments rather than private investors. And the huge debt will also discourage domestic savers; why invest if the profits will be taxed and sent abroad?
For a few billion dollars, the West can insure that the brave Poles succeed and set an enviable model for the rest of Eastern Europe, and beyond. The Poles cannot afford to repay most of their foreign loans; it would be tragic to ask them to try.

HEADLINE: National Health Insurance Benefits Everyone

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Health Care a Growing Burden" (Business Day, Jan. 29) finds that annual health-care costs for each worker in 1990 were more than $3,200, a 17.1 percent increase from 1989. Employer-based health care has become increasingly inadequate for containing costs and providing coverage for the 31 million people who are uninsured. Health-care expenditures only add to the cost of labor, thus increasing unemployment. Increased labor costs also make it more difficult for American companies to compete with foreign corporations.
In addition, employers who would like to offer health insurance are sometimes denied that opportunity by insurance companies. For instance, many insurers who fear enrolling individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome or the human immunodeficiency virus will not enroll such groups as professional dancers, florists and AIDS activists. And some insurers offering group plans to employers try to discourage high-risk people from enrolling by offering skimpy benefits -- such as paying no more than $2,000 a year for pharmaceuticals or hospitalization.
Moreover, those who are unemployed, self-employed, between jobs or unable to work are seen as poor risks by insurers. They are able to get insurance, if at all, at prohibitively high rates, excessively high out-of-pocket expense or without coverage of pre-existing conditions.
Ultimately, employer-based health insurance must be eliminated to insure efficient and equitable health insurance financing.
The Dutch Government plans to eliminate employer-based health insurance in the 1990's. Under the Dutch health insurance system, each individual will select a health plan from competing insurance organizations during an open-enrollment period. The Government will require insurers to offer a basic minimum benefits package. This will prevent insurers from offering skimpy benefit packages that cater to the healthy.
Individuals will be required to pay a premium into a central fund based on income, as well as an additional premium to the plan of their choice. Those who are unemployed will be required to pay only a modest premium, but will still be covered by the basic benefits package.
The incentives in this system encourage quality and efficiency. Plans that can deliver services most efficiently and with the highest quality will enroll larger numbers. Insurers will not be allowed to deny coverage, but those who disproportionately enroll high-risk individuals will be compensated by the central fund. Cost containment will thus come from competition among health insurers, as well as limits on the use of the most expensive technology.
The elimination of employer-based health insurance and compensation for insurers who take added risks should mean competition by insurers to control costs, rather than to avoid high-risk individuals. This may be just the dose of efficiency and equity the United States health-care system and American business desperately need.

The Elderly Victimized

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Once again, the elderly, and ultimately all of us, fall victim to the lack of a cohesive and rational health-care policy. The news coming from Washington regarding President Bush's proposed budget (front page, Feb. 5) threatens a generation of Americans who do not know what to expect next on health care. Medicare, a program established to provide for the health of the elderly, is again being singled out by the Bush Administration for disproportionate cuts.
Health care is not an economic commodity. Health care is a social good. Every citizen has a legitimate expectation of access to health care, and physicians and hospitals have legitimate expectations to be properly compensated for providing that care. Our nation must develop a system that responds to the health-care needs of the elderly and the millions of others who lack health care.
It will be interesting to see what Congress does with the latest proposals, especially since these proposals actually rehash proposals previously rejected. Let's hope Congress does its job in holding the President accountable.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Campaign Hopes to Promote Bronx Zoo and Its Mission

BYLINE: By Kim Foltz

 BODY:
HEEDING Darwin's lesson -- adapt to survive -- the Bronx Zoo will soon begin its first big image campaign. With safari-like commercials promoting the zoo's naturalistic settings, the zoo hopes to use the call of the wild to attract visitors and additional donations.
The New York Zoological Society, which operates the Bronz Zoo, the New York Aquarium and the zoo in Central Park, last week hired Geer, Dubois, a New York agency, to create an advertising and marketing campaign that will promote the zoo and remind people of the society's role as a wildlife conservation organization. 
 "The Bronx Zoo hadn't bothered to advertise itself," said Peter Glankoff, director of marketing and communications for the society. "It simply relied on its reputation."
But that is not enough any more, he said. Financing from traditional sources like donations is hard to come by in tough economic times. The society hopes to raise revenues by bolstering annual attendance, now about two million.
The zoo hopes to stir up the kind of interest the San Diego Zoo did when it began a splashy advertising campaign several years ago. Some commercials showed exotic animals cavorting to classical music, and one award-winning billboard sported a giant flamingo.
The campaign is widely credited with helping to make the San Diego Zoo one of the best-known attractions in California. And while attendance at some zoos dropped in the last decade, San Diego's rose to 3.3 million in 1989, from 3 million in 1980.
No longer able to rely on tax revenue and contributions as their primary sources of money, zoos have increasingly turned to aggressive marketing programs. In the past year, a number of zoos, including those in Minneapolis and Toronto, hired agencies to give themselves a high profile.
The Bronx Zoo's biggest problem is overcoming public misconceptions. "Research showed that many people thought it was still an old-fashioned kind of zoo where animals are kept behind bars," said John Hayes, the president of Geer, Dubois.
Mr. Glankoff of the Zoological Society said that many people believe the zoo is situated in an unpleasant neighborhood and he said the society would publicize the availability of express bus service to the zoo, which is off Southern Boulevard in the Fordham section of the Bronx.
The agency is also going to develop marketing programs to emphasize the zoological society's primary mission, wildlife preservation.
Rodney Underhill, executive vice president and creative director of Geer, Dubois, said the agency was working on exhibits for some of the zoo's leading attractions. "We might put a big electronic sign at the exit of Jungle World that continually ticks off the steady depletion of the rain forests," he said. "At that point we've already got a sympathetic audience, so maybe we can get them to join the society."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 12, 1991, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
The Advertising Column in Business Day yesterday about campaign plans for the Bronx Zoo misstated the surname and title of an executive at the zoo's agency, Geer, Dubois. He is Rodney Underwood, not Underhill; he is the agency's vice chairman and creative director, not executive vice president.

HEADLINE: Waiting and Waiting on Tables for Her Big Break

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The face is familiar: she was Tom Hanks's mother in "Big," a furiously jealous Mafia wife in "Married to the Mob," and a smart, savvy and sexy Wall Street lawyer Off Broadway in "Other People's Money."
But to those who see Mercedes Ruehl on stage or screen and think they recognize her from a completely different context, the answer is simple: they probably do. 
 Success was not an overnight phenomenon for Ms. Ruehl. It took so long, she says, that she almost gave up. When she was not auditioning she spent a good deal of time in restaurants.
"I must have worked in at least a dozen places in New York as a waitress," Ms. Ruehl says, relaxing after a performance at the National Theater here of Neil Simon's new play, "Lost in Yonkers," in which she stars as Aunt Bella, a 35-year-old woman with the mind and emotions of a 13-year-old. "I was a milkmaid in the ice cream corner of the Plaza Hotel. I worked at Teachers on the Upper West Side, at the Buffalo Roadhouse in Greenwich Village, and I did a memorable summer at the White Horse Cafe. I was terrible when I started, but after about five or six years I became dangerously good at it, maybe even better at that time than I was as an actress."
 
Previews Start Tomorrow
 Ms. Ruehl is receiving very favorable advance comment for her portrayal of Bella, a character who, as one of her relatives says, is permanently "closed for repairs." "Lost in Yonkers," a comedy with serious overtones -- not unlike Mr. Simon's highly successful Brighton Beach trilogy but not as overtly autobiographical -- is set in the summer of 1942 in a two-bedroom apartment over Kurnitz's Kandy Store in Yonkers. The play, directed by Gene Saks, begins previews tomorrow on Broadway at the Richard Rodgers Theater, where it opens Feb. 21.
It tells the story of two teen-age brothers who have been forced for economic reasons to move in with their grandmother (Irene Worth), a stern, distant and iron-willed German-Jewish refugee whose overpowering personality has stunted the adulthood of her children. In addition to Bella, those children include a somewhat lovable mobster played by Kevin Spacey.
Ms. Ruehl, her long, dark hair piled atop her head and her slim, jeans-encased legs crossed at the ankles, is leaning forward, puffing a cigarette (only her second of the day; she is trying to quit) and talking about her new role, her career and the years it took to achieve her goals. She clearly loves to talk, and when she is asked a question, almost any question, her answers are unhesitating and rapid. The only thing she is reticent about is her age. She will, however, acknowledge that it is similar to Bella's.
 
Adult Awareness
 When she first started studying the role, she says, she had a lot of trouble getting a handle on it. Yes, Bella is childlike, but the character is also mature enough to understand and talk about her need for love and her desire for a husband and children. "Maybe I'm a child," Bella says, "but there's just enough woman in me now to make me really miserable."
Finally, Ms. Ruehl thought of a movie she had made, in which she played the mother of a 13-year-old who suddenly takes on adult form.
"I thought -- ding dong -- Tom Hanks in 'Big,' " she says. "He didn't talk cute or act cute. He just went about his business, and there were times when he even seemed naively, charmingly fresh. And then Bella started to come to life in my mind, because there are moments when she is very close to being a bit wise."
 
Peripatetic Childhood
 Ms. Ruehl, the daughter of a former F.B.I. agent, was born in Jackson Heights, Queens, but lived there for only two weeks. The next eight years were spent moving around: first to the Bronx, then to Lafayette, Ind., Scranton, Pa., and Hackensack, N.J. Finally, the family moved to Silver Spring, Md., where she stayed through high school.
After graduating from the College of New Rochelle, she moved to Manhattan, where, she says, she "started a career of waiting tables and studying drama."
The studying was done at the HB Studios, with William Hickey and Uta Hagen. She performed in workshops, an occasional Off Off Broadway showcase and a few other acting jobs every once in a while. But that was pretty much it. "I couldn't punch through that membrane," she says.
She went on a yearlong tour with "The Miracle Worker" and "Come Blow Your Horn," playing high schools and colleges all over the country, doing 90-minute versions of the two plays 14 to 16 times a week for a salary of $126. Then, after another period of mostly waiting on tables, she worked for two years in repertory at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts and began making the rounds of regional theaters.
 
Time to Grow Up
 By the time she looked up, it was Thanksgiving 1984. And, she says, she almost decided to drop it all: "I started to think: 'O.K., so this is it? Five hundred dollars a week and a reasonably nice apartment in the actors' transient building in every big city. Do I want to live like this indefinitely?' And I thought, 'I don't want this.' I always believed I was going to have this destiny in the theater, but now I figured: 'Maybe I'm not. And it's time to think about living like a grown-up.' "
One evening, she sat down with her father and talked about her problem. "He had just retired from the bureau," she says, "and he knew of a fellow retiree who was working for Baltimore Gas and Electric. And his friend knew this gal -- this was when I discovered that they're all 'gals' in business, and I knew I was looking ahead to 'galhood,' which filled me with feelings of utter ambivalence -- anyway, he knew this gal who had been an actress who was now directing industrial and promotional films for Baltimore Gas and Electric. And I said without a lot of conviction that it sounded wonderful, maybe I should meet her after Christmas."
But before she could make the appointment, she received a phone call from the playwright Albert Innaurato, for whom she had done some readings and who was having trouble with a play he was presenting at the Public Theater. The play was "Coming of Age in SoHo"; performances had been suspended, and Mr. Innaurato was busy rewriting.
"Albert called and said: 'No audition. Just come in. I've convinced them you're the one to do this. We've got 12 days.' Now, I'd been trying to get a foot in the door of the Public Theater since the beginning of time and couldn't. And suddenly here it was -- Off Broadway. So I said, 'Yes, yes, I'll do it.' "
 
'It Was Terrifying'
 But it was rough going. "There was a big chair on the set," she says, "and I would make my entrance, and I would realize that this was not just a regional stage. It was the Public. It was New York. And it was like jumping into a cold pool. It was terrifying.
"I would run to that chair every night and hold on to it. It was like a shield between me and the audience. And both Joe Papp and Albert had to persuade me to get out from behind the chair. And finally, on opening night, I got these lovely flowers from Joe with a note. It said: 'You finally got out from behind the chair. Anything goes now.' And it was a prophecy, because after that, I never stopped working."
"Coming of Age in SoHo" led almost immediately to Christopher Durang's "Marriage of Bette and Boo." And that led to a small movie role in "Heartburn." And 13 months as Judd Hirsch's daughter on Broadway in "I'm Not Rappaport." And "Big." And "Married to the Mob," for which she won the National Society of Film Critics' award as best supporting actress of 1988. And "Other People's Money." And two forthcoming movies, "Another You" with Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, and "The Fisher King" with Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges. And now "Lost in Yonkers."
"And I never went to meet them at Baltimore Gas and Electric," Ms. Ruehl says, and laughs. "I never became a gal."

HEADLINE: Political Pressure Dismantles East German Sports Machine

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEIPZIG, Germany

 BODY:
The big bronze statue of the javelin hurler identifies the building as a sports school, but half the javelin is snapped off and the marble base is crumbling. Inside the building that was once the premier academy of the powerful East German sports machine, glass trophy cases gape emptily, and a tax consultant, one of thousands of private businesses sprouting in eastern Germany's dash to the market, has taken up rooms on the ground floor.
"Just one of those measures to help pay the upkeep," sighed Helmut Kirchgassner, a former middleweight boxer and professor of the theory and practice of training who is the school's new dean. 
 Officially dubbed the German College for Physical Culture, the school produced the coaches, trainers and sports medicine personnel who were responsible for East Germany's remarkable success at the highest levels of international sports. That success was demonstrated at the 1980 Games in Moscow -- after Western nations, led by the United States, stayed away to protest the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan -- the East Germans won 47 gold, 37 silver and 42 bronze medals, second only to the Soviet Union.
 
Struggling for Upkeep
 The school is now in limbo, its status unsure, staff cuts looming, its coaches either discredited for doping practices or leaving for more lucrative jobs in the old West Germany and farther West, and its financing unreliable.
In fact, these days, struggling to pay the upkeep is what takes up most of the time of athletes and sports officials on the eastern edge of a reunited Germany.
Eighteen months ago, they were still the heroes of the nation, standing triumphantly above the world of international sport that made their Communist state, politically and economically a dwarf, an athletic giant. Now they lie among the flotsam and jetsam of the discredited system, the athletes heckled for the privileges they enjoyed and their clubs threatened with closure.
As an abundance of coaches and trainers struggle for the few jobs available, a dog-eat-dog atmosphere has set in, with charges flying fast and furiously that so-and-so either used drugs or helped athletes do so, or belonged to the now-defunct Communist Party, or worse, the secret police, whose goons laced the sports establishment.
Harsh debate focuses on the so-called Child and Youth Sport Schools, a network of 25 prep schools whose pupils were picked by intricate tests and measurements from among first-grade youngsters. Parents were required to sign contracts permitting the children to withdraw only after consultation with state authorities, and many top East German athletes were graduates. Debate focuses on demands by Germans in the west that the schools be liberalized, a process some Germans in the east say will destroy the schools' effectiveness as training centers.
In a small apartment on the outskirts of Leipzig, Thomas Munkelt, an Olympic gold medal winner in the 110-meter hurdles in 1980, recalled the days of gold and glory. Munkelt, who attended a prep school for three years, described how sports had enabled him to climb out of a gritty home town near Buna to the practice of dentistry in a state clinic. But by Western standards, he admitted, the rewards were slim.
As a student, he and his wife and daughter shared two small dormitory rooms, until a small apartment became available. Every four years there was a new car, a stodgy Soviet-built Lada in his case, and small things, like fresh fruit, that few other East Germans saw much of, brightened an otherwise simple life.
Now, with Communism collapsed, he and a fellow hurdler-turned-dentist are seeking loans for a private practice. He laments what he views as the gradual demise of the old sports machinery.
"The basic problem is the training of young athletes, which in principle is being destroyed," he said. "Maybe in 5, 10 years' time it'll be back again. But for now, the money's just not there.
"According to our papers, we were always fulfilling our economic goals," Munkelt added bitterly. "But our stores were still always empty. We ran our sports by the performance principle, but not our economy."
The former hurdler has no excuses for East Germany's doping record. "You cannot force anyone to take tablets," he said, "but I don't think it was good the way it was done, with central lists and central organization and all that. The most important thing is that, with better testing, the use of drugs is being pushed back further and further."
The exact extent of drug use in East Germany remains a murky matter.
The German weekly Der Spiegel has published details of East Germany's centralized doping program, with two high-powered research institutes, one at the college in Leipzig and another in the hilltop village of Kreischa, south of Dresden, reporting to a doping headquarters at the Sports Medicine Service in Berlin.
A former swimming coach at a Potsdam sports club, Michael Regner, described how club physicians had initiated him in the distribution of anabolics to team swimmers, who included Kristin Otto and Silke Horner, both gold medalists at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Regner, who fled East Germany in August 1988, through Hungary and now coaches in New Zealand, described how a drug called Oral-Turinabol, manufactured by an East German company in Jena, was given to 13-year-old swimmers.
The reports prompted the Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl to establish a seven-member commission, which began work last month, to examine doping abuse in Germany and make proposals for control. Underscoring official concern, Kohl told Parliament recently, "We support the declared intention of the sports clubs to take decisive steps against doping practices. Top-level sports must respect human dignity."
The mud-slinging has hardly hindered German sports groups in the western part of the country from snapping up former East German experts. Last fall, it was reported that Hermann Buhl, the deputy director of the medical department at the Leipzig research center, was hired by the Institute for Sports Medicine, in Paderborn. Hartmut Riedel, East Germany's track and field team physician, is now professor of sports medicine at Bayreuth, in the former West Germany. Much of the sports medical center at Kreischa, though not its doping lab, a major focus of the commission's attention, has been taken over by Bavaria Klinik, a western company. Though the commission has yet to begin hearings, many top-secret records are reportedly missing, evidently shredded or sold by former researchers.
At Leipzig University, Joachim Weiskopf, a dentistry professor who is also vice president of the National Olympic Committee of united Germany, said he had a "clear position regarding doping, and I think I have a clear conscience." But he said charges and countercharges were fed by the terrible struggle for jobs in a collapsing economy. The bloated German Gymnastics and Sports Union, the vast East German sports bureaucracy, had 12,000 employees, of which only about 1,500 can be kept on, he said. East Germany had about 600 track and field coaches, but now there are jobs for only 72 coaches, and those jobs are all taken at the moment.
"There's a psychological component," he said over sips of coffee, "the fact that so many were in the Communist Party, were bearers of state secrets. So now people are saying, 'He did doping.' There's envy, and everyone's taking potshots at everyone else."
Last June, Weiskopf, a 64-year-old, a former Olympic field hockey player, replaced Manfred Ewald, a staunch Communist, as head of the still existing East German National Olympic Committee, a post he assumed with the sole goal of leading East Germany back into a united German Olympic organization. Weiskopf, never a Communist, was known for his integrity. "Our states, our cities are looking at all our unemployment and saying, 'Let's first rebuild the factories and then invest in sports; let's put our money first where it's productive,' " he said. "So we're standing here with empty hands, so we can only go to the West Germans and say, 'Help us.' While their reaction is, 'There they go asking for money again.' "
Over at the college, the 1,000 or so students are already learning what this means. The Government of Saxony, where Leipzig lies, has ordered the school disbanded, announcing plans to refound it as a physical education department of Leipzig University.
Two years ago the faculty and staff totaled 1,050, Kirchgassner said, and now 700 remain. He estimates that the school will eventually have a staff of about 270, including 120 full-time professors.
Moreover, while the college once focused only on Olympic disciplines like swimming, diving, track and field, the syllabus was broadened to include gym teacher training, sports for rehabilitation and recreation, and even sports management.
But demands that the Federal Government in Bonn finance the school's continued independence are growing, fueled by students' desires that the college remain a center of competitive sports training in eastern Germany, to parallel a similar institute in Cologne, in the west.
Now, the Research Institute with its high-powered laboratories and testing equipment, is locked. But on a recent afternoon, desks in the bright library were filled with students while others worked out in the school's training halls.
But for Kirchgassner, it was clear that despite the semblance of business as usual, an epoch was drawing to a close.
"You have to be realistic," he said, "competitive sports as they were exercised here, or in the G.D.R. generally, are not salvageable. We have to find new forms, and that will be tough, because the conditions, financial and otherwise, are lacking."

HEADLINE: Careers;
Law Schools Put Stress on Specialization

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
BEYOND torts, property and other first-year basics, law schools are rethinking the second and third years of their programs.
"The practice of law has changed, reflecting changes in the business world and to some degree in the political world, while law school teaching has changed little in recent years," Ronald A. Cass said last week. Dean of Boston University's law school, he discussed a new focus for the curriculum: specialization. 
 Stressing the need for prospective lawyers to specialize, he said: "Every one of them increasingly needs a specialty. Our students need to study in greater depth."
He proposes a track of four different specialties for the second and third year of law school and hopes to have some in place by fall. These studies might include international law, corporate law, public law and environmental law.
Specialization would not be required but would be encouraged. "I don't want to be overly rigid about it," he said, adding that specialization would appeal to some because it would make them more marketable.
He thinks that lawyers increasingly require more knowledge of international events. For example, a lawyer involved in an antitrust case would have to recognize the international impact on a global corporation.
"To be effective these days as a lawyer I need to know something about business, economics and statistics," Dean Cass said. He hopes to integrate these fields into various courses for law students to give them a broad knowledge of their applications. Separate courses in the subjects are available now.
"I noticed when I worked for the Government that expert witnesses often spoke different languages from the lawyers," he said. To make proper use of witnesses, lawyers must know the terminology used by financial analysts, accountants and others.
Some young lawyers obtain master of business administration degrees to help them fit better into corporate life. Dean Cass said, "If law schools do the job right they don't need an M.B.A."
At Stanford University's law school, the dean, Paul Brest, agreed that lawyers in the 21st century should be offered "more specialization." He also agreed that specialization -- he prefers the word concentration -- should be encouraged, not required. "And not at the cost of a broad liberal education," he said.
Most previous efforts to change law school curriculums have been devoted to the first year, he said, adding that "the first year now works pretty well" and that hard work needed to be done on the second- and third-year offerings. "It is not done well," he said of those years, "and students have a feeling they are not progressing, and indeed they are not. They are right in wanting change." He thinks students are "not being challenged enough to deepen their intellectual horizons."
Dean Brest says the faculty now offers or hopes to offer so-called concentrations in business, environmental law and poverty law. "I call poverty law "lawyering with minorities." he said, stressing its growing importance.
He described the relatively new business concentration at Stanford, which he said was "fully implemented" last fall. Students take economics, if they did not take the subject in college, and also a course that Dean Brest calls financial theory.
In the second year of the three-year program for a law degree, the students take a first-semester course called Business Associations concurrently with an accounting course.
"I describe this Business Associations course as transactional because they learn how to put together deals and enterprises," Dean Brest said.
A second semester course follows in the track and it is called Capital Markets and Securities Regulation. When students have finished this they are ready for advanced courses. "We are now developing more such courses," he said.
"We do have one in place called What Every Lawyer Should Know About Business; I am excited about it," he said, explaining that it was in its second year and adding, "A textbook is being developed."
He mentioned another course, called Counseling the Business Enterprise, described as a clinical course that involves role playing. It covers topics like executive compensation, counseling for venture capitalists and expertise in negotiating.
Another new course, called Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility, deals with such issues as proxy fights and environmental problems.
Like Dean Cass, he hopes that a concentration would be adequate for a sophisticated lawyer not interested in working for a corporation and that an M.B.A. would not be necessary.

HEADLINE: Too Many A's Seen at A. M. Best

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 11

 BODY:
A. M. Best, the 92-year-old company on which thousands of American corporations and consumers depend for evaluations of the financial health of insurance companies, is being accused of grade inflation. A new study concludes that it is significantly easier for insurance companies to win a top rating from Best than from two other major raters of insurance companies -- Standard & Poor's and Moody's.
The study was conducted by Joseph Belth, an Indiana University professor who is an expert on the insurance industry. He published his findings in the December 1990 issue of his Insurance Forum newsletter. The study comes at a time when the number of insurance-company failures is rising and public concern about the solvency of insurers is increasing. 
 Professor Belth says that Best's apparent easing of requirements has caused some customers who buy its books, newsletters and other publications to lose faith in the rating agency. Some people in the industry agree.
 
Charges by Critics
 "The Moody's and Standard & Poor's process is much more rigorous and the results are more meaningful than Best's," said Peter Hutchings, chief financial officer of the Guardian Life Insurance Company, based in New York.
The real issue, people familiar with the situation say, is whether Best has loosened its requirements in response to increasing competitive pressures from S.& P., Moody's and a few smaller firms like Duff & Phelps.
Some critics have argued privately that to hold on to the thousands of insurance companies across the country that pay in some cases tens of thousands of dollars to buy its publications, Best has eased the requirements A+ companies must meet.
Best vigorously denies this accusation. "Totally untrue," said Paul Wish, the spokesman for the A. M. Best Company, based in Oldwick, N.J. "The ratings in the books have nothing to do with the sale of the books."
Mr. Wish, defending Best's rating system, said: "The major difference between us and them is that we take the long-term view. We look at an insurance company's long-term prospects, whereas Moody's and Standard & Poor's are more attuned to day-to-day changes in market conditions."
An agency's rating is crucial to insurers because independent agents who sell life insurance steer customers to higher-rated companies. Some industry experts say that lower-rated insurers have to offer higher yields to attract consumers. A rating reduction can also force an insurance company to pay more interest when it borrows in the capital markets.
And when many large corporations consider an insurance company, they want it to have top ratings from at least two major rating agencies.
 
Striking Differences in Ratings
 Professor Belth studied 100 life insurers rated by both the Standard & Poor's Corporation and Best. Of that group, 33 received Best's top A+ rating but were rated lower by S.& P. Over all, 53 of the 100 compared were rated higher by Best than by S.& P.; 36 were rated the same, and 11 were rated lower by Best.
The study also found 62 life insurers rated by both Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Best. Of that group, 34 were rated A+ by Best but received lower ratings from Moody's. Over all, 43 of the 62 fared better under the Best system than under the Moody's system; 16 were rated the same by both agencies, and 3 got a lower rating from Best.
Some of the differences between Best's ratings and the other agencies' were striking. For instance, Best gave the Executive Life Insurance Company of Los Angeles a rating of "contingent A," meaning it has the third-highest rating but is under review. The same insurer was rated 12 notches from the top by Moody's (a Ba2 rating) and by S.& P. (a BB rating). Executive Life's parent, the First Executive Corporation, has suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses on its portfolio of high-yield "junk bonds," and many customers have cashed in their policies.
"What all this suggests to me is that the Best system is significantly looser than that of the competition," Professor Belth said. "I am not saying that Best is selling out. I have no evidence of that. What I am saying is that it is easier to get a top rating from Best."
Best said recently that its rating system essentially paralleled that of S.& P. and Moody's, meaning that a top rating from Best was equivalent to a top rating from S.& P. or Moody's, and so forth.
 
Differing Criteria
 Other factors may explain how Best ends up with higher ratings. The S.& P. and Moody's ratings are based on a fairly narrow criterion -- the ability of an insurer to pay claims. Best says it bases its ratings on the ability of an insurance company to meet all financial obligations.
"The mechanics for rating are the same, but the underlying philosophy is different," said Mr. Wish, the Best spokesman.
Whatever the reason for Best's higher ratings, there is little disputing that Best, while still important in the insurance business, has seen its influence wane in recent years.
"While a decade ago most of the big brokers did not spend much time with it, today they have full-time research departments that get to know the insurers well," said Richard Heydinger, the senior insurance executive at Hallmark Cards Inc. in Kansas City, Mo.
 
A Near Monopoly Until 1983
 Nor is there much disputing that Best, which is privately held, has been facing new competition. For decades the company held a near monopoly on the business of rating insurers. Wall Street analysts published reports on publicly held insurance companies, but it was not until 1983 that S.& P. got into the business. Moody's started in 1986. Both companies still have much smaller operations than Best's but their influence has been rising as policyholders have grown concerned about the ability of insurers to pay claims.
Recognizing that the risks insurers face have been changing along with the investments insurers make with their income from premiums, many industrial companies now subscribe to more than one rating agency.
Moody's, S.& P. and Duff & Phelps tend to focus more than Best on an insurer's financial results. This emphasis reflects their background as bond-rating agencies. By contrast, Best, in making its rating, tends to look beyond the numbers at aspects of the overall quality of an organization, like experience of management, modernization of the back office and the speed of payment of claims.
"Some people are saying that in a much more complex world, Best may no longer be as adequate as it used to be," said Richard Hackenberg, an executive vice president in Boston for Caroon & Black, the big insurance brokerage firm.

HEADLINE: Mockery Is Made Of Disney Memo

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 11

 BODY:
First came the Memo, a 28-page analysis of the state of the motion picture industry prepared last month by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chairman of Disney Studios . An attack on "runaway costs and mindless competition," the memo quickly became required reading in Hollywood. Now there is the Sequel, a deft parody of Disney's and Mr. Katzenberg's corporate style that has studio executives here in stitches.
"This country faces some of the worst economic and political conditions imaginable," the parody memo reads. "Our streets are filled with the homeless, the uneducated; our troops face the constant threat of chemical weapons, Scud missiles and repeated shell fire; and attendance at our parks is down, way down. 
 "That's the bad news. Now the good news. We intend to save money by paying our employees even less."
 
An Example at the Top
 The parody mimics the form and substance of Mr. Katzenberg's original document, which first surfaced in mid-January. "Our great and noble leader, Michael Eisner himself," it states, referring to the chief executive of Disney, "took home a paltry $11 million in stock and salary this year, down from last year's haul of over $50 million. That's an 88 percent sacrifice!
"All I'm asking is that each of you make the same sacrifice that Michael Eisner has made. By reducing employees' salaries by 88 percent we will establish a platform to launch the next round of good times."
Disney has declined to comment on the parody, and its origin is not known. But executives at other studios said they believed one or more Disney employees wrote the mock memorandum and then faxed it to friends at other companies. Parts of it were published today in Variety.
"It's hilarious," said an executive at a rival studio who received a copy of the document last week. "It sounds just like Jeffrey Katzenberg."
 
No Wastrels Here
 Of Hollywood's major studios, Disney has earned a reputation as the most frugal, and the parody makes sport of that situation. It also takes a poke at Mr. Katzenberg's image as one of Hollywood's top power brokers and the gusto with which he exercises his authority. "In the dizzying world of movie making, we must not be distracted from one fundamental concept: I am king," he supposedly says, adding that his memo is intended to be "a reference guide not unlike the Ten Commandments."
Much of Disney's success in recent years has come from movies starring actors whose careers were on the skids and therefore were willing to work for less money than bigger stars. The mock memorandum gleefully notes both that tendency and Disney's penchant for reworking scripts to eliminate unhappy endings, as displayed in "Pretty Woman" and other hits.
"It's our job to find the great idea, then mangle it and sugarize it, until it has a shot at appealing to the lowest common denominator of our society," the parody says.
"This is why we should be aggressive on all fronts -- at the dining table with major stars" and "at the back door of the Betty Ford Clinic, with a pen and contract in hand," it continues.
 
Base Motive, Basically
 Mr. Katzenberg's original memo concluded with a clarion call to Disney employees to take inspiration from the magic of movies. The parody, however, suggests the underlying motivation in movie making is something less noble.
"Greed is the only word that can explain how we can force employees to work 60-hour weeks at the studio, paying them the lowest salaries of any major studio, while taking home incredible salaries ourselves," it concludes.

HEADLINE: War Renews Interest in Sea-Air-Space Museum

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Since the hostilities in the Persian Gulf began on Jan. 16, attendance has more than doubled at the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in Manhattan, which has had more than its share of financial problems in recent years. During the last few weekends there have been 5,000 visitors, compared with less than half that number in the same period last year.
The curatorial staff of the museum -- a complex of the aircraft carrier Intrepid, the destroyer Edson and the guided-missile submarine Growler at 46th Street and the Hudson River -- is now racing to assemble and install the exhibition "War in the Gulf: The Liberation of Kuwait," which begins on Feb. 27. 
 "Everyone has been hearing about Tomahawks and Patriots and Scuds, but they're vague about them," Lawrence Sowinski, the museum's executive director, said in an interview the other day. "We felt we had a responsibility to our public to interpret this war that may change the world."
 
Explanation of Deployment
 The new show will chronicle the events leading to the Gulf conflict, explaining how the new high-tech tools of the military trade are being deployed in the Gulf.
"These are artifacts of war like the swords in the Metropolitan's collection of arms and armor," Mr. Sowinski said. "Many of the items in our collection are very rare, and in the future, some will be as treasured as the one-of-a-kind swords in the Metropolitan."
The recent attendance boom has not solved financial difficulties. The museum currently has a deficit of "several hundred thousand dollars," Mr. Sowinski said, because of the recession and the recent loss of about $200,000 in education grants from New York City.
From 1985 to 1988, the museum operated under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code, but it had been in the black until last fall, when New York City tourism fell victim to the recession. "Right now, we're looking hard to find some additional income," Mr. Sowinski said.
 
Ingenuity and Strength
 At times, the peculiar nature of the Intrepid's exhibits tests the mettle of its curators. On a recent morning, a fragile, 1,000-pound artifact worth $700,000 had to be moved into a carefully prepared niche.
"Not the usual museum installation," said Scott Koen, the aircraft curator, after the heaving and aligning was done. The object was a 12 1/2-foot-long Harpoon cruise missile, of the kind that has reportedly destroyed much of the Iraqi Navy in the Persian Gulf war, and the niche was an A-6 Intruder attack bomber, like the ones that have been harrying Iraqi troops in Kuwait.
Some of the items for the new show have yet to arrive. A Patriot missile and a diorama displaying its deployment will soon be on the way from the Raytheon Company in Lexington, Mass. The museum has also found a spare 21-foot-long Tomahawk cruise missile -- disarmed, of course -- in the factory of a Titusville, Fla. contractor.
"We're working with the National Polish Armed Forces Museum to get a Scud missile," said Mr. Sowinski. "And we've located a Scud missile launcher in Germany -- but we haven't been able to find transportation for it yet."
In addition, the museum is negotiating with the Israeli Government for Scud missile fragments from Iraqi attacks on Tel Aviv.
 
Specially Built Models
 The exhibition will display more than 30 scale models of aircraft, ships and equipment, most of which are being constructed for the show.
A number of the elements come from the museum's collection. In addition to the Intruder fighter and the Harpoon missile, the museum has an AV8 Harrier jump jet, of the kind being used against the Iraqis; an F-4 Phantom similar to the Wild Weasel missile-hunting aircraft used by the Kuwaiti Air Force; an A-7 Corsair attack plane, and an M-60 main battle tank, the kind used by the Saudis in the recent battle for the town of Khafji. The museum also has a 2,700-pound armor-piercing shell identical to those fired by the 16-inch cannons on the battleship Missouri toward Iraqi positions in Kuwait.
Despite the fearsome power of much of the museum's inventory, a large part of the collection is quite fragile and needs constant maintenance. Plexiglas cockpits deteriorate after too many hours in the sun on the Intrepid's 900-foot flight deck, ship and airplane parts are corroded by the salt air, and the three vessels require $85,000 worth of paint every year.
To Mr. Koen, the aircraft curator, the installation of the Harpoon missile "was pretty easy compared to some of the installations we've done."
His toughest museum installation was a 10,000-pound Regulus missile, which had to be mounted on the launcher of the Growler. "But we found a way to do it," he said. "Once we got an 80-ton crane, the rest was easy."

HEADLINE: U.S. Giving Haiti Aid To Buttress Democracy

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
The United States announced today that it was giving $82 million in aid to help Haiti complete its transition to democracy, an increase of $28 million over the $54 million granted in fiscal 1990.
The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide was sworn in as Haiti's first democratically elected President last week. Haiti has seen a violent and troubled transition to democracy since the collapse of the Duvalier family dictatorship five years ago.
The Agency for International Development, which announced the aid increase, said in a statement that the money would be used for programs in health, nutrition, business development, education, agriculture and preserving natural resources.
A major aim is to strengthen democracy and private sector growth, the statement said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar at Low Against Mark Despite Central Bank Buying

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell to a new postwar low against the German mark in United States and European trading yesterday despite dollar-buying by the central banks of a number of nations.
Gold also fell, with prices on the Commodity Exchange in New York dropping to $367.10 an ounce, off $3 from late Friday. At the Republic National Bank, gold settled at $366, down $3.75. 
 The dollar has been falling in recent days on speculation that the Federal Reserve will move to lower interest rates further to stimulate economic growth.
Declining interest rates in the United States make the dollar less appealing to foreign investors. In addition, the German central bank recently raised important lending rates to fight inflation, making the mark even more attractive.
Trading in the currency markets was light yesterday until comments by an official of the German central bank sent the currency falling. The official said last week's dollar-buying by central banks was done to stabilize the dollar, not to halt its fall.
The official also said that such intervention had little effect when it was trying to counteract a market trend, said Lorenzo Troni, vice president of foreign exchange at Paine Webber International Ltd.
Mr. Troni said the market was taking the comments as an indication that intervention by Germany "will be sort of weak in the future." The mark, he noted, "immediately took off to new levels."
Later, the Federal Reserve and the central banks of France, Canada and England sold marks to buy dollars, Mr. Troni said, but the action did not prevent the dollar's decline.
The dollar finished at a new low of 1.4455 marks in Europe, down from 1.4575 marks late Friday and below the previous record closing low of 1.4490 marks Thursday. In New York, the dollar sank to a record low of 1.4477 marks, compared with 1.4556 marks late Friday. The previous domestic closing low of 1.4483 marks was set Wednesday.
The markets were closed in Tokyo for National Foundation Day, a national holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 127.65 Japanese yen, down from 128.20 yen late Friday in Tokyo. In New York, one dollar bought 127.73 yen, down from 127.78 yen late Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9980, from $1.9875 late Friday. In New York, one pound cost $1.9985, up from $1.9885 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.2368 Swiss francs, down from 1.2435; 4.9360 French francs, down from 4.9595; 1,091.00 Italian lire, down from 1,096.25, and 1.1553 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1580.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $367.25 an ounce, from $369 late Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $367, from $368.50 late Friday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 67 cents an ounce, to $369.97.
Silver bullion for current delivery closed at $3.685 an ounce on the Comex, down from $3.820 late Friday. Silver fell in London to a late bid of $3.75, down from Friday's $3.83.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Windfall Exceeds $3 Billion From Oil Price Rise

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 11

 BODY:
After reeling for years because of low world oil prices, Mexico has pocketed a windfall of more than $3 billion thanks to the surge in oil prices since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, according to Mexican officials and a United Nations report.
But with oil prices receding on world markets, no one expects this gusher to keep flowing. So the Mexican Government is squirreling away the money to brace itself for a glut of crude oil, lower oil prices and the fallout from the United States recession. 
 "We know that this is one-time income, and one-time income is saved, not spent," one senior Government official said, repeating what has become a point of pride as well as principle for aides to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. "We will not repeat the same mistakes we have made in the past."
 
Net Gain for Latin America
 Although some Latin American countries like Chile and Brazil have paid sharply increased prices for imported fuel, the higher income and production of oil producers like Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador have largely outweighed those costs on a broader regional basis.
For Mexico, which earns 35 percent of its export revenue from oil sales, the market effects of the Persian Gulf conflict have been profound, defying early pessimism about the country's ability to respond to the crisis.
When oil prices first shot up as a result of the gulf crisis, many analysts doubted that Mexico's aging oil-production operations were capable of a serious increase in output.
 
Reserve of 68 Billion Barrels
 Mexico has proven oil reserves of more than 68 billion barrels, and untapped reserves that are estimated to be among the largest outside the Middle East and the Soviet Union. But its annual capital spending on oil exploration and drilling slid from nearly $6 billion in 1981 to a little more than $1 billion before the gulf crisis began.
As investment declined, output fell to 2.5 million barrels a day by the middle of last year, from 3 million barrels a day in 1982. When the gulf crisis arose, many analysts predicted that Mexican production could not be increased by more than about 15,000 barrels a day.
But they were wrong. By the end of 1990, according to official figures, overall production by Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, the state-run oil monopoly, had reached 2.65 million barrels a day, an increase of 4 percent, or 150,000 barrels a day, over pre-crisis production levels.
 
Added Profits Put in Savings
 The higher average prices of $22 to $25 a barrel in the last five months of 1990 for Mexico's three types of crude -- Isthmus, Olmeca and Maya -- plus the extra production in the same period, brought Mexico more than $3 billion over its budgeted oil income, which had been calculated on a projected price of $17 a barrel.
By contrast to the late 1970's and early 1980's, when the greatest share of additional Mexican oil revenues was added directly to the Government's budget, senior Mexican officials insisted from the beginning of the gulf crisis that none of the windfall income would be spent. Instead, it has been held, together with income from the continuing privatization of Government-held enterprises, in a special contingency fund to guard against future oil price drops and, eventually, to help pay down Mexico's debt load.
Despite widespread criticism here of the United States for its role in the gulf conflict, Mr. Salinas's Government has walked a fine line in keeping Mexican oil sales to the United States from becoming hostage to that debate.
 
Embargo Effort Rejected
 Last month, the leader of the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, called for a complete embargo on Mexican oil sales to the United States and all other parties to the conflict. Several Government officials also made statements appearing to support such a cutoff.
But in a statement issued later, the senior official for international affairs in Mr. Salinas's Institutional Revolutionary Party, Romeo Flores Caballero, rejected any suggestion that supplies to the United States would be restricted, declaring that "Mexico maintains its position of responding to the mechanisms of supply and demand in the international market."
According to statistics provided by Pemex, 61 percent of Mexico's 1990 oil production was sold in the Western Hemisphere, 27 percent in Europe and 12 percent in East Asia.

Industry's Tactics To Deflect Slump

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: BOCA RATON, Fla.

 BODY:
THE recession has severely damaged major industries, among them real estate, construction, auto making, banking and finance. But for the vast majority of manufacturers -- the heart of the American economy -- the recession is just beginning to undermine operations. And the great hope of the executives who run these companies is that by fall the recession will have ended, leaving them almost unscathed.
That hope showed up repeatedly in interviews and conversations over the weekend with more than two dozen chief executives and top corporate officers at the semiannual meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers. The association's staff economists embody the members' hopes -- indeed, their heartfelt expectation -- in a formal forecast predicting that the economy will rebound by late summer, if the Persian Gulf war ends soon. 
 "Everyone is looking for a turnaround in the last half of the year, but no one really knows," said Donald J. Krumm, chairman of the Maytag Corporation, the appliance maker. In the meantime, as the executives try to cope with the unfolding damage to their companies, the main problem so far is the great difficulty in raising product prices.
Without periodic price increases, profit margins are squeezed. And if profits shrink for long enough (say, through the end of this year), then companies begin to cut back spending for new machinery and product development. Such cutbacks would make the recession harder to shake off and, in the long run, would make the companies less competitive.
Valmont Industries, a Nebraska manufacturer of irrigation equipment and street lights, is at the beginning of this cycle. Orders are off, the costs oflabor and other expenses are still rising and price increases are hard to come by, so Valmont's return on original equity -- that is, the return on the money initially invested in Valmont -- fell to 16 percent last year from more than 20 percent annually in the late 1980's. "We can mark time for a while, continuing to re-invest profits, but over the long term we have to average 20 percent a year to justify capital spending," William F. Welsh 2d, the company's chief executive, said.
Data from the Commerce Department show that like Valmont most manufacturers managed to maintain capital spending levels for new equipment through the fourth quarter of 1990. But even the most profitable among them, exceptional companies like Rubbermaid Inc., are struggling for price increases that keep pace with inflation.
Some manufacturers are cutting advertising budgets, but Stanley C. Gault, Rubbermaid's chairman, says he has increased his company's spending, particularly for ads suggesting that Rubbermaid's plastic dustpans, kitchen utensils and other household items are indispensable. Rubbermaid and other companies are also introducing newproducts ahead of schedule, on the theory that new products will draw consumers more easily than old ones and will command relatively high prices even in hard times. Rubbermaid recently pushed ahead the introduction of a new line of brushes, mops and other cleaning items, and also a new plastic tool box. "If you can move production up a few weeks, it is very important," Mr. Gault said.
If customers reject price increases, then cutting costs can preserve profit margins and postpone the day that cuts must be made in capital spending. Many companies have cut dividend payments to preserve cash, reduced their work force and postponed pay increases. And they have put pressure on suppliers to hold down raw materials prices.
Exports are another way to beat the profit squeeze, as is manufacturing overseas for sale to foreign customers. As the dollar falls in value, sales in German marks, for example, convert into more and more dollars. "Without any change in the number of items sold, the profits earned overseas are worth more in dollars," said Joseph R. Oldfield, a vice president of the Polaroid Corporation.
Exports also help in another way. With orders falling, many companies are slowing assembly lines, which means they produce fewer items, even though the fixed costs of running a factory must still be covered. That problem has squeezed profits at the Labonco Corporation, a maker of electronic ventilation equipment in Kansas City, Mo. In response, Labonco opened a big warehouse in the Netherlands and stepped up production to fill it with inventory for distribution in Europe, which is mostly not in recession.
"The key is to work like the devil for the future, so that when the recession ends, you can move out of it quickly," said John N. McConnell, Labonco's chairman. But Labonco's Dutch warehouse can hold just so many ventilators. Mr. McConnell's tactic, and those of the others, assumes that the recession will be short-lived. If it is not, then capital spending will inevitably suffer and the recession will enter a new phase -- one harder to reverse.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Prices Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed in light trading yesterday, as dealers and investors began to acclimate themselves to interest rate levels they have not seen in a year or longer.
Long-term interest rates are at their lowest levels since January, 1990. Meanwhile, short-term rates have fallen even further. At yesterday's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, the new securities sold at their lowest average levels since early 1988. 
 "These are pretty rich levels, and it takes a little getting used to," one government bond trader said. "But more money is coming off the sidelines and into the stock and bond markets. A reliquefication of the financial markets seems to be taking place."
At the bill auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.86 percent, down from the 5.97 percent average rate at last week's sale. It is the lowest three-month bill rate since the auction on April 18, 1988.
Meanwhile, bids on the new six-month bills generated an average rate of 5.85 percent, down from 5.94 percent a week ago. It is the lowest rate on a six-month bill since the bill auction on March 14, 1988.
 
Treasury Securities Sale
 Traders said the distribution of last week's $34.5 billion worth of Treasury securities that were sold at the quarterly refunding auctions was pretty much at an end.
However, that does not mean that a significant proportion of the new issues do not remain in the Wall Street's hands, some analysts said.
"All of the indications suggest that the dealers owned an unusual share of the auctions," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets.
Mr. McCarthy said that Wall Street bought slightly more than 97 percent of the issues sold last week, roughly three percentage points more than it normally does at refunding auctions.
"A lot of dealers seem to be positioned in expectation of more favorable news on the economy and inflation," Mr. McCarthy said.
While last week's auctions went well, a smaller but not insignificant supply hurdle will need to be addressed next week, when the Treasury will sell new two-year notes and five-year notes.
"Sometime next week, after the twos and fives are sold, the market really has a chance to do better," the trader said. "But for the time being, I would guess we'll just be churning around at these levels."
Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago, said that "the market is moving around in a very listless, range-bound way, waiting for a reason to move."
 
Report on Retail Sales
 Economic data this week, including January reports on retail sales, producer prices and industrial production, are expected to show no signs of strength, Mr. Johnson and other analysts said. But weak numbers are widely forecast. As a result, if the figures meet market expectations there is little reason to anticipate that interest rates would quickly move lower, the analysts said.
"The data will be reasonably constructive," Mr. Johnson said, "but that is pretty much already incorporated in rates. The market will probably have to wait until early March, when we get the February employment numbers and a further reading on progress in the Middle East before it moves again. But the rally is not over."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the Treasury's new benchmark bonds, the 7 7/8 percent securities of 2021, were offered in late when-issued trading at a price of 99 1/ 32, down 3/32, to yield 7.96 percent, compared with 7.95 percent late Friday.
Among note issues, the new 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a 99 29/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 7.76 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 14/32, up 1/ 32, to yield 6.75 percent.
New-issue activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market remained strong yesterday, as four companies, including Coca-Cola, priced a total of $600 million worth of new securities.
In the municipal bond market, the decision by Moody's Investors Service to lower its ratings on New York City bonds had little impact on prices of outstanding city issues, traders said. The ratings were lowered by Moody's one notch, citing huge fiscal problems and recession. Prices of 30-year city bonds were offered at a price to yield about 8.40 percent, in line with late Friday.
New York City is expected to sell just under $1 billion worth of new tax-exempt and taxable issues later this week.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged to down about 1/8 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: 1990 Survey On Banking

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The nation's banks had a miserable year in 1990, with profits plummeting and problem loans soaring, according to a study released yesterday.
Over all, banks saw their nonperforming assets, or problem loans, rise 35 percent, to 3.03 percent of assets in 1990, up from 2.24 percent of assets the year before, according to SNL Securities, a banking research and publishing company in Charlottesville, Va.
The group's survey of 1990 banking results showed that when write-offs for third world loans were excluded, the nation's banks reported average return on assets was 0.54 percent, a 40 percent drop from the year before. Many of the nation's largest banks set aside millions in 1989 in one-time charges to cover failing loans to third world countries.
An SNL spokeswoman, Elisabeth Todaro, said the company's research showed earnings were the worst since the Depression, but she did not provide figures for comparison.
The report provided stark evidence of the credit problem, with banks' loan growth slowing to 1.89 percent in 1990, down from 5.88 percent the year before. The Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates in recent weeks to encourage banks to resume lending and stimulate growth.

HEADLINE: Malaysia Trading Plan Seeks a Unified Voice

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia

 BODY:
East Asia may be the site of some of the world's fastest-growing economic powers, but historically it has always been so fractious and competitive that it could never be organized into anything resembling a trading bloc.
Now, with the the unification of the European market approaching and feelings of alienation from the United States rising, Malaysia is trying a debated effort to organize the region into what it delicately calls an "economic grouping" of Asian nations.
 
Little Discussed in West
 The plan, laid out two months ago by Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's Prime Minister and the steward of one of Asia's biggest economic success stories, has been little discussed in the West, but it has become one of the hottest topics in East Asia. 
 It is still far from clear that Mr. Mahathir's East Asian economic grouping will ever come to pass, especially in a region that has never been able to translate its political alliances into economic ones. While his idea has attracted some support, its success hinges on the willingness of one participant: Japan, whose economy is the linchpin of the rest of Asia.
So far, Japanese politicians are skittish about any economic alliance that would seem to pit it against Europe and the United States, which has developed a free-trade agreement with Canada and is working toward one with Mexico.
The next few months will be crucial, as Malaysia completes its first round of explanations and seeks to create a formal trading body. It could pick up more support, especially if the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks fails, paving the way for fiercer direct competition.
 
Trade Barriers Common
 Many Asian countries are known for erecting huge trade barriers to protect their infant industries. Malaysia produces manufactured goods that it cannot sell to its closest neighbors, and it slaps huge taxes on imported cars and other goods.
But Mr. Mahathir, who in 10 years as Malaysia's Prime Minister has become a powerful and sometimes feared figure in Southeast Asian politics, has clearly struck a chord with his idea for a more organized and aggressive Asian economic alliance.
"Singly, we will have no hope of arguing our case," he said. "Only together will we have more bargaining power and be in a better position when negotiating for free trade."
No one, not even some of Mr. Mahathir's Cabinet members, can define precisely what kind of economic bloc he is trying to form. Everyone seems to agree that it would include the six members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, or Asean: Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei and Malaysia. Mr. Mahathir has said that the group will also include Vietnam, Myanmar (formerly Burma), Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea.
But the list excludes countries populated chiefly by non-Asian races, including Australia and New Zealand. For weeks, Malaysia's Minister for International Trade and Industry, Rafidah Aziz, has been traveling through Asia seeking members.
"What we are talking about is enhancing regional trade among countries with commonalities here in Asia," said Mrs. Rafidah, who supports Mr. Mahathir.
The Prime Minister's plan has not been welcomed by everyone, and Malaysia has been amending parts of it. Indonesia has expressed no enthusiasm, and Taiwan and Hong Kong, among others, have been silent.
The reasons for the objections are not clear, but some Asian officials say they fear that a poisoning of relations with the United States or Japan could hurt their best chances for export. Last week, Mr. Mahathir said he thought the United States was trying to influence some nations not to join the trade group, which American officials in Kuala Lumpur deny.
In the last two months, since Mr. Mahathir took his Cabinet and neighboring nations by surprise with the proposal, the description of the trade grouping has begun to shift. He originally spoke of a trading bloc, immediately prompting fears that he was looking for a way to create trade barriers against countries outside Asia.
The word "bloc" was then deemed offensive because it could scare away Japan and could raise the ire of American officials, who have not supported the plan. Malaysia now is speaking of a "grouping" that would work within multilateral trading groups, like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Officials in Kuala Lumpur also insist it would "complement" other organizations, like Asean, a 24-year old political alliance that has never been effective as an economic entity.
 
The Plan's Objective
 The object, Malaysia says, is to turn Southeast Asia into a leading exporting force and an investment haven, to give it power to match Europe and America. So far, exporting is dominated by Japan and, to a lesser degree, the nations known as the "four tigers": South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Only Japan enjoys such political influence.
"The whole line is that this will not exclude anybody, as long as they look Asian," one Western diplomat here said. "But no one can say what 'complement' means. And this is hardly a group of like-minded countries they are getting together."
Indeed, it is a collection of nations at different stages of development.
At one end of the spectrum are the "tigers." They have grown so quickly in the last decade that they are looking for cheap labor and investment opportunities abroad. Then comes nations like Thailand, perhaps Asia's greatest success story in the late 1980's, though it has begun to show signs of choking on its overexpansion. Malaysia follows, a country that has quickly moved beyond the days of tin and rubber plantations to become a manufacturing center.
But also in the group are countries mired in problems of economic reform, like China, Myanmar, North Korea and Vietnam, all of which have discussed various degrees of economic reform, but have actively resisted political liberalization. Each has considerable poverty and lack a skilled work force.
 
Capitalists and Communists
 If they joined, it would be the first time that some of the world's most fervent capitalists, like the Singaporeans, joined some of its most unreconstructed Communists, like the Vietnamese, in a trading group.
But the critical element to the grouping is Japan, which still has no formal relations with North Korea and is on strained terms with Myanmar and Vietnam. Some Japanese officials have suggested that Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu may be unenthusiastic about the proposal.
So, at first, were most other countries. But Singapore changed its mind last month, and its new Prime Minister, Goh Chok Tong, said the grouping would give small Asian countries a voice they now lack. The Philippines has also been mildly supportive, and China termed the idea interesting. Indonesia and Thailand, Malaysia's biggest competitors, have all but dismissed the concept.
The United States has said little, but American diplomats in Asia seem unenthused, particularly because the United States would be excluded.
"It will take some time to fully develop a view," said one American diplomat here, "because no one can quite figure out what the idea is yet."

HEADLINE: Chapter 11 For Carter Hawley

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., the largest department store chain on the West Coast, sought protection from its creditors under Federal bankruptcy law today in an effort to shore up its deteriorating finances.
In filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Carter Hawley Hale became the latest retailer to fall victim to the combination of a weak economy and a crippling debt burden. 
 The company, based in Los Angeles, operates the Broadway chain in Southern California and Arizona, the Emporium chain in the San Francisco area and Weinstocks in the Sacramento region.
A large part of $800 million of Carter Hawley's $1.6 billion in long-term debt includes high-yield "junk bonds" sold in 1987 as part of a plan to evade a hostile takeover bid by the Limited Inc., a chain of women's specialty stores based in Columbus, Ohio.
 
New Financing Acquired
 Philip M. Hawley, chairman of the company, said he was optimistic that Carter Hawley could emerge from bankruptcy in stronger condition. He said the company had $800 million in new financing from Chemical Bank to pay suppliers and remodel and upgrade its stores.
Analysts, however, took a much dimmer view of the company's prospects, questioning whether creditors would allow the company to survive intact. Some said it was likely that the company would have to sell some or all of its 88 stores under pressure from bondholders and shareholders, including the company's employee stock-ownership plan, which holds 45 percent of the shares.
The Chapter 11 bankrupcty filing allows the company to operate while avoiding paying past debts until it files a business and reorganization plan, but it can buy new goods and pay for them from the new financing from Chemical Bank.
Carter Hawley Hale's stock closed today at $1.625 a share, down 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Originally known as Broadway-Hale Stores Inc., the company became Carter Hawley Hale in 1974 after Edward W. Carter, who had run the company since 1946, promoted Mr. Hawley, who had come up through the ranks, to president. The company grew quickly during the 1970's, acquiring regional department and specialty stores including Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and John Wanamaker.
But in 1986 and 1987, the company was forced into a bitter takeover battle with a group led by the Limited. It responded with a plan that spun off some of the store chains but left Carter Hawley Hale with a huge debt. By the beginning of this year, the company had been forced to pare itself back to its West Coast chains.
 
Once Dominated West Coast
 The West Coast stores had once dominated their markets serving middle-class customers, but they suffered in recent years from what analysts say was an ill-defined image, uninspired merchandise and stores badly in need of physical upgrading.
The company has also been hurt by intense competition, particularly in California from competitors including the R. H. Macy Company and Nordstrom Inc. Hampered by a lack of cash, the company has lagged in upgrading stores and keeping shelves filled with best-selling merchandise, analysts said.
"It's one thing to have a bad balance sheet, but they have a bad balance sheet and a bad business," said Robert M. Raiff, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence Inc., a New York brokerage. "The best thing for the company is to be sold."
 
Interest Payment Was Due
 The most immediate impact of the bankruptcy filing will be to relieve Carter Hawley Hale of its obligation to meet $44 million in annual interest payments on its high-yield junk bonds. A payment of $22 million was due on Friday.
Mr. Hawley said that apart from the suspension of the junk bond payments, the company should be able to conduct "business as usual" with its suppliers and employees and that it had received permission from the bankruptcy court to pay its routine bills. He said he believed the company could emerge from bankruptcy without selling any stores or other assets.
The company was pushed into bankruptcy by an inability to obtain credit that accelerated over the last month. Banks have become increasingly reluctant to lend to retailers, especially those that already have a heavy debt load. In addition, suppliers became skittish about advancing credit, hampering the company's ability to keep its stores stocked.
 
Trying to Raise Cash
 Carter Hawley Hale has been scrambling in recent months to raise cash and reduce its debt. It has eliminated 1,000 jobs, or 3.3 percent of its work force, for an estimated annual savings of $75 million. It sold its Thalhimers department store division to the May Department Stores Company in December for $317 million.
Last month, it announced that it would sell its credit card operation to the GE Capital Corporation for $50 million plus the removal of $600 million in debt. But the deal fell through last week on the same day that an agreement to borrow $100 million from the Bank of America also collapsed.
In its bankruptcy papers, filed early today with the United States Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles, Carter Hawley Hale listed assets of $1.2 billion and liabilities of $1.38 billion. It did not provide a list of secured and unsecured creditors.
 
Mixed Reaction From Suppliers
 The bankruptcy filing drew mixed reactions from suppliers.
"It's a sad shame, of course, but we are a double-digit, million-dollar supplier to Carter Hawley, and we're waiting to hear more details of their financing," said Linda Wachner, chief executive of Warnaco Inc., a leading apparel producer based in Bridgeport, Conn. "We stopped shipping to them last week and won't resume until we get more financing information and are put on one of the creditors' committees."
Lee Abraham, chairman of the Associated Merchandising Corporation in New York, said Mr. Hawley and H. Michael Hecht, Carter Hawley Hale's president, were expected to travel to New York this week to speak with key suppliers.
"I think their willingness to communicate with the market and the funds they have available are cause for optimism," Mr. Abraham said, "but it seems that the bankruptcy trend is a never-ending one."
Carter Hawley Hale's bankruptcy comes one week after Hills Department Stores Inc., the nation's fifth-largest discount chain, filed for Chapter 11. Also having filed since the beginning of last year were the Federated Department Stores Company, the Allied Stores Corporation and the Ames Department Store Company.

HEADLINE: Wisconsin Welfare Plan: To Reward the Married

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, who has made a national reputation with his aggressive proposals to overhaul Wisconsin's welfare system, offered another one this month. He wants to reward teen-age mothers who marry and penalize those who do not.
As part of the budget he presented to the Legislature on Thursday, the Republican Governor unveiled a pilot program to cap welfare payments to unwed teen-age mothers regardless of how many children they have, and to pay larger grants to those who marry. Recipients would have to finish high school or get job training, or forgo benefits. 
 The plan is one of several across the nation based on the idea that welfare ought to be no more than a temporary safety net, with benefits engineered to discourage long-term dependency. Increasingly, states are offering cash incentives to get the behavior they want.
In Ohio, teen-age parents who stay in school can get child care, transportation and an extra $62 a month. In Kansas, lawmakers are considering a bill that would pay welfare recipients $500 for agreeing to use Norplant, a long-lasting contraceptive that is surgically implanted. Proposed legislation in Wyoming would have the state pay childbirth expenses for all women who put their babies up for adoption.
Under Mr. Thompson, who was first elected in 1986 after campaigning against high taxes and welfare benefits, Wisconsin has been in the forefront of efforts to require welfare recipients to work. And three years ago, the state began docking the welfare checks of parents whose teen-agers had three or more unexcused absences from school in a given month. So far, the state has withheld a total of $3 million from thousands of families, though it has not determined how the program is affecting school performance.
Now Mr. Thompson wants to tie welfare payments to marriage, saying the current system only encourages unmarried women to have more children. His proposal would not affect the 78,000 Wisconsin families who now receive welfare; it would apply only to new welfare applicants under 20 years of age. It would be tested in four counties, including Milwaukee, before expanding to the rest of the state. The administration says about 1,600 young women would face either marriage or a lower welfare check.
The current welfare payment in Wisconsin is $440 a month for a woman with one child, and about $80 a month for each additional child. Under the new plan, unwed mothers could receive no more than $440 a month no matter how many children they had. But those who married would get nearly $80 a month extra, and would be permitted to keep up to $14,500 in earnings from outside jobs.
The state said these recipients would be eligible for programs to help them get a high school diploma, for unpaid "work experience" in areas like garbage recycling and building maintenance, and for job training in fields like auto mechanics and television repair.
"I want to give people the elevator of opportunity and get away from the locked-in generations of welfare dependency," the 49-year-old Governor said in a telephone interview. "Now a man can come in and get trained for a job, become a useful member of society and take care of his family, so that society doesn't have to do it for him. I certainly don't want to force anybody to get married, but don't think the welfare system should act as an impediment."
Before the plan can be adopted, even as an experiment, Mr. Thompson will have to win over Democratic majorities in both houses of the Legislature and gain a waiver of rules from the Federal Department of Health and Human Services. Democrats said they were skeptical and officials in Washington would not comment, but the Governor has persuaded each before.
His proposal has attracted the attention of welfare policy analysts around the nation. Many applaud the effort to reinforce families and reward their working, but are troubled by the appearance of punishing other welfare recipients.
"To penalize people who don't get married in society in which family ties are weakening in general seems like tough medicine," said Prof. Richard P. Nathan, director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York at Albany. "This is not in the mainstream. This sounds like a sledgehammer policy."
Other analysts said the proposal went further than almost any other in drawing a line between acceptable and unacceptable family patterns in the welfare system.
"The notion of denying benefits when an additional child is born and providing generous subsidies to those who marry is unknown in the U.S. welfare system," said Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution in Washington. But he and other analysts said there was little evidence that financial incentives changed patterns of marriage or childbearing, and they added that such inducements could hurt more than help.
"Giving financial incentives for parents to do right thing by their children is not out of bounds," Mr. Burtless said. "No one likes people having children out of wedlock, but it's very difficult to deny them the resources that they need. More damage could be done by making children destitute."
Even those who support the idea of curtailing benefits for unwed mothers question whether $80 a month is incentive enough. "I think this is better than the status quo, but how much better is the question," said Walter E. Williams, a professor of economics at George Mason University who has written extensively on the topic of welfare.
While married couples in general fare much better financially than single mothers, he said, marriage is one of the clearest routes out of poverty. The poverty rate for blacks who graduate from high school, get a job and stay married is 6 percent, as against more than 30 percent for blacks as a group, according to the Census Bureau.
But Professor Williams said that while encouraging marriage was a worthy goal paying people to take their vows corrupted the institution and offered no assurance that their lives would improve.
"Marriage is much deeper than some government program," he said. "When you you stand in front of the minister, you're supposed to be there because you love the person and are committed to them, not because you're going to get $80. That's a tainted marriage from the beginning. That trivializes marriage. If $80 will do it, that is bad news."
Local critics say the state should not be in the matchmaking business. "This is dressed-up marriage brokering for poor people," said Hannah Rosenthal, executive director of the Wisconsin Women's Council, a research and advocacy group. "It's dangling a paycheck in front of a girl and saying, 'We'll give you a bonus if you get married.' It assumes that the ticket out of poverty is a man."
 
Viewing Welfare Differently
 Governor Thompson said the point of the measure was not to make people get married but to get them to view welfare differently. He insists that his welfare initiatives are working and cites a 21 percent drop in the state's welfare rolls since he took office in January 1987, to 238,000 people, from almost 300,000.
"People don't like the fact that I'm putting strings on their welfare, that I'm making them go to school or get a job," he said. "They're not going to get rich off of this. This gives them incentive to go to work."
Women who have had to turn to welfare say life is not so simple. For one thing, they say, they have not exactly been flooded with marriage proposals. "These mothers have no control over whether these guys take a hike or not," said Deborah Darden, a former welfare recipient who is now a job counselor for women trying to get off welfare. "They haven't been given a choice. I think a lot of them would love to get married if they were given a chance. But what kind of song and dance are they supposed to do to get keep these men around?"
Julius Fourston, a 21-year-old mail-room clerk in Milwaukee, said a welfare check would not induce him to marry. "That's getting married for the wrong reason," he said. "You can't do anything with $20 a week. I want to have a good job before I get married. I can't support a wife and kid now. I want to have a job with a future. I want to do things right."
Ms. Darden, who pulled herself up from welfare to job counseling, said poor people, like anyone else, would follow society's norms when they felt they were part of society. "If the Governor improves the quality of life for them," she said, "people will naturally get married."

As Bombs Fall And Flags Fly, Business Booms

BYLINE: By ANDREW H. MALCOLM

DATELINE: BLOOMFIELD, N.J.

 BODY:
Dan Connors thought he'd never see anything quite so bizarre at work. Squads of silent men in nice suits pulled open every drawer, every door, every closet, every box in the Annin Company factory here. They took nothing, these smile-free fellows, just poked through everything.
At every entrance they stationed guards in equally nice suits with government-issue sunglasses. They wouldn't admit Mr. Connors until the company president identified him. 
 That was the September week in 1988 when George Bush came to New Jersey to wrap his campaign for President in the American flag at one of the nation's biggest flag factories. Now, of course, George Bush is President Bush. He's leading one of modern history's largest military operations. And it's got all wrapped up in flags.
It's a funny thing about the American flag. Its viewers seem to see in it the color of the moment, like the same ocean shining deep blue on a sunny day and lurking dark gray beneath clouds. The flag has always been red, white and blue. Its design hasn't changed in three decades. But now the flag business sure has changed on Llewellyn Street, where Helga Hart is banging so many machine staples into little wooden flagpoles every day that her right foot is numb even before overtime.
If many families get flags freshly folded from caskets, feelings could change. But for now, the Persian Gulf operation has been great for the flag. Even on wintry days, flags appear in front of houses all over the suburbs. On businesses and restaurants. Car and truck radio antennas.
In Hartford, flags are so scarce that radio stations broadcast listener tips on which stores still have some. WOR gave them away and reported its phone lines were never so jammed. Professional and collegiate athletes wear flags, while Connecticut high school wrestlers seek flag stickers for the backs of mat shoes. Even New Jersey's criminals want flags; someone stole the flag from the South Orange Rescue Squad the other night.
There have been many peaks of flag fascination since 1820, when Alexander Annin began making them as a sideline at his New York hardware business. Since 1847, that's all the family company has done -- make flags, through good times and bad times, slow times and fast times.
 Congress gave Medals of Honor for capturing Civil War flags. But the best flag times are not just about causes; usually they also in volve an easily identified bad guy to fly the flag against. World War II was a good flag time. Although the 48-star flag hadn't changed since 1912, everyone wanted a new one to support the war effort, and there were obvious bad guys.
The Korean War was a little fuzzy; who'd ever heard of Kim Il Sung? But 1959 brought in two new states, which made obsolete every flag in existence. Then came Vietnam, which so divided this country that many of the flags not being burned went into hiding. The Bicentennial ignited great flag passion, although interest, uh, waned sharply on July 5, 1976.
There have been brief bubbles of flag fervency since -- the return of hostages from Iran, for instance, the 1984 Olympics. And the Reagan Presidency seemed to elevate flag exposure generally. Always, the South was the strongest market; the Midwest was good too, if the economy was strong.
The nation's half-dozen major flag manufacturers were aware of the United Nations January deadline to Iraq. Orders were stronger than usual all autumn.
But nothing prepared them for the morning after the first allied air attacks. "It was an explosion of orders," said Mr. Connors, "from everywhere." The cause was generally acceptable, the bad guy easily identifiable and the number of families and friends touched by military involvement many.
Within hours of Baghdad's bombing, the Memorial Day inventory was gone. Because Americans couldn't get flags, they wanted them even more, especially the 3-by-5-foot homeowner size.
With overtime and a second shift, the factory here ships over 10,000 flags a week, plus 40,000 on Mrs. Hart's little wooden sticks. If no more orders came in, the three-story brick factory on a quiet suburban street might catch up in seven weeks. Alfreda Kruk stiches white stripes to red stripes 200 yards at a time. Evangeline Archondes bangs grommets one after another. Rouba Khalia snips loose threads. Even Guilford Kempadoo, a supervisor, labels.
They're not famous like Betsy Ross. They're more like Mary Pickersgill. She's the little-known seamstress who responded to a rush order during a previous flag peak. It was her handiwork that Francis Scott Key saw through the rockets' red glare.

Times Co. Reports a Profit Of $12.2 Million in 4th Period

 BODY:
The New York Times Company yesterday reported net income for the fourth quarter of $12.2 million, or 16 cents a share, compared with a loss of $19 million for the quarter a year earlier.
The results for the 1989 period had been depressed by substantial one-time charges. 
 Disregarding special charges and credits for 1989 and 1990, the picture was considerably gloomier in the recent quarter. Excluding those factors, earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of last year fell 31 percent, to 31 cents a share, from 45 cents a share a year earlier. Profits for the year were down 11.5 percent, to $1.46 a share from $1.65.
 
Weakness in Advertising
 The company attributed most of the decline to a poor advertising climate, particularly in New York City. Advertising volume at The New York Times newspaper for the fourth quarter of last year declined 19 percent from the corresponding quarter of 1989 (which had one more Sunday, a major advertising day).
About 65 percent of the decline in advertising was in help-wanted and real estate classified advertising, categories particularly likely to suffer in an economic downturn.
The special charges and credits were complex. In the fourth quarter of 1989, the company took charges totaling 60 cents a share for staff reductions, wholesaler settlements and a valuation reserve at its forest products group. By contrast, the 1990 fourth-quarter results were reduced by 7 cents a share for start-up costs, depreciation and interest expense at new plants in Edison, N.J., and Gwinnett County, Ga.
Revenues for the 1990 quarter declined to $456 million, from $470.2 million in 1989.
 
Sale Affected 1989 Results
 The company's net income for 1990 declined to $64.8 million, or 85 cents a share, compared with $266.6 million, or $3.39 a share, in 1989. The 1989 results were swollen by proceeds from the sale of the company's cable television operation.
Income from continuing operations, also $64.8 million, declined 5 percent for the year, from $68.2 million in 1989. The 1990 figure amounted to 85 cents a share, down from 87 cents in 1989.
Revenues for the year improved slightly, to $1.77 billion, from $1.76 billion in 1989.
The New York Times's average circulation reached record highs last year. Daily sales increased to 1.15 million, or 51,200 copies above the 1989 level, and Sunday circulation jumped almost 60,000, to 1.7 million. The Times became the nation's largest-circulation Sunday paper.
Operating profit of the company's newspaper group rose in the fourth quarter to $32.1 million, from $25.1 million in the 1989 period. The group's revenues were $350.1 million in the 1990 period, down from $375.2 million in the 1989 quarter. For the year, the group's operating profit declined 23 percent, to $140.3 million, and revenues dropped slightly, to $1.36 billion from $1.4 billion. The group includes The Times, a group of 32 regional newspapers and a one-third interest in The International Herald Tribune.
The company sold three small newspapers in 1990, but record circulation was reached for the regional papers that remained, with daily sales up 21,100 copies, to 881,000, and Sunday sales up 16,500, to 871,000.
The company's magazine group had a fourth-quarter operating loss of $6.3 million, exactly half the loss for the fourth quarter of 1989. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 1990 were $85.2 million, compared with $75 million the year before.
Charges associated with the acquisitions of McCall's and Golf World magazines were 29 cents a share for 1990, compared with 18 cents in 1989.
"Excluding the effect of the McCall's acquisition, the group's 1990 fourth-quarter and full-year performance would have resulted in operating profits which were significantly higher than the respective 1989 periods," a company statement said.
Operating profit of the broadcasting and information services group increased to $4.7 million in the quarter, from $2.9 million in 1989. Operating profit for the year was $15.1 million, compared with $12.7 million in 1989. Profits suffered in 1989 from a $1.1 million write-down of certain syndicated program rights.
The forest products group reported a decline in profits from continuing operations to $38,000, from $2.1 million in 1989. Much of the decline resulted from big discounts in the price of newsprint.
The Times Company's class A stock closed at $24.875 yesterday, up 62.5 cents a share, on the American Stock Exchange. The earnings were released after the close of trading.

HEADLINE: Worn Out, Some Step Back From Fight Against AIDS

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Marie St. Cyr first encountered AIDS nine years ago when she headed a social-services program in Florida. A client in his 30's began losing weight and falling ill for no apparent reason; he soon died.
Two weeks ago, worn down by the seemingly endless effort against the disease, Ms. St. Cyr thought of that man as she sat through a memorial service at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in New York City for Richard Dunne, the former executive director of the Gay Men's Health Crisis, who died of AIDS-related causes at 46. 
 "It was such a stark reminder that we haven't moved very far in this crisis," said Ms. St. Cyr, who recently resigned as executive director of the Women and AIDS Resource Network in New York. "People are still dying. The resources are meager. There's still no cure. You come to a point where you realize, 'How effective can I be?' "
 
Emotional Toll
 Ten years into an epidemic that has claimed more than 100,000 lives in the United States, many of those who have long cared for or been advocates for people with AIDS find themselves overwhelmed by despair or struggling to cope. Some, like Ms. St. Cyr, who now works with the city's Human Rights Commission, have recognized signs of burnout and left the field, at least temporarily. Many others stay on, their commitment fueled by anger or hope, or the fear that if they quit nobody else will step in to take their place.
As the search for more funds to combat AIDS becomes harder amid budget crises and recession, and as the growing AIDS caseload both pressures and decimates their ranks, workers say the AIDS fight is extracting a higher emotional toll. More and more veterans of the field -- from volunteer "buddies" who do chores for the very sick to doctors on the cutting edge of research -- are pausing to assess the implications of that toll and to try to blunt its impact.
"Turnover costs us money and experience," said Paul Kawata, director of the National Minority AIDS Council in Washington, which provides technical assistance to 200 organizations. "We're all spending more time looking at how we can take care of our staff."
Within the last year, AIDS agencies like the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York City, which serves 4,500 clients a year, have increased efforts to address the stress and frustration of their workers. The director ofvolunteers for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, Joseph Ripple, said three-day "grief and healing" workshops, begun 10 months ago, have reduced turnover among the organization's cadre of 2,200 volunteers to a quarter of the previous rate.
Staff support groups, many with psychotherapists, are springing up among more nonprofit AIDS organizations and medical AIDS units. Some agencies are consideringflexible schedules, coffee breaks and other concepts borrowed from the private sector to relieve stress.
Some organizations are also making staff members take vacations, which many workers had not done because they felt guilty taking time off.
"It's not something that's been addressed because it sounds so self-serving," said Regina Quattrochi, who this month became executive director of the AIDS Resource Center, which provides housing and support services for homeless people with AIDS. "It's almost like it's taboo to say, 'I also have to take care of myself.' " She has vowed to give priority to the needs of her staff of 85.
 
Social Problems
 AIDS workers say that watching people in their 20's, 30's and 40's die -- most after wasting away physically and mentally -- is among the most difficult aspects of their job.
Many victims are friends and co-workers, and it is not unusual for workers to have to cope with seeing an entire family, including children, die from the disease.
As the epidemic has spread among intravenous drug users and their sex partners, mainly in poor black and Hispanic neighborhoods, those who work with AIDS victims must deal with the accompanying social ills, like homelessness and inadequate health care. They must also contend with policy debates like the dispute over whether to provide condoms to high school students to fight the spread of the disease.
"It's so frustrating to see political funding and religious barriers preventing us from stopping this epidemic in its tracks," said Mark Barnes, a lawyer who is resigning as director of policy for the New York State Department of Health's AIDS Institute.
Mr. Barnes, 30 years old, is switching to private practice after six years of AIDS-related work, including cases of housing and job discrimination against AIDS patients. Most recently he helped devise the state's guidelines for medical personnel infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
 
'You Never Win'
 Mr. Barnes said that although he thinks of his work as "a noble calling," the vastness of the crisis has gradually overwhelmed him, to the point that he feels inadequate and defeated. More than once in the last few months he has found himself crying while driving to work.
"In AIDS you never win -- all you do is stave off disaster," he said. "Even when you get what you want, all you're really doing is controlling the damage. We're always playing catch-up."
At the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, where pioneering research in pediatric AIDS includes an effort to develop a vaccine to block transmission of the AIDS virus from mother to fetus, AIDS work is a challenge. But the college's division of allergy and immunology, which is responsible for staffing AIDS clinics at Montefiore Medical Center and Bronx Municipal Hospital, must also contend with financial problems and neighborhood opposition to expanded AIDS services.
The division is frantically trying to make up for the loss of almost $1 million in state and private grants, in order to keep open the clinics, which served 1,200 patients last year.
"You can't do research without giving service to patients," said the division director, Dr. Arye Rubinstein.
 
Difficult to Recruit
 Those who treat AIDS patients say that despite strides made in treatment, their work still boils down to -- as one doctor put it -- "managing death."
"The patient that I treat in 1991 has a better life and lives longer than the kids I treated in 1981," said Dr. Marc Sicklick, an immunologist and AIDS researcher who treats children at Albert Einstein's AIDS clinic. "But we always have to make a decision about when it is not worth it to prolong misery."
Health workers in AIDS medical units say recruiting new staff is difficult, partly because AIDS workers are often ostracized by colleagues.
"There's absolutely no prestige associated with this job," said Cecilia Douglas, a nurse clinician on the Albert Einstein team. "People ask you what you do and you tell them and they think you're so weird."
 
Dedicated Workers
 But for all the emotional hardship that comes with the job, those who take up the fight against AIDS are moved by a commitment that gives them endurance. Suzanne C. Ouellette Kobasa, a professor of psychology at the City University of New York who studied 600 new volunteers at the Gay Men's Health Crisis from 1988 to 1990, found that they viewed AIDS work as highly rewarding. She also found that although the first volunteers had usually experienced AIDS through the death of a friend or lover, many new recruits, often women, had no such connection and simply want to help.
"The changing nature of the volunteer group is important and offers good news," she said. "Many of them are coming without a lot of AIDS stresses already in their lives."
Hal J. Moskowitz, a 37-year-old medical equipment specialist, joined G.M.H.C.'s volunteer corps in 1983. Since then he has done it all, from changing soiled bedsheets to talking on the telephone with AIDS patients for hours at a time. He is still going strong.
"This disease is preventable," he said. "If I educate somebody and prevent them from getting infected, I've done something."
Magda Martas, 27, who joined Albert Einstein's AIDS unit last July as an outreach worker, conceded that she was depressed over the recent death of a client, a 25-year-old woman with three children. "Every time this happens I will cry and be devastated," she said. "But there's always another person to help."
More than 161,000 Americans have been diagnosed with AIDS, and Federal health officials estimate that a million Americans are infected with the AIDS virus. Those afflicted with the disease still make up a major portion of the anti-AIDS work force.
"Some people need tranquillity when they're ill," said Larry Gutenberg, who serves on the board of the People With AIDS Coalition and who was diagnosed with AIDS in 1989. "I find that controlled anger is the elixir that prolongs one's life."
And many of those who have decided to quit AIDS work as a vocation, like Mr. Barnes and Ms. St. Cyr, still do volunteer work.
"I've learned a lot from the courage of those who have died," Ms. St. Cyr, 40, said. "It's not an ending struggle for me."
One night last month, 35 men and women -- the newest batch of volunteers -- gathered in a room at the Gay Men's Health Crisis headquarters in Chelsea for an orientation session. The group, which included waiters, computer specialists and grieving friends of some who had died, listened thoughtfully as Mr. Moskowitz shared his experiences with AIDS and encouraged them to lend a hand.
"This is something you shouldn't fear, but something you should get into with a lot of determination and hope," he said. "I can guarantee you, at the end of it, you won't recognize yourself."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Efforts Set Back by Cut In Bond Rating

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating on New York City bonds one notch yesterday, a blow to efforts by Mayor David N. Dinkins to show that his administration was mastering the city's finances.
The decision, which could eventually lead to higher interest rates for the city, was based on doubts about Mr. Dinkins's ability to carry out a plan he released last month to cut a $3 billion budget gap over the next 18 months with sharp reductions in services and higher taxes. 
 The Mayor said he was disappointed by the rating cut but pledged to continue his administration's efforts to improve the city's finances.
 
Fiscal Maneuvers
 The rating cut comes a week after the city completed an agreement to postpone thousands of layoffs of teachers this school year by deferring a portion of the wage increase won by 85,000 school employees. The move was cited by the ratings service as a "one shot" mechanism that does not address the underlying budget problems faced by the city.
Moody's, which has seven categories of municipal investment-grade ratings, lowered its rating on more than $15 billion in outstanding New York City general-obligation bonds from A to Baa1, one notch above its lowest investment rating of Baa. It is the lowest city bond rating since December 1985.
The ratings service warned that it would drop the city's rating even further if it continued to rely on fiscal maneuvers. City officials said they were particularly dismayed by the Moody's decision because it was announced one week after another rating agency, Standard & Poor's, reaffirmed a higher rating of A-, and praised the city for "meeting the challenges in the fiscal-balance question in a fairly reasonable fashion."
In lowering the rating, Moody's said Mr. Dinkins had made a "credible attempt" in January to deal with the budget problems. But it questioned whether the city would be able "to negotiate the political and managerial avenues needed to make the plan work."
"With a backdrop of worsening economic performance," the agency said in a statement distributed yesterday, "the likelihood that the city will have to move well beyond current plans to close continuous and increasingly large budget gaps raises additional uncertainty."
The rating puts the city's creditworthiness below that of Chicago, Los Angeles and some other large cities, on a par with Cleveland's and one notch above the ratings for New Orleans, Detroit and Massachusetts. New York State bonds are rated A by Moody's.
 
'All That We Can Do'
 Appearing angry and dismayed, Mayor Dinkins told a hastily called news conference at City Hall that he was satisfied that his administration "had done all that we can do."
"Sometimes, the umpire calls a high inside pitch a strike," Mr. Dinkins said before leaving for Albany to lobby for more state aid for the city.
But he pledged to be "resolute in our commitment to meet these challenges" and said that "we will continue to present spending plans that are socially responsible and fiscally prudent."
Standard & Poor's had raised many of the same concerns cited by Moody's yesterday, but it stopped short of downgrading the city's rating, highlighting the subjective elements in rating a city's creditworthiness.
"It is like going to the Supreme Court -- sometimes judges disagree in very close votes," said Hyman C. Grossman, a managing director at Standard & Poor's. "I hope the city justifies the rating."
But in a report issued yesterday, Standard & Poor's presented a bleak portrait of the city's problems while being buffeted by a deep recession. Like Moody's, it warned that the city's rating would fall if the city resorted to quick budget fixes. Its one-word outlook was "negative."
 
'Under a Cloud'
 Mr. Grossman said that while Standard & Poor's believed that the city would eventually rebound from the recession, perhaps by early 1992, the city would "remain under a cloud until it does so."
The lowered rating by Moody's could increase the city's interest costs in a $950 million bond sale scheduled for tomorrow, perhaps by as much as $150,000 a year for each $100 million in outstanding bonds, some traders predicted.
But late yesterday, city officials said preliminary efforts to set a price for the bonds showed that the downgrading did not appear to have much of an impact, mainly because New York City bonds have been already trading as if they had been downgraded, with the city paying higher interest costs.
"We have been trading as if this were our rating for some time now," said Sally Hernandez-Pinero, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. "The market has made its decision to some degree independent of the ratings."
While Moody's and Standard & Poor's use different rating systems and refuse to compare them, bond traders and analysts agreed that the Moody's rating represented a considerably lower credit assessment than the one assigned by Standard & Poor's.
 
A 'Significant Notch'
 Daniel M. Heimowitz, an executive vice president at Moody's, said the Baa1 rating was a "significant notch" below the Moody's A rating and a little better than Baa, its lowest investment grade rating.
New York City is the largest single borrower in the municipal credit market. As it continues with a plan to sell more than $4 billion in bonds a year, some traders say it will likely have to face higher and higher interest costs to attract borrowers, and the doubts raised by yesterday's downgrading may come back to haunt the city in future bond sales.
Yesterday, long-term city bonds sold at about 8.35 percent, a slight decline from the 8.5 percent the city paid when it last sold bonds in December. But since December, interest rates in the municipal bond markets had fallen even further.
In the December sale, investors in 15-year New York City bonds received about 1.45 percentage points more than investors in other bonds rated A by Moody's, according to a market survey by the Delphis Hanover Corporation. Bondholders received 1.20 percentage points more than on bonds with the lowest investment rating, Baa.
 
Theoretical Possibility
 Last week, Mr. Dinkins set off a storm of controversy when heraised the theoretical possiblity of the city borrowing to pay its bills and balancing its budget over several years to avoid disastrous service cuts.
But Mr. Heimowitz of Moody's said Mr. Dinkins's remarks played no role in yesterday's rating decision. The agency, he said, had come to a tentative decision some time ago and acted after giving Mr. Dinkins a chance to appeal.
And it warned that if the city resorted to bond restructuring or other "one shots," the rating could go down further.
City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman complained that the decison by Moody's had failed to take into account the city's "track record." But she pledged to avoid one shots in closing the city's future budget gaps.
"The city has closed budget gaps before without such measures," she said. "We will do so again, if we take prudent action now."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: ISRAEL;
ISRAELI TELLS BUSH OF MISSILE DAMAGE

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Israel's Defense Minister, Moshe Arens, in a hastily arranged one-day visit to Washington, told President Bush today that Israel was suffering heavy "destruction" from Iraqi missile attacks and that its willingness to refrain from retaliating was wearing thin, Administration officials said.
While Israeli leaders have consistently said since the missile attacks began that they are reserving the right to retaliate, until now they have refrained from doing so at Washington's behest. It is not clear what the Israelis could do to Iraq that the much larger American-led coalition air forces have not done. 
 Administration officials said Mr. Arens's visit to the White House seemed intended both to prepare Washington for any possible Israeli retaliation and to try to impress Mr. Bush with the sacrifices Israel has made in not retaliating so the Bush Administration might deal more favorably with Israel's financial needs.
In a 30-minute meeting with the President in the Oval Office, Mr. Arens reportedly detailed the effect of Iraq's missile attacks on Israel, telling reporters later, "We see sights of destruction in Israel that have not been seen in a Western country since World War II."
An Administration official said the Israeli official seemed to be "laying the groundwork, if the Israelis decide to retaliate" and "softening us up" for an new Israeli aid request -- something that some Americans in the meeting resented, Administration officials said. While officials did not say so explicitly, they left the impression that the Arens-Bush meeting did not enhance Israeli-American relations.
The Administration official said that in the talks with Mr. Bush, Mr. Arens "didn't say absolutely that the Israelis were going to retaliate."
"But he didn't say they were not, either," the official said. "He made a very emotional presentation, though. He told the President the Israelis are really taking a lot of hits and this can only go on so long."
Asked how the President responded to Mr. Arens's presentation, an Administration official said Mr. Bush reiterated his longstanding position that the United States appreciated Israel's restraint. The President also reportedly stressed how important this restraint was for the anti-Iraq coalition and expressed the hope that Israel would continue its policy.
An Administration official said he got the feeling that Mr. Arens was sent to emphasize to Mr. Bush how big a sacrifice it is for Israel to continue not responding to the Iraqi missile strikes in the hope that this will prompt the Administration to respond more favorably to Israel's increased economic aid needs. Israeli officials have estimated those needs -- for housing Soviet Jews and military spending -- at $13 billion over the next five years, in addition to the $3 billion Israel already receives annually from the United States.
 
Israeli Complaints on Aid
 Israeli officials have been complaining that despite their restraint, the Administration has refused to include additional economic aid as part of its supplemental budget request to Congress to pay for the war. While Washington has lined up economic support from Europe to help allies like Egypt and Turkey through the war, the Israelis really have only Washington to rely upon. Only by being included in the supplemental request could Israel get immediate compensation for war expenses without going through the long formal budget process, which offers little prospect for an aid increase.
Mr. Arens, while he stressed the costs to Israel of the missile strikes, said he made no aid request in his meeting with the President.
Administration officials also saw the Arens visit as an extension of domestic Israeli politics. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has come under pressure to act from some hard-line members of his right-wing coalition, particularly Ariel Sharon.
It is possible that Mr. Arens wanted to go to Washington to have his hands tied by the President so he would be able to return and say that he was prepared to order a retaliation but that the Americans pressed him not to attack Iraq. Up to now, the Israeli public has overwhelmingly supported Mr. Shamir's policy of restraint.
 
A Dramatic Note
 Mr. Arens's presentation was enhanced by the fact that while he was meeting with Mr. Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other top Middle East experts, he was handed a note that another Iraqi Scud missile had landed in central Israel.
After his talks with the President, Mr. Arens went to the Pentagon to meet again with Mr. Cheney and to the State Department to see Mr. Baker. The Defense Department spokesman, Pete Williams, made clear that the Pentagon was also hoping that Israel would continue to show restraint.
Mr. Williams, asked about the purpose of Mr. Arens's visit, said: "The consultations have focused on how to meet Israel's security needs and enable Israel to continue to pursue its commendable policy of restraint in staying out of the conflict in the Persian Gulf. One of Saddam Hussein's apparent goals has been to try to suck Israel into the conflict, and working together, we've frustrated those aims, and we hope that will continue to be the case."
Military analysts say it is not at all certain that the Israelis could be any more effective than the American-led coalition forces in knocking out the Iraqi missile launchers.
For the Israelis to use their air force over Iraq, while the American-led coalition is operating there, they would need the electronic identification codes of American aircraft. These codes, which enable pilots to identify whether another plane is a friend or foe, are changed every day. Without them, Israeli planes would risk either being shot down by American planes or shooting down American planes. Up to now, the Pentagon has withheld these codes, and Mr. Arens may have been seeking them.
 
2 Scuds Fired at Israel
 TEL AVIV, Tuesday, Feb. 12 (Special to The New York Times) -- Iraq carried out two missile attacks against Israel overnight, and in each case Patriot missiles engaged a single Scud carrying a conventional warhead over the Tel Aviv area.
Debris from the first attack, early Monday evening, fell harmlessly in an unpopulated area near Tel Aviv, causing no injuries or property damage.
But the second Scud was hit by the Patriot over a populated area early this morning, and flaming missile parts slammed into the city. At least seven people were lightly injured. The Army reported extensive damage to houses and businesses. Rescue workers, firemen and ambulance crews rushed to the scene and set up barricades to keep curious neighbors away from the damaged area.
At the site of impact, it appeared that the missile's warhead was largely intact when it fell to the ground adjacent to a single-family home, totally destroying it.
The front walls of the home next door were blown away and a car was flipped over on its roof in the driveway.
Early this morning, rescue teams using tracker dogs crawled through the rubble searching for people trapped under collapsed walls. Apparently no additional victims were found.
"One missile with a conventional warhead struck a residential area," Brig. Gen. Nachman Shai, the army spokesman, said this morning.
"There are a few people injured, mostly lightly, with perhaps one or two with medium injuries," he added. "There is also significant property damage."
There was no indication anyone was killed in the attack.
In the emergency room at Tel HaShomer Hospital here, Dr. Boris Goldman said "we admitted six people with light injuries -- light lacerations, one person rescued from rubble, one who broke his leg running to a bunker, and one woman in severe shock."
The light injuries were typical of those sustained by hundreds of Israelis in three weeks of Scud missile attacks by Iraq. Most people have been hurt by shrapnel, flying glass, falling furniture or shock. One man was killed when his house collapsed during an early Scud attack, and three elderly Israelis died of heart failure during another assault.
The Scuds fired overnight were the 12th and 13th attacks against Israel since the Persian Gulf war began.

HEADLINE: Take Our Poor, Angry Hartford Tells Suburbs

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Raymond Eugene Shipman says Hartford cannot afford to play nice anymore. Since arriving last fall to become City Manager, he has bluntly, repeatedly described what he sees as the main source of this troubled capital city's problems: its isolation as an urban core, kept impoverished by state tax policies and suburban attitudes.
His prescriptions are just as blunt. 
 With welfare rolls growing along with the recession, and tax collections either flat or falling, he says Hartford must "divest" itself of some of its poor by razing its oldest and largest housing projects. New housing for the projects' more than 1,000 families should be scattered among the towns surrounding Hartford, he says.
 
Wage Tax on Nonresidents
 And if Connecticut has no income tax to transfer wealth from rich communities to poor ones, he says Hartford should levy its own wage tax, but only on nonresidents, the thousands of commuters who flock to downtown office towers by day but flee back to their suburbs at night.
City officials and citizens groups say it is unclear whether Mr. Shipman galvanized Hartford's City Council or whether he is the instrument of a more assertive governing body. But the Council has taken an aggressive stand on other fronts. Two lawsuits are being planned seeking to overturn state tax and housing laws that officials say restrict the city's revenue and unfairly add to its poor population. The city may also join in a suit to overturn the state's education system.
 
Contrasts Are Harsh
 Hartford's problems with poverty and finances are shared by many other aging cities. But here, where an uneasy balance exists in the best of times between well-off suburbs, the banking and insurance companies downtown and the city's desperately poor neighborhoods, the contrasts have become particularly harsh.
It doesn't matter that many of the proposals -- especially those requiring legislative approval, like the commuter tax -- were considered doomed from the outset. Many people believe that by simply raising the questions, Mr. Shipman has set the tone of the debate on what Hartford will become.
Mr. Shipman's views reflect those of a majority on the City Council, his employer. But in giving voice to the harsh proposals, he has become a target of critics.
Advocates for the poor accuse him of looking for a scapegoat for Hartford's budget problems. The city faces an estimated shortfall of $50 million in next year's $440 million budget.
Business leaders say the plan to tax commuters would drive even more employers from downtown, which has been battered over the last year by store closings, bankruptcies and the loss of two hotels. Even the city's delegation to the General Assembly refused to endorse the tax.
"For the City Manager to make statements like that is outrageous," said Sandra E. Little, a City Council member and early supporter of Mr. Shipman who is now offended by his talk of "divesting" the city of its poor. "What does he think the surrounding towns are going to do?"
State Representative Robert Farr, a Republican from neighboring West Hartford, said of the wage tax, "It would be a suicidal policy on the part of the City of Hartford."
 
Fears for Hartford's Survival
 Mr. Shipman, a 49-year-old chain smoker who was an assistant city manager in Kansas City from 1981 until last year, had never lived in Connecticut until he arrived in September to take the $100,000-a-year city manager's job.
He soon began arguing that Hartford's long-term survival was threatened by the growing number of poor people and the state's refusal to allow cities to impose any taxes other than property taxes. Mr. Shipman argues that city residents simply cannot pay more taxes, but that suburban commuters can.
Unlike many newer cities, especially in the Southwest, that could take in new taxpayers through annexation, Hartford has been hemmed in by independent towns with no interest in being absorbed, especially now.
Hartford's population is 140,000, compared with 158,000 20 years ago. It was named the nation's fourth poorest city among those with populations over 100,000 in the 1980 census, with 25.2 percent of its population then below the Federal poverty line. Local officials say little has changed.
Of the 32,798 people receiving welfare benefits in December in the nine towns west of the Connecticut River covered by the Hartford office of the State Department of Income Maintenance, 31,010, or 94.5 percent, lived in Hartford, making up more than 22 percent of Hartford's population. The 1,788 living in the eight other towns made up less than 1 percent of their population of 190,356, according to the state.
 
Clusters of Public Housing
 About 16 percent of Hartford County's population lives in the city. But of the 3,436 public housing units in Hartford County, 70 percent are in Hartford. Most are clustered in the largely black and Puerto Rican neighborhoods of the North End, including the three projects Mr. Shipman wants to raze: Stowe Village, Nelton Court and Bellevue Square.
"It's no small secret that we'd be in the same dire straits as Bridgeport if we kept going at the pace we're going, being all things to all people," Mr. Shipman said, referring to the state's largest city, which has been in a financial crisis for months.
Hartford's Deputy Mayor, I. Charles Mathews, who is the City Council's chairman, says that a firm majority is behind Mr. Shipman and that the manager's ideas reflect the Council's.
Under Hartford's City Charter, the Council acts as the highest authority for both passing laws and formulating policy, while the city manager acts as chief operating officer.
 
Weicker Warns of Aid Cuts
 "There needs to be a new Hartford," Mr. Mathews said. "We can't continue to absorb all the poor of the region. We can't survive as a city."
Behind City Hall's anger are economic issues that could determine Hartford's fate for years. Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has said that $850 million to $900 million must be cut from the state's next budget, and that aid to most towns and cities will probably be cut or frozen.
A billion dollars or more in new taxes will also be needed, Mr. Weicker said. Mr. Shipman said that while this year's city budget had a revenue shortfall of only $2 million to $4 million, Mr. Weicker's budget, which is to be released on Wednesday, could force the city to order layoffs and spending cuts that could harm the entire region.
Among some local groups, though, Mr. Shipman's ideas provoke fear.
 
Poor Residents Fear Trick
 "There's a lot of apprehension," said Dulcie Giadone, the president of Hartford Areas Rally Together, an umbrella organization of community groups across the city. Ms. Giadone said that her group had invited Mr. Shipman to meet with local leaders at least three times, and that her "skepticism" grew each time his busy schedule required him to send substitutes.
At Bellevue Square, a graffiti-splattered low-rise housing project north of downtown, some residents said they thought the talk of moving people to better housing elsewhere was a ruse to clear the way for new office towers.
"Most of the people want to be here," said Andre Ocasio, 16, who has lived in the project for four years. "They were born and raised here."
Many people say the Council's new tone is also important. Last month, the Council voted to ask city lawyers to prepare a suit challenging the state's entire property-tax system. The resolution said the laws unfairly penalize cities like Hartford by exempting from taxes so much property that is naturally clustered in cities. Hospitals and state office buildings, for example, pay no local property taxes.
The Council has also discussed a suit to force housing officials to consult the city before using state money to move poor people into Hartford's state-owned housing. They say the state should provide money for increased city services that poor residents need.
The Council has also tentatively approved joining a school desegregation suit against the state. That suit, filed in 1989 on behalf of some Hartford public school children, argues that racial isolation in the city and suburban schools violates the state constitution.
Mr. Shipman says simply that the state should take over authority for all public education, which has always been handled on the local level.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Clash Spurred Queens To End Boycott

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
When community leaders in Elmhurst, Queens, heard last week that an employee of a Korean-owned supermarket there had been charged with assaulting an 11-year-old black boy, and that anger was growing among black residents, they knew what they did not want to happen.
They swung into action, driven by a fear that their racially and ethnically diverse community could become embroiled in the kind of corrosive clash that raged last year in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, where black boycotters declared economic war against a Korean-owned grocery after a black customer said an employee had assaulted her. 
 "We don't want this to be a Brooklyn-type situation," Ruby Muhammad, one of the Elmhurst civic leaders, said yesterday.
 
Limiting the Damage
 On Friday, three days after the incident, leaders of local groups met at a fast-food restaurant with the store's owner and representatives of the Dinkins administration and the Police Department. The alleged assault took place, the police said, after a store employee accused the boy of shoplifting. The talk on Friday was about what had happened and how the participants could limit damage to the social fabric in its aftermath, Ms. Muhammad said.
Yesterday afternoon, after several days in which protesters picketed the supermarket and urged neighborhood residents to boycott it, the street outside the store -- an independently owned outlet of the C-Town chain, at 57th Avenue and 98th Street -- was devoid of demonstrators. Inside, shoppers, many of them black, wheeled carts down the aisles, fingered fruits for ripeness and plucked packaged products from shelves.
The emphasis on all sides was to calm rather than inflame. And above all, the goal, some local leaders said, was to keep people who did not live in the community from entering the dispute and keeping it alive.
"We wash our own linen here," said James E. Brown, a 73-year-old retired postal inspector. "We don't need outsiders to come in." Mr. Brown is acting vice president of the tenants association at Lefrak City, a huge high-rise apartment complex across the street from the supermarket. It provides many of the store's customers.
Ms. Muhammad, who is a director of the tenants association and who, like Mr. Brown, is black, predicted that "this will be different" from the battle at the Flatbush grocery, which came to symbolize tensions between blacks and Korean operators of stores in black neighborhoods.
 
Demand for Prosecution
 In contrast to the goals of many of the Flatbush pickets, she said, most of those demonstrating at the Elmhurst C-Town were not pressing "to close it down."
The lawyer for Bobby Yates, the Lefrak City boy who was said to have been assaulted, also said last night, "We don't want to see him closed down and destroyed." But the lawyer, Stephen G. James, said the Yates family wanted swift and effective prosecution of the store employee, Yong Cha Kim, who was arrested and charged with hitting the boy.
Mr. James said the Yates family also believed that more blacks should be employed at the C-Town and at other stores in the neighborhood, in which most of residents are black, Hispanic or Asian people who hold blue-collar and white-collar jobs.
Most of those calling for a boycott are black, as are many of those working to defuse the protest.
Mr. Kim, a 53-year-old man who speaks little English, could not be reached yesterday for comment, but Francis An, the store's owner, said Mr. Kim denied having hit the boy in the incident last Tuesday.
Nonetheless, Mr. An said yesterday that he had let Mr. Kim go because, "whether he was right or wrong, he raised this problem in the community" and that it was "not right for the neighborhood to keep him here."
The police said Mr. Kim cuffed the boy on the ear, accused him of shoplifting and took him to a back room, where he kept him for almost a half-hour, until his mother, Cynthia, was located.
Ms. Yates is a member of the congregation of the House of the Lord Pentecostal Church in Brooklyn, whose minister, the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, a black community advocate, led one group of demonstrators in front of the supermarket on Saturday.
Mr. Daughtry said yesterday that he had informed the local leaders in Elmhurst that he wanted "to move in concert with the community leaders." Noting that he had taken part in last Friday's meeting, Mr. Daughtry said, "I don't have any interest in making more of it than it is but I do have an interest in seeing justice prevail."
Besides the Lefrak tenants association, the talks included members of Concerned Community Adults, a local civic group that works with youths; a representative of Community Board 4, which covers the area; the local Assemblywoman, Helen M. Marshall, and representatives of the Mayor's Community Assistance Unit, the City Commission on Human Rights and the 110th Police Precinct.
A spokesman for Mayor David N. Dinkins, Ruby Ryles, said the Community Assistance Unit had also become swiftly involved in the Flatbush dispute. But that dispute escalated and lingered, and critics said the Mayor had not brought it quickly to an end. A store employee charged with slapping a black customer in that incident was acquitted earlier this month.

HEADLINE: Earning the Right to Borrow

 BODY:
Deficit financing -- jargon for going into debt -- is getting attention right now because the financier Felix Rohatyn has suggested that borrowing might save New York City from fiscal disaster. Mayor David Dinkins hasn't ruled out the idea. But it's a dangerous one.
Mr. Rohatyn warns that a worsening economy could lead to such a large budget deficit that the city would have to seek paralyzing budget cuts and intolerable tax increases to balance its budget. To lessen the pain, Mr. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, suggests that the city avoid disruptive cuts by using money borrowed through bonds issued by M.A.C. The bonds would be paid off in the future, presumably after the economy had improved. 
 The idea sounds enticing. Which is precisely why it is to be avoided if possible. Borrowing is the ultimate temptation for politicians. It lets them duck, lets them avoid the difficult choices that should be the essence of responsible government.
That is especially true in New York. The state has spent beyond its means for years and now, damaged by the economy, is passing the burden on to its cities and towns through deep cuts in state aid. And though New York City balances its budget, it has yet to provide a trenchant proposal for addressing its growing fiscal problems. The Mayor's preliminary budget for the coming fiscal year, though balanced, relies mostly on taxes, not reforms. That budget now appears so fragile that Moody's downgraded the city's credit rating yesterday.
The recession demands fundamental, structural change in the way the city and state deliver every service, from medical care to education. Mr. Rohatyn says he would only make M.A.C. money available if the city agreed to a tough retrenchment plan involving the state, M.A.C. and the Financial Control Board. But where is the plan? And how would it be enforced? That's not yet clear. Besides, it's up to the Mayor, not Mr. Rohatyn, to enlist the Governor's support and push for state and city reforms.
New York City borrowed and spent its way to the door of bankruptcy in 1975, when state law forced the city to balance its budget every year. Under the Rohatyn plan, M.A.C. would be doing the borrowing. But by relying on borrowed money, the city would still be spending beyond its means.
That would let both the Mayor and Gov. Mario Cuomo off the hook. The city wouldn't have to reduce its workforce or function more efficiently. The Governor wouldn't have to find equitable solutions to the state's huge budget gap because, with M.A.C. money available to soften the blow, he could continue to make severe reductions in state aid to the city.
Although it may seem seductive to make things easier in the bad times and repay debt in the good times, there's sorry evidence that the payback never happens. If the city must turn again to borrowed money, it has to earn that right first, by showing it's prepared to make fundamental changes to cope with mounting deficits.

HEADLINE: Pause for Peace

BYLINE: By Paul D. Wellstone; Paul D. Wellstone, a Democrat, is Senator from Minnesota.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Before America hurries into an incalculably costly ground war, the Bush Administration should order a temporary halt in allied bombing that would give third parties such as Jordan and Iran a chance to mediate an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. No one can guarantee that Saddam Hussein would accept a peace proposal. But given the fearsome consequences of continued fighting, we must make the effort.
America sits transfixed by images of war and recoils at the consequences of Saddam Hussein's brutality. Yet, along with anger and revulsion at his disregard for human values, each day we feel more sharply the costs of warfare and wonder where Desert Storm will lead us, the region and the world. 
 By looking at how quickly the number of Americans killed in action doubled with just the first minor ground skirmish, at Khafji, the nation has begun to recognize the severe human cost of attacking well-entrenched Iraqi forces. The White House chief of staff, John Sununu, has acknowledged that Desert Storm will cost at least $50 billion in 1991.
But have Americans focused squarely on the geopolitical implications of a major ground war? Have we asked whether we are prepared to have such a war be the first -- and effectively the only -- priority in American domestic and foreign policy for the immediate future? Can we afford to ignore Soviet actions in the Baltic states? At what cost do we look the other way as Syria tightens its grip on Lebanon? And are we asking whether a victory over Mr. Hussein might prove Pyrrhic?
Grant that after a protracted land battle and thousands of allied and Iraqi casualties we drive him from Kuwait, what value will the victory hold if we have permanently embittered a generation in the Arab world? What good will victory be if we destabilize regimes in Egypt, Jordan and the North African states? How will victory over Iraq contribute to solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?
Since the war's start, serious unrest has been growing throughout the Muslim world, from North Africa to Pakistan. Despite the Scud terror attacks Israel has stayed out of the fighting, but has taken increasingly stern measures against Palestinians in the West Bank.
The Administration adamantly opposes negotiations now. Rejecting Iranian talk of mediation, the President and State Department have said no negotiations until Iraq withdraws from Kuwait. But a strong majority of Americans thinks otherwise.
According to an early February poll, conducted by ICR Survey Research for the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, six in 10 Americans want to start diplomatic efforts before allied forces commit to a ground war. Shouldn't we listen?
The conventional wisdom is that it is too late to debate. The U.S. is committed; a ground war is inevitable. I do not accept that view.
First, there is no reason to become embroiled in a ground war. Iraq is surrounded, isolated and growing weaker economically and militarily. The international sanctions are strangling its economy. Our bombing has demolished Iraq's nuclear weapons program and its chemical and biological weapons-making facilities.
We have greatly diminished Iraq's ability to threaten its neighbors; continued sanctions would insure that that remains the case. By placing Patriot missiles in Israel, we have dramatized Israel's security concerns while holding together the coalition and preventing wider war.
Second, we must keep our war aims limited and make clear our postwar intentions. Recent Administration rhetoric gives the impression that our goals have escalated well beyond those of the U.N. resolutions and now include overthrow of the Iraqi Government, and, possibly, occupation of Iraq.
Third, and most important, we should announce a pause in the bombing and tell Saddam Hussein that now is the time to talk. Such a pause would be conditional, and would allow immediate allied retaliation against any Iraqi attack, forbid resupply of troops in Kuwait and, of course, keep effective economic sanctions in place.
In short, a pause would give us a chance to explore a regional solution short of total war. We could then encourage third parties who already have indicated an interest, such as Jordan and Iran, to mediate an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
In politics, all too often perception is reality. Many in the Arab and Moslem world view the Administration's "new world order" as the unwelcome imposition of a Pax Americana on problems that are the Arab world's. Before we commit ourselves to a costly ground war on Mr. Saddam's terms against Muslims, President Bush and the nation should stand back and ask if there is not a more promising way to establish enduring peace in the Middle East.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Moscow and Baghdad

BYLINE: A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
The war in the Persian Gulf is still to be won, but the struggle for the shape and meaning of the peace already has been joined.
Mikhail Gorbachev signaled that clearly from Moscow. We should be grateful to him. Maybe he will wake us up. 
 Mr. Gorbachev knows what Americans sometimes forget. The way a war is fought and its objectives, official or unspoken, decide what the peace will be like, how long it will last and whether the victor in war will also be the victor in peace.
 Without contributing a soldier, the Soviet President is trying to determine both the conduct of the combat and its objectives. It should not come as a total surprise that the benefactors of his vision would be Moscow and the Soviet Union's longtime ally and best Scud customer, Saddam Hussein himself.
 A political rescue of Saddam Hussein would bring Moscow back into the Middle East at absolutely no cost and at a time when Soviet influence in the rest of the world is just a nasty memory.
So Mr. Gorbachev sends a warning to the United States that the damage being done to Iraq by the coalition's aerial pounding "threatens" to go beyond the United Nations mandate to free Kuwait.
Summed up, the Nobel Peace Laureate is telling the U.S. to try to oust Saddam Hussein from Kuwait without fully using air and sea bombardment in advance to destroy every reachable bit of Iraqi armor, communications, chemical weapons storage, transportation, electric power -- just go ahead and try.
Now, the Man of the Decade must know that even the U.S. will not be stupid enough to cause needless American deaths by suddenly ending the military pounding of Iraq. For military purposes there is no distinction between the battleground in Kuwait and the military and economic targets in Iraq from which Iraqi troops draw sustenance.
Still, he knows that his warning will be seized upon by United Nations members who want to save Saddam Hussein and may increase the pressure on President Bush to go to ground combat earlier than he might otherwise.
Mr. Gorbachev also sends other signals: He will lead a fight against Mr. Bush if Washington tries to achieve an objective not specifically mentioned by the U.N. but without which the war would be brutally cynical and the peace brief -- the elimination of Saddam Hussein. Mr. Gorbachev would leave Saddam Hussein still ruling, to rally and lead anti-Western hatred in the Muslim world.
I do not think Mr. Gorbachev can bring this off. How could an American President possibly tell his soldiers that he allowed the murderer who caused the war and killed their comrades to keep on ruling in Baghdad?
Happily, Mr. Bush is also sending signals. By musing often enough and loud enough about how Saddam Hussein would not be missed one bit, Mr. Bush may get the message across to Iraqis that if they want to sit at the table after the war they should get rid of the killer before the seats are allotted.
 Secretary of State James Baker is not helping his reputation by trying to mollify the fading Mr. Gorbachev, a strange obsession that does not grip many Soviet citizens. But in the State Department and the White House, work is taking place on a Mideast future deprived of Saddam Hussein.
Planning includes agreements to stop the maniacal Middle Eastern arms race and to help the Mideast economically. The two go together. The U.S. should not assume the burden -- that is an economic fantasy. Think of the hundreds of billions Saudi Arabia and Kuwait can contribute from the money they will save just by not paying to arm Iraq -- as they did before the Kuwait invasion. Iraq itself will be plump with oil money once rid of Saddam Hussein and his lust for weapons.
David Levy, Israel's Foreign Minister, will be in Washington this week carrying proposals for arms limitation and economic cooperation. First, the Arab states would have to agree to end the state of war with Israel to which they have clung like a foul security blanket for a half century.
Simultaneously the Israelis would negotiate with Palestinians for West Bank elections, possibly with a definite time depending on when the war ends. No new Palestinian state is in the Israeli plan. Scuds have not increased Israeli appetite for suicide.
So the end of Saddam Hussein will not itself solve the problems of the Middle East. That will take years. But it is the only logical place to begin -- and also a delightful thought.

 
Russell Baker is on vacation.

Get Over That Terrorism Trauma

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am writing this on Pan Am Flight 107 returning to Washington after a weeklong visit to clients of my law firm in Britain. At each stop of my visit, remarks were inevitably made to the effect of, "Well, now, do we have to give you a medal for coming to see us?" or "Got your gas mask in your suitcase, have you?"
These remarks -- made without malice -- I believe illustrate how many people in Britain perceive how Americans are responding to the threat of terrorism created by the Persian Gulf war, based on what the British hear and read about us in the news. Many in Britain simply cannot understand how citizens of a country that is sending hundreds of thousands of its citizens to the gulf to fight a war are at the same time exhausting supplies of gas masks in Los Angeles and New York, and are refusing to fly -- for business or personal reasons -- from Denver to San Francisco, let alone New York to London.
No sensible Western European -- especially the British, who have endured the Pan Am explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland, and Irish Republican Army attacks -- would rule out terrorist attacks in Western Europe as a result of the gulf crisis. Yet the attitude in Britain at present seems to be that daily life must go on as normally as possible.
Experience has taught Western Europeans that terrorism is chronic, subject to ebbs and flows, and they and their governments have learned to take sensible precautions when threat levels are high. In Britain, this includes tanks reportedly surrounding Heathrow Airport, armed militia patrolling airline terminals and exceptionally tight screening of passengers and their luggage.
Against this backdrop, to others we look like a country hunkered down in front of its television sets, as if what is taking place were some sort of superpower version of a Giants-Redskins game. Concern about getting on with daily business activity -- including dealing with a slowing economy -- seems to have slipped to a distant second place.
I would be the last to suggest Americans put themselves in danger by engaging in frivolous overseas travel in Western Europe in this difficult time. Moreover, as the terrorist threat level constantly changes, what may be an acceptable risk today may be unacceptable tomorrow. We must all be alert to this and change our travel plans accordingly.
Nevertheless, the longer the gulf crisis continues, the more important it becomes that we wean ourselves from our CNN diet and stop refraining from normal business and personal activities because of terrorist fears. Otherwise, if we do not do so and such inactivity causes our economy to slow down even further, Americans must seriously consider
the extent to which Saddam Hussein can claim that he is winning this war.
What might be the long-term economic consequences if we fail to put the terrorist threat into context? A friend who just returned from Paris reports that, while the city was empty of Americans, it was full of Japanese businessmen.

HEADLINE: Quality Education

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a graduate of Stuyvesant High School in New York City, I was proud to see how well its students did in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search this year (news article, Jan. 25). I had a wonderful learning experience there and recognize the tremendous value of New York City's specialized public high schools, where students regardless of race, creed or economic circumstances can obtain a tuition-free, high-quality education in science, mathematics, liberal arts and the arts in an atmosphere where scholarship is encouraged by a quality, dedicated faculty.
I am concerned that these fine institutions and other opportunities nationally for high-ability students (such as honors and advanced-placement courses) may be threatened because of a trend in public education toward the heterogeneous grouping of students at the primary and secondary levels, regardless of special needs or abilities. Recent educational literature seems to take the approach that such grouping improves the socialization of students and can improve the learning of lower-ability students, while stating little about the effects, positive or negative, on higher-ability students.
New York City's specialized high schools set admission and student expectation standards high. Students are constantly challenged to extend themselves academically and are given opportunities for research and advanced study in school and in cooperative programs with the area's colleges and universities.
What will happen to gifted and talented students if the trend toward heterogeneous grouping is extended?

HEADLINE: Student at Brown Is Expelled Under a Rule Barring 'Hate Speech'

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Feb. 11

 BODY:
Brown University has expelled a student for shouting racial epithets, thereby violating an anti-harassment rule enacted in 1989 as part of an effort by the university to combat racism on campus. It is the first time a Brown student has been expelled for such a violation and is thought to be the first such expulsion in the country.
Officials at the American Council on Education, the American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations that track campus hate crimes said they knew of no other student who has been expelled for violating one of the many "hate speech" regulations instituted in recent years at universities like Brown, Stanford, Tufts and the Universities of California and Wisconsin. 
 The student, Douglas Hann, a junior, was found by the university's Undergraduate Disciplinary Council to have violated the rule by shouting anti-black, anti-Semitic and antihomosexual remarks in a courtyard last October. The council, made up of five students and five faculty or administration members, also considered that he had been drinking at the time and that it was his second violation involving racial epithets.
A Brown spokesman, Mark Nickel, said that in past years students found guilty of serious behavioral violations had been dismissed and asked not to return but that the term expulsion was not used until about two years ago. Expulsion means a student is never permitted to return, while dismissal means a student may reapply after a specified period.
 
Act of New President
 Students who committed academic violations like cheating or plagiarism have been dismissed with the understanding that they would never be readmitted.
Brown's rule, proposed by the president, Vartan Gregorian, shortly after his inauguration two years ago and put into effect in the fall of 1989, defines as unacceptable the subjecting of "another person, group or class of persons, to inappropriate, abusive, threatening or demeaning actions based on race, religion, gender, handicap, ethnicity, national origin or sexual orientation."
In addition to violating that rule, Mr. Hann was found to have violated longstanding university rules against excessive drinking and against showing "flagrant disrespect for the well-being of others."
Mr. Hann, whose routes of appeal at Brown were exhausted with a Jan. 25 statement affirming his expulsion, said he may pursue a remedy based on violation of his First Amendment rights, but he declined to be specific about what his next step would be. "I think it is, of course, a case of free speech," he said in a telephone interview from his home in Pittsburgh.
 
Challenges to Speech Codes
 Throughout the country, university officials have adopted codes forbidding oral, written or even symbolic attacks on individuals or small groups of individuals on the basis of their sex, race, ethnic origin, color, handicap, religion or sexual preference.
Such codes have come under attack, on campus and off, as infringements of free speech.
In 1989, a Federal court ordered the University of Michigan to change its harassment prohibition, deeming it unconstitutionally vague. By contrast, Stanford's code restricts itself to "fighting words" intended to "insult or stigmatize an individual or a small number of individuals" on the basis of their sex, race, color, physical disability, religion, sexual orientation or national or ethnic origin."
Mr. Hann, a varsity football player who was majoring in business economics and organizational behavior and management, was celebrating his 21st birthday last October when the incident occurred.
 
Noisy Birthday Celebration
 A witness, who spoke on the condition of not being identified, said Mr. Hann was yelling an anti-black comment involving a common obscenity and the word "nigger," in the courtyard of a dormitory. He said the remark was yelled into the air and did not appear to be directed at any individual.
A student in the dormitory then opened his window and shouted "Keep it down," the witness said. Mr. Hann then used the word "faggot" and an obscenity combined with the word "Jew," directing his shouts at the student in the window.
Mr. Hann does not deny the incident but says the allegations as presented in university hearings were inexact. He declined to specify exactly what he had said, either during the incident or during his hearings.
In the telephone interview, Mr. Hann said Mr. Gregorian "wanted someone," adding, "I think it was just a political statement by the university."
 
Details Not Released
 Both Mr. Gregorian and university spokesmen declined to comment on the situation, and the university has never publicly released Mr. Hann's name nor the names of the witnesses to the incident. At least three student publications have printed Mr. Hann's name and picture.
The only statement the university has made was the release of a one-sentence Jan. 25 memorandum from Robert Ripley, chairman of the Undergraduate Disciplinary Council, announcing that "the president has affirmed the decision" of the council "to expel a student" for violating the university's anti-harassment clause.
The case was the second charge against Mr. Hann that led to university hearings. In his first year at Brown, a committee of students and faculty members found Mr. Hann guilty of directing a racial epithet at a black student in a fraternity bar on Jan. 27, 1989. His punishment then was to attend a race relations workshop and counseling for possible alcohol abuse.
 
'Solemn Warning' Issued
 In April 1989, just 20 days after his inauguration as president, Mr. Gregorian addressed a group of students after racist graffiti and white supremacist leaflets were found in a dormitory.
"I issue a solemn warning that it is the policy of my administration to take action against those who incite hatred," Mr. Gregorian said. "It is my intention to prosecute vigorously, and to expel immediately, such individual or individuals for any attempt to inject and promote racism and thus insult the dignity of our students as citizens of Brown."
Howard Ehrlich, the research director of the National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence, based in Baltimore, said that he did not know of any other such expulsions but that he was familiar with cases in which students who had harassed others were moved to other dormitories or ordered to undergo counseling.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: NIGERIA;
Support for Iraqis Grows in Nigeria's North

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANO, Nigeria

 BODY:
The manager of the Fahad supermarket here, Malam Isyaku Bature, recently received an ominous warning from his neighbors: either change the name of the store or "something very bad could happen."
The threat followed a rumor circulating about town that the Fahad store was somehow linked with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. And because the Saudis had invited troops from the United States and its allies into the center of Islam, Mr. Bature said, any hint of a Saudi connection here could prove ruinous. The store, in fact, has no ties to the Saudis or any other Arabs. 
 Nonetheless, given the public's pro-Iraqi, anti-Saudi mood, the store's owners took the threat seriously. "Some of them urged us to change our name to Saddam," Mr. Bature said, as a demonstration of their support for the President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
In a compromise of sorts, the supermarket was recently renamed Sahad.
Such incidents are a measure how the politics of the Persian Gulf war are increasingly being played out in Nigeria, Africa's economic giant and America's fourth largest foreign supplier of oil.
From the start, Nigeria's military Government has criticized Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. As for the war between Iraq and the allies, however, Nigeria is officially neutral.
But here in the Muslim northern part of Nigeria, the sentiment is decidedly in support of the Iraqi leader. Through protest marches, official statements and harsh newspaper commentaries, much of the Nigerian north has begun to display a growing aversion to the United States.
In early February, at least 5,000 people demonstrated here and in front of a United States diplomatic post in nearby Kaduna. Apparently because of the heavy police presence, only a few minor clashes were reported.
 
Warnings on Travel
 Both Britain and the United States have advised their nationals not to travel in northern Nigeria.
"There's a great deal of unhappiness here with the Government's neutral stance," said Ibrahim Bello Kano, a lecturer in oral literature at Bayero University and a leader of the demonstrations here. "Most people, in fact, believe the Government is really backing the U.S., and that's made the Government quite unpopular."
"Most Nigerians here," he added, "are praying day and night for Saddan's success."
From the walls of mosques and bazaars throughout this ancient walled city, posters of Mr. Hussein stare out at passers-by. Not far away, students at Bayero University, Nigeria's biggest, have scrawled signs in the hallways renaming them "Saddam Avenue" and "Iraqi Boulevard." And atop a building across from the Emir's palace near the center of town, Iraqi flags fluttered in the bright Saharan sun.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Aetna Hires a Manager For Its Investment Unit

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Daniel P. Kearney, who has held top government and Wall Street posts, has been hired by the Aetna Life and Casualty Company to manage its investments.
Mr. Kearney, who is 51, has been named group executive at the insurance company based in Hartford. He takes over a position that has been vacant since June, when Philip R. Roberts left to join the Mellon Bank. 
 Mr. Kearney, who will head a staff of 900 investment professionals, will hold a key position at Aetna. The pressure is on insurance companies these days to make the most out of their investments, now that many real estate ventures have soured and threaten the financial health of some institutions. Aetna has joined other companies in retrenching, cutting jobs and withdrawing in states where business has fallen off.
In December, when Moody's Investors Service lowered its ratings on the financial health of five major insurance companies, it confirmed the financial-strength rating of Aetna , but lowered its rating on the safety of its senior debt because of concern over the company's mortgage portfolio.
"I think it's pretty sound," Mr. Kearney said of the Aetna investment portfolio. "It's a lot different from all those S.& L.'s I was dealing with."
Mr. Kearney was referring to the five months he spent as president and chief executive of the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Government operation that was established to oversee the disposition of failed savings institutions taken over in the Federal rescue of the industry.
Mr. Kearney left that post a year ago. "I was disappointed that it didn't work out," he said yesterday. When he resigned, there were reports that he had been hampered by the Treasury Department, which was said to have been "micro-managing" the situation.
At Aetna, Mr. Kearney will be investing in stocks, bonds and real estate. Asked what makes a good investment these days, on a day when the Dow Jones industrial average climbed more than 70 points, he said, "Look at the stock market; everything's got a relative value."
In a statement welcoming Mr. Kearney, James T. Lynn, Aetna's chairman, said, "Aetna's investments are the backbone of all our businesses." The company is listed as the 11th-largest United States corporation, based on assets of $89 billion.
Mr. Kearney holds bachelor's and master's degrees in economics from Michigan State University and a law degree from the University of Chicago.
Among the government positions he has held are associate director of the Office of Management and Budget and president of the Government National Mortgage Association. He went to Wall Street in 1977 and helped found the mortgage-backed securities department of Salomon Brothers Inc.
In 1988, he joined a Boston pension advisory fund and was named to the Resolution Trust post in September 1989. For the last year, he has been a consultant to various financial institutions, including Aetna.

HEADLINE: Katie Louchheim Is Dead at 87; Official for U.S. and Democrats

BYLINE: By GLENN FOWLER

 BODY:
Katie Louchheim, a former State Department official and a former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee who was a prominent figure in the social life of Washington for four decades, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.
Mrs. Louchheim, who had been in failing health for the last few years, died of pneumonia, her family said. 
 Although she never held elective office, her influence in politics was considerable, beginning in 1934 when she arrived in Washington with her husband, Walter, a Manhattan investment counselor. He had been called on to help organize the Securities and Exchange Commission in the early days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.
Mrs. Louchheim was also a poet, and the Louchheims' house in Georgetown soon became a meeting place for people in politics and the arts. A vivacious woman of enormous energy, she plunged into Democratic Party affairs and worked her way up to become vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee from 1956 to 1960.
 
Posts in United Nations
 Along the way, she held various appointed government posts. In World War II she served in the Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation and helped form its United Nations counterpart, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, for which she went to Europe in 1945 to arrange press relations at camps for displaced people.
President John F. Kennedy gave her a post in the State Department, and within two years she was named Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, at that time the highest job in the department ever held by a woman.
She moved to other State Department posts through the Administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson and was United States Ambassador to the United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization until 1969, when the Republicans took power under President Richard M. Nixon.
 
Rejected Republican Roots
 Mrs. Louchheim was born in Manhattan in 1903. Named Kathleen Scofield, she was known for most of her life as Katie. The daughter of a Manhattan stockbroker, she grew up in Republican surroundings; when she moved to Washington in Roosevelt's first term she was a prime example of what people called "a traitor to one's class."
She attended Rosemary Hall in Greenwich, Conn., and studied in Europe before marrying Mr. Louchheim in 1926.
She published a collection of poems, "With or Without Roses," in 1966. Her autobiography, "By the Political Sea," came out in 1970. She wrote "The Making of the New Deal -- The Insiders Speak," published by Harvard University Press in 1983.
After her husband died in 1973, Mrs. Louchheim moved back to Manhattan. In 1981 she married Donald S. Klopfer, a co-founder of the publishing concern Random House; he died in 1986.
She is survived by two daughters, Mary Evangelista of Manhattan and Judith Read of Darien, Conn.; three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A Japanese Symbol of Excess

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 11

 BODY:
It was bad when the banks sent their people to monitor his debt-laden operations and worse when they slammed the brakes on his hectic pace of property acquisitions. But now the bankers say the three private jets must go.
 No, this is not Donald J. Trump, Robert Campeau or some fallen savings and loan owner. Meet Harunori Takahashi, chairman and owner of the privately held EIE International Corporation, a big hotel and resort developer struggling under $6 billion in shaky debt. 
This brash and chain-smoking businessman is just one of many Japanese entrepreneurs transformed by the doubling of the yen's value after 1985 into overnight sensations. Mr. Takahashi charmed lenders and the news media alike, while assembling an empire stretching from Tahiti to 57th Street in Manhattan, where he is building the Regent Hotel designed by I. M. Pei. Although little known in Japan, Mr. Takahashi became one of Australia's biggest and most talked about property barons.
 
Administrative Weakness
 Today, the 45-year-old Mr. Takahashi's predicament symbolizes the excesses that swept corporate Japan in the overheated 1980's -- just as they swept Wall Street. As he attempts to adapt to the 1990's, the only question is how much of his grab bag of holdings -- ranging from Regent and Hyatt hotels throughout Asia, a floating hotel in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, a thousand-mile railroad being built through Australia's outback and a half-share in Australia's Bond University -- he will be able to salvage.
 "Mr. Takahashi is good at proceeding on projects very aggressively, and he has a very good eye for assets, but he is not so good at financial calculations or management," said Yoshiharu Suzuki, general manager of the corporate finance group at the the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, EIE's biggest lender, with almost $1 billion outstanding. "So we've decided to send people to supplement the area where he has a weakness, namely in administration. That's so we can have completely harmonious cooperation."
 The size of EIE's problems is also a reflection on the euphoria that prevailed at Japanese banks in the heady 1980's. Banks, after all, are supposed to weigh prudently the projects to which they will lend. Stuart Matthews, an analyst at Barclays de Zoette Wedd, observed, "We're discovering that some of the bankers here were just as adventurous as those anywhere in the world."
 During a recent interview at his headquarters in downtown Tokyo, which he is about to vacate for less expensive space, Mr. Takahashi, a whirl of energy who habitually juggles numerous deals, bridled at the suggestion he had become overextended.
 "Tightening up would be the way to describe what we're doing," he said. "We certainly have some properties that don't fit. You'll see us dispose of them. As I've said all along, there's a time for expanding and a time for cleaning house."
 
Same Problem, Different Solution
 For those who regarded Japanese businessmen as unstoppable money machines effortlessly snapping up real estate around the globe, a look at the problems of Mr. Takahashi and a half-dozen other large real estate owners provides some sobering insights. But if they share some of the problems of American developers, the solutions being proposed generally differ.
 For the most part, bankers are stepping in and overseeing the process in an orderly way, keeping the problems far from courtrooms. In EIE's case, the Long-Term Credit Bank heads a recently formed lenders' committee and has sent six executives to help manage the business.
 Some of Mr. Takahashi's aides grumbled at the imposition of cost controls. "When you get a lot of bankers around, you start worrying about things like counting paper clips," commented Bungo Ishizaki, a former professor who is a senior adviser to EIE. He also suggested that getting rid of the jets might not be such a good idea.
 "You don't project a conservative image when you're flying around in a 727, that's true," Mr. Ishizaki acknowledged. "But if you're doing a deal with the King of Tonga or something, it does make a corporate statement."
 But in return for its cooperation with the banks, EIE is likely to receive as much as $500 million to meet interest payments and finish some projects. And $1.5 billion worth of properties unrelated to the South Pacific resort business will be put on the market.
 Neither Mr. Takahashi nor Mr. Suzuki would be specific, but they hinted the list would include the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles, BP House in London, Bond Centre in Hong Kong and assorted office and hotel developments around Asia and Europe.
 
Government Actions
 As is frequently the case in Japan's tightly regulated economy, the Government has played a large role in the ascension of developers like Mr. Takahashi and in their current difficulties. For years, the Finance Ministry permitted the banks to pump up the real estate market. Then the soaring prices became a political liability as middle-class Japanese found themselves priced out of the housing market. As a result, the Bank of Japan more than doubled certain key interest rates, squeezing indebted developers. And the Finance Ministry began a campaign to force banks to reduce their lending to speculative developers in Japan or abroad.
 The Long-Term Credit Bank said it was not being forced to have EIE cut back on its holdings, but acknowledged it was informally reporting all of the measures taken to the Finance Ministry.
 Mr. Takahashi is a member of a prominent family from western Japan, near Nagasaki, and is descended from a prewar Prime Minister. He joined EIE, then an importer of computer tapes and other components in 1977 and eventually bought a majority when its former owner retired.
 The company's fortunes soared when the big industrialized nations cut the value of the dollar in half in September 1985, in an effort to reduce Japan's yawning trade surplus and America's trade deficit. The resurgent yen slashed the cost of imports, and EIE's profits jumped.
 Those profits were invested first in the Japanese property market, which by then was soaring. Mr. Takahashi then began to develop golf courses, another booming business in Japan. He used the cash generated by selling high-priced memberships to finance his ventures overseas. He and his bankers insisted his domestic holdings remain sound.
 Mr. Takahashi's friendship with Shintaro Abe, long mentioned as a future Prime Minister, and Toshio Yamaguchi, a former Labor Minister, has increased speculation that some of his capital comes from political connections. For some, this answers the mystery of how he accumulated so much real estate, more than $7 billion worth, in so short a period.
 Mr. Takahashi acknowledged being close to the senior Liberal Democratic Party officials but rejected the assertion that he had benefited financially from the connections. "Politics and business have nothing to do with each other," he said.
 
Insider Investigation
 It did not help Mr. Takahashi when the first insider trading case investigated in Japan involved Nisshin Steamship, a company EIE had bought control of several years ago. Mr. Takahashi renamed it Sea-Com and used it to hold his interest in the Regent Hotel in Sydney, Australia. The company's stock price soared when it first announced it would go into the resort business, and the Government has said that an investor had advance notice of the move and profited from it. No charges have been filed, and Mr. Takahashi was not implicated.
 Even with his problems, Mr. Takahashi may emerge at the head of a substantial property business. He has generally concentrated on luxury class hotels and developments. Property experts say EIE may survive if it can complete some projects and raise cash.
 EIE owns three hotels in Tahiti and owns or has begun construction of Regent Hotels in Fiji, Noumea in New Caledonia, Bangkok in Thailand, Huehue in Hawaii, New York, London and Milan in Italy, as well as Sydney. There are Hyatt hotels in Saipan in the Marianas Islands as well as in Perth and Sydney in Australia.
 In addition to a scattering of office buildings in the United States, EIE controls Park Inns, a hotel chain. A deal to acquire 27 hotels from San Diego-based Hotel Investors fell through last year when financing dried up. EIE also came in second in the bidding for Ramada Inns.
 Mr. Takahashi vowed that the creed that had brought him this far would not let him down. He is, he acknowledged, an opportunist, and he said more opportunities were bound to come his way.
 "Very few companies can really set specific goals long in advance and achieve them," Mr. Takahashi said, "In business, so much is coincidence. You stumble on things. If someone says this is what they set out do and they achieved it, you should be skeptical."

Oil Prices Rally, With Focus On Cold Weather in Europe

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices rallied in choppy trading yesterday, with market participants focusing on cold weather in Europe.
Crude oil for delivery in March settled at $22.93 a barrel, up 46 cents, at the New York Mercantile Exchange. In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude closed at $20.61 a barrel, up 10 cents, at the International Petroleum Exchange. 
 "Crude was higher off European prices," said William Byers, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company. "You continue to have abnormally cold weather in Europe that's kept prices firm."
Analysts said much of the direction of the energy futures market came as traders sold heating oil, after sharp rallies last week and on Monday, and bought crude oil and gasoline.
Home heating oil for delivery in March seesawed before settling at 70.80 cents a gallon, down 0.30 cent, in New York. Unleaded gasoline for delivery next month closed at 63.42 cents a gallon, up 0.89 cent.
Natural gas for delivery in March closed at $1.348, down 0.5 cent for 1,000 cubic feet.
Crude oil had moved lower in early trading, then rallied briefly on a vague rumor that a ground war had broken out in the Persian Gulf conflict, traders said. Crude then dipped before rallying again late in the day, propelled by the prices in Europe.
On the way up, crude gained some momentum on news of supply disruptions in the North Sea, caused by a natural gas leak, although repair crews were restoring production.
Home heating oil in New York swung in both directions before closing lower.
"I think the market's getting used to the fact that cold weather's not all that unusual in February," said Bob Baker, an oil analystwith Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "It was just all over the map, for no particular reason that anyone could justify."
Analysts said that although the anticipated beginning of a full-scale ground war was still stirring modest concerns that Saudi oil productions could be threatened, the weather continued to have the greater impact on the oil market.
"Nobody even knows about the war in this market," said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up as Central Banks Move Early to Halt Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar moved higher on world markets yesterday, propped up by early central bank intervention and technical buying.
Gold prices retreated overseas but rose in domestic dealings. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery rose 90 cents an ounce to settle at $368. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $366.75, up 75 cents an ounce.
Analysts said the currency market was largely confused by mixed signals from American officials and leading central banks.
Several central banks in Europe bought dollars in an effort that successfully strengthened the United States currency, an indication that some consensus existed that the dollar might have fallen far enough.
But later, Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, who addressed the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, indicated the Federal Reserve had room to lower interest rates further. Such a move would be bearish for the dollar because it erodes the value of dollar-denominated securities.
Mr. Boskin's comments "are contrary to the intervention we've seen over the last few days," said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader at the Bank of Boston's office in New York.
Despite Mr. Boskin's assessment that lower interest rates are necessary, "people are wary of central bank intervention" and moved to buy dollars, Mr. Morrissey said.
Traders are also awaiting the release of American economic data, beginning with the Commerce Department's release today of retail sales figures for January.
The report "will be used as a gauge of consumer confidence," said Marc Chandler of IDEA, a New York consulting firm. He said the report should show a deepening recession, which would give the Fed further incentive to push interest rates lower.
The dollar rose strongly against the German mark in New York yesterday, jumping to 1.4742 marks, from 1.4477 late on Monday.
The dollar also settled higher against the yen, at 128.65 yen, up from 127.73 yen on Monday in New York.
To buy a British pound in New York yesterday, it cost $1.9910, less than $1.9985 on Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Monday, included: 1.2460 Swiss francs, up from 1.2370; 4.9565 French francs, up from 4.9360; 1,094.75 Italian lire, up from 1,091.00, and 1.1536 Canadian dollars, down from 1.553.
In London, gold fell to a late bid price of $365.95 an ounce, from $367.25 bid late on Monday. In Zurich, it fell to a closing bid of $365.10, from $367. The Hong Kong gold market was closed yesterday for the Lunar New Year holiday.
On the Comex, silver prices were mixed yesterday. Silver bullion for current delivery settled at $3.704 an ounce, up from $3.685 on Monday. But in London, the metal fell to a late bid price of $3.70 an ounce, from $3.75.

HEADLINE: Bush View Upbeat on Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Blaming factors beyond their control for the recession, President Bush and the professional economists who advise him offered an upbeat assessment today of the nation's economy and presented a rosy forecast.
"This temporary interruption in America's economic growth does not signal a decline in the basic long-term vitality of the U.S. economy," the President asserted in his annual Economic Report to Congress. 
 The fuller presentation by the Council of Economic Advisers that accompanied the report carried the thought a step further. "With sound economic policies in place," it declared, "there is no fundamental obstacle to an expansion in the 1990's at least as long and strong as the record expansion of the 1980's."
 
Rationale for Policies
 In terms of policies, the reports broke no new ground. The Administration's main economic themes, like the quest for a capital gains tax cut and new banking legislation and the view that no new tax and spending measures are needed to counter the recession, had already been advanced in the State of the Union Message and the budget. But today's reports expanded on the economic rationale underlying those policies.
For example, the economic advisers listed several reasons for the recession to be, as Mr. Bush stated, "mild and brief by historical standards" and thus not to warrant bold anti-recession measures. Most companies, the advisers said, have low inventories, limiting the need to cut production to work off excess stocks; the low value of the dollar and the strong economies in Germany and Japan are expected to keep exports strong; oil prices have come down in recent weeks, and the Federal Reserve has inflation in check and so is free to ease monetary policy.
 
Little Talk of Risks
 The advisers gave little emphasis to what they called "the downside risk" that the scarcity of credit would continue into 1991 and restrict the recovery.
The Administration forecast that the recovery would begin by summer, that the economy would grow by nine-tenths of 1 percent this year and 3.6 percent next year and that the unemployment rate would average 6.7 percent this year. And that forecast is similar to the projections of the Congressional Budget Office and the prevailing view of private economists.
But the favorable assessment did not sit well with many Democrats in Congress who have been hearing from their constituents of the pain being caused by the recession.
At a hearing this morning of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat who heads the committee, told Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, "The difficulty I'm having is the almost sanguine attitude about the unemployment situation."
 
Council's Members
 Mr. Boskin, an economist on leave from Stanford University, was primarily responsible for preparing today's reports. He was joined at the hearing by the other two members of the council, John B. Taylor, also of Stanford, and Richard L. Schmalensee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In their report and again at the hearing, they said the recession was brought on by the rise in oil prices following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the uneasiness among consumers that resulted from the invasion and the slowdown in bank lending. They also faulted the tight monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board as the economy weakened in the first half of last year.
Pressed in an interview about how much blame he was casting on the Fed, Mr. Boskin praised the central bank for containing inflation and for moving strongly in the last three months to drive interest rates down. But he said, "With the benefit of hindsight, they might have been a bit too restrictive."
 
Contrast to Greenspan
 That is in contrast to the opinion of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, who said in an interview two weeks ago that even if he could go back and start over, he would not change monetary policy.
At the Congressional hearing, Mr. Boskin was asked by Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, whether the Administration or Congress could have taken steps or avoided pitfalls to avert the recession. Mr. Boskin replied that he could not think of any, with the possible exception of recognizing the severity of the scarcity of credit a few months earlier.
On balance, the reports are an exposition of the traditional Republican economic view of the value of free markets with only limited Government intervention and regulation. "The simple secret of America's economic success in the 1980's," Mr. Bush stated, was "Government policy that allowed the private sector to serve as the engine of economic growth."
 
No Waste of Energy Seen
 A chapter devoted to energy policy minimizes the likelihood of serious effects from a steep rise in oil prices and says the Government should not intervene with price regulation or higher taxes. "The common belief that the United States is a wasteful energy user is not supported by the data," the advisers' report declared.
Another chapter defends the Administration's legislative proposals to expand the powers of banks and increase competition among them. Still another chapter reviews the virtues of trade liberalization and the economic cost of protectionism.
In some respects, the reports are noteworthy for topics that are not discussed. While the economic effects of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August are fully documented, there is no mention of the potential economic impact of the war itself, which began last month. Mr. Greenspan has maintained that a war lasting past the middle of April could lead to a long and deep recession.
 
Some Issues Are Ignored
 Moreover, the reports do not deal with issues like the failure of the unemployment insurance system to provide for most people out of work, the high level of poverty among children and the growing income gap between rich and poor.
Like previous reports, one main value of this year's document is the appendix, which includes more than 100 tables of economic statistics, the best compilation of economic data published by the Government. The reports suffer, however, from lack of an adequate index.
The Economic Report of the President and the Annual Report of the Council of Economic Advisers can be purchased for $12 at Government bookstores or ordered from the Superintendent of Documents, Washington, D.C. 20402.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Little Changed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed and interest rates remained locked in a narrow trading range yesterday, as dealers awaited reports on the economy and inflation, as well as auctions next week of new two-year and five-year Treasury notes.
"A lot of securities are trading, but not much is happening," a government bond trader said. "We are caught in a fairly narrow trading range, one I can't see us getting out of until after the auctions next week. Then the market will do better." 
 Since last Thursday, when the Treasury sold $11 billion in new 30-year bonds, long-term interest rates have been stuck at 8.03 percent to 7.93 percent.
The appetite for new securities, nevertheless, remains strong.
 
One-Year Notes at 5.85%
 Bids at an auction yesterday of more than $11 billion worth of new one-year Treasury notes were strong, particularly from small investors. The bids produced an average rate of 5.85 percent, the lowest rate on a new one-year bill in just under four years.
The rate on the new bills was down from the 6.22 percent average rate at the last one-year bill sale on Jan. 10. It was the lowest one-year bill rate since the auction on March 12, 1987, which produced a rate of 5.68 percent.
Market participants were left unmoved by the Bush Administration's annual Economic Report, presented yesterday to Congress. In the report, the Administration forecasts a mild and brief recession that will end this summer. For the year, the Administration is forecasting growth of nine-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Fed Move Unlikely
 Moreover, analysts said that for the time being the Federal Reserve Board was not likely to move interest rates lower, a suggestion that Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors, made in presenting the report.
"Urging from the Administration for the Fed to ease further will not bring a move from the Fed any sooner," analysts at MMS International, an economic information service company, said in their daily market commentary. The analysts said, however, that they did expect the Fed to ease short-term interest rates again in March.
"You can't rule out another easing this month, because they are clearly concerned about the credit crunch," said Kristen Foster, a financial market economist at Citicorp Investment Bank. "But it looks to us as if Fed policy is on hold for a couple of weeks. That means we are in a trading range. "
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the new 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 99 3/32, up by 1/32, to yield 7.95 percent, compared with 7.96 percent late Monday.
 
10-Year Notes at 7.76%
 Among note issues, the new 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at a price of 99 29/32, unchanged, to yield 7.76 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 1/2, up by 2/32, to yield 7.37 percent.
Rates on outstanding short-term Treasury bills were unchanged to up slightly.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.83 percent, up by 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates were unchanged, at a late-offered rate of 5.84 percent.
Retail sales figures, the first of a new set of economic reports due out this week, are expected to be released today. Analysts and market participants are anticipating that the January sales figures will be very weak.
Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji Securities Inc., said the overall sales figures could show a decline of more than 2.5 percent.
"Most of that decline is concentrated in autos," Mr. Kahan said, "but the CNN effect had an impact too."
Mr. Kahan was referring to the effect the Persian Gulf war has had on potential shoppers, who appear to be staying home to watch how the war is being waged on television rather than spending money.
Excluding automobiles, Mr. Kahan said that retail sales probably declined by about 1 percent last month.
 
Corporate Bonds Strong
 In other developments, new issuance in the investment-grade corporate bond market remained strong yesterday.
Among the new issuers was the Union Oil Company of California, which offered $200 million in 15-year debentures through an underwriting syndicate led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 9 1/8 percent securities, which mature on Feb. 15, 2006, were priced at $99.337, to yield 9.207 percent, or 1.45 percentage points over the prevailing yield on Treasury securities of comparable maturity at the time of pricing.
The issue, which is noncallable for life, is rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
Big Hawaii Sale
 A number of new tax-exempt issues were offered in the municipal bond market.
The largest deal was for Hawaii, which had a negotiated sale of $250 million in general obligation bonds through an underwriting group also led by Merrill Lynch.
The issue, which was increased from $150 million because of strong demand, consists of serial bonds with maturities of 1994 to 2011. Yields on the securities at pricing ranged from 5.30 percent on bonds maturing in 1994 to 6.55 percent on those maturing in 2011.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues rose by about an eighth of a point.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt securities said that prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged to down about an eighth of a point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE;
Dow's a Good Indicator, Except for False Starts

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Almost alone among economic indicators, the stock market has been sending strong signals that the recession is nearly over. While other measures like housing starts continue to offer a dreary run of bad news, the Dow Jones industrial average has risen 21.5 percent since it bottomed on Oct. 11, despite yesterday's decline of 27.48 points, to 2,874.75.
The market's out-front role is not unprecedented. In several postwar recessions, stocks turned up before any of the other leading indicators the Commerce Department follows. And even when stock prices have trailed some other indicators, as happened in 1982, the market's strong performance provided evidence that the economy was going to strengthen long before most economists saw it coming. 
 "I regard it as quite good as a leading indicator," said Geoffrey Moore, the director of the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University. He played a leading role in developing the index of leading indicators.
Looking at seven recessions since World War II, Professor Moore and Prof. John P. Cullity of Rutgers University calculated that the stock market bottomed out as little as three months before the end of a recession and as much as seven months ahead. If it turns out that this stock market hit its low point in October, that would imply an end to this recession by May.
But while the record is a good one, it can be hard to tell the real signals from the false ones. The classic example came in the long 1973-75 recession, when stocks rallied in early 1974, only to plunge again.
That rally sent the Dow up 13.1 percent from its low of 788.31 on Dec. 5, 1973, to a peak of 891.66 on March 13, 1974. The recession officially began in November 1973, and the rally seemed to indicate at the time that the downturn would be short and mild.
Sure enough, the gross national product did rise in the second quarter of 1974, adding support to the stock market's signal. But both the economy and the stock market soon faltered, and the recession continued until March 1975. Share prices did not bottom again until Dec. 6, 1974, when the Dow hit 577.60, a drop of 35.2 percent from the level on March 13, 1974.
But when the stock market did begin to move up at the end of that recession, it was the first of the 11 leading indicators to do so, said Barry Beckman, the chief of the Commerce Department's statistical indicators branch. Similarly, stock prices turned up before any other indicator in the recessions that ended in 1954 and 1958.
By March 17, 1975, midway through what was later determined to be the final month of the 1973-75 recession, the Dow was up 36.2 percent from its low of the previous December, at 786.53.
"It has a good record," Mr. Beckman said of the stock market's role as an economic forecaster. "The main drawback to it is that it has false cycles to it, many during expansions." In such cases, of which the 1987 crash is one example, the stock market turned down sharply but no recession followed.
The Administration, which needs good news, has seized on the market's record as a positive economic indicator. President Bush referred to it last week in a speech to the Economic Club of New York, and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told the Congressional Joint Economic Committee yesterday that the market obviously saw a short and shallow recession.
But, resorting to a cliche often used by economists who have little faith in the predictive power of share-price action, Mr. Boskin added, "Of course, the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions." He did not address its record in forecasting recoveries.
While the early 1974 rally gave a false signal of an economic rebound, and may serve as a warning to investors to be cautious now, bulls can point out that this rally has been much more powerful than the one in 1974, rising much further and carrying along virtually all stocks. The 1974 rally was more selective and took the Dow up a much shorter distance.
In regard to that internal power, the latest rally most resembles the explosive advance that began on Aug. 13, 1982, more than three months before the 1981-82 recession was officially deemed to be over, but after indicators like housing starts and consumer expectations had begun to rise.
In 1982, the Dow leaped 37.1 percent from a low of 776.92 on Aug. 12 to 1,065.49 on Nov. 3, early in the month that the economists eventually declared to be the one in which the recession had ended.
A similarity between 1982 and now is that both rallies came after the Federal Reserve had clearly signaled its intention to drive down interest rates and try to spur economic growth. While the slogan "Don't fight the Fed" has long been standard investment advice, in both cases many economists and market analysts thought the Fed's efforts would prove wanting. These experts were wrong in 1982, and the rise in stock prices indicates that many investors think they will be wrong again this year.
The stock market has not, of course, responded only to economic news. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August, followed by rising oil prices, served to depress share prices. Hopes for a short war this year have helped to raise them. How much those concerns have distorted the movement of stocks is impossible to say.
But it is clear that economic expectations are playing an important role. According to Shaw Data Services Inc., one of the best-performing stock groups in the Standard & Poor's 500 this year has been building and housing stocks, which rose 25.4 percent through Monday despite general gloom in the real estate industry.
By contrast, shares of companies that could be expected to show consistent profits even in an unhealthy economy have trailed the market. The indexes for both telephone utilities and for cosmetic and soap companies are down this year.

HEADLINE: Threat to Cellular Phone Services

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
In a move that could threaten cellular telephone companies, the Federal Communications Commission may decide on Wednesday to grant a small radio company's request to provide a new form of mobile telephone service in six major cities, including New York.
If the request is approved, the action could inject new competition into the industry. At the moment, Federal rules permit only two cellular systems to operate in any city. But the new proposal could open up a regulatory back door, allowing companies that provide private radio service for taxi fleets and delivery services to offer mobile telephone services to individuals. 
 The new services would have some drawbacks when compared with normal cellular systems, and may not be any cheaper, but the competition it creates could force prices down.
 
Industry Is Alarmed
 The proposal has alarmed the industry, which has heatedly opposed it and enlisted support in Congress late last year to delay the F.C.C.'s decision. Now, the agency appears ready to make a decision.
The proposal was submitted by Fleet Call Inc. of Bloomfield, N.J., which is licensed to provide specialized mobile radio in six cities. The principal customers are now radio dispatch services that operate fleets of vehicles, from taxis to pizza trucks.
Traditionally, these services have been able to serve only a limited number of customers, partly because they are assigned comparatively small slices of the radio spectrum. In New York, for example, a private radio service can handle only about 150 conversations at a time.
But Fleet Call, which was founded in 1987, says it can use new technology to increase capacity sharply and change the competitive equation. Using advanced digital transmission techniques, it says it can pack several times as many calls over its radio frequencies. In addition, it wants to build a network of low-powered transmission towers, much like those used by the cellular industry today.
As envisioned, the new system would be able to provide mobile service to almost as many customers as today's systems. Customers could also be connected to local telephone networks, allowing people with ordinary phones to speak with people using mobile radios. Fleet Call has asked for permission to build the new systems in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Dallas and Houston, cities in which it now operates dispatch services.
"We expect to be a major competitor in the wireless communications business," said Jack A. Markel, vice-president of Fleet Call. As envisioned, the company would still offer traditional dispatch services, but it would also offer mobile telephone service for individuals, data transmission and possibly other services.
F.C.C. officials are known to favor increased competition, and they have made it clear they are cool to preserving rules that create artificial barriers between industry rivals. The F.C.C. chairman, Alfred C. Sikes, has repeatedly said the commission needed to face up to communications technologies that can be used for a number of different purposes.
But the company still faces both regulatory and business obstacles. The cellular industry has begun a major lobbying campaign, enlisting two former F.C.C. chairmen, Mark Fowler and Richard Wiley, to argue both in Congress and before the commission that Fleet Call violated procedural rules in making its request.
F.C.C. action was delayed in the fall, after Mr. Sikes received letters from two key Democrats questioning the procedure under which the Fleet Call decision was being made. Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, head of the telecommunications subcommittee, suggested that the issue should not be decided as a limited waiver request from Fleet Call but as a broader policy issue.
 
Prediction of Decision
 One lobbyist predicted today that the F.C.C. would approve the company's request for only one city.
Doubts remain about how effectively Fleet Call would actually compete against cellular companies. At the moment, such mobile radio services can allow customers to patch calls through local telephone companies but only for a limited number of people. At the moment they are cheaper than cellular services. Andrew Roscoe, president of Economic and Management Consultants International Inc., says customers using such services today spend an average of $33 to $51 a month. Cellular users spend $80 to $90.
But any service that competes with a cellular company will have substantial costs because it will have to build scores of small transmission towers. Fleet Call has already spent $200 million to built its current systems, and predicts it will need another $700 million to $1 billion to provide the enhanced services.
 
Some Cost Drawbacks
 Some analysts also contend that the radio handsets for Fleet Call and its imitators will be more expensive than cellular units. The technical features of cellular equipment are now standardized nationwide, making it possible to bring down costs through higher selling volumes. Specialized mobile services are currently different in each city.
Finally, customers of the new service would not have the ability to use their equipment outside their cities. By contrast, cellular systems have "roamer" agreements, which allow a customer to make calls from distant cities.
Some analysts also contend that Fleet Call's local service is likely to be inferior as well. "It is highly unlikely to be as good as cellular service," said Denise Jevne, telecommunications analyst with T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.

HEADLINE: PHILIPPINES SEEKS HIGHER BASE RENT

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MANILA, Feb. 12

 BODY:
The Philippines told the United States today that it wanted more money to allow the Americans to use military bases here after their lease expires in September.
Philippine negotiators made their proposal one day after the chief United States negotiator, Richard Armitage, offered what United States officials called a "reasonable" package for use of Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Station and four smaller installations. 
 No figures were disclosed. But Manila's figure was considerably higher than the United States offer, according to people close to the talks, who spoke on condition that they not be identified.
A spokesman for the American negotiators, Stanley Schrager, told reporters that Mr. Armitage had suggested dividing the packages into "hard" and "soft" categories, with the former to be discussed first.
 
U.S. Budget Deadline
 Mr. Schrager said the "hard" components, which Americans wanted settled first to meet a February Congressional budget deadline, included military assistance, economic support funds and food aid.
"Soft" categories include sales of Philippine goods to the bases, housing investment and debt reduction.
"We have submitted proposals based on the perceived needs in this country and on our desire to have as much as possible from these talks to help us in all our economic recovery programs, to enable us therefore to get back on our feet," the acting Philippine spokesman, Raul Rabe, said.
After today's meetings, the two sides reported progress on issues like military cooperation, cultural exchanges and legal procedures for the 40,000 United States troops, Defense Department civilians and military dependents at the installations.
 
Timetable for Transfer
 Other unresolved issues include Philippine demands for full criminal jurisdiction over troops and dependents as well as the timetable for transferring control of the bases.
Philippine negotiators have said they want the bases converted to commercial use. The United States has proposed a 10- to 12-year transition to full Philippine control. Philippine negotiators have proposed a 5- to 7-year phase-out.
United States officials have agreed to return the four small facilities to the Philippine Government, and current talks have focused on the status of Clark and Subic.

HEADLINE: Monsanto Told to Halt Promotion Of Its Gene-Engineered Milk Drug

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
The Food and Drug Administration has ordered the manufacturer of a genetically engineered hormone that increases milk production to stop promoting the drug while it is still under Government review.
Federal officials maintained that the manufacturer, the Monsanto Company, was promoting the product, bovine growth hormone, as being safe and effective but that safety had not yet been determined by the F.D.A. Promotion of a product while it is still under review is illegal. 
 Monsanto officials said the company's activities had been in compliance with Federal regulations. "We feel strongly that what we have done is informational and not promotional," said Larry O'Neill, chairman of Monsanto's public information group. He said Monsanto would continue to follow the regulations.
In a Jan. 9 letter to Monsanto, Dr. Gerald B. Guest, director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Veterinary Medicine, cited 49 examples of statements made in brochures, videotapes and company meetings that were "clearly promotional." Statements that the F.D.A. found objectionable were assertions that the hormone, also known as bovine somatotropin, had no ill effect on cows and that milk production could increase as much as 40 percent.
 
Meetings Around the Country
 Dr. Guest said Monsanto held meetings around the country where "the emphasis was clearly to promote the safety and effectiveness of BST, particularly Monsanto's product, to practicing veterinarians." Some of the meetings were attended by staff members from Dr. Guest's agency.
Last November, the Foundation on Economic Trends, a Washington advocacy group leading a national campaign against the hormone, accused the four companies that make the chemical, plus dairy trade associations, of promoting the drug, and threatened to sue the F.D.A. if the agency did not take action to stop the promotion.
The critics' opposition is based on fear of the health effects on humans who consume milk from cows that have been injected with the hormone.
Bonnie Aikman, an spokeswoman for the F.D.A., said the reprimand of Monsanto was not in response to the group's objections but was a result of the F.D.A.'s own investigation.
The drug, the first genetically engineered hormone to undergo the Government drug approval process, is at the center of a struggle over the future of biotechnology in agriculture.
 
Hormones From Bacteria
 The intent of using the drug is to increase the effects of a hormone that occurs naturally in cows. The gene that prompts production of the homone can be cloned in a laboratory, using genetic engineering techniques. These genes can then be inserted into bacteria, which in large colonies mass-produce the hormone. This synthetically produced hormore can then be injected into mature cows, causing them to produce more milk.
Monsanto, the American Cyanamid Company, Eli Lilly & Company and the Upjohn Company have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on research and development of the hormone.
Critics of the hormone charge that the regulatory process has been tainted by manufacturers' trying to influence the F.D.A. and public opinion.
Mr. O'Neill of Monstanto said he did not know why his company was the only one reprimanded, although he said it may be because "we have been more vocal."
 
'Politics and Emotion' Are Cited
 Steve Berchem, a spokesman for the Animal Health Institute, a trade group for animal products in Alexandria, Va., that coordinates the public relations in favor of the drug, said the result of the regulatory fight may may be to frighten the public about the safety of the milk produced.
"We protest attempts to let politics and emotion get in the process," Mr. Berchem said. "We feel that some of the critics of BST are taking the public down that road."
Mr. O'Neill said he and other Monsanto officials met with F.D.A. officials 10 days ago to clarify how they could comply with the regulations.
But Mr. O'Neill said the Monsanto delegation told the Federal officials, as it had before, that it was important that the company continue to be able to deal publicly with the questions about the hormone.

A Queens man beat his 11-month-old son to death on Monday, then slit his wrists and walked to the edge of Jamaica Bay, where he was arrested, the police said yesterday.
The man, Raymond Rodriguez, 25, an unemployed Far Rockaway resident, was charged yesterday with second-degree murder as he lay in critical condition at St. John's Hospital, the police said. 
 On Monday, police officers, called by the child's mother, Sylvia Brabham, 20, found the baby, Donald Ray Rodriguez, in cardiac arrest in his crib on the first floor of 14-24 Point Breeze Place in Far Rockaway, a three-family house.
He was pronounced dead at St. John's. The medical examiner found that the child had died from blows to the head and trunk, a police spokesman, Officer Fred Weiner, said. He said apparently no weapon was used.

Hard Times, Easy Subsidies

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
DOES one bad subsidy deserve another? Easy credit offered to the Soviet Union is likely to increase Western sales at the expense of cash-and-carry Eastern European exports. That is why Daniel L. Bond of the United States Export-Import Bank and Anthony M. Solomon, the former president of the New York Federal Reserve and now an adviser to the S. G. Warburg Group, want to help the Eastern Europeans build a subsidy system of their own.
The proposal to fight subsidies with more subsidies did not delight the economists, bankers and diplomats assembled last week at the Institute for East-West Security Studies in New York. But it may win converts among pragmatists who say Stalin's victims deserve every break they can get -- and fear that the West does not have the generosity to see Eastern Europe's transition to capitalism through to a successful end. 
 Export subsidies may be on their way out. While there is still a free-for-all in food and weapons trade, Western governments have become tougher on exporters who use guaranteed loans to woo customers. Mr. Bond, the chief economist for America's export finance agency, said that someday soon governments would charge enough to cover the real cost of credit -- including the risk of default.
But someday is not now. Mr. Bond and Mr. Solomon worry that in the worldwide scramble to export to the Soviet Union, backward industries in Eastern Europe will be driven out of business before they have been fairly tested.
Eastern Europe's export woes flow from the collapse of the Soviet trading system. Under the old rules set by Moscow, the satellites delivered a wide range of products in return for Soviet fuel and raw materials. In a sense, the system worked to Eastern Europe's advantage. Export markets were guaranteed, and at highly favorable terms; Moscow effectively subsidized the empire by selling oil and natural gas at far below world prices.
But over the long run, managed trade has proved a disaster. Lacking both competition and access to modern technology, Eastern Europe was never disciplined for delivering computers that were instant museum pieces or cars that belched rotten-egg fumes. When the Kremlin announced last year that the colonies must make their own way in a global market, hundreds of seemingly productive factories became obsolete overnight.
Mr. Bond and Mr. Solomon say they fear that trade within the former Soviet bloc will fall by 30 percent in 1991. That is not necessarily bad news. One way or another, the cycle of incompetence begetting incompetence must come to an end. But the two economists argue that the West has no business piling on; Western-subsidized competition may ruin enterprises that could otherwise have survived the transition.
The economists estimate that Western companies will fight for roughly $20 billion worth of the exports Eastern Europe now funnels to the SovietUnion. The creaky Eastern economies will be able to hang on to some of this trade by offering lower prices or longer warranties. But the two economists guess that credit subsidies from Western governments could still cost Eastern Europe some $4 billion in sales each year.
Mr. Bond and Mr. Solomon propose to right the balance by subsidizing what amounts to a reinsurance system. Where credit proved to be the decisive factor in export competition, Eastern European governments would be encouraged to guarantee the repayment of bank loans made to Soviet customers. Western governments, in turn, would guarantee the guarantees.
No Western outlays would be needed on Day 1. But the economists suggest that it would be prudent to set aside $400 million a year to cover potential Soviet defaults.
Objections leap to mind. Local officials would decide which exports deserved guaranteed financing, effectively strengthening the planning bureaucracies that made a shambles of the Soviet-bloc economy. Western government guarantees might end up costing a lot more than $400 million a year if the Soviet economy disintegrates and the Kremlin stops paying its bills.
But the proposal may offer a relatively appealing alternative to subsidy-as-usual. No Eastern European government is ready to abandon every money-losing enterprise to its fate. Most are now inclined to plow cash into the enterprises with the most employees or the most political clout. Export credit guarantees, by contrast, would be tied in part to objective market performance: They would not save enterprises that could not convince foreigners of the value of their products.
What is more, no-money-down credit guarantees might prove a more palatable form of aid to budget-pinched Western governments than cash loans or grants -- indeed, that is precisely why credit guarantees are so loathed by free marketers. But as long as back-door subsidies remain on the table, why not use them in a virtuous cause?
