HEADLINE: A Fog Warning, Again, for Municipal Bonds

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
FEW areas of finance are as opaque as the municipal bond market.
Which is astounding, when you consider how crucial this $4 trillion market is to the nation's economic life. Sure, munis seem boring. But without them, state and local finances would collapse. Witness the mess in Jefferson County, Ala., which declared bankruptcy last fall.
And so the Securities and Exchange Commission -- with good reason -- is trying to bring transparency to the muni market by increasing disclosure requirements. 
As a result, issuers of munis must now post financial statements, bond rating changes and other material information promptly on the EMMA data site of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.
It's a good start. Some 55,000 entities in America issue municipal bonds. But not all of them are adapting well to a new, open world. A case in point is the West Penn Allegheny Health System, one of the biggest bond issuers in muni-land. This five-hospital system in the Pittsburgh area posted $1.6 billion of revenue in its 2011 fiscal year. It has almost $740 million in bonds outstanding, most of which were issued in mid-2007.
The sheer size of the West Penn bond issue makes it a muni bond bellwether. A genuine market exists for its debt; trades take place fairly often, unlike the situation for many other government bodies, whose bonds essentially change hands by appointment.
But West Penn is also worth watching because it has been subject to an S.E.C. investigation since August 2008. An earnings restatement in July 2008 prompted the inquiry, which became a formal investigation in February 2009.
West Penn is also noteworthy because it emerged out of the failure in 1998 of the Allegheny Health, Education, and Research Foundation. The bankruptcy of Aherf, as it was known, was the largest among nonprofit health care providers at the time, according to Moody's Investors Service. Some $555 million in debt was affected.
Today, West Penn is struggling again. It lost $56 million in the six months ended last December. Its pension plan is underfunded by $200 million. Moody's and Fitch Ratings downgraded West Penn's bond rating last fall, pushing it deeper into junk territory. And last December, KPMG, its auditor, said the system's financial performance for fiscal 2011 raised ''substantial doubt'' about its ''ability to continue as a going concern.''
A potential life raft popped up last year, when West Penn announced a partnership with Highmark Inc., a health insurer with 4.8 million members in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Under a deal struck in November, Highmark said it would commit up to $475 million over three years to strengthen West Penn's hospitals. So far, West Penn has received $100 million.
Obviously, this combination would provide a needed backstop for West Penn. But because it would involve a health care payer teaming up with a health care provider, the agreement must be approved by Pennsylvania's insurance department and attorney general.
That will take time, maybe 12 months or longer, according to the Fitch analysts. West Penn, meanwhile, is hemorrhaging cash. As of Dec. 31, the system had 58 days worth of cash on hand.
More worrisome is that the potential partnership has attracted interest from the antitrust division of the Justice Department, which has asked that documents relating to the Highmark-West Penn partnership be produced within the next few weeks.
Bond holders may be unaware of the Justice Department investigation, however; West Penn has not disclosed it.
Such silent treatment from West Penn management is typical, some large bond holders say. The turnaround team hired last fall by West Penn has met with hospital employees, doctors and the Pittsburgh community to outline its plans. But bond holders' requests to meet with management and discuss its turnaround strategy have been rejected, according to a spokeswoman for United Missouri Bank, the bond trustee.
Given that the bonds make up roughly three-quarters of West Penn's capital structure, giving those holders the cold shoulder seems odd. It might be acceptable if the system's operations were thriving. But considering West Penn's deteriorating financial position, you'd think its management would be eager to tell its story to bond holders, if only to reassure them.
DAN LAURENT, a spokesman for West Penn said the system ''has and will continue to fully comply with all of its disclosure obligations.'' On the question of why the new management team had not met with bond holders, he said that it had recently met with the bond trustee and its advisers. Mr. Laurent declined to comment on the Justice Department investigation.
But its silence is also strange, given that West Penn's disclosure practices are already on the S.E.C.'s radar. The regulator has sought information ''related to certain disclosures by WPAHS,'' according to the system's financial statements. As is the custom in such cases, a spokesman for the S.E.C. declined to comment on the status of its investigation.
Because the West Penn bond issue looms so large in the muni market, many institutions hold West Penn's debt. The $3.3 billion Goldman Sachs High Yield Municipal fund is an example; as of Dec. 31, it held West Penn bonds with a face value of $90 million.
But individuals are also sizable players. So far this month, a vast majority of trades in West Penn bonds were for less than $50,000 worth of the debt. Last week, two transactions totaling $150,000 took place at a price of $84.75. Yields on those trades were about 6.5 percent, a lofty figure, considering that the interest on these bonds is at least exempt from federal income taxes.
Although those prices are down some from January trades around par, or $100, investors don't seem exceedingly concerned about West Penn's future. They may be counting on approval of the Highmark transaction or, failing that, perhaps they expect another buyer to emerge.
How things at West Penn will play out is anybody's guess. What is clear is this: While disclosure in the muni market has improved, largely at the insistence of federal regulators, getting the full picture from some issues remains enormously difficult.

HEADLINE: Boom Times For a Seller Of Drums

BYLINE: By REBECCA FLINT MARX

 BODY:
WEDGED between a strip joint and a neon-fringed brasserie, the entrance to 723 Seventh Avenue does not demand attention. For a jazz drummer, however, it may as well be the gateway to Narnia.
A three-floor elevator ride above the dissonant grind of the theater district, Steve Maxwell Vintage and Custom Drums sits as calm and orderly as a library. The main showroom is a percussive playground: bass drums, tom-toms and snares neatly stacked four and five high, their shells lustrous shades of mahogany, indigo, copper and champagne sparkle, accented by winking chrome.
Leather stick and cymbal bags hang from the blond wood walls, waiting to be plucked by the people who weave among the instruments, appraising them with scholarly gravity. The frequent pop and sparkle of snare drums and ride cymbals emanate from two glass-fronted, sound-insulated demo rooms, a legacy of the third floor's previous tenant, a recording studio. 
''We're very lucky,'' Steve Maxwell, the proprietor, said one afternoon this winter. ''When we rented this space, the soundproofing was already here. If we didn't have it, we wouldn't be able to have a conversation with a customer.''
Mr. Maxwell, 59, was in the former control room, a space that functions as a museum of sorts for rare and extremely valuable vintage kits. A yellow Gretsch kit that the jazz drummer Elvin Jones played from 1970 to 1979 was on loan from the Rolling Stones's Charlie Watts, a friend of Mr. Maxwell's. It sat cheek by jowl with Peter Erskine's maple Yamaha tour kit from his Steely Dan days, yours for $8,500. Nearby was a $30,000 white marine pearl Rogers set with gold-plated hardware that the jazz drummer Louie Bellson gave to Sammy Davis Jr.
The almost four-year-old shop, near 48th Street, is itself a rarity, the only serious drum store left in New York City, and one of a few nationwide to survive the Internet, the economy and big-box retailers. On this afternoon, Mr. Maxwell and his employees were busy absorbing inventory from Drummers World, a nearby shop that closed earlier that week.
''I tip my hat to Barry,'' Mr. Maxwell said of the defunct store's owner, Barry Greenspon. ''Thirty-two years, that's a good run. I'm going to miss him.''
When he was a teenager in Rhode Island, Mr. Maxwell would take the bus to New York and hang out at Frank Ippolito's Professional Percussion Center in Midtown, where he studied with the legendary Papa Jo Jones. After playing professionally for several years, he landed in Chicago, where he ran a technology business and opened the first location of Maxwell's in 2002.
The New York store functions both as a community center and as a destination for gawkers and serious customers. ''We get everyone from celebrities getting custom work done to Broadway players to weekend warriors,'' Willie Martinez, the store's in-house repairman, said.
Heavies like Steve Jordan, Jeff Hamilton and Vinnie Colaiuta visit when they come through town. But those with less-intimidating resumes are also welcome. Andy Hazlitt browsed a wall of snares as his 15-year-old son, Cole, tried out some old K Zildjian cymbals he had seen on Maxwell's Web site. He and his family were visiting for the weekend from Clearwater, Fla. ''We made a pilgrimage,'' Mr. Hazlitt said. ''We stop at Macy's, Bloomingdale's and here.''
On another winter afternoon, Jay Friedman, 64 and recently retired, dropped in to pay for his weekly lessons with Ron Tierno, a musician and teacher who has a studio in the store.
''I walked in here and thought, 'This is pretty cool,' '' Mr. Friedman said, recalling his first visit. ''Sam Ash'' -- the music megastore down the street -- ''is a big machine. This place is a little jewel.''

HEADLINE: A Young Novelist Uses Life Lessons

BYLINE: By CELIA McGEE

 BODY:
THE ladies who pre-lunch at the Regency Hotel had no idea there was a spy in their midst. Cristina Alger always fits incontestably into Park Avenue's epicenter of corporate power breakfasts, the evening cocktail hours for young socialites in training. She likes to go there because ''it's just up from my apartment,'' she said.
Check the Goyard schlepping bag, the Cartier watch and Hermes bracelets wrapping her wrist. There's nothing to reveal that Ms. Alger, 31, has now stepped outside the hush-hush circle of her upbringing -- Chapin, white-gown debut, four social years at Harvard -- to drop a dime on the whole shebang. Her first novel, ''The Darlings,'' comes out Monday. It's about one of those bright and shining New York families (the Darlings) who have it all. Until they don't. 
An estimable fortune is brought low, and along with it the racquet club morale and ethical code by which Carter Darling, the founding billionaire of a seemingly unassailable hedge fund, has led his life and steered his family: his lovely, frosty wife; his two unevenly accomplished daughters, and the highly presentable young men -- one smarter and not to the WASP manner born -- who have married them. The ostensible tripwire of the disaster is the discovery that a trusted firm member has been running a far-reaching Ponzi scheme.
''The Madoff situation was just starting to unfold as I began the book,'' Ms. Alger said, ''but he wasn't the only Ponzi schemer out there. I had read and heard about plenty of them. What interested me more was what makes other characters turn a blind eye, and what happens as a result.''
She took an analyst job at Goldman Sachs straight out of college, then, one New York University law degree later, became a rising corporate attorney at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr. But the financial crash of 2008 upended the moneyed world around her, she said. As she watched the Wall Street crackup, she decided ''I wanted to write about it.''
Where did she get the nerve? Tamped down inside the young professional she had become was the writer she had hoped she might be until three days into her senior year: Sept. 11, 2001. Her father, David Alger, the well-known chief executive of the mutual fund giant Fred Alger Management, had his offices on the 93rd floor of the north tower at the World Trade Center. Ms. Alger learned of her father's death ''because I was watching the news on television.''
An only child, losing her father ''changed my life in more ways than I can articulate,'' she said. ''I wasn't thinking terribly clearly,'' when she made her about-face into investment banking. ''I wanted a job close to my family and that paid enough so my mom wouldn't worry about me.''
''When a parent dies, particularly one who's prominent,'' said Ms. Alger's close Harvard friend, Christina Lewis, daughter of the late Reginald Lewis, ''that's a lot of responsibility. You have to be strong and self-aware. Cristina is.''
In her book, 9/11 is barely mentioned, yet, Ms. Alger writes, no one forgets ''when the planes hit the Trade Towers and all was lost in New York.''
''It was an end of innocence,'' she said.
Ms. Alger and her father were not only very close (both fanatical athletes, both crazy about writing and books), she also believes her parents provided her with a moral compass, stressing that they had been happiest when they were young and struggling, that their good fortune was owed to education and hard work. And they were strict, her mother a rigid stickler for good manners and proper behavior. They stayed vigilant, Ms. Alger believes, as they eyed the circles she was moving in.
In the novel, Merrill, the older Darling daughter, reflects that ''Manhattan children were like armadillos...They had to be. Manhattan was a Darwinian environment...Merrill would see schoolchildren on Park Avenue, golden-haired cherubim in pinafores and Peter Pan collars, and she would think: These are the offspring of killers.''
Yet anyone who reads the book and sees themselves mirrored in the particular tuck of Nantucket reds or a silly quote about Palm Beach ''would have to be a narcissist,'' Ms. Alger said.
The exception is a minor character in this novel who will be a major player in her next one. Any resemblance between the overzealous (in the Darlings' eyes) Wall Street watchdog Bill Robertson and Client No. 9 is totally on purpose, Ms. Alger said. ''I like the idea of a political figure with great promise, yet personal feelings can bring down a professional life.''
The comparisons to Tom Wolfe that are starting to come her way, Ms. Alger said, just make her laugh. ''Alexandra Wolfe was one of my best friends at Chapin,'' she said. ''I practically grew up in the Wolfes' apartment.''
Her parents had a downstairs neighbor who was also kind to the embarrassed eighth-grader they sent over to show off her first Chapin literary prize. Joan Didion ''served me tea, and told me something I've never forgotten,'' Ms. Alger said, ''that you have to have something to write about before you learn how to write about it.''
Her mother has not remarried. ''She's old-fashioned that way,'' Ms. Alger said. ''She and Joan check in on each other.''
She has dedicated ''The Darlings'' to her mother, an indication of how far their relationship has come not just since her father died but since her father-centered adolescence. She also has a fiance in place -- a onetime friend from Goldman, now at a private equity firm -- and he didn't grow up in New York. The other day she picked out a wedding dress her mother actually loves almost as much as the plans for Ms. Alger's wedding at the Knickerbocker Club in May.
''I like to think that people have learned from 2008,'' she said. ''There was so much hubris, so much not being kept in check. But it'll take years to see if it's changed.''

HEADLINE: High-Brow Lit for High Fliers? Not Me

BYLINE: By DOMINIQUE BROWNING. 
DOMINIQUE BROWNING, author of the memoir ''Slow Love,'' is the senior director of Moms Clean Air Force, an organization fighting air pollution as a children's health issue.

 BODY:
SOMEWHERE over the Mississippi River I looked up from my book, glanced out the window, realized that my flight out of New York was actually in the air, that we seemed to be making good time, and that there was a slim chance I would make a tight connection in Texas and get to my first meeting in New Mexico. Duly noted. I glanced at the snaking river below me, took in the squared-off landscape, and plowed right back into my book.
To what did I owe this newfound oblivion about where I was? This insouciance about fraying schedules? This good cheer about the dismaying ritual of herding, shuffling, squeezing, starving, sitting and suffocating that characterizes air travel today?
To a good book. The right kind of good book. My heart and mind were plunged into an epic battle between good and evil, the struggle to establish a new world order, the heartbreak of love fractured by political imperative, the tragedy of families torn apart. 
Was I reading ''War and Peace''? Hardly. I have given up flying with Great Literature.
I must credit George R. R. Martin with a salutary breakthrough in my reading habits, but I might just as easily credit (or blame) Sara Paretsky, or Patricia Cornwell, or P. D. James, or Sue Grafton, or Faye Kellerman, or John Mortimer. I'm just beginning to mainline the addictive Ruth Rendell.
This breakthrough came after years of piling up back issues of sobering magazines, hoarding clips on topics like ''The Trouble in Galicia'' or ''Economic Peril Sets In'' to read on the plane. After years of buying paperbacks of world classics, meaning to reacquaint myself with the stuff of college classes. After years of being tethered to my middle seat too near the lav, struggling distractedly through great prose, tough reporting, clear-minded thinking, biting analysis -- and understanding nothing.
Instead of reading, I used to worry about how long a delay was going to last; fret over the awfulness of the dried-out sandwich that was meant to be dinner; gently shove back the head of a slumped stranger snoring on my shoulder; feel a miasma of germs settle around my head and travel up my nose, down my throat, into my eyes; imagine the incipient thrombosis that would clog my heart, just because I was too timid to ask two grumpy people to get up once again so I could walk down the aisle.
And then I finally found the literature that stands up to the tests of travel. The secret, dear reader, lies in narrative drive. Plain, old-fashioned, unrelenting, compelling storytelling. You've got to reach for the best-seller shelves. Which, until now, I had avoided with the mild disdain of the librarian who finds herself stamping withdrawal slips for the football team.
It all started one day when I was in a swivet over a canceled flight out of St. Louis. I had gotten to the bottom of a daunting pile of clips. One of my biggest nightmares loomed: nothing to read. At the newsstand was a stack of novels by a writer whose name dimly rang a bell, something from television land, perhaps? Worse. Video games. Having been a Tolkien addict as a teenager -- and there, on the cover, it said, ''our American Tolkien'' -- and feeling weary, weak, awfully alienated from those teenage years and far from the comforts of home, I reached for ''A Game of Thrones'' by George R. R. Martin.
Within minutes, I was a goner. As dismal hours in the airport lounge slipped by, my mind stayed locked in the conveyor belt of a fantasy saga. Nothing mattered but world dominion. I left the tawdry, dingy, gray world of airlines and moved into a place of large, complicated, colorful conquest. When I glanced at my fellow passengers, I no longer saw the poor slobs who were as sick and tired as I was. I saw the Brotherhood of the Wall, imperturbably guarding a towering barrier of ice and magic. That wasn't a manic Chihuahua yapping in a crate. It was a direwolf pup, with whom I felt a mystical kinship. Before long, I, too, was a queen, bedraggled by a long journey, surely, but with my warlord, a nomadic Dothraki, at my side. My carry-on carried dragon eggs, not two-ounce bottles of liquids.
Don't get me wrong. I love Daniel Deronda and Martin Chuzzlewit as wholeheartedly as the next English major. But the last time I tried reading ''Ulysses,'' as the plane was being de-iced and delayed for more than an hour, I felt as if my brain had entered the literary equivalent of a wait on the tarmac. Joyce was going nowhere, fast -- and so was I.
I no longer take Great Literature on the road. It belongs nestled in my arms, deep in a comfortable chair by a crackling fire, where I can tend lovingly to every detail it whispers, where I can pay close attention to the dexterous play of intelligence and the lilting nuance of verbal agility.
Of course, one can stoop too low. Junk food may be what is needed on a plane trip, but junk books don't satisfy. Poor writing grates on my ear, no matter where I am. It is like eating too many potato chips; by the time you realize your tongue is glued to a salt lick, you feel dumb as a cow, and you're sick. What I want on a plane trip is a loud, beefy -- even vulgar -- but scintillating companion. Someone like Scott Turow, who commands attention but is refined enough to respect my intelligence. This, not unlike any level of discrimination in matchmaking, narrows the field.
By the end of an autumn of endlessly unpleasant plane flights, crisscrossing the country for a book tour, I had traveled through all five volumes of Mr. Martin's epic series, ''A Song of Ice and Fire.'' I went into immediate withdrawal, and just as quickly came out when I discovered P. D. James, a brilliant writer who studs her mysteries with vitamin-fortified words like ''rumbustious.'' The hours speed by, even when the miles do not. What is a cranky ticket agent compared with a headless body? When was the last time you thought the plane was landing too soon? Trust me: that happens when you have 30 more pages of ''Shroud for a Nightingale.''
You cannot have a steady diet of crime when you are in airports because after a while you get a creepy feeling that you are surrounded by murderers and remittance men, if not actually sitting next to one. So, when the mayhem of detective novels became a bit heavy, I dipped into the anodyne Irish novelist Maeve Binchy. She held up for thousands of miles; I flew through the tribulations of the women who populate the fictitious town of Knockglen in rural Ireland in the '50s: ''Circle of Friends,'' ''The Copper Beech,'' ''Minding Frankie.'' I loved them all. The characters are sweetly troubled but the village is always there to prop them up. This is comforting. It also explains the siren call of the dark psychological thrillers of Ruth Rendell.
I like to cover great blocks of books: all the Martins, all the Cornwells, all the Jameses. It is time for a new writer when I find myself rereading the same book a third time -- and I don't even realize it until about halfway through, when the story becomes a tad too predictable. There's something about airplane air that destroys memory cells. The covers, the plot lines, the characters begin to blur. All the stories sound familiar. That's part of their appeal. They will get you where you want to go, unlike the diverted plane in which you are sitting.
Don't make the mistake of straying off the plot path. You need books with hefty runways and fast takeoffs. You might be tempted, say, to go with autobiographies by Patti Smith or Keith Richards. Noisy, yes; they do drown out the chop of propellers. But famous lives often splutter and short out early, and, I've noticed, this generally happens right around the time a gate change is announced.
Don't even think of tackling titles like ''The Power of Kindness'' or ''Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill.'' You will have failed to develop your better self the moment you are afflicted by the power of unkind strangers bearing Elite Status Membership, shoving you aside in their skilled race to a new boarding gate. I'm all for compassion, but it's not what you want to practice when you're stranded in Cincinnati.
All I want now, from a good airplane book, is transport. A sense of propulsion. I want to feel the rush of plot against my cheek. I want to know where I am going, and why. I'm willing to trade transport for transportation.
I want all the things, in other words, that the airlines no longer deliver. But who cares? When the world around you is ringing with clashing swords, cataclysmic love affairs, swashbuckling detectives -- when you are moving at warp speed through entertaining realms -- the right book becomes your ticket to travel, and your plane ticket only feeds the fantasy that you are making progress through this world.

HEADLINE: With Billions in Grant Money, Leverage to Curb Smoking

BYLINE: By REEVE HAMILTON. 
rhamilton@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Despite polls showing overwhelming public support and endorsements from celebrities like Lance Armstrong, efforts to establish a statewide smoking ban in the workplace have fallen flat in recent sessions of the Texas Legislature. But a state agency is finding that the billions of dollars it has at its disposal may allow it to be more effective in getting comprehensive tobacco-free policies established -- most notably, at university campuses.
University administrators around the state are considering campuswide tobacco-free policies as a result of new rules established by the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. In January, the institute's oversight committee adopted a policy that requires grant recipients to have policies prohibiting tobacco use in buildings and structures where financed research is occurring, as well as at the outdoor areas immediately adjacent to those buildings. The grant recipients must also provide smoking cessation services for community members who desire them. 
For schools that pride themselves on their research function, like the University of Texas at Austin -- it has received about $30 million in grants from the institute and is hoping for $88 million more -- there is a clear financial incentive to institute changes.
''If folks have to go a little bit farther, if they have to think about having a cigarette a little bit more, we are encouraging them to smoke less -- which results in positive benefits -- or to quit altogether,'' said Bill Gimson, the executive director of the institute.
He added that the new rule is not a response to legislative failures but is consistent with the institute's mandate to prevent cancer in Texas.
In 2007, the research institute was established with the passage of a constitutional amendment that easily won voter approval. The state was authorized to issue $3 billion in bonds over 10 years to finance cancer research and prevention efforts. Nearly $600 million in grants have been issued, primarily to academic institutions.
Institutions currently receiving grants must be in compliance by Aug. 31 or their current financing could be in jeopardy. The policy will apply to all new grant proposals submitted on March 1 or later.
Around the state, institutions are scrambling to revisit their tobacco policies.
Adrienne Howarth-Moore, the director of human resource services at U.T., said that narrowing down the buildings that current and future research might occur in -- or revisiting the issue each semester as the affected locations change -- could prove challenging.
''We have researchers that do their day-to-day investigations in a lab, but then they go and do their analysis and review in an office,'' she said. ''And they might have graduate research assistants who are doing their work in the library.''
The existing policy prohibits smoking in all buildings, as well as within 20 feet of doors and windows. Ms. Howarth-Moore said expanding the capacity of the university's current cessation services, as well as producing additional signs and educational materials, would probably have an economic impact, though she said the amount is unknown.
In early 2011, U.T.'s student government called for a campuswide tobacco ban. William C. Powers, the university's president, had openly opposed it, claiming that it would infringe on personal freedoms.
Mr. Gimson shrugged off the notion of overstepping, saying that campuses still have choices. ''We came up with a reasonable policy,'' he said. ''If folks want to expand that, more power to them.''
Though Mr. Gimson said the rule change is intended to be a carrot and not a stick, it is a large one that many universities cannot afford to ignore.
''I don't know what we want to call it,'' said Taylor Eighmy, the vice president for research at Texas Tech University, which has received nearly $1 million in grants. ''It's not legislation, it's not a mandate, it's not a federal or state requirement.
''But this suggested language, we intend to comply with it.''
And with research financing at stake, the president of U.T. is coming around. ''President Powers supports revisiting these rules in light of the recent decision'' by the cancer research institute, said Gary Susswein, a university spokesman.
Although the prospect of having to leave the campus to have a cigarette is certain to create some anger on college campuses, a number of tobacco users welcome the change.
''It would definitely be inconvenient, but I am all for a smoke-free campus,'' said Kirk Van Sickle, a junior who started smoking when he was 18. ''On a personal note, it would probably help me quit. It would be good for me.''
A campuswide ban is not a sure thing. As compliance deadlines approach, U.T. administrators say such a policy remains one of many options.
At the University of Houston, which has received nearly $7 million in grants from the cancer research institute, the student government recently approved a resolution to extend a prohibition on smoking within 15 feet of facilities to 25 feet.
''This is a topic of interest and importance to the university, even before we learned of the new guidelines,'' said Richard Bonnin, a university spokesman.
He indicated that U.H. was also considering a campuswide measure. ''We want to make sure everyone's viewpoints are expressed before making a final decision,'' he said.
Jason Cook, a spokesman for Texas A&M University in College Station, which has received more than $3.4 million in grants, said the issue would be complicated on A&M's 5,000-acre campus, with more than 500 buildings and multiple state agencies.
''Given the issue of size and scope and the multiple organizations on our campus, we intend to have a very engaged discussion,'' he said, adding that the first step would probably be to establish boundaries around buildings where institute-financed research is occurring.
A handful of institutions in Texas, including the University of Texas System campuses in Arlington and Brownsville, have already adopted campuswide tobacco bans of their own accord.
At U.T.-Arlington, which has received nearly $2.3 million in grants, the policy was phased in over nearly two years. Kristin Sullivan, a university spokeswoman, said the financial impact had been nominal -- approximately $7,000 per year.
Mr. Gimson said he sees progress in the movement toward anti-tobacco policies on university campuses.
''I think we're ahead of the wave,'' he said, ''but certainly there is a wave.''

HEADLINE: Canal Expansion Raises Expectations and Questions

BYLINE: By SUSANNAH JACOB. 
sjacob@texastribune.org

 BODY:
From his office window, Ricky Kunz, the Port of Houston Authority's vice president for origination, watched the action unfold. As workers drove Volkswagens off one vessel onto a dock, a neighboring ship was loaded with cargo, destined for the Far East. Freighters that dock at one of the world's busiest ports cannot afford to leave empty.
The port is overseeing $3 billion in updates to its berths and cranes and other facilities, many of which are being completed in anticipation of the 2014 debut of the expanded Panama Canal. 
Local officials agree that the canal's expansion will be a financial boon to Texas -- and in particular, the Port of Houston, which should see more and larger container ships docking in its berths. But officials disagree on the size of the economic benefits and the ability of the state's already congested railways and roads to handle the predicted significant uptick in traffic.
Mr. Kunz expressed confidence that the port, which had a record 8,073 ships call in 2011, will be ready for the increased traffic resulting from the canal's expansion. But he is wary about predictions of explosive, unprecedented traffic at the port and then northward, as trucks and trains travel through Texas, hauling cargo to the Midwest.
''I think that we will see an increase, but we are very, very conservative in what we forecast, about a 15 percent increase of the traffic we get on the trade lane from Asia to Houston,'' Mr. Kunz said, discussing the movement of container ships.
''What we do know is that this third set of locks that's being built is going to create a redistribution of cargo,'' he said. ''It's not going to make the cargo grow. It's just going to be a redistribution.
''The West Coast is going to lose some. We're going to get a little bit. The East Coast ports are going to get a little. Everyone is going to share a little bit more in the wealth.''
The seven-year expansion project will be the canal's first major widening in 100 years. In addition to being widened, the canal will double its capacity with two new sets of locks.
Jeff Moseley, president and chief executive of the Greater Houston Partnership, says the canal project is ''a huge game-changer and the project of the century.'' ''It will take us decades to fully realize the potential of this new capacity,'' he added. (The Greater Houston Partnership is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)
Mr. Moseley is quick to emphasize the existing advantages of Houston as a port city, namely its railroad system. He said the rail lines would provide relief for highways clogged with cargo-laden trucks making the same passage as the trains, though less efficiently.
''There will be no more railroads built in America if you can imagine how prohibitive the cost would be, but Houston is blessed with this very strategic network rail -- a fabulous grid that literally connects Houston between the Rocky Mountains and the Ohio Valley,'' he said.
Harris County Judge Ed Emmett had promoted the Port of Houston's potential to be the ''gateway of North America'' for years. He agrees that the Panama Canal is a ''big plus'' but does not think it will be ''the panacea that a lot of people think.'' He suggested that the current rail system might need work.
''The rail system needs to be redesigned, because even though the two major railroads serving here do a good job, the rail system was designed well over 100 years ago, and a lot of those rail tracks still go through downtown, which doesn't make any sense,'' he said.
With so many variables in the shipping industry and the competing ports lining the United States' edges, it is impossible to forecast what shippers will do.
Mr. Kunz hesitates to make predictions. ''I've talked a lot about the expansion of the Panama Canal in the last couple of years,'' he said, ''but the one thing I've learned is that nobody really knows what's going to happen.''

HEADLINE: Brazil Booms, and Brokers Smile

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
DOMINIQUE BENZ and her husband are looking forward to hosting a Brazilian barbecue on their downtown Manhattan deck sometime later this year.
Their ambitions for the affair won't be constrained by space. Last year, the Sao Paulo couple bought two adjoining apartments at the Caledonia in Chelsea. They plan to combine them, creating a 2,800-square-foot deck -- one of the largest private outdoor spaces downtown, brokers said.
Nor will they have any trouble finding fellow Brazilians to invite.
Already, 8 of the 181 condo units in their building have been bought by fellow countrymen, part of a Brazilian buying spree in New York that shows no sign of slowing. The city is already teeming with Brazilian tourists, and many of them, flush with cash from a booming economy back home, are snapping up their own pieces of Manhattan. 
While Russians like Dmitry Rybolovlev, the buyer of an $88 million penthouse at 15 Central Park West, boast in press releases about their trophy properties, Brazilians have quietly become steady clients for higher-end brokers in New York and Miami.
When I was living in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro the past five years, well-to-do locals talked incessantly about New York as the ultimate status symbol. Walk into a trendy restaurant in either city and the words ''Nova Iorque'' seem to be spoken more slowly and loudly than any other (just in case, hopefully, somebody is eavesdropping). Even with soaring fares for flights from the Brazilian cities to the Big Apple, everyone, it seemed, was either going or coming from New York.
''For many, Manhattan is their dream town,'' said Marcos Cohen, a Brazilian broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman who said he had closed more than 15 deals over the past two years for Brazilians paying from $5 million to more than $15 million for Manhattan apartments. For Ms. Benz's husband, a native of Rio de Janeiro who works at a Sao Paulo investment fund, buying a New York apartment was a passion project.
''Having an apartment in New York was a dream of my husband since he was a little boy,'' said Ms. Benz, 35. ''It is his gift at the end of working so hard to be able to buy.''
With three children, the couple were willing to pay more than market value for the second of their two apartments in order to create one of the larger spaces in the building, said their broker, Fredrik Eklund of Prudential Douglas Elliman. They paid a combined $4.1 million for the apartments, with 2,133 square feet of interior space in all.
Ms. Benz said she and her husband were looking to the future, hoping that their children could someday use the apartment for internships or to work in the city. For now, she is happy to have a place to take them a few months out of the year where they can visit Chelsea Piers and ride bicycles without the fear of kidnappings many Brazilians feel back home.
Many of the Brazilian buyers in New York are professionals in their 30s and 40s, often tied to commodities or the finance sector, which has made many Brazilians rich from a flurry of I.P.O.'s in recent years.
Brazilians favor addresses along Central Park on the Upper East Side or in Midtown near Lincoln Center, where many have season tickets, brokers say. Many also look downtown at full-service buildings with concierge services, Mr. Eklund said.
After they close on an apartment, Brazilians often bring in their own architects and interior designers. Fernanda Marques, a Sao Paulo-based architect who is well known in Brazil, is currently doing two projects for Brazilians in New York and one in Miami.
Brazilians are also scooping up hundreds of units in high-end developments in Miami, helping to prop up a moribund market wracked by the 2008 financial crisis, brokers and developers there say.
At the W South Beach Hotel & Residences, about one-fifth of the buyers since 2010 have been Brazilians; they have purchased 31 units totaling nearly $50 million, said David Edelstein, a co-owner of the project. At Paramount Bay, whose lender had previously foreclosed on the project, about one-third of the buyers over the last six months have been Brazilian, said Anthony Burns, a senior vice president at iStar Residential, which co-owns the development.
Alan Araujo, a broker in Miami with Worldwide Development Services, said he sold 12 units in the Epic development to a single Brazilian client who works in the oil industry. He bought an additional 17 in another building, Infinity, about a month later. His total spent on Miami property last year: about $20 million.
''Brazilians have been waiting like 100 years for this opportunity,'' Mr. Araujo said. ''They are in invasion mode.''
In deciding to spend close to $20 million to redevelop Paramount Bay following the foreclosure, the developers chose the musician Lenny Kravitz's design firm, Kravitz Design, to redo the building's common spaces. Mr. Kravitz's popularity among Brazilians -- he has performed at Rock in Rio -- played a big role in his selection, Mr. Burns said.
It has become cheaper, these days, for Brazilians to buy apartments in Miami than in parts of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's magical city by the sea. Apartment prices there are soaring ahead of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and the 2016 Rio Olympics. From April to October of last year, per-square-meter prices rose by more than 20 percent in Rio's wealthier areas, according to Ibope Inteligencia, a Brazilian research company.
''Even New York can be seen as a bargain compared to Rio,'' Mr. Cohen said.
Just a few years ago it wasn't this way. In the 1980s and 1990s waves of economic crises held Brazil's currency down against the dollar. Inflation surged over 1,000 percent a year, and there was little middle class to speak of.
Buying abroad was complicated. ''It took weeks just to make a wire transfer,'' said Daniela Sassoun, a Brazilian broker at the Corcoran Group who specializes in high-end Manhattan sales to international clients. ''It was remnants from a dictatorship full of bureaucracy and stamps and papers.''
These are heady days for Brazilians. Their economy has risen to the sixth-largest in the world. Reforms of the banking system and much lower inflation have given the economy stability. High commodity prices and demand from China have kept the money flowing.
American brokers and lawyers are so eager to do real estate deals with Brazilians that they are making more frequent trips to Brazil and stepping up their marketing efforts in select society publications there.
Mr. Araujo said he made eight trips to Brazil last year, visiting five cities, trying to drum up new clients for Miami properties. Last March, Ms. Sassoun participated in a seminar in Sao Paulo, held by a law firm there, counseling high-wealth Brazilians on how to purchase property in New York and London. The advice included how to structure limited liability companies to shield buyers' identities in property records. Some 130 people attended, with Brazilians calling in from all over the country, she said. The law firm plans another seminar next month.
Mr. Cohen, the broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, boldly approached President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil at the French restaurant Le Bernardin on West 51st Street in September and complimented her on the government's success. ''I said, 'Listen, Mrs. President, I never thought I would live to see how much people respect the Brazilians on Fifth Avenue.' ''
Mr. Cohen himself came to New York in 1987 after living through dictatorship and economic crises, seeing little future for himself there. After selling electronics he decided to get his broker's license and has been selling real estate for the past 17 years.
With so many Brazilian tourists and part-time residents in Miami and New York, getaways can feel like homecomings. Ms. Sassoun said she was buying shoes in Bergdorf-Goodman last year and heard familiar accents. ''I closed my eyes and thought I was in Brazil again,'' she said.
For Jeisa Chiminazzo, a 26-year-old Brazilian model from a town of 3,000 people who bought a two-bedroom TriBeCa loft in 2009 for $1.65 million, the Brazilian invasion has at least one downside.
''If you want to gossip a little bit you can't gossip in Portuguese anymore,'' she said, ''because you will have a Brazilian bump into you.''

HEADLINE: China Takes New Step to Prime Its Slowing Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Determined to keep the domestic economy chugging along, China's central bank said on Saturday that it would reduce the amount of cash reserves that banks need to hold, a move widely seen as encouraging stronger growth. 
The decision to cut the reserve ratio requirement for the nation's biggest banks by half a percentage point, to 20.5 percent from 21 percent, effective next Friday, should make more money available for lending, adding a little extra juice to an economy that has begun to show signs of slowing.
The cut is not a huge move. But with Europe struggling with a debt crisis and growth in the United States still relatively anemic, Chinese officials are worried that exports to its two biggest trading partners could collapse, and investment could slow here.
The decision to reduce the reserve ratio comes after a similar cut in December, which followed more than a year of tightening measures aimed at taming inflation and a soaring property market. The country's economic leaders have repeatedly moved to tighten bank lending.
In recent months, inflation has moderated, though it ticked up in the most recent report. But analysts say there seems to be enough breathing room for policy makers to loosen money controls and take measures to ensure that China's growth in a nation accustomed to boom times does not weaken substantially.
Although economists constantly worry about China's growth trajectory, government planners have managed to steer the economy away from disaster.
China's economy grew by over 9 percent last year. Economists are forecasting slower growth this year, to about 8 percent, a remarkable rate considering China is now the world's second-largest economy after the United States.

HEADLINE: What's New at the PTA, Dad?

BYLINE: By KYLE SPENCER

 BODY:
AT Public School 11 in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, the senior president of the Parent Teacher Association is a vivacious chatterbox who ascended the school's executive board the way many do: forging bonds with parents and teachers, doing an impressive stint as treasurer and finally being drafted for the top slot by a growing fan base.
The one thing this executive officer did not do is man the cupcake table.
''I'm not into the baking,'' said Juan Brea, an admission that once would have been unheard-of in the PTA. 
Mr. Brea, a 43-year-old who favors football, blue blazers, Polo cologne and chopping wood in his Catskills backyard on weekends, is part of the changing face of the PTA. What was once an easygoing volunteer group made up mostly of stay-at-home moms has begun to give way to male leadership.
''This is like running a small business,'' said Mr. Brea, whose day job is chief operating officer at a small nonprofit. ''I'm an operations guy. I believe I add value.''
A 2009 study by the National Congress of Parents and Teachers and the National Center for Fathering, a nonprofit educational organization, found that 590 of 1,000 fathers surveyed nationwide said they attended school parent meetings. That is up from 470 out of 1,000 a decade earlier.
And in many of the top-rated public schools across New York City, where parent groups have become ever-more-efficient fund-raising machines in the face of mounting budget cuts, fathers with financial expertise and a zest for leadership are not just going to those meetings, but running them.
The shift reflects a number of underlying social trends: more women with demanding jobs, more men underemployed in a lingering recession, more shared parenting responsibilities over all and the professionalization of the PTA itself.
In School District 2, which winds through some of Manhattan's priciest neighborhoods, at least 10 of the approximately 40 elementary and middle schools now have male parent-group leaders, up from just a couple 15 years ago.
On Staten Island, the male firefighters, police and emergency-medical technicians who used to shy away from PTA meetings now call many of them to order. And in brownstone Brooklyn's District 15, PTA boards have been inundated with male leadership, in what officials say is a 15 percent jump from five years ago.
For the most part, female PTA leaders applaud the injection of testosterone. But ''both women and men would be lying if they were to say gender dynamics were not an issue,'' said Michelle Ciulla-Lipkin, a president of the PTA at P.S. 199 on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where 5 of the 18 board members last year were male.
At P.S. 110 on the Lower East Side, some have said that John Mooren, an investment banker whose platform as PTA president includes the ambitious goal of building a new gym, has been trying to corporatize the once laid-back board. ''My response is: we need money,'' said Mr. Mooren, 58, whose sons are in kindergarten and first grade.
In the cramped PTA room with the bright pink door at P.S. 75 on West End Avenue in Manhattan, Hector Rios, a co-president, said that being the lone man among eight board members has its downside: ''Sometimes I feel like everybody's husband.''
And at P.S. 3 in the West Village, Nick Gottlieb (a PTA co-president and Papa Nick to students) said that years as a stay-at-home dad have not erased his own perception that he is occasionally an interloper in the land of bake sales, recess volunteers and pajama parties.
''I have to make an extra effort not to be perceived as stepping on people,'' said Mr. Gottlieb, who has daughters in kindergarten and third grade. ''And I think that does have to do with being a man.''
A 1997 study by the National Center for Education Statistics, a federal agency, found that children whose fathers were involved in their schools were more likely to stay in school, do well and enjoy themselves while they were there.
A decade later, in 2008, the National PTA -- a 5.5-million-member organization headquartered in Alexandria, Va. -- paired with the National Center for Fathering in the hope of getting more active male members. Its Web site now lists tips on recruiting men, including scheduling meetings in the morning, which many New York City schools now do.
In 2009, the national PTA elected Charles J. Saylor, a construction industry executive and father of four in Greer, S.C., as its first male president.
''I grew up in a home where both parents were involved,'' said Mr. Saylor, who started out heading the fund-raising committee at his oldest son's elementary school because of, he said, ''an inability to say 'no.' '' Over the years, he said, ''I just started noticing on the county, state and national level more men in the room.''
In 2010 the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, for its part, started NYC Dads, a 14-agency initiative designed to get men to support their children's development in and out of school. And Dennis M. Walcott, chancellor of the city's department of education, pushes father-involvement at events like one in St. Albans, Queens, where fathers brought neckties to P.S. 36 and taught their sons how to tie them.
The surge in male leadership has, in many places, followed a more fundamental shift in the nature of the PTA. Women with advanced degrees, high-powered jobs and technological savvy have brought a new level of sophistication and seriousness to the business of supporting schools. The changed dynamic -- committees that are better organized, deadlines that are taken seriously, goals that are more ambitious, schedules that accommodate working parents -- helped make many PTAs more comfortable for men.
In interviews around the city, many female PTA leaders praised their male counterparts for overhauling disorganized talent shows, automating bookkeeping, building gardens, cultivating contacts with local politicians and silencing parents who go off on tangents during meetings.
Not that women cannot or do not do the same things, but ''men on the board can add a calm,'' said Kathy Ellman, who has three sons and who served on the PTA board at P.S. 11. ''They can be a little more relaxed.''
Still, for every admiring story about a father whose PowerPoint presentation revolutionized the Read-a-Thon, there is one about the bossy treasurer whose budget-balancing came with an off-putting tone. Or the president who chose the wrong time to talk school politics.
And what seems to be a perennial gripe: men going missing when it's time to do the grunt work.
''You don't see many male presidents with the cellophane and the curling ribbon working on the auction baskets,'' said Bijou Miller, who lives on the Upper West Side and has sat on a half-dozen school-related boards over the last decade.
Mr. Brea of P.S. 11 said he was focusing on appealing to big-ticket donors and setting up processes that future boards can benefit from. He recently helped convert the PTA into a tax-exempt organization, and helped secure a $2,500 computer program that tracks donations.
At P.S. 295 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, Dan Janzen used his stint on the grant-writing committee to persuade Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president, to give the school $150,000 in interactive white boards.
''That was my aha! moment,'' said Mr. Janzen, 44, a freelance copywriter and father of two. ''I said, 'This is real. I can really get things done.' ''
And at P.S. 261 in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, Rick Knutsen, 46,who has a daughter at the school, can sometimes be spotted playing piano for the chorus, or doing a PowerPoint presentation for the PTA, for which he is a president.
Eli Janney, one of the group's vice presidents, is often at a table in the lobby, Starbuck's coffee by his side, peddling tickets to a fund-raising event and imploring parents to ''Support the school!''
But Mr. Knutsen has faced some discouraging moments. He was recently dressed down, he said, by a mother irate that he chose the cherished winter concert, which draws a big crowd, to vote on a letter opposing a new charter school nearby. She thought his timing was wrong.
''My kid tap-danced and then I got yelled at,'' Mr. Knutsen recalled glumly.
Among the beneficiaries of the new PTA dads are their wives.
''If our daughter comes home and tells us about something that happened at school, Rick pretty much already knows about it,'' said Mr. Knutsen's wife, Frances Barney Knutsen, who works for BNY Mellon. ''That's comforting.''

HEADLINE: Budget Woes Prompt Erosion of Public Jobs, With a Heavy Toll in Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
SAN JOSE, Calif. -- The smell of new carpet still lingers in the children's section of the gleaming new Bascom Library and Community Center here, where signs promise ''picture books'' and ''story time.'' But the low, easy-to-reach wooden bookshelves are empty, along with the rest of the shelves in the state-of-the-art, 40,000-square-foot building.
The bookless library stands behind a locked chain-link fence with signs warning of 24-hour video surveillance, one of four libraries the City of San Jose has built but cannot afford to open.
The city's Fire Department laid off 49 firefighters two years ago, and the trucks that race to calls now carry only four firefighters instead of five. Streets are repaved less often. And the Police Department, which laid off 66 officers last summer and has shrunk by about a fifth in recent years, has grounded its helicopter, reassigned officers from special units to patrol and stopped responding to burglar alarms. 
The nation has lost 668,000 state and local government jobs since the recession hit -- more than in any modern downturn, according to a new analysis of labor statistics by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government. On the national level, the steady loss of public sector jobs has reduced the effects of recent job gains in the private sector and has slowed economic growth. But in cities and states around the country, the loss of those jobs has made it harder to provide services and has upended the lives of thousands of workers who had thought their government jobs were safe.
It is not just faded industrial cities that are struggling to retain their workers. San Jose, a growing city of nearly one million in the heart of Silicon Valley that is now the nation's 10th biggest, has shed 1,592 jobs -- more than a fifth of its employees -- over the last four years as falling tax revenues, rising pension costs and dwindling state aid have all taken their tolls on the city and its workers.
Christine Velasquez, 39, who lost her job at the city's redevelopment agency last spring as the state prepared to shut it down to save money, now uses local coffee shops as virtual offices for networking and job hunting -- including Caffe Frascati, an Italian-style cafe she helped bring to the city when she worked at the agency.
John Robertson, 28, who was recruited to the Police Department here from his old job as a New York City police officer with the promise of better pay and better benefits, was laid off last summer. Mr. Robertson, who is getting married this year, said he was lucky to find a job a couple of months later at another Bay Area police department.
Teresa Gutierrez, 66, who in June lost her publicly financed job as a translator and an organizer at a center that helps the poor, has not been as lucky. She now takes home some food for herself from the food bank where she has helped out for years.
''I can't find a job,'' Ms. Gutierrez said at her old office at the Santee Neighborhood Action Center, where she still volunteers to help people avoid eviction, find help or learn about gang prevention. ''There are hardly any jobs anywhere. I even looked in a restaurant, to wash dishes, and they said no, with your application you're overqualified.''
It is hardly the image that comes to mind when many people think of a Silicon Valley city where the median household income is $76,794 a year and employers include Cisco Systems, eBay and Adobe.
But the city's tax collections this year are projected to remain below where they were five years ago -- and California law makes it hard for cities to raise taxes, since they must win voter approval first. Pension costs now consume more than a fifth of the city's general fund budget, officials said, and have risen to $245 million this year from $73 million a decade ago.
''You've got this double whammy for local government of the retirement costs escalating and the crash of '08, the recession, knocking revenues down at the same time,'' Mayor Chuck Reed, a Democrat, said in an interview in his office in the city's new 18-story Richard Meier-designed City Hall, which was built in better times by his predecessors.
The city government's employee head count has shrunk to 5,400 from 7,418 a decade ago, when it had fewer residents. Branch libraries are open only four days a week. And the city recently won agreements from its unions to cut compensation for all of its employees by at least 10 percent.
Now Mr. Reed is taking aim at pension costs, which rose after the benefits were improved over the last decade, with police officers and firefighters able to retire after 30 years with pensions worth 90 percent of their salaries. He supports a ballot measure this June that would require workers to go into far less lucrative retirement plans, or to contribute up to 25 percent of their salaries to keep their current benefits. ''Every dollar the city pays for retirement costs is a dollar we can't spend on services for our residents,'' he said in his annual State of the City speech this month.
Union members picketed the speech. They have accused the city of exaggerating the future costs of pensions to build support for the measure. Jim C. Unland, the president of the San Jose Police Officers' Association, said that the police were willing to negotiate on retirement costs, but that the mayor's proposals went too far.
Yolanda Cruz, a library network engineer and the president of the city's Municipal Employees' Federation, pointed out that city workers would not get Social Security, and that the average pension for nonuniformed workers was $36,000 a year. She said a city-commissioned poll had found a growing willingness to raise taxes.
For now, the city is trying to figure out how to make do with fewer workers.
After the police unit in charge of gang violence was merged last year with a unit that focused on quality-of-life issues, street-level drug dealing and prostitution, a spate of gang-related murders occurred in the city, which remains one of the safest of its size in America. The smaller unit was ordered to focus on gangs. Then there was an increase in prostitution.
''It's no longer 'Do more with less,' '' said Christopher M. Moore, the chief of police. ''It's doing less with less, and what is it that we're going to do that makes the most sense.''

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about budget problems in San Jose, Calif., misspelled the surname of a resident who lost her job last spring and is using local coffee shops as virtual offices. She is Christine Velasquez, not Velazquez. The article also misspelled the name of one of the coffee shops she visits. It is Caffe Frascati, not Caffe Frescati.

HEADLINE: Drinking and Drugging

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
''CRACK is wack.''
Remember that phrase? I heard many people repeat it last week as they appraised the waste of Whitney Houston's later years and flashed back to her 2002 interview with Diane Sawyer, when she uttered those immortal words. She was bristling not at rumors that she abused drugs but at insinuations that she turned to cheap ones. With album sales like hers, you didn't have to suck on a pipe.
Sawyer wanted to know what Houston was on. Everyone wanted to know what Houston was on, and news reports after her death took unconfirmed inventory of the pills in her hotel suite, wondering if they represented the extent of her indulgences. 
No. By many accounts, Houston also drank. More than a little. In fact one early, leading theory about the cause of her death, which won't be known until toxicology tests are finished, was that a mix of prescription drugs and alcohol did her in.
But while the drugs leapt immediately to the foreground, with questions raised about which doctors and pharmacies had provided them, the alcohol receded from focus, as it too often does. Wrongly, perilously, we tend not to attribute the same destructive powers to it that we do to powders, capsules and vials.
We don't talk of its abuse in quite the same titillated, scandalized, censorious tone. Vodka isn't wack. Beer, certainly, isn't wack. It has adorable mascots -- remember Spuds MacKenzie, the Bud Light bull terrier? It's advertised during the Super Bowl and on the sides of municipal buses. It even comes in cloying fruit flavors and brightly colored cans, with fun names. Four Loko, anyone?
Because drinking is legal for adults, safe in moderation, the rightful font of epicurean reveries and the foundation of a multibillion-dollar industry with lobbyists galore, it gets something of a pass. Many of us like it -- no, love it -- too much to survey the damage it can do, look at ways in which our society could work to curb that and acknowledge that the effort isn't so very vigorous.
According to Robert Brewer, the alcohol program leader at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, heavy drinking is the third leading preventable cause of death in this country, after smoking and a combination of bad diet and inactivity. By conservative estimates, it's directly related to about 80,000 deaths each year, an agent of -- or co-conspirator in -- cirrhosis, esophageal cancer, overdose, homicide and much, much more. It seeds and squires a broad range of diseases. Multiplies the effects of illicit and prescription drugs. Adds the twitch to a trigger finger. Puts the wobble in legs on a staircase or hands on a steering wheel.
And while 8 percent of Americans ages 12 and over use illicit drugs, 34 percent are addicted to alcohol or indulge in what public health officials consider risky drinking, according to Susan E. Foster, director of policy research and analysis for the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.
As a result, she said, ''There are many more deaths due to alcohol. There's much more violent crime linked to alcohol.''
That's not to mention all the injuries, emergency-room visits, disabilities and missed work days. Brewer calculates that for those reasons and others, heavy drinking costs the United States about $224 billion annually.
''There is a huge societal burden that we're all bearing,'' he said.
But is there a commensurate societal concern?
States have raised the legal drinking age to 21 over recent decades, and there has definitely been extensive public education about drinking and driving.
But I can't recall much alarm about drinking's other perils. From antismoking ads, I have pictures of blackened lungs and amputated fingers seared into my memory. From antidrug ads, I remember an egg in a skillet as a metaphor for a brain on amphetamines. Where's the analogous image for the ravages of too much booze?
And where are the taxes? Many studies have shown that pricing is a surefire way to control consumption, and taxes on tobacco have risen accordingly, so much so that in New York, a pack of cigarettes now costs upward of $10.
But excise taxes on alcohol have gone down over the last few decades, when adjusted for inflation and measured in terms of the percentage they represent of the wholesale and retail price of a bottle or a can. The federal government and many states long ago set those levies in terms of a certain dollar amount per gallon -- and then didn't tweak them much as the cost of living went up.
Because Congress last revised excise taxes on distilled spirits in 1991, the real value of those taxes has declined more than 35 percent, said Alexander Wagenaar, a professor at the University of Florida's College of Medicine who specializes in alcohol research.
In several states, the situation is even more absurd. According to a national roundup done by Alcohol Justice, an industry watchdog group, Wyoming hasn't raised the excise tax on beer, which is two cents per gallon, since 1935.
Although some states have increased the sales taxes on alcohol over the last few years, they've typically done so in search of badly needed revenue and in the hope that it won't dampen consumption -- not as a public health measure aimed at reducing drinking.
''It's amazing,'' Wagenaar said. ''There are scientists and epidemiologists counting all the bodies from alcohol-related problems, but only a few of them are looking at tax rates.''
And while some states restrict the marketing and promotion of alcohol, the overall advertising climate remains permissive enough that between 2001 and 2009, the average number of commercials for alcohol seen yearly by a teenager who regularly watched television rose to 366 from 217, according to a study for the Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth at Johns Hopkins.
I'm not interested in reanimating Carry Nation, and I'm not about to abandon my white Burgundy or gin martinis. But I'm confused by the paucity of public discussion about all this. I've heard more calls for taxes on sugary soft drinks than for an overdue examination of taxes on booze.
The chatter about Amy Winehouse's dalliances with crack cocaine was more derisive than the talk of her boozing, though what ultimately killed her was alcohol.
What killed Houston is still to be determined. But as we turn her into a cautionary tale and tote up all the places she went wrong, let's not be too quick to edit drinking out of the picture.

HEADLINE: Patrick and Nascar Are Ready to Win

BYLINE: By VIV BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Those racy photo shoots and GoDaddy.com commercials are not the only reasons Danica Patrick is the most brazen driver in Nascar. Just listen to her.
''Do I think I can win the Daytona 500? Yeah,'' Patrick told reporters Thursday at Daytona International Speedway.
She could be right. Trevor Bayne, a rookie part-timer in his second Sprint Cup start, won it last year to prove once again that the Daytona 500 is one of Nascar's least predictable races. But for Patrick to declare herself a contender before her first Cup event says as much about her as it does about the race. 
As the veteran driver Denny Hamlin said last month, ''If she's got the confidence that she can win the Daytona 500, then I can guarantee you she's got as good a shot as anyone here right now.''
Patrick, who is 5 feet 2 inches when she is not glamorizing Nascar in spike heels, has never been short on confidence. As she moves from IndyCar and prepares to race full time in the Cup series in 2013 by driving regularly in the lower-level Nationwide Series for Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s JR Motorsports and in 10 Cup races for Stewart-Haas Racing this season, Patrick appears at ease with the attention she has drawn.
The pressure of being the first woman to gain a top ride in Nascar, and the third to race in the Daytona 500, does not seem to bother her.
''Hey, I want to do well just as much as other people want to see me do well,'' said Patrick, who will turn 30 on March 25. ''I'm sure there's people who don't want to see me do well as well. But no, I put plenty of pressure on myself. I've gotten better about it in my old age, setting realistic goals for myself. And you know, it's all part of the game. It's about a story. It's entertainment. It's a story, and everybody's trying to dig in it from different directions, creating their own expectations. But it's really opinion, and I have one, too.''
Maybe the calm comes from standing at the precipice before. In 2005, Patrick burst into the national consciousness by becoming the first woman to lead laps in the Indianapolis 500; she finished fourth. She has been a focal point and lightning rod in auto racing ever since. Patrick has titillated some male fans by posing for Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue and in other risque spreads. She has angered some women by baring skin to cash in and raise her profile instead of relying on her performance to stand out.
Patrick apologizes for none of it.
''I do what feels comfortable to me and then I'm good with it,'' she said. ''I'm a girl, and so to say I can't use being a girl doesn't make any sense. In this world, there's so much competition out there that you have to use everything that you have to make sponsors happy, to attract them, to be unique, to be different.''
Even as she chooses a sexy image to garner fame and fortune, Patrick criticizes the news media for calling her sexy.
''It's like if there is a pretty girl, they don't know how to describe a pretty girl other than being sexy, and it has such a negative connotation to it,'' she said. ''You don't say those kinds of things to frame it like that for a guy, or even sometimes talk about it. But it seems like with female athletes if they are pretty, they only know how to describe them in a sexual way. I don't care, but I just wonder why we can't talk about it in a different way. Why can't there be other words for it? Why does it have to be somewhat negatively twisted?''
Patrick's decision to race full time would seem to be all positive for Nascar. She proved competitive with men as the first woman to win an IndyCar race, at Motegi, Japan, in 2008. And she was the most popular driver in that series for six years.
Nascar, which has felt the effects of the recession in terms of dwindling sponsorship dollars, could have an increase in fan interest and television viewership because of her. And that could be the hook that draws sponsors back to the sport.
''She attracts a lot of attention,'' Earnhardt said. ''We need a bit of a rebound in some areas. She can provide that spark, sort of refresh some corporate sponsors' interest in the sport and do things like that.''
Patrick does not have to win races. Nor is she expected to, given that she raced only part time in the Nationwide Series the past two seasons. Last year's Nationwide champion, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., won only two races, and he has far more experience in stock cars than Patrick.
Her goal in the Nationwide Series is to be competitive from week to week. And despite Patrick's Daytona bravado, her realistic expectations on the Cup circuit are limited. She still has much to learn.
''I think success at the end of the year won't be judged by where the finishing position is,'' said Tony Stewart, a three-time Cup champion and Patrick's team owner.
Still, the stage is set for another dramatic Danica moment like the one she had seven years ago in the Indy 500.
''If she were to have the same kind of performance at Daytona that she had at the 2005 Indy 500,'' said Eddie Gossage, the Texas Motor Speedway president and a top race promoter, ''that's a watershed moment for our sport.''

HEADLINE: For Syria, Reliant on Russia for Weapons and Food, Old Bonds Run Deep

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- As the violence in Syria worsened in recent days, amateur video showed the forces of President Bashar al-Assad rolling through the besieged city of Homs in vintage Soviet battle tanks.
Other photographs, including satellite images released by the State Department, showed deployments of Soviet-designed truck-mounted rocket launchers and two models of a self-propelled howitzer whose sweet-scented names in Russian, Gvozdika and Akatsiya (Carnation and Acacia), are no reflection of their fearsome firepower.
Seemingly undeterred by an international outcry, Moscow has worked frantically in recent weeks to preserve its relationship with the increasingly isolated government of Mr. Assad, even as the Syrian leader turns his guns on his own citizens, and the death toll mounts. Not only has it continued to arm Syria, but its veto with China of a United Nations Security Council resolution calling on Mr. Assad to resign provided the political cover for a more severe crackdown on rebel forces.
Russia has praised Mr. Assad's call for a constitutional referendum, a step that the United States and other governments have dismissed as meaningless. On Thursday, Russia was one of just a dozen countries, among them China, Iran and North Korea, to vote against a General Assembly resolution urging Mr. Assad to step down. 
And many analysts say that without Russia's backing, including a steady supply of weapons, food, medical supplies and other aid, the Assad government will crumble within a matter of months if not sooner.
It has done all this in the face of stinging international criticism, and so far it has shown no signs of backing down. While Moscow has a number of reasons to guard its relations with Damascus, the most concrete, many analysts say, is the longstanding arms sales to Syria.
The chief spokesman for Rosoboronexport, the state-owned weapons trading company, said last week that absent any new directive from the Kremlin, business with the Assad government would continue as before.
''We understand the situation has become aggravated in Syria,'' the spokesman, Vyacheslav N. Davidenko, said in an interview. ''But since there are no international decisions, and there are no sanctions from the U.N. Security Council, and there are no other decisions, our cooperation with Syria -- the military-technical cooperation -- remains quite active and dynamic.''
Regional political events have played a part. The Arab Spring and the American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have dissipated Russia's once-powerful influence in the region, transforming the relationship into one of critical importance to Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, who is running for president and wants to expand Russia's role as a global powerbroker.
''Syria is kind of it in the Middle East at this point for Russia,'' said Dmitry Gorenburg, a Russia expert with the Center for Naval Analyses, a federally financed research group based in Virginia. ''That can go a long way toward explaining why Russia stuck with Assad for the last year.''
The Kremlin is also eager to send a stern message to the West about its distaste for interference in any country's internal affairs -- a point it reiterated in voting against the General Assembly resolution last week. Russia's United Nations ambassador, Vitaly I. Churkin, said the resolution ''reflects the alarming trend to try to isolate the Syrian leadership, to refuse any contacts with it, to impose a formula for political settlement from outside.''
Instead, Russian officials have called for both the Assad government and the opposition in Syria to agree to a cease-fire.
And the Russian Foreign Ministry has praised the plans for a constitutional referendum.
''Moscow sees this step as evidence that the Syrian leadership, despite the complicated security situation, is implementing the promises made to the people of realizing deep political and socioeconomic transformations,'' the ministry said in a statement.
But if the talk from Russia is heavy on respecting Syria's autonomy, and avoiding the chaos that has engulfed Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Egypt, arms exports have long anchored the relationship between Moscow and Damascus, including sales over the years of MIG fighter jets, attack helicopters and high-tech air defense systems.
While the ouster and death of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya and the imposition of sanctions on Iran have sharply curtailed other formerly lucrative arms markets for Russia, Syria has increased its weapons purchases, including a deal late last year for Yak-130 light attack planes worth more than $550 million.
From 2007 to 2010, the value of Russian arms deals with Syria more than doubled -- to $4.7 billion from $2.1 billion -- compared with 2003 to 2006, according to an annual report by Richard F. Grimmett, a veteran international security specialist at the Congressional Research Service in Washington.
During the same period, the value of Russia's weapons deals with Iran fell to $300 million from $2.1 billion.
In a sign of the intensifying diplomatic pressure on the Kremlin, Russian officials have visited Syria and called for a truce. And the deputy defense secretary, Anatoly Antonov, recently insisted that no Russian weapons were being used against the opposition forces in Syria -- but he offered no basis for the assertion.
Russian officials have forcefully pushed back against any suggestion of an arms embargo against Syria, which they say would handcuff Mr. Assad's government while allowing the opposition to continue acquiring weapons.
While Mr. Davidenko, the spokesman for Russia's weapons company, acknowledged the longstanding ties between Moscow and Damascus, he said that some analysts were exaggerating the importance of Syria as an arms customer, noting that India, now the world's overall largest importer of weapons, had also become Russia's biggest customer these days.
Still, Mr. Davidenko conceded that Russia had lost billions of dollars in potential arms business as a result of sanctions against Iran and the change of power in Libya. In Libya alone, he said, the new government has suspended about $4 billion in previously agreed-upon contracts.
The Libya experience weighed heavily in Russia's Security Council veto. Mr. Putin, for one, was furious at the NATO-led airstrikes against Colonel Qaddafi after Russia and China agreed not to veto a resolution creating a no-fly zone over the nation.
Russian officials said that they were also led to believe that existing arms agreements would be honored by the new Libyan government, but that so far that has not been the case.
''All of that made them very dubious that anything the U.N. Security Council passes that makes mention of Assad stepping down could be used as carte blanche for folks interested in regime change,'' Mr. Gorenburg, of the Center for Naval Analyses, said.
Russian domestic politics are also a concern, especially with the presidential election just two weeks away.
More than two million Russians work for military-related businesses, and they represent a slice of the electorate that officials never want to malign. On Thursday, the government announced plans to spend about $100 billion through 2020 to modernize its military-industrial complex.
Russia's ties to Syria are old and deep. A Russian naval station at Tartus, in northern Syria, is its only military installation outside of former Soviet territories.
There are numerous other economic and cultural bonds, including the presence of Russian companies working in oil and natural gas in Syria, as well as a proposal for the state-owned nuclear energy company, Rosatom, to build a power plant there. Other Russian companies have interests in agriculture, irrigation and telecommunications in Syria.
Syria, however, has a checkered history when it comes to paying for its weapons.
Mr. Assad arrived in Moscow for his first state visit in 2005, with his country owing Russia about $13.5 billion. Mr. Putin welcomed him warmly at a ceremony in St. George Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace. Their wives met for tea.
At the time, the two leaders signed a ''joint declaration on friendship and cooperation,'' and Russia agreed to write off nearly 75 percent of Syria's unpaid bills.
Many Syrian arms purchases are financed by loans, said Ruslan Aliev, an arms-trade specialist at the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a Moscow research group. ''They are old customers, but they are very poor,'' Mr. Aliev said of the Syrians. ''They don't have enough money -- not like Saudi Arabia or United Arab Emirates.''

HEADLINE: Bonds Backed By Mortgages Regain Allure

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED

 BODY:
Some Wall Street investors made money as the mortgage market boomed; others profited when it fell apart.
Having reaped big gains during both of those turns, Greg Lippmann, a former star trader at Deutsche Bank, is now catching the next upswing: buying the same securities built from mortgages that he bet against before the financial crisis erupted.
Mr. Lippmann is joined by other big-money investors - mutual funds like Fidelity as well as hedge funds - in riding a wave of interest in the same complex loan pools that nearly washed away the financial system.
The attraction is the price. Some mortgage bonds are so cheap that even in the worst forecasts, with home prices falling as much as 10 percent and foreclosures rising, investors say they can still make money. 
''Given its significant underperformance in 2011, we believe the product is as cheap to broader markets as it has been in a long time,'' Mr. Lippmann, whose portfolio is heavy with subprime mortgage securities, wrote in a recent letter to investors.
More broadly, the nascent recovery in the mortgage bond market supports a view that the housing slump may have bottomed out. Sales of existing homes are picking up. State and federal authorities have reached a $26 billion settlement with the big banks that is expected to provide some mortgage relief. And the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been able to auction off billions of dollars of mortgage securities that it acquired as part of the financial crisis bailouts.
''There is light at the end of the tunnel,'' said Kenneth J. Taubes, the head of United States investment for Pioneer Investments, a global investment manager that owns these securities. ''The mortgage crisis is getting behind us, and things are getting back to some semblance of normality.''
That optimism is an about-face from 2006 and 2007, when Mr. Lippmann and others told investors that housing was a bubble ready to burst. On Wall Street, Mr. Lippmann became known as ''Bubble Boy,'' and one of his traders wore a joking T-shirt that read, ''I Shorted Your House.''
His exploits were chronicled in Michael Lewis's best seller ''The Big Short,'' which described him as somewhat brash and crass. He was known for maintaining a sushi spreadsheet, where he ranked the top Japanese restaurants in Manhattan on ambiance, quality and cost. (He still maintains the spreadsheet.)
These days, industry competitors describe Mr. Lippmann, who runs LibreMax Capital, as a more mellow presence. And he is much more positive about the market, telling investors that his fund is reducing its hedge against a potential market crash. Through a spokesman, Mr. Lippmann declined to comment.
Others in the industry are also bullish, pouring money back into mortgage securities. Trading has surged in recent weeks. Prices have risen more than 15 percent in the first two months of 2012, after dropping by as much as 40 percent last year.
''There was a lot of money waiting on the sidelines because yields were starting to look very attractive,'' said Jasraj Vaidya, a strategist at Barclays Capital. ''Lots of it seems to have come out now.''
Yet the tide could turn again and wipe out investors. Chief among the risks is Europe: the Continent's banks still hold a significant amount of United States mortgage securities, and if they are forced to sell assets, it could wreak havoc on the market.
Washington is a question mark, too. If banks have to pay for loans they issued under dubious circumstances, it would be a home run for investors, who could receive full payment for a mortgage in a security they bought at a discount. But if borrowers whose houses are worth less than their mortgages are able to reduce their principals on a large scale, bond investors could suffer because the securities would be worth even less than they paid.
''As a money manager, you can't close your eyes to that potential outcome,'' said Jeffrey Gundlach, a founder of DoubleLine Capital, who has been buying mortgage securities since 2008. ''To believe that this time we are really out of the woods and the prices will not drop again is dangerous. People made that argument a year ago.''
The mortgage bond market is a very different creature than it was before the financial crisis. For one, it is much smaller: very few residential mortgage-backed securities have been issued since the crisis. The market, at $1.3 trillion, is half the size it was at its peak and shrinks by an estimated $10 billion every month.
Despite the limited supply, prices remain cheap, in part because the assets are difficult to value. Hedge funds and big investors use computer systems to analyze the underlying loans and estimate, among other things, how many borrowers will default and how much money can be recovered in a foreclosure.
Take one security, JPALT 2006-S1 1A11, which was built from Alt-A loans, or mortgages that required little documentation verifying a borrower's income.
On the surface, the numbers are not encouraging: of the 799 mortgages underpinning the bond, many in foreclosure-heavy California and Florida, about 21 percent are more than 60 days late on payments.
The annual default rate is about 7 percent, and of the homes sold out of foreclosure, investors take a 54 percent hit, according to data from Bloomberg. On average, about 5 percent of the homeowners refinanced their mortgages before they were due over the last 12 months.
That bond recently traded at nearly 70 cents on the dollar.
At that price, even if defaults and the losses increase, an investor can still make more than 5.4 percent, an analysis shows. In a rosier prediction, where defaults drop slightly and the losses on the sale of foreclosed homes stay flat, the bond returns nearly 8.7 percent.
''Price is a wonderful thing,'' said Chris Flanagan, an analyst with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ''Yields in this market range anywhere from 4 or 5 percent up to 12 percent.''
With long-term interest rates close to zero, such returns are hard to resist - even for investors who were punished in the housing bust. The American International Group, whose mortgage securities were acquired by the New York Fed in its more than $100 billion bailout in 2008, has been buying back some of those bonds. And a former mortgage team from Lehman Brothers, which went bankrupt in 2008, formed One William Street, a hedge fund that manages more than $3 billion in assets.
As for Mr. Lippmann, his reputation has made it both easier and more difficult to get commitments from investors. Some are impressed by his well-publicized bet against the mortgage market; others are turned off by his high profile in an industry known for secrecy and discretion.
LibreMax, made up of several members of Mr. Lippmann's team from Deutsche Bank, has raised more than $1 billion in a little over a year. His performance has been relatively strong during a period of market turmoil - up 2 percent last year and a little more than 6 percent since launching.
Like his rivals, Mr. Lippmann cites his experience in the housing market - including its boom and bust - as a principal selling point for his fund.
''Because we have a trading history, I think we understand very well how the street works, better than perhaps people who didn't work in trading before that haven't had that experience,'' he said at a Bloomberg hedge fund conference in 2010.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Mogul Next Door

BYLINE: By JOAN JULIET BUCK

 BODY:
When I interviewed Estee Lauder in 1985, we lunched on grilled flounder at Le Cirque surrounded by excited socialites. Lauder wore a formal dress, a matching coat and a hat. She was often at the Reagan White House, tight with Nancy and Ronnie. When I interviewed Bobbi Brown, we ate organic vegetables in her kitchen in Montclair, N.J., while her nephew noodled on a laptop nearby. She wore J. Crew pants, a Uniqlo sweater, sneakers and her hair was in a ponytail. She is often at the Obama White House and gave the president one of his earliest fund-raisers in 2007, in her garden.
Estee Lauder was nearing 80 but coy about her age, the founder of a multi-billion-dollar empire. She embodied a brand that still represents grown-up ideals of status and class. Bobbi Brown is 54 but keeps claiming 55, a makeup artist who built a company on a brown lipstick and yellow-based foundation, and sold it four years later to Estee Lauder's son Leonard, while keeping creative control. She embodies a brand that represents candor and lack of artifice, truth in makeup. Kate Middleton wore Bobbi Brown at her wedding to Prince William.
''She wants everyone to look like themselves, every woman a queen, and I love that,'' Leonard Lauder says. 
''When do you know you have too much makeup on?'' Oprah once asked Bobbi Brown on TV. ''When you look really good, you should stop,'' she answered.
Bobbi Brown looks really good. The clarity and confidence are dazzling, and so is the common sense. The woman who sells 21 million ''units'' of product each year, or 2,400 per hour, or 40 per minute, says: ''Eating right and exercising is more important than what you put on your face.'' Her hairis long, her features symmetrical, and despite the warm smile, her eyes are serious. Small dangling earrings and a center part make her look a little Italian. She wears rectangular glasses with black frames, not contacts. Her skin appears bare of makeup, but her eyes are perfectly outlined with an almost imperceptible black gel that began life as the stuff that's inside a mascara wand.
She gives off energy, focused attention, warmth. There's also a sprinkling of one-liners -- this is a woman who has been on television regularly for years and is used to public banter. ''I'm not really Type A'' she says, pointing out her home gym, ''but A minus.'' In her walk-in closet there are high heels, but her favorites are all flat. Backlogs of pashminas, totes and bags have gone off to Dress for Success, the nonprofit that helps outfit women who need jobs. Each time she goes on QVC, Bobbi Brown hands over $25,000 to Dress for Success. She's just finished her seventh beauty book and a year of celebrating her 20th anniversary as a brand. She works from her studio in an industrial building in Montclair and goes into the Bobbi Brown headquarters in SoHo twice a week. With her two older sons, Dylan and Dakota, in college -- at Stanford and Willamette -- she's taken in two exchange students from Italy and Germany, Alessandro and Amedeo, who go to school in Montclair with her 13-year-old son, Duke. Two nephews, one a graduate, one in law school, also live in the house part time. There are two dogs, Biggie and Pup Pup. A former baby sitter called Raven lives in a house in the garden with a third dog.
Bobbi rises early, moves fast, lays claims to an adult A.D.D. that allows her to do her best work in a moving vehicle -- driven, she specifies, by someone else -- and likes to say, ''I write all my books in traffic jams,'' and carries herself with the dignity of a Sicilian magistrate, except when she is near tall people, or rappers. Just five feet, she insists on having her picture taken with six-footers, like the designer L'Wren Scott, or -- her best catch yet -- Yao Ming, the 7-foot-6 Chinese former N.B.A. player. She loves rap and hip-hop and dancing. Last year, she joined the rapper Flo Rida to dance onstage. ''I think I'm really good,'' she says. ''It's only when I see the videos that I realize I am a short Jewish woman after all.''
Bobbi's parents, Joe and Sandra Brown, were only 21 and 20 when she was born in Chicago. She grew up in the suburbs dancing to Motown with her friend Lynn and spent one year at the University of Arizona. Undecided as to what to do next, she returned home. ''If you could do anything you wanted to, right now, what would it be?'' her mother asked. ''I'd like to go to Marshall Field's and play with makeup,'' she said.
She went to Emerson College, studied theater makeup and moved to New York with a boyfriend. After enduring the boredom of a job respecting continuity on a movie -- ''I had to create bruises and make sure the bruises didn't move across the face during the filming, and people just sat there eating bagels all day'' -- she moved into fashion makeup. She was adaptable, easy to work with and paid intense attention to everything around her. The photographer Brigitte Lacombe loved to work with her because she didn't try to change anyone's face, just made them look like themselves. That was not the fashion.
''The look was very, very white skin with bright red lips, and painted, sculpted faces,'' she says. ''I could not do that kind of makeup. I thought people looked better with natural skin. Why would you change the color of someone's skin?''
In 1988, at dinner with a friend at Raoul's, in SoHo, she met Steven Plofker, a real estate developer. ''I looked at him, he looked at me, and by the end of the night I knew I was going to marry him,'' she says. Asked to recall his first impression, Plofker says, ''Impression implies there was conscious thought, and it was on a much more emotional level.''
They were engaged within three months and moved to Montclair, which he'd described as a ''cool little town,'' right after their honeymoon. ''I said we're not buying the first house,'' Bobbi says. ''We bought the first house. He's a developer. I was so lonely, we got a dog, and by our first anniversary I got pregnant.''
Contrary to the rules of success, they have stayed in Montclair ever since. ''I love New York. I don't love that New York thing,'' she says. ''My husband taught me I don't have to be part of it. I remember one time when I really had to make a decision. It was early in my career, and it was Yom Kippur, and I felt guilty doing a cover for Cosmopolitan with Francesco Scavullo on Yom Kippur. My husband and my young child were coming into the city to get me for dinner. Scavullo said, 'Why don't you come out to dinner with me and Jean Paul Gaultier?' And then my husband walked in. I'll never forget: he was wearing a blue striped shirt, vertical stripes, and Jean Paul Gaultier was wearing his blue and white striped sweater, horizontal stripes -- and I stood there saying, 'Bobbi, pick a door, because you can't do both.' And I picked my husband and the kid -- and that was good. As happy as I was to be working with Scavullo, that was not my life.''
She still doesn't fast on Yom Kippur. ''My husband fasts and hikes on Yom Kippur without trail mix, and then he comes home and sits in a chair until I can give him some orange juice at 5 o'clock,'' she says. The Plofkers give a break the fast party for 100 people that night. ''How can you set out food and do everything you're supposed to do if you're fasting?'' The guest list is her hit parade of real people, close friends and New Jersey neighbors: Stephen Colbert; Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark; and Yogi Berra. ''Yogi Berra,'' she says with pride, ''uses, and is obsessed with, my face cream and my eye cream. Every time I see him, he wants more. I say, 'Yogi, you have enough.' He goes into the locker room and he's telling everybody about skin care and suddenly we're getting all these calls -- Derek Jeter wants some, all these guys want some. So we called our clear lip balm Yogi Bare.''
The lipstick began as a conversation Bobbi had with a chemist at Kiehl's during a shoot for Mademoiselle. By the time Dylan was born, it was ready to go, from their first house in Montclair. In 1995, Leonard Lauder told Bobbi, ''You're beating us in the stores'' and offered to buy the company with the assurance that she could do anything and be totally creative. Lauder has kept his word.
Bobbi Brown's company is said to represent a bit under 10 percent of total Estee Lauder sales. There are 40 stores, over 1,000 store counters and 3,100 makeup artists around the world. It is, in the words of its president Maureen Case, ''a big small brand or a small big brand. We can make a decision in two minutes and make it happen.'' As for the current economic climate, she quotes the line ''Never waste a good recession.''
After a few years in the G.M. building with Estee Lauder, Bobbi Brown's headquarters moved to the same SoHo building where Prada and Interview magazine are located. There are slate floors in the foyer and old metal desks, tables and chairs in the offices that have the same scarred charm as the stuff in her Montclair studio. You sense personality at work; the brand is built to match the character of one woman who celebrates the individuality of many women, and it's not always easy.
The mug Bobbi Brown carries into the Tuesday ''heads of state'' meeting carries an expression that is unprintable here. An executive coach named Marcie Elias watches the meeting with care. Last year, apparently, there was some degree of contention; people moved around and up and out. In exchange for the maintenance of creative control that Bobbi demanded, Elias was brought in ''so I could be a more successful leader,'' Bobbi says. ''I guess I was a little more salty.''
Maureen Case adds: ''We both have had some lessons from Marcie that helped -- just in communicating with people. What people don't realize is she's Bobbi; her nuance can be interpreted so many different ways, and we want to keep the team motivated.''
Mickey Drexler, the man who reinvented the J. Crew brand as a provider of well-cut clothes, met Bobbi at an Obama fund-raiser at Jon Bon Jovi's house. He appreciates their similarities: ''We are both very product-centric, contrarian, purely instinctive. She's a terrible corporate executive, and I say that as a compliment. She's about her product and her customers. She's not great at dealing in bureaucracy, at doing things like normal executives do.''
She doesn't do things like normal richpeople, either. The Plofkers made a brief foray into the Hamptons, bought a house on West End Road in 1999, named a skiff TYLL for Thank You Leonard Lauder and soon chose to summer on the Jersey Shore instead. They bought the 1910 Craftsman house in Montclair in 2001. It had been built by the original Mr. Funk of Funk & Wagnalls ''for his teenage bride,'' says Bobbi, who adds, ''Everything you are looking at is brand new. There is nothing old here.''
They moved in while it was being redone in early September 2001. After she was stranded in Manhattan on 9/11, she walked up through Harlem to the George Washington Bridge and waited for a car to take her across the Hudson back home to Montclair. ''It took me a long time after that to be able to feel comfortable in New York and on airplanes,'' she says. ''It's immigrant resilience -- you just get on with it and do what you got to do. My grandmother came here at 2 from Yugoslavia, and my grandfather came from Russia at 6 or 8 by himself, lived with different people, was selling newspapers on the street and ended up with a car dealership in Chicago.''
Montclair is about 15 minutes from Manhattan in midmorning. It has a pond, wooden houses, front lawns, brick shops. An air of storybook authenticity covers the rich and the poor areas and strikes a European eye as wildly exotic. Americana! Sleeping porches! A bookstore with Alice Waters's big red book! A yoga studio . . . a hairdresser . . . a dry cleaner or two . . . Whole Foods. Phew. Livable. Steven Plofker owns the soccer bubble and the building that houses his wife's studio, which is an office, a shop and an improvised school. A long makeup counter the exact height of a bar stands in front of shelves that could hold liquor in a nanosecond. Bottles of Bobbi Brown scents are on the counter. One smells like Ivory soap, another like Coppertone, a third like my school friend Jane Gozzett's favorite, Je Reviens.
The place, designed by Plofker, has a playful, steampunk, postindustrial scrubbed steel and brick look. ''We get bored very quickly,'' says Plofker, who is now an attorney as well as a developer. His office upstairs looks like a little law office in a Frank Capra movie. ''The new things are always the favorites.''
Bobbi Brown's office is downstairs. She has a table made out of the door to a submarine and an old, half-full traveling case that belonged to the man who made up Frank Sinatra. ''I love old funky things,'' she says. ''Color just makes me happy, and things all lined up.'' Case in point: a full box of hundreds of unused colored pencils lifted from her creative director's desk. On a bookshelf, a tome called ''50 Things to Do When You Turn Fifty'' has this contribution from Bobbi: Stop obsessing about your flaws.
Her office faces a big space, where seven antique banquet tables are assembled as if in a library reading room; this is where Girl Scouts get empowered or a local woman will have her 50th birthday party. Snacks are set out as in SoHo: carrots, celery, almonds, hummus, dark chocolate. One of the tables is from a Danish schoolhouse; most of the initials cut into it are Ks.
She proceeds to make me up. Before she starts, she sprays her hands with a peppermint cleanser; remarkably for someone who is herself a brand, it's not something she makes. It's from Whole Foods. Once the long brush is in her hand, she holds it straight, like a painter, and her hand relaxes around it. Brush and hand seem to take over. She's been doing this for 30 years. Practice shows. I come out looking considerably better.
The New Jersey afternoon comes to an end. Once Duke and the two exchange students, Alessandro and Amedeo, are home from school, Bobbi and Steven will take them into the city to see the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center, stop off at Uniqlo and celebrate Amedeo's birthday with dinner at the Harvard Club. Sightseeing, shopping and dinner in the city.

HEADLINE: New Cars That Pass the Pump as They Celebrate the Socket

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
IT has been a rotten few months for electric cars. Less than a year ago, E.V.'s and plug-in hybrids seemed ready for a mass takeoff, with the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Volt leading the charge down the runway.
But early sales have been disappointing, causing some analysts to express caution. Are plug-in cars establishing a foothold? Or might they be done in by familiar factors: high prices, short range, long charging times, plentiful gasoline and consumer resistance?
In December, J. P. Morgan sharply downgraded its electric-adoption forecast, projecting that plug-in models would take just 4.5 percent of the global market by 2025, down from the previous estimate of 8.6 percent.
The Volt's reputation was dinged by a federal investigation into the potential for battery fires. That inquiry concluded that the plug-in hybrid was no more fire-prone than a gas-powered car. 
And in this election year, Republicans have assailed electric cars, making them a stand-in for President Obama's stimulus spending, energy policies, auto-industry aid and loans for plug-in makers including Ford, General Motors and Nissan.
House Republicans accused federal safety officials of trying to whitewash a Volt battery fire -- which occurred weeks after the car was crash-tested -- to protect the government's investment in G.M. Called before Congress, G.M.'s chairman, Daniel F. Akerson, defended the Chevy's safety and lamented the Volt's new role as ''a political punching bag.''
Fisker laid off 66 workers in California and Delaware after missing development and sales targets for its Karma plug-in luxury car that were conditions of its $529 million Energy Department loan.
But none of the bad news is stopping automakers, from big, bullish Nissan to tiny underdogs like Coda, from sticking electric motors into cars.
Americans bought 19,874 plug-in cars in 2011, according to LMC Automotive. But the research firm expects the number to surge to roughly 70,000 this year, to nearly 170,000 in 2013 and to a healthy 250,000 by 2015, representing a significant 1.5 percent of a 16.5 million vehicle market.
About a dozen new plug-in models are scheduled to reach showrooms this year, and another dozen in 2013. Most new models adopt a standardized plug that delivers stronger 240-volt current, filling the batteries in three to eight hours -- though models can also charge on a standard household outlet, which can take up to 24 hours.
Both companies and the government continue to place billion-dollar bets on electricity as the best available technology to curb pollution and reduce dependence on foreign oil. Mr. Obama's latest budget calls for raising federal tax breaks for plug-in buyers to $10,000, from $7,500, a measure that would cost taxpayers up to $100 million for every 10,000 cars sold.
With models like the Karma priced at $100,000, some of tax breaks will go to the wealthy. Even ''affordable'' E.V.'s like the Ford Focus Electric are priced around $40,000, a huge premium over conventional high-mileage cars.
Whether or not plug-ins become common, some intriguing vehicles will arrive in the next two years. Here are some models to keep an eye on:
AMP This Ohio company plans to yank the powertrains from Jeep Grand Cherokees and Mercedes M-Class S.U.V.'s and replace them with batteries and electric motors, good for a 100-mile range. Set for this fall, Amp's Jeep and Mercedes E.V.'s start around $58,000 and $80,000 respectively. That's about $25,000 more than gas-powered versions.
AUDI An electrified version of the R8 sports car, featured in the ''Iron Man'' movies, the E-tron is to go into production late this year and will have four electric motors, one at each wheel. With power from a big 53-kilowatt-hour battery, a prototype developed 313 horsepower and 502 pound-feet of torque. Expect a price well into six figures.
BMWThe ActiveE, an all-electric version of the 1 Series coupe that is being leased to 700 American customers, is serving as a testbed for BMW's first full-production electric car, the i3.
A city car with a body of lightweight carbon fiber, the i3 is to reach dealerships in late 2013 and early 2014. It will first be offered as a pure E.V., with a plug-in hybrid version to follow.
Then, in 2014, BMW will offer Hollywood celebrity bait with the futuristic i8 plug-in hybrid, which has already had a supporting role in ''Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol.'' A turbo 1.5-liter 3-cylinder will drive the i8's rear wheels and a 130-horse electric motor will propel the front wheels, for a total of 350 horsepower.
CADILLAC To arrive next winter, the eye-catching front-drive ELR adopts the hybrid approach of the Chevy Volt, covering short distances on battery power, then switching to a gas engine to generate electricity and extend the range. The four-seat ELR will have front-wheel drive, not the sportier rear-drive layout of the CTS and ATS sedans.
CODA This Los Angeles-based underdog plans an international approach: importing partly built Hafai Saibo sedans from China, then installing batteries and electronics in Northern California. For prices of $38,145 or $40,795, buyers will get a car with a range of 125 or 150 miles. Coda hopes to roll out its first cars in California in the spring.
DOK-ING Though a long shot for American showrooms, the XD, a Croatian-built cutie with gullwing doors and an unusual three-passenger layout, was a hit at the Los Angeles auto show in November. The XD has four electric motors delivering speedy acceleration.
FIAT Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of Fiat and Chrysler, complained last year that Fiat would lose $10,000 on every E.V. it sold. Still, Chrysler is engineering the Fiat 500 EV for limited production this year, at a price that may approach $40,000.
FISKER After long delays, the $103,000 Karma plug-in hybrid is slowly reaching customers from the factory in Finland where it is assembled. The California start-up says its voluptuous sedan can cover 300 miles, the first 50 on battery power. The Karma can reach 60 m.p.h. in less than six seconds, with a boost from a G.M.-sourced 4-cylinder gas engine.
FORD Three plug-in cars are coming from Dearborn this year. The Focus Electric goes on sale next month in California, New York and New Jersey, with distribution spreading to 15 additional markets by year-end. The car's trump card is a powerful 6.6-kilowatt onboard charger, giving the 123-horsepower Ford a full charge in four hours, about half the time of the current Nissan Leaf. But the $39,995 base price is $4,000 more than the Nissan's, which has a similar 100-mile range.
The Ford C-Max people mover will be offered as both a conventional hybrid and, this fall, as a plug-in version called the Energi. A 2-liter gas engine and electric motor supply 185 horsepower, with recharging in as little as 3.5 hours. Ford says the C-Max Energi will beat the Volt's gasoline equivalent rating of 93 m.p.g.e. and have a total driving range of 500 miles.
Finally, Ford plans to sell an Energi plug-in hybrid version of its 2013 Fusion alongside the gasoline and hybrid models, starting next winter. Ford says the handsome sedan will deliver up to 100 m.p.g.e.
HONDA An electric version of the Fit hatchback arrives this summer, though just 1,100 will be available, strictly on the West and East coasts, with a $399 monthly lease. The Fit adopts the 123-horsepower electric motor from the FCX Clarity hydrogen fuel-cell car; a 20-kilowatt-hour battery will provide roughly 75 miles of range.
And in fall 2013, Honda will offer an advanced plug-in hybrid system on its next-generation Accord. A 2-liter Atkinson cycle engine will join two electric motors, one to charge the battery and one to propel the car. The plug-in Accord is said to be capable of traveling 10 to 15 miles on electricity at up to 62 m.p.h., or to blend gas and electric power.
INFINITI To be unveiled at the Geneva auto show next month, Infiniti's two-seat rear-drive sports car will combine electric power with a midmounted 1.3-liter gas engine. The car adopts the Chevy Volt's extended-range format rather than the all-electric approach championed by Nissan.
MERCEDES-BENZ Like other electric supercars, the gullwing SLS AMG E-Cell could pluck the consciences and wallets of the rich when it comes to market, possibly in 2013, with a projected price of $200,000. The E-Cell would crank out 526 horsepower through four 12,000-r.p.m. electric motors; its projected top speed of 155 m.p.h. could set a production E.V. record.
MITSUBISHI Mitsubishi's tiny four-seat ''i'' city car is the E.P.A.'s new fuel-economy champ, rated at the gasoline equivalent of 126 m.p.g.e. on the highway and 99 in town. It is also, at about $30,000, the most affordable highway-capable electric car. With 63 horsepower, the ''i'' is slow and somewhat crude, with a range of 62 miles. On sale now in the West, the car migrates to the Northeast in April.
PORSCHE A jaw-dropper for its design and its $845,000 price, the 918 Spyder hybrid promises a top speed of 198 m.p.h., fuel economy exceeding 70 m.p.g. and lower carbon emissions than a Prius. Between its race-bred V-8 and electric motors, the plug-in Porsche will kick out roughly 730 horsepower and is said to be capable of 0-to-60 m.p.h. acceleration in just 3.2 seconds, yet travel up to 25 miles on electricity. The showroom version will be unveiled in Frankfurt in 2013.
SMART ELECTRIC DRIVE This electric version of the tiny Smart car can be leased with an eye-popping monthly payment of $599. Unfortunately, the car may be even more distressing to drive than the gas version. It provides scant performance, a 60 m.p.h. top speed and a 60-mile range.
TESLA Tesla is seeking to justify its federal loans with the Model S, a striking electric sport sedan that claims unmatched range of 160 to 300 miles, depending on the battery. Tesla offers 40-, 60- and 85-kilowatt-hour versions from $57,400 to $105,400. The power-packed version offers an unlimited battery warranty and 0-to-60 m.p.h. acceleration of 4.4 seconds. Deliveries are to start later this year.
TOYOTA For $32,760 to start, the new Prius plug-in hybrid can travel just 15 miles on battery juice alone -- one-third the Volt's range -- but it can top 50 m.p.g. when its gas engine comes into play, beating the Chevy. A similar version of the Prius V wagon arrives this fall.
Toyota will also start production in Ontario late this year of the RAV4 EV, whose electric powertrain was developed by Tesla at a cost to Toyota of $100 million.

HEADLINE: On Active Duty For the Movies (Real Ammo)

BYLINE: By JOHN ANDERSON

 BODY:
THE audience crowding into a recent Manhattan preview of the war-on-terror movie ''Act of Valor'' might have been described as ecumenical. Police officers. Firefighters. Sanitation workers. Army. Air Force. And the Navy, home of the Sea, Air and Land Teams known as the Seals, the ''silent warriors'' who engage in hostage rescue, counterterrorism and others forms of unconventional, clandestine warfare.
Or, on this particular night, starring in a major motion picture.
''We've never had a film where the principals were active-duty Seals,'' said Bob Anderson, director of the Navy's Office of Operations West, in Los Angeles, the liaison between the Navy and Hollywood. Or, for that matter, he added, a movie that used live ammunition in battle scenes. 
The relationship between Hollywood and the military is a long one; the winner of the first Academy Award for best picture, ''Wings,'' was made with military assistance. Later much of the Pentagon's interest in mainstream entertainment concerned children-focused television. ''Lassie'' and ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' were among early shows that had official input, especially when they dealt with emerging technology. But by the end of the 1970s Vietnam and its aftermath cooled public affection for military themes until the Reagan years, when there was a jump in requests for military cooperation in the making of movies, TV and home videos. This led to Pentagon-Hollywood collaborations like ''Red Dawn'' and ''Top Gun'' (and the coming ''Top Gun 2'').
Filmmakers today still tend to shun official help, preferring to consult former soldiers. Critics have raised the specter of a military so interested in burnishing its image that it strong-arms studios. Jerry Bruckheimer went his own way with ''Crimson Tide'' because the Navy proved allergic to a story line about mutiny.
But now the military needs Hollywood's help again. After a decade of war and with the economy shaky, the services are seeking to remold themselves into a leaner, less-expensive force made up of soldiers capable of special-operations missions involving cyberspace and intelligence. How better to attract those elite fighters than with a film about an elite force? Hence ''Act of Valor,'' which is opening Friday. It actually originated with the Navy, in 2006.
Rear Adm. Denny Moynihan, of the Navy Office of Information in Washington, explained that every four years the Defense Department ''looks at itself and says, 'What is it that you need to be moving forward, and where do you think you are?' '' He added, ''For the Navy and the Seal community it was, 'Hey, you need 500 more Seals' and that launched a series of initiatives to try to attract more people. This film was one of those initiatives.''
Directed by Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh, who under the Bandito Brothers banner have specialized in producing high-speed sports documentaries, ''Act of Valor'' follows a Seals team as it rescues an undercover agent in the Philippines and stumbles on a plan to bring widespread terror to the United States. Bandito Brothers, new to features, was chosen over several other applicants after the Navy issued a request for proposals.
''I think they were fans of our previous films, 'Step Into Liquid' and 'Dust to Glory,' and the fact that Scott and myself were former stuntmen,'' Mr. McCoy said.
''Let me be clear,'' Admiral Moynihan said, '' 'Act of Valor' did not follow the normal Department of Defense approval process for making motion pictures.'' Ordinarily that process involves a film company or studio proposing a project to a service branch, accommodating any requested script changes and paying for services rendered. As Mr. Anderson put it, ''There's a price list for everything.'' For the 2001 thriller ''Behind Enemy Lines,'' he recalled, missions to order were flown at a cost of $5,400 an hour.
Recent events, like the killing of Osama bin Laden and the January hostage rescue in Somalia, have dramatically raised the public profile of the Seals. For the members involved, recruitment was not the main motive to take part in ''Act of Valor.''
''There's quite a bit of misinformation in the way movies usually represent us,'' said Capt. Duncan Smith, who is in the film and served as a kind of line producer, wrangling equipment (in this case a submarine) and even shooting some underwater footage. ''You never see a special ops change the magazine in his rifle, or use a gun sight, or carry a pack, or drink water. They talk in hushed tones, where we would use hand signals. So these tactics in the film did us proud.'' The film was shot during actual training sessions; the plot is based on real exploits, Lt. Cmdr. Rorke Denver, one of the film's two principal members of the Seals, said at the screening. ''Any Seal who sees it will recognize that this was that person, and that was this person.''
There really was a member of the Seals shot 27 times, said Captain Smith, who was also in New York. ''There really was a Seal who dove on a grenade and was recognized for it. Mark Robbins, a gentlemen who's now a police officer, was shot through the eye,'' which happens in the film. ''Those and other stories are a testament to those guys who didn't necessarily leave the battlefield in one piece.''
The film cost the taxpayers nothing, Mr. Anderson emphasized. It was financed independently and made collaboratively. Although there was a script, the service members essentially played themselves. ''You weren't really talking to the actor about the character,'' Mr. Waugh said. ''You were talking to the character. The character would say, 'I wouldn't say that,' and you can't argue with him. He's the character.''
While they may provide authenticity, the Seals also present challenges to those used to working under more traditional circumstances. For their fellow actors, there was, for instance, an immersion in a novel kind of Method acting. In one memorable scene a Seal member known only as Senior Chief interrogates a Russian arms smuggler played by Alex Veadov.
''He had just gotten back from Afghanistan,'' Mr. Veadov said of Senior Chief. ''At first it was O.K. As it progressed a little, and he starts throwing things around, it kind of became a little tense.
''When he started speaking Croatian, though, it became freaky. I don't speak Croatian, but he must have looked me up on the Internet. I had done a play with a Croatian company. So he did research on me as an actor. And I was little bit intimidated. After all, this is what this guy does for a living.''

HEADLINE: The End of American Intervention

BYLINE: By JAMES TRAUB. 
A columnist at foreignpolicy.com, a fellow at the Center on International Cooperation and the author of ''The Freedom Agenda.''

 BODY:
FOR the last 20 years we have lived amid the furious clangor of war -- and debates over how to wage it. The intense and urgent clashes in the 1990s over ''humanitarian intervention'' gave way to pitched battles over ''regime change'' and ''democracy promotion'' after 9/11, and then to arguments over ''counterinsurgency strategy,'' a new battle for hearts and minds, as Barack Obama ramped up the war in Afghanistan.
The foreign policy debate has often felt like an ideological cockfight. And now, although we have not yet realized it, that era has come to an end.
For proof, you need look no further than the Pentagon's new ''strategic guidance'' document, issued last month in the wake of Mr. Obama's pledge to cut $485 billion from the defense budget over the coming decade. It repeats many of the core objectives of recent American national security strategy: defeat Al Qaeda, deter traditional aggressors, counter the threat from unconventional weapons. 
But it also states, ''In the aftermath of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States will emphasize nonmilitary means and military-to-military cooperation to address instability and reduce the demand for significant U.S. force commitments to stability operations.'' It goes on to note that ''U.S. forces will no longer be sized to conduct large-scale, prolonged stability operations.''
With this paragraph military planners signaled an abrupt end to the post-9/11 era of intervention. Only a few years ago the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- wars of occupation, nation-building and counterinsurgency -- looked like the face of modern conflict. Now they don't. Americans don't believe in them and can't afford them anymore.
The strategic guidance hit one other very new note: While American forces will continue to maintain a significant presence in the Middle East, the planners wrote, ''We will of necessity rebalance towards the Asia-Pacific region.'' This is bureaucratic code for ''we will stand up to China,'' which, the Obama administration has concluded, has superseded Al Qaeda as the chief future threat to American national security.
To say this is not merely to assert that one region has taken precedence over another but that the traditional threat of the expansionist state has supplanted the threat of the stateless actor that emerged after 9/11. Of course, global problems like climate change, epidemic disease, nuclear proliferation and terrorism won't go away. But in matters of war and peace, we seem to be returning to a more familiar world in which great powers maneuver for advantage.
We left that world behind, or so we thought, with the end of the cold war, which deprived America of its traditional enemy and thus raised the question of whether and when we would resort to force.
The answer came in the mid-1990s, when the Clinton administration felt compelled to respond to political chaos in Haiti and mass violence in the Balkans. Force could be used in the pursuit of justice. During the 2000 election campaign, George W. Bush vowed to put an end to these moralistic enterprises and to focus instead on great-power relations.
But 9/11 turned those plans upside down. Indeed, the Bush administration's 2002 national security strategy asserted that ''America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones.'' Mr. Bush, far more than Mr. Clinton, yoked the use of force to a transcendent principle, insisting that America ''must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere.''
Those were fighting words, and not just abroad. The debate over the war in Iraq revived many of the old debates from the Clinton era. Liberal internationalists like the British prime minister, Tony Blair, joined American neoconservatives like William Kristol and Robert Kagan in arguing for the use of force to bring about transformative political change, while ''realists'' on the left and right warned of the danger of reckless adventures.
The era we have now entered will be a less ideologically charged one. The questions raised by China's growing ambitions are categorically different from those provoked by 9/11. China is an emerging power, and once having found their footing, emerging powers usually seek to expand at the expense of their neighbors.
The world is accustomed to dealing with this kind of problem, which involves persuading the bumptious power that its interests lie in cooperation rather than in confrontation. And there is a fair amount of consensus in policy circles about how to deal with it. Conservatives have been sounding alarms about China's military ambitions for several years, and the Obama administration has now begun to execute a ''pivot'' to Asia. On a visit to the region, President Obama announced that America would station 2,500 Marines in Australia, even as it decreased military commitments elsewhere.
WHATEVER policy the Obama administration or its successor adopts toward China, the broader East Asian region, unlike the Middle East, is filled with stable, and largely democratic, states. The United States does not have to defend liberty and justice there. Regime change, democracy promotion and nation-building will be off the table. So, for that matter, will war.
America is not about to go to war with China, or with anyone else in Asia. The struggle to balance Chinese ambition will be left mostly to the Navy and Air Force, and our allies in the region. And it will not be a metaphysical one: the very complicated relationship with China is much less a clash of worldviews than of interests.
Finally, there is the elemental fact that America can no longer afford its own ambitions. The failure of last year's bipartisan effort to solve the deficit crisis triggered automatic cuts that are supposed to double the half-trillion dollars already scheduled to be sliced from the Pentagon budget.
In his 2010 book, ''The Frugal Superpower,'' Michael Mandelbaum argued that the contraction of the American economy meant that ''the defining fact of foreign policy in the second decade of the 21st century and beyond will be 'less.' '' Mr. Mandelbaum, himself a leading realist, suggested that the chief victim of the new austerity will be ''intervention.''
It may be so, though the NATO air campaign in Libya shows that humanitarian intervention is neither defunct nor doomed to failure. Such ventures, however, will be very rare, as the current stalemate over Syria implies. The coming years may well be a period of at least relative austerity, modesty and realism. Should we feel relieved?
It is easy enough to say that the United States should no longer fight wars of occupation in the Middle East, or seek to promote democracy through regime change, or undertake counterinsurgency campaigns on a massive scale. But in a world of weak and failing states, are we also to abandon ambitious hopes to help build stable and democratic institutions abroad? Is foreign aid to wind up on the junk heap of failed dreams?
America has been and can continue to be a force for good in the world. But those of us who have championed an idealistic foreign policy have been deeply chastened by the failure of so many fine hopes and have been forced to recognize both how much harm the United States can do with the best of intentions and how very hard it is to shape good outcomes inside other countries. So we must accept, if uneasily, the future which now seems to lie before us: We will do less good in the world, but also less harm.

HEADLINE: Beginning of the End

 BODY:
Like most Americans, we are eager to see an end to the war in Afghanistan. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's announcement that American forces would step back from a combat role as early as mid-2013 was welcome.
The Pentagon's intention is to try to shift more responsibility to the Afghan security forces while the Americans are still in the country to provide help with planning, transport and intelligence, and to bail the Afghans out in a crisis. That shift is already happening in less volatile regions. And with the United States and NATO committed to bringing nearly all of their troops home by the end of 2014, the Afghans need to learn to take the lead.
If there is any chance of pulling this off, the United States must improve the quality of the Afghan army and police and strengthen central and local governments. We have yet to see a comprehensive plan for an orderly transition.
More than 1,700 Americans have been killed in Afghanistan over the last decade, and the financial cost for this country, more than $450 billion, is staggering. It did not have to be this way. In order to pursue his misguided war in Iraq, President George W. Bush denied his commanders in Afghanistan the necessary troops and support. 
President Obama has done better. He poured more resources into training the Afghan army and police, and a ''surge'' of an additional 50,000 American troops has weakened the Taliban's fighting forces. Stepped-up intelligence efforts have led to the deaths of Osama bin Laden and scores of Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders. The Taliban have recently said they want to talk.
Whether these gains can be maintained is far from clear. What is certain is that there is little time and a huge amount to be done to increase the chances that Afghanistan will not implode once most of the American troops are gone. Here are some areas that must be addressed:
GOVERNANCE There have been some improvements at the federal and regional levels, but the country -- hampered by illiteracy and corruption -- still lacks a fully functioning government and banking system. After spending huge sums on failed development projects, the State Department is working to better focus and design how it spends these critical dollars. It needs to move quickly.
Since Mr. Obama put in a new diplomatic and military team, public clashes with President Hamid Karzai have declined. But serious frictions remain. Washington and its allies must work harder to get Mr. Karzai to carry out reforms that will encourage credible candidates to run in 2014, when he is supposed to step aside. He must be pressed to take on high-profile corruption cases. He and his ministers need to focus a lot more attention on improving basic services, including the delivery of electricity. To attract foreign investors, Parliament needs to approve a solid legal framework for commercial relations.
TRAINING AND FINANCING AFGHAN FORCES The United States and its allies have spent tens of billions of dollars building an Afghan army and police force from the ground up. They have turned out 330,000 troops, but because of illiteracy, conflicting political loyalties and other problems, there are far too few reliable units.
NATO and the Pentagon are now talking about reducing the Afghan force to 230,000. We don't know if that is a sound assessment of what is needed or an acknowledgement that Afghanistan and its backers cannot afford to maintain such a large force. The United States will spend $11 billion this year on the 330,000 troops; the cost is expected to drop to around $4 billion annually if the number of troops is reduced and American involvement lessens.
Weeding out less competent soldiers, or corrupt ones, makes sense. But putting tens of thousands of fighters back on the streets could be disastrous. One possible solution would be to shift them to a less costly reserve force.
Afghanistan will not be able to foot the bill for even a smaller force, and Washington will very likely bear most of the cost for years to come. It should not have to do that alone. The Obama administration should use the NATO summit meeting in Chicago in May to press allies to make concrete commitments now. And then hold them to it.
TALKING TO THE TALIBAN Most of the Republican presidential candidates insist the United States must ''beat'' the Taliban. That sounds good on the stump, but American military commanders say it is impossible now: it would take too many troops, too many years. The best hope is for some kind of political solution.
The Taliban have signaled what they say is a serious interest in negotiations; whether they mean it is anyone's guess. Still, the administration is right to try. At a minimum, the fact that the Taliban leadership is talking will make more fighters on the ground -- and those tempted to join them -- question whether the battle is worth it.
The United States has laid down several principles for a settlement: The Taliban must renounce terrorism, cut all ties with Al Qaeda and eventually lay down their weapons and accept the Afghan Constitution -- including rights for women. Both Washington and the Afghan government must stick to those principles.
American officials say they are open to a Taliban request for some ''confidence-building measures,'' including transferring a small number of prisoners from Guantanamo to house arrest in Qatar and lifting some sanctions on individual Taliban negotiators. In return, the Americans must, at a minimum, get assurances that the prisoners will not return to the battlefield, and that the Taliban will renounce terrorism and seriously engage in peace talks.
ECONOMIC SUPPORT Paying for the army is not the only financial problem. Afghanistan faces a potentially devastating economic slowdown when American and coalition troops and aid workers depart. The World Bank estimates that an extraordinary 97 percent of the country's $28 billion gross domestic product comes from military and development aid and the in-country spending of foreign troops.
At a conference in Bonn, Germany, last year, President Karzai requested $10 billion a year in foreign support through 2025. The United States and its partners promised to help. Vague promises are not enough. Housing prices, salaries, store sales and factory orders are already dropping as coalition troops and aid workers prepare to withdraw. The allies need to have a concrete plan -- a mix of aid and investment in the minerals industry and other private projects -- in place in time for the NATO meeting.
RESIDUAL AMERICAN FORCE Defense Secretary Panetta told Congress last week that the United States was close to signing an agreement with Mr. Karzai to allow an undefined number (perhaps 15,000) Special Operations soldiers to remain after 2014. These forces would hunt down militants, and would provide air cover, intelligence, logistical support and training for Afghan forces.
We would like to see all American troops gone. But continuing to pound Al Qaeda, and increasing the odds that the Taliban do not again seize power, are in Washington's strategic interest. The agreement would also send a message to the region that this time the United States plans to stay engaged. Two issues are blocking the deal: Mr. Karzai's demand to immediately take control of American-run detention facilities and of nighttime raids that he says have killed too many civilians. The United States should keep insisting that Afghans can take over the raids only when they are capable. The detention facilities should be shut down.
DEALING WITH PAKISTANIslamabad's continued collusion with the Taliban and other extremist groups is the biggest threat to Afghanistan's long-term stability. A decade after the Bush administration ordered them to pick sides, the Pakistanis are still cynically playing all sides.
Billions in aid have not changed their thinking. Nor has the recent suspension of some of that aid. Nor has the fact that the extremists seem nearly as eager to bring down Pakistan's government. The Army and intelligence services are still determined to use the extremists as proxies in their endless competition with India.
The fact that Pakistan did not stop the Taliban from agreeing to negotiations with Washington may be a rare positive sign. But with Islamabad there are never any guarantees. As frustrating as it is, the administration must keep trying to cajole and pressure Pakistan into cooperating. The United States really has no choice, not least because a collapse in Pakistan -- with 100 plus nuclear weapons -- would be even more disastrous than a collapse in Kabul.

HEADLINE: Ford's Mr. Inside, In Sight of the Crown

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
MARK FIELDS should be feeling pretty good right about now.
The Ford Motor Company, his employer for the last 23 years, is in the midst of a remarkable turnaround. Since the American auto industry's big wreck in 2008, Ford has reported 10 consecutive profitable quarters. And Ford, the only one of Detroit's Big Three that wasn't bailed out by taxpayers, has steadily gained market share with each new product it has introduced. To top it off, the biggest contributor to this comeback, by far, is Mr. Fields's business unit, which encompasses all of Ford's manufacturing and sales in North and South America.
So why is Mr. Fields looking so tense on this morning in early February, as he convenes his weekly meeting of senior managers in a second-floor conference room at the company's sprawling Product Development Center here?
''We do have a lot to celebrate, and we have a wonderful opportunity to take the business to the next level,'' Mr. Fields said in an interview just before the meeting. ''The key is not getting -- and I hate this word -- complacent.'' 
That's certainly one answer. Another is that the top job at Ford now looks as if it's his to lose, and the pressure is on.
Mr. Fields is the odds-on favorite within Ford to succeed Alan R. Mulally as its chief executive. And with North America as the source of virtually all of Ford's profits for the foreseeable future, Mr. Fields is being pushed to deliver better margins, higher sales and the final validation that he is the best choice to take over when Mr. Mulally retires.
Succession issues at the Big Three grip Detroit like a presidential election. But speculation about Mr. Mulally's replacement is greater than at any time since Lee A. Iacocca headed toward retirement at Chrysler in the early 1990s.
''Complacent,'' the word Mr. Fields so despises, is not a description heard often today in Detroit. True, Ford and its crosstown rivals, General Motors and Chrysler, are again making money and increasing sales after their financial crises three years ago. But Mr. Fields doesn't forget how miserable Ford's prospects were when he became president of the Americas division in 2005, or the tens of thousands of jobs he had to cut to get its United States operations back on track.
So instead of opening his weekly management session that February morning with a glowing recap of Ford's $8.8 billion operating profit for 2011, he instead passed out a sheaf of news reports casting doubt on its future, including one headlined, ''Are Ford's Best Days Behind Them?''
And while Ford's global operating margins were a relatively healthy 6 percent in 2011, they fell far short of the 9 percent at rivals like Volkswagen and Hyundai. Among all automakers, Ford ranked only sixth in profits earned on each vehicle sold.
''No one wants to say, 'We're No. 6,' '' said Amit Singhi, the Americas division controller.
That's exactly the message that Mr. Fields wanted to drive home. With its international operations struggling, Ford urgently needs better margins from its core business in the United States to continue to grow. Its impressive recovery, he said, will mean little if results plateau now.
''All the hard work has gotten us to this point,'' he said. ''It's like we've gotten to base camp on Mount Everest, and now we have to climb the mountain.''
THAT could describe Mr. Fields's career path as well. At 51, he's no longer the wunderkind Harvard Business School graduate who was dispatched to save Mazda, Ford's Japanese affiliate, in 2000, was moved two years later to run Ford of Europe, and then was thrown into the fire as president of the faltering Americas unit.
''Mark is clearly the heir apparent unless he stumbles badly,'' said Joseph Phillippi, a former Wall Street analyst and principal in Auto Trends Consulting. ''He's proven himself to be a really good manager, but they are really in a dogfight to keep putting up the numbers in the U.S.''
Mr. Mulally, now 66, has been tight-lipped about his departure plans. This month, he made light of the question in announcing the retirements of Ford's chief financial officer, Lewis Booth, and product development chief, Derrick Kuzak. ''I have read the news release very carefully, and I do not find my name on it,'' Mr. Mulally told reporters.
In his time at Ford, Mr. Mulally has done what many thought impossible. Since arriving in 2006 after a long career at Boeing, he has shattered the myth that outsiders can't grasp the complexities of the auto business. His moves to cut underperforming brands and globalize products have transformed Ford from an industry laggard dependent on sales of big pickups and sport utility vehicles into a leader in producing technologically advanced fuel-efficient cars. In the process, he has changed a corporate culture known for executive infighting into one admired for cohesion and teamwork.
But the retirements of Mr. Booth, 63, and Mr. Kuzak, 60, who have been instrumental in Ford's recovery, are the first signs of a changing of the guard. And while company insiders expect Mr. Mulally to stay on for at least another year or two, the spotlight is focusing on Mr. Fields.
Whereas Mr. Mulally was a huge unknown when he joined Ford, Mr. Fields is considered the consummate insider. Over the course of his career, he has been seen as a rising star who fixed Mazda and brought order to what was Ford's hodgepodge of European brands, as well as a lightning rod for criticism by the United Automobile Workers as the architect of drastic job cuts and plant closings before Mr. Mulally arrived.
During a wide-ranging interview, Mr. Fields frowns only when asked about his chances to run Ford after Mr. Mulally. ''Very simply, my ambition is just to contribute as much as I can to the profitable growth of Ford, and that means running the Americas,'' he said. ''Otherwise you get distracted. And I'm not going to allow that to happen.''
It's the politically correct response, and it underscores how crucial success in the American market is to Ford's progress. Its North American operations accounted for 70 percent of pretax profits last year, with Ford's automotive finance business contributing most of the rest.
By contrast, Ford lost money in Europe, where economic conditions have depressed the car market, and Asia, where it is investing heavily in new factories and products to catch up to rivals like G.M. and Toyota.
''Everything revolves around how Ford does in the U.S. for the time being,'' said David Whiston, an auto analyst at Morningstar, the investment firm.
MR. FIELDS got his start at Ford as a marketing manager for its Thunderbird car in 1989. Born in Brooklyn and raised in Paramus, N.J., he readily acknowledges that he is not a ''gearhead with oil running through my veins.'' But after getting his M.B.A., he chose a job offer from Ford over opportunities in investment banking because the scale and scope of the car business enthralled him. His decision baffled classmates who were headed to Wall Street.
''I felt it was really important to go to a company that made something,'' he said. ''I'd say I'm going to work for Ford, and they'd kind of look at me and say, 'So how many classes did you fail?' ''
With his New Jersey accent, tailored suits and, at the time, a sweptback mullet of dark hair, Mr. Fields stood out from the Ford crowd of conservatively dressed Midwestern engineers and finance types. But he quickly learned how to hold his own in a culture where executives fought openly for power and influence. ''You never said you needed help,'' he said. ''That was a sign of weakness.''
When William Clay Ford Jr., Ford's current chairman and then its C.E.O., summoned him from Europe to take over the Americas unit in 2005, Mr. Fields brashly suggested that he would deliver results faster if other corporate officers stayed out of his way. ''I was pretty straightforward with Bill,'' he said. ''Keep world headquarters out of our hair and let us put our plan together and implement it.''
Mr. Ford concurred, but Mr. Fields found out that his desire for autonomy also had a downside. Under his direction, Ford cut more than 40,000 jobs in the United States and closed some of its oldest assembly plants in the country. His calls for sacrifices among rank-and-file employees backfired when a local television station revealed that he was using Ford's private jets to fly back and forth to his family home in Florida.
He agreed to give up the jet trips, but the damage was done. ''He seemed like the slick operator who was too important to fly commercial,'' Mr. Phillippi said. And as Ford's losses grew in the United States, Mr. Fields became aware that some at the company were taking bets that he wouldn't last after Mr. Mulally's arrival.
''There was a 'dead pool' about me,'' Mr. Fields said. ''People were saying, 'When is Fields going to get shown the door?' ''
But, in fact, he has thrived under Mr. Mulally's inclusive management style. ''Mark has grown a lot since Alan came in,'' said one company executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on personnel matters. Mr. Fields has modeled his weekly management team meetings after Mr. Mulally's business-plan review sessions, and acknowledges that he needed to soften his strident style.
''What's important is that everybody is pulling together to solve issues and not score points,'' Mr. Fields said. ''At the end of the day it's all about the company and not about individual success. For a number of years it was exactly the opposite.''
At his recent team meeting, Mr. Fields opened the floor to subordinates about how to keep the vast North American organization of 20,000 salaried workers focused on incremental improvements in margins.
''People understand the strategy, but it's not hitting home,'' said Jim Tetreault, who runs manufacturing for North America. ''I don't think the benefits of our platform consolidation have resonated, and that's a story we need to tell better.''
Combining vehicle platforms to yield a wider variety of models saves Ford money, reduces complexity and improves quality. The so-called ''One Ford'' approach is the linchpin of Mr. Mulally's turnaround strategy, and an effort that has quickened Ford's product pace, giving Mr. Fields a steady supply of fresh new vehicles to sell in the intensely competitive American market.
MR. FIELDS walks a fine line between reminding employees how bad things were just a few years ago, and exhorting them to build on its more recent success. ''I would call it good confidence, not overconfidence,'' he said. ''It's great to have a bit of success as long as we don't inhale and keep ourselves really focused on what's going on in the marketplace.''
To improve margins, he has to keep a tight control on vehicle inventories, and successfully manage the introduction of products, particularly the revamped versions of two of Ford's biggest sellers, the midsize Fusion sedan and the Escape compact crossover. He has often traveled to oversee both the changeover of some assembly plants from larger vehicles to smaller ones, and the hiring of thousands of entry-level autoworkers. A slip-up in the production process could reduce profits -- and hurt his chances to succeed Mr. Mulally.
''Investors are pretty confident that if Mark is the guy, he won't screw anything up,'' said Mr. Whiston at Morningstar. ''It would be more troubling if Ford had to look outside the company for its next C.E.O.''
That seems unlikely, according to people in the company familiar with the succession deliberations being conducted by Mr. Mulally, Mr. Ford and the board. Several executives use the phrase ''it's his to lose'' when referring to Mr. Fields's opportunity to become the next C.E.O.
It's not always easy, Mr. Fields acknowledged, to be under such a microscope. But it has helped him appreciate the stability that Mr. Mulally has brought, and the need to sustain it. At the Detroit auto show last month, the wife of one employee sought out Mr. Fields to let him know just that.
''She said, 'I just want to thank you and the rest of Ford management for what you've done,' '' Mr. Fields recalled. ''It's those things that really bring it home for me. It's not about camaraderie, but the pressure not to let each other down.''

HEADLINE: Economics Made Easy: Think Friction

BYLINE: By BARRY SCHWARTZ. 
A professor of psychology at Swarthmore College and the author, with Kenneth Sharpe, of ''Practical Wisdom: The Right Way to Do the Right Thing.''

 BODY:
CRITICS of Mitt Romney's activities at Bain Capital have been described, somewhat hysterically, as critics of capitalism. They're not. But they are attacking something. And understanding that something can have enormous implications for the shape of our economic institutions and activities going forward.
What Bain Capital, and firms like it, do is try to increase the efficiency of the companies they buy. They try to get more with less -- to eliminate waste. They are not interested either in creating jobs or in destroying them. Nor are they interested in improving the lives of consumers by making products and services better and cheaper. They are interested in profit -- for themselves and their shareholders. Sometimes a Bain success will lead to more jobs and better products. Sometimes it will not. 
It may seem heartless to worship efficiency at any cost, including lost jobs and decimated communities, but it is important to understand that increased efficiency is the only way a society's standard of living will improve. If your company raises your pay without becoming more efficient, it will have to raise its prices in order to pay you. This is true of all companies. And if all companies raise their prices to allow for higher wages, you will end up just running in place, with your higher wages exactly matched by the higher prices of the things you buy. It is only if your company and others find a way to pay you more without charging more that your living standard goes up.
So if we want to make material progress, we must become more efficient. In addition, as markets have become ever more globalized, increased efficiency of American companies has become a condition for their very survival.
So firms compete to become more efficient, and we as consumers, along with Bain Capital and its like, benefit from this competition.
What stands in the way of efficiency is friction. When automobile manufacturers struggle to squeeze as many miles per gallon as possible out of their car designs, friction is the enemy. Their aim is to design a vehicle that uses every ounce of fuel to move the car forward.
And so it is in the world of finance. As the historian Niall Ferguson reminds us in his book ''The Ascent of Money,'' hard as it is to imagine, people didn't always have money. The invention of money went a long way toward reducing the friction, the inefficiency, in financial transactions. No longer did the farmer have to bring sacks of potatoes to the marketplace to trade for eggs and milk. Money was a medium of exchange that greatly reduced what some have called the financial coefficient of drag.
Arguably, much that has happened in the financial world over the last 200 years can be seen as a continuation of the revolution in efficiency begun by money. Credit, for example, meant that the farmer could go shopping for eggs and milk without even having the money. He could promise to pay it at a later date, after the potato harvest. Nor did the farmer need to save up the surplus from many years of bumper crops before buying more land. It was possible to get the land now with credit, and pay for it over time, in part with the proceeds from newly cultivated acres.
Much more recently, financial markets have been all about efficiency. This is one way to understand the oft-cited distinction between the ''real economy'' and the ''financial economy.'' Like point masses moving in frictionless, Newtonian vacuums, financial transactions are so far removed from the material entities that underlay them that transactions can occur with lightning speed, with nothing to slow them down. The creation of option markets means that you don't have to go to the trouble of actually buying a stock that you are going to be selling soon anyway. You can just promise to buy it and then sell it at a price and date specified by the option contract. And then you can trade the option rather than the underlying stock.
And bundling mortgages into securities reduces the time-consuming, unproductive friction involved in checking the creditworthiness of each mortgage applicant. You can just let the mortgages of the many work to indemnify the defaults of the few.
Similarly, credit card interest rates of 20 percent or more eliminate the need for credit card companies to spend time unproductively checking the credit of applicants. High interest rates more than cover the occasional delinquent. Home-equity lines of credit mean that homeowners can borrow a big pile of money (or have the potential to borrow a big pile of money) and have it at the ready, even when there is no pressing need. Instead of having to go through red tape to get a loan when your kitchen pipes burst, or your car engine dies, you can just write a check.
Each of these developments has made it easier to do one's business without wasted time and energy -- without friction. Each has made economic transactions quicker and more efficient. That's obviously good, and that's what Bain Capital tries to do in the companies it buys. You may employ a lazy brother-in-law who is not earning his keep. If you try to do something about it, you may encounter enormous friction -- from your spouse. But if Bain Capital buys you out, it won't have any trouble at all getting rid of your brother-in-law and replacing him with someone more productive. This is what ''creative destruction'' is all about.
ALL these examples tell us that increased efficiency is good, and that removing friction increases efficiency. But the financial crisis, along with the activities of the Occupy movement and the criticism being leveled at Mr. Romney, suggests that maybe there can be too much of a good thing. If loans weren't securitized, bankers might have taken the time to assess the creditworthiness of each applicant. If homeowners had to apply for loans to improve their houses or buy new cars, instead of writing checks against home equity, they might have thought harder before making weighty financial commitments. If people actually had to go into a bank and stand in line to withdraw cash, they might spend a little less and save a little more. If credit card companies weren't allowed to charge outrageous interest, perhaps not everyone with a pulse would be offered credit cards. And if people had to pay with cash, rather than plastic, they might keep their hands in their pockets just a little bit longer.
These are all situations in which a little friction to slow us down would have enabled both institutions and individuals to make better decisions. And in the case of individuals, there is the added bonus that using cash more and credit less would have made it apparent sooner just how much the ''booming '90s'' had left the middle class behind. Credit hid the ever-shrinking purchasing power of the middle class from view.
So whereas some efficiency is good, more efficiency may not be better. The psychologist Adam Grant and I published an article last year suggesting that the ''too much of a good thing'' phenomenon may be more general than commonly thought. Some choice is liberating; too much choice is paralyzing. Some motivation produces excellent performance; too much motivation leads to folding under pressure.
Finding the right amount of each of these things -- what Aristotle called the ''mean'' -- is the real challenge we face, both as individuals and as a society. In my view, the real criticism of capitalism that is implied by the criticism of Mr. Romney and Bain is that in worshiping efficiency so single-mindedly, it has ignored the possibility that too much efficiency -- too little friction -- might be a bad thing.
Finding the mean isn't easy, even when we try to. It is sometimes said that the only way to figure out how much is enough is by experiencing too much. But the challenge is even greater when we're talking about companies, because companies aren't even trying to find the mean.
For an individual company and its shareholders, there is no such thing as too much efficiency. The price of too much efficiency is not paid by the company. It is what economists call a negative externality, paid by the people who lose their jobs and the communities that suffer from job loss. Thus, we can't expect the free market to find the level of efficiency that keeps firms competitive, provides quality goods at affordable prices and sustains workers and their communities. If we are to find the balance, we must consider stakeholders and not just shareholders. Companies by themselves won't do this. Sensible regulation might.
So the real criticism embodied by current attacks on Bain Capital is not a criticism of capitalism. It is a criticism of unbridled, single-minded capitalism. Capitalism needn't be either of those things. It isn't in other societies with high standards of living, and it wasn't historically in the United States.
Perhaps we can use the criticism of Bain Capital as an opportunity to bring a little friction back into our lives. One way to do this is to use regulation to rekindle certain social norms that serve to slow us down. For example, if people thought about their homes less as investments and more as places to live, full of the friction of kids, dogs, friends, neighbors and community organizations attached, there might be less speculation with an eye toward house-flipping. And if companies thought of themselves, at least partly, as caretakers of their communities, they might look differently at streamlining their operations.
We'd all like a car that gets 100 miles to the gallon. The forces of friction that slow us down are an expensive annoyance. But when we're driving a car, we know where we're going and we're in control. Fast is good, though even here, a little bit of friction can forestall disaster when you encounter an icy road.
Life is not as predictable as driving. We don't always know where we're going. We're not always in control. Black ice is everywhere. A little something to slow us down in the uncertain world we inhabit may be a lifesaver.

HEADLINE: A Third Voice for 2012

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
EVENTUALLY the ''circular firing squad'' that is the Republican primary will be over and the last man standing will be the party's nominee for president. If that candidate is Rick Santorum, I think there is a good chance a Third Party will try to fill the space between the really ''severely conservative'' Santorum (or even Mitt Romney) and the left-of-center Barack Obama. It would be fitting. After all, this is the 20th anniversary of Ross Perot's independent candidacy. Perot won close to 20 percent of the vote, and his success was instrumental in making deficit reduction one of Bill Clinton's top priorities. An independent candidate in 2012 who was a little more, shall we say, ''normal'' than Perot could have an equally big impact on the winner. I still don't know if I'd support an independent. Like others, I worry about electing the wrong person by accident. (See: Ralph Nader and George W. Bush.) But I know what I'd pay good money to see: an intelligent independent candidate just taking part in the presidential debates, because it would make both Obama and his Republican opponent better. One independent I'd like to see play that role is David Walker. 
Walker was the country's chief auditor, serving from 1998 to 2008 as the U.S. comptroller general. He is currently the chief executive of the Comeback America Initiative (www.tcaii.org), a nonpartisan group dedicated to getting America's fiscal house in order. Walker -- who came in second to Hillary Clinton in a reader poll that Politico conducted last October for favorite Third Party candidate -- told me that he has no desire to run but that he's been speaking across the country, trying to do what Perot did.
''He did three things,'' says Walker. ''He woke up the American people to the truth about our fiscal situation in clear, concise and compelling terms. He made the presidential debates much more substantive, and he helped to set the next president's agenda, and, as a result, we made great progress in reducing the deficit from 1993 to 2000. Now we have lost all of that and more.''
Walker's view is simple: ''We are not Greece, where the government grew too big, promised too much and waited too long to restructure, but we're making many of the same mistakes.'' Because of the size of the U.S. economy and the dollar's role as a global reserve currency, we ''have some time'' to get our house in order, ''but we are not immune from the laws of prudent finance.''
Alas, both of our major parties behave as though we are. The Democrats, argues Walker, ''are still in denial about the need to renegotiate our social insurance contract.'' Walker praises Obama for focusing on the right metric -- our overall debt-to-G.D.P. ratio -- and in offering short-term ideas to enhance economic growth and address unemployment, like investments in infrastructure. But these ideas, he says, have to be ''coupled with a credible and enforceable plan to address the structural deficits that threaten our nation's future position in the world and our standard of living at home'' -- and there Obama continues to fall short.
''He is not talking about the fundamental reforms in Medicare and Medicaid that we need, and he is not ready to touch Social Security,'' says Walker, referring to Obama's latest budget. Also, Obama ''talks about tax reform, but it is not comprehensive, and he is using creative accounting to get to his budget numbers. His proposals don't come close to stabilizing our debt-to-G.D.P. ratio at the level we need.''
Walker says the president's budget cuts discretionary spending programs by 1 percent over 10 years, but mandatory spending programs -- like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and interest on debt -- will be left to grow by more than 96 percent over the same decade. As a result, in the year 2022, more than 77 percent of total government outlays will be on auto-pilot, ''which is irresponsible and unsustainable.'' There will be little left for defense or infrastructure, education and research that build our future.
As for Republicans, says Walker, ''they don't have a plan to restore fiscal sanity either. They're in denial that we can solve our structural deficit problems with either our current level of taxation -- between 15 and 16 percent of G.D.P. -- or even with our historical average, about 18 percent of G.D.P. We need more revenue. Our deficit problem is primarily a spending problem, but it is not only a spending problem.''
We need $1 in new revenue for every $3 in spending cuts, excluding interest, says Walker -- and that should be accomplished through tax reform that makes our system ''simpler, fairer and more competitive,'' while generating more revenue. ''The Republicans are simply in denial about this.''
The American people are ''starved for three things,'' concludes Walker: ''truth, leadership and solutions.'' Unfortunately, the two parties are just offering ''laggardship -- waiting for something to hit the fan'' so they can again just react ''without adequate due diligence.''
After months of nutty, gravity-free Republican primary debates, how great would it be to have presidential debates in which a smart independent like Walker was in the middle to challenge both sides and offer sensible solutions?

HEADLINE: The Plug-Ins Are Coming: New Cars That Pass the Pump as They Celebrate the Socket

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
IT has been a rotten few months for electric cars. Less than a year ago, E.V.'s and plug-in hybrids seemed ready for a mass takeoff, with the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Volt leading the charge down the runway.
But early sales have been disappointing, causing some analysts to express caution. Are plug-in cars establishing a foothold? Or might they be done in by familiar factors: high prices, short range, long charging times, plentiful gasoline and consumer resistance?
In December, J. P. Morgan sharply downgraded its electric-adoption forecast, projecting that plug-in models would take just 4.5 percent of the global market by 2025, down from the previous estimate of 8.6 percent.
The Volt's reputation was dinged by a federal investigation into the potential for battery fires. That inquiry concluded that the plug-in hybrid was no more fire-prone than a gas-powered car. 
And in this election year, Republicans have assailed electric cars, making them a stand-in for President Obama's stimulus spending, energy policies, auto-industry aid and loans for plug-in makers including Ford, General Motors and Nissan.
House Republicans accused safety officials of trying to whitewash a Volt battery fire -- which occurred weeks after the car was crash-tested -- to protect the government's investment in G.M.
Fisker laid off 66 workers after missing sales targets for its Karma plug-in that were conditions of its $529 million Energy Department loan.
But none of the bad news is stopping automakers, from big, bullish Nissan to tiny underdogs like Coda, from sticking electric motors into cars.
Americans bought 19,874 plug-in cars in 2011, according to LMC Automotive. But the research firm expects the number to surge to roughly 70,000 this year, to nearly 170,000 in 2013 and to a healthy 250,000 by 2015. About a dozen new plug-in models are scheduled to reach showrooms this year, and another dozen in 2013. Most new models adopt a standardized plug that delivers stronger 240-volt current, filling the batteries in three to eight hours.
Both companies and the government continue to place billion-dollar bets on electricity as the best available technology to curb pollution and reduce dependence on foreign oil. Mr. Obama's latest budget calls for raising federal tax breaks for plug-in buyers to $10,000, from $7,500.
With models like the Karma priced at $100,000, some of tax breaks will go to the wealthy. Even ''affordable'' E.V.'s like the Ford Focus Electric are priced around $40,000, a huge premium over conventional high-mileage cars.
Whether or not plug-ins become common, some intriguing vehicles will arrive in the next two years. Here are some models to keep an eye on:
AMP This Ohio company plans to yank the powertrains from Jeep Grand Cherokees and Mercedes M-Class S.U.V.'s and replace them with batteries and electric motors, good for a 100-mile range. Set for this fall, Amp's Jeep and Mercedes E.V.'s start around $58,000 and $80,000 respectively.
AUDI An electrified version of the R8 sports car, featured in the ''Iron Man'' movies, the E-tron is to go into production late this year and will have four electric motors, one at each wheel. With power from a big 53-kilowatt-hour battery, a prototype developed 313 horsepower and 502 pound-feet of torque. Expect a price well into six figures.
BMW The ActiveE, an all-electric version of the 1 Series coupe that is being leased to 700 American customers, is serving as a testbed for BMW's first full-production electric car, the i3. A city car with a body of lightweight carbon fiber, the i3 is to reach dealerships in late 2013 and early 2014. It will first be offered as a pure E.V., with a plug-in hybrid version to follow. Then, in 2014, BMW will offer Hollywood celebrity bait with the futuristic i8 plug-in hybrid, which has already had a supporting role in ''Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol.''
CADILLAC To arrive next winter, the eye-catching front-drive ELR adopts the hybrid approach of the Volt, covering short distances on battery power, then switching to a gas engine to generate electricity and extend the range.
CODA This Los Angeles-based underdog plans an international approach: importing partly built Hafai Saibo sedans from China, then installing batteries and electronics in Northern California. For prices of $38,145 or $40,795, buyers will get a car with a range of 125 or 150 miles. Coda hopes to roll out its first cars in California in the spring.
DOK-ING Though a long shot for American showrooms, the XD, a Croatian-built cutie with gullwing doors and an unusual three-passenger layout, was a hit at the Los Angeles auto show in November.
FIAT Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of Fiat and Chrysler, complained last year that Fiat would lose $10,000 on every E.V. it sold. Still, Chrysler is engineering the Fiat 500 EV for limited production this year, at a price that may approach $40,000.
FISKER After long delays, the $103,000 Karma plug-in hybrid is slowly reaching customers from the factory in Finland where it is assembled. The California start-up says its voluptuous sedan can cover 300 miles, the first 50 on battery power. The Karma can reach 60 m.p.h. in less than six seconds, with a boost from a G.M.-sourced 4-cylinder gas engine.
FORD Three plug-in cars are coming from Dearborn this year. The Focus Electric goes on sale next month in California, New York and New Jersey, with distribution spreading to 15 additional markets by year's end. The car's trump card is a powerful 6.6-kilowatt onboard charger, giving the 123-horsepower Ford a full charge in four hours, about half the time of the current Nissan Leaf. But the $39,995 base price is $4,000 more than the Nissan's, which has a similar 100-mile range.
The Ford C-Max people mover will be offered as both a conventional hybrid and, this fall, as a plug-in version called the Energi. A 2-liter gas engine and electric motor supply 185 horsepower, with recharging in as little as 3.5 hours. Ford says the C-Max Energi will beat the Volt's gasoline equivalent rating of 93 m.p.g.e. Finally, Ford plans to sell an Energi plug-in hybrid version of its 2013 Fusion alongside the gasoline and hybrid models, starting next winter.
HONDA An electric version of the Fit hatchback arrives this summer, though just 1,100 will be available, strictly on the West and East coasts, with a $399 monthly lease. The Fit adopts the 123-horse electric motor from the FCX Clarity hydrogen fuel-cell car; a 20-kilowatt-hour battery will provide roughly 75 miles of range.
And in fall 2013, Honda will offer an advanced plug-in hybrid system on its next-generation Accord. A 2-liter Atkinson cycle engine will join two electric motors, one to charge the battery and one to propel the car. The plug-in Accord is said to be capable of traveling 10 to 15 miles on electricity at up to 62 m.p.h., or to blend gas and electric power.
INFINITI To be unveiled at the Geneva auto show next month, Infiniti's two-seat, rear-drive sports car will combine electric power with a midmounted 1.3-liter gas engine. The car adopts the Chevy Volt's extended-range format rather than the all-electric approach championed by Nissan.
MERCEDES-BENZ Like other electric supercars, the SLS AMG E-Cell could pluck the consciences and wallets of the rich when it comes to market with a projected price of $200,000. The E-Cell would crank out 526 horsepower through four 12,000-r.p.m. electric motors; its projected top speed of 155 m.p.h. could set a production E.V. record.
MITSUBISHI Mitsubishi's tiny four-seat ''i'' city car is the E.P.A.'s new fuel-economy champ, rated at the gasoline equivalent of 126 m.p.g.e. on the highway and 99 in town. It is also, at about $30,000, the most affordable highway-capable electric car. With 63 horsepower, the ''i'' is slow and somewhat crude, with a range of 62 miles. On sale now in the West, the car migrates to the Northeast in April.
TESLA Tesla is seeking to justify its federal loans with the Model S, a striking electric sport sedan that claims unmatched range of 160 to 300 miles, depending on the battery. Tesla offers 40-, 60- and 85-kilowatt-hour versions from $57,400 to $105,400. The power-packed version offers an unlimited battery warranty and 0-to-60 m.p.h. acceleration of 4.4 seconds. Deliveries are to start later this year.
TOYOTA For $32,760 to start, the new Prius plug-in hybrid can travel just 15 miles on battery juice alone -- one-third the Volt's range -- but it can top 50 m.p.g. when its gas engine comes into play, beating the Chevy. A similar version of the Prius V wagon arrives this fall. Toyota will also start production in Ontario late this year of the RAV4 EV, whose electric powertrain was developed by Tesla at a cost to Toyota of $100 million.

HEADLINE: Here Comes Class Warfare

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
The last time I considered Barack Obama's re-election chances in this magazine, in mid-November, things were looking pretty bleak for the president. The statistical model I used measured three key factors -- a president's approval rating, economic growth and the ideological orientation of his opponent -- and taken together, they showed that Obama had become a slight underdog to win re-election.
Three months later, his position is much stronger.
In January, 243,000 jobs were created. The number surprised investors and economists, but it was part of a stream of solid economic data: over the last few months, consumer confidence has gone up, Americans have spent more on big-ticket items like cars and there is even evidence that the housing market has begun to rebound. Before the job numbers came out, most economists were expecting around 2.5 percent G.D.P. growth this year. Those forecasts are liable to be revised upward now, perhaps to about 3 percent. 
Americans seem to have noticed the change. By early February, Obama's approval rating had climbed to 49 percent in the Real Clear Politics average, a six-point improvement from three months earlier. Although it's not a terrific approval rating, it may be enough to get Obama another term. In 2004, George W. Bush won a narrow victory with essentially identical metrics: G.D.P. growth of 2.9 percent and an approval rating of about 48 percent on Election Day.
Still, Obama's position isn't solid enough for him to beat just anybody. Bush benefited from running against a middling opponent like John Kerry, against whom he was able to squeeze every ounce out of his approval rating.
The model I created evaluates the strength of the opposition candidate by considering his ideology on a left-to-right scale. Candidates who are closer to the center have historically done better than those closer to the wings. (I've updated the model's measure of ideology to account for new data.)
Obama's most likely Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, continues to rate as a ''generic Republican.'' In fact, he now scores at exactly 50 on the 100-point scale from centrist to extremist. That means an election against Romney, like Bush's against Kerry, would mostly be dictated by the fundamentals of the economy and by evaluations of Obama's job performance. With 2.5 percent G.D.P. growth from now through November, Obama would be a 60 percent favorite to win the popular vote.
The popular vote is one thing, however. The Electoral College is another -- and Romney could have more vulnerabilities there.
In recent weeks, Obama has taken a more populist approach (just read the transcript of his State of the Union address). The strategy has induced more howls than usual from Republicans about ''class warfare,'' but the White House has clearly studied the numbers. In the Republican primaries, Romney has had trouble winning the loyalty of working-class voters, especially in the Midwest. And recent polls suggest that Romney, who has a penchant for making intemperate comments that draw attention to his wealth, could struggle among that group in the general election as well.
So let's conduct a thought experiment. Suppose that against Romney, Obama does 10 points better among white voters whose households make less than $50,000 per year. The trade-off is that he does 10 points worse among whites making $100,000 or more and 15 points worse among whites making at least $200,000.
In terms of the popular vote, this would almost exactly balance out. The effect would be more substantial, however, in individual states.
In wealthy Virginia, Obama would lose a net of 2.5 percentage points to Romney under these rules, according to the demographics from the 2008 exit poll there. He would also be harmed by 2.7 points in Colorado. And Romney would have a chance of putting New Jersey into play, because he would gain four full points there. (The Chris-Christie-for-V.P. train will be departing from Platform 1.)
Moreover, Obama would have relatively few states that he might flip to blue. Missouri is one exception: the 3.9-point boost he would see there outweighs his narrow margin of defeat in 2008. Obama would also gain 5.8 points in Montana, which would have been enough for him to beat John McCain.
But Obama doesn't need to win many new states. His challenge will be in holding the ones that might turn red. And pursuing a populist strategy against Romney could put him at a big advantage.
Consider the Midwest. By trading votes among wealthy whites for more among working-class ones, Obama would bolster his margins in Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa and Michigan. Indiana, a state that otherwise looks like a very tough hold for Obama, also contains a high percentage of working-class whites, and he could gain a few points there.
His chances of winning North Carolina, where he sneaked by with fewer than 15,000 votes last time, would go up as well. The same goes for the 2nd congressional district in Nebraska, and Oregon and Maine, two states that are less upscale than their coastal brethren and that have been competitive in the past, would be easier holds.
Conversely, none of the 22 states that John McCain carried in 2008 would be bolstered meaningfully under this situation. Most of those states are securely Republican to begin with; the few exceptions, like Georgia and Arizona, contain about as many working-class whites as wealthy ones.
All told, there are 101 electoral votes in swing states that Obama could either put into play or make more secure under the populist paradigm -- well more than the 36 he might lose among Virginia, Colorado and New Jersey.
The reason for the imbalance is that most wealthy whites do not live in swing states but in enclaves that the sociologist Charles Murray calls SuperZIPs. Most of these are in states like New York, California, Maryland and Massachusetts that are very far from being competitive. (There are also a significant number of SuperZIPs in the Dallas and Houston metro areas in Texas, but Obama probably wasn't going to win the Lone Star State anyway.)
But what if Rick Santorum were to steal the Republican nomination away from Romney? After his sweep of the contests in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri on Feb. 7, he looks like a more viable candidate -- one who doesn't seem as beholden to the 1 percent as Romney does. He has been successful at making Obama's supposed elitism a theme of his campaign. And he is more conservative on social policy than on fiscal policy, which runs against the consensus view in the Virginia and New Jersey suburbs but puts him in line with the preferences of middle-income voters in the center of the country.
Still, Santorum, who rates as a 68 on the ideology scale (the same as a less-plausible nominee, Newt Gingrich), would probably be weaker than Romney in the popular vote. According to the model, Obama would be a 77 percent favorite to win the popular vote against Santorum given 2.5 percent G.D.P. growth.
Republicans wouldn't care about that, however, if Santorum carried Ohio and Michigan -- and perhaps even his home state, Pennsylvania -- places where economic concerns tend to take precedence. Under these conditions, in fact, Republicans might be able to win the Electoral College while losing the popular vote.
I am not quite ready to suggest that Santorum would be a better nominee than Romney. But the electability gap between the two is closer than it might appear because of the way Santorum's strengths could play in the Electoral College. At the very least, he might force a reset of the White House's strategy -- from one focused on the 99 percent to one more intent on critiquing Santorum's positions on social issues.
Whichever strategy the Obama folks settle on, though, they'll be acting from a place of relative strength -- so long as the economic numbers remain decent. If the economy tips backward toward recession because of the situation in Europe or tensions in the Middle East, Obama would go right back to being an underdog against either Romney or Santorum.
So, who wants to bet on there being nine months of no bad news?

 WHY OBAMA WILL EMBRACE THE 99 PERCENT: If Obama waged a populist campaign against Romney, he'd peel off more white voters who make under $50,000 a year and lose a bunch who make over $100,000. It's a winning strategy as far as the Electoral College is concerned. (GRAPHICS BY ELEONORA MARTON) (MM45)

HEADLINE: To Be Read by All Parties

BYLINE: By EMILY PARKER. 
Emily Parker is senior fellow and digital diplomacy adviser at the New America Foundation. She is writing a book about the Internet and democracy.

 BODY:
Some people write books for love. Others write for fame, or more impractically for money. Then there are those who strive for impact in Washington. This may seem most delusional of all. But in today's Washington, books do matter -- even if they often have the most influence when presented in abbreviated form.
Last month, President Obama expressed unexpected admiration for the work of the neoconservative intellectual and Mitt Romney adviser Robert Kagan. In an excerpt from his book ''The World America Made'' that appeared in The New Republic, Kagan set out to debunk the popular idea that America's power and influence are waning. For Obama, Kagan's argument was a welcome rebuke to his opponents' complaint that he was presiding over his country's decline. 
I saw the potency of books firsthand while serving recently on the State Department's policy planning staff. Ideas that originated between covers often shaped conversations and found their way into major speeches or memos. Indeed, a book, by its mere existence, can lend legitimacy to an argument in a sound-bite-driven debate. ''There are so many ideas flying around, it's very important that some have been worked out more thoroughly and comprehensively,'' says Anne-Marie Slaughter, the State Department's policy planning director from 2009 to 2011. ''When I find an idea I'll immediately go to the book to make sure that it's serious, even if I don't read the whole book.'' The author Leslie Gelb acknowledges that his ''Power Rules,''where he argued that G.D.P. matters more than military might, was more influential when reduced to articles. Still, he says, publishing a book ''gets people talking about what you did.''
The administration's bibliophiles include the national security adviser, Tom Donilon, who told me by e-mail that he recently read ''George F. Kennan: An American Life,'' by John Lewis Gaddis; ''On China,'' by Henry Kissinger; ''Where China Meets India: Burma and the New Crossroads of Asia,'' by Thant Myint-U; and ''A Peace to End All Peace,'' a history of the division of the Middle East after World War I by David Fromkin. ''Having a sense of history is critical to sound policy-making,'' Donilon says.
Other consequential books, like Robert Wright's ''Nonzero,'' are less obviously related to questions of policy. ''Nonzero'' employs evolutionary biology and game theory to argue that life is not a zero-sum game with a clear winner and loser. ''You operate within a much more horizontal setting, where you operate by connecting to others and mobilizing others in ways that advance common causes,'' Slaughter says. '' 'Nonzero' basically spells out the logic of that.'' This idea was reflected in Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 2010 Internet Freedom speech, which championed the ''freedom to connect.'' Slaughter, who was policy planning director at the time, says, ''We were actively focused on a world in which the power to connect to others is essential.''
Derek Chollet, senior director for strategic planning at the National Security Council, says Robert Kaplan's ''Monsoon'' affected thinking across the Obama administration. Kaplan asserts that America's ability to project power in the future requires an understanding of the dynamics of the greater Indian Ocean, in particular the rivalries and competition over trade routes among the United States, China, India, and countries like Indonesia and Vietnam. ''There hasn't been much written about the Indian Ocean that is accessible to the nonscholar. 'Monsoon' forced people to think differently. It put the Indian Ocean on the agenda,'' Chollet says. In a speech in Chennai, India, last July, Hillary Clinton drew attention to the area's strategic value.
Books influence economic decision makers as well. Lawrence Summers, director of the National Economic Council in 2009-10, says he was impressed by Liaquat Ahamed's ''Lords of Finance,'' which highlights the dangerous consequences of government austerity in the wake of financial crisis. Summers says that Ahamed's book reinforced his belief in the ''overwhelming importance'' of expansionary policy. From Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart's ''This Time Is Different,'' a history of financial crises through the ages, Summers took away an emphasis on ''deleveraging as an important aspect of the crisis, the risks that crisis would spread to Europe and the risks that policy makers will be fooled by false dawns in the economic data.''
He also reread David Halberstam's 1972 book ''The Best and the Brightest,'' a withering indictment of ivory tower intellectuals' role in planning the Vietnam War. Some critics would say that the Obama administration repeated the errors of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations by putting too much trust in highly educated technocrats like Summers himself. For his part, Summers says ''The Best and the Brightest'' provided valuable lessons in humility: it reminded him ''that people in government positions would be given the positive news that they wanted to hear, would be overconfident about policy paths they had selected and would be insufficiently open to outside opinion.''
Summers adds that it is not always necessary to read an entire book. Rather, a good review can capture a fair amount of what's necessary for a policy maker to learn. He says, ''If you tell me that the policy makers are reading the reviews, not the books, I don't take that as evidence that the books aren't influential.''
Of course, books have impressed administrations at least since the time of Abraham Lincoln, who is said to have told Harriet Beecher Stowe that she started the Civil War by writing ''Uncle Tom's Cabin.'' Dwight Macdonald's 1963 review of Michael Harrington's ''Other America'' helped spur the war on poverty. The fallout from Samuel P. Huntington's 1996 book ''The Clash of Civilizations'' is immeasurable. And needless to say, a book's effects can be very different from what the author intended. The depiction of ethnic violence in southeastern Europe as an age-old tradition in Kaplan's ''Balkan Ghosts'' was reportedly used by the Clinton administration to justify nonintervention in the Balkans, a reading that Kaplan calls ''naive.''
What hasn't changed is that a book with a strong idea has a good chance of getting inside the Beltway in some form or other. And what makes for a strong idea? Back in the 1960s, a former assistant secretary of defense, John T. McNaughton, perhaps put it best: An outside idea has a chance to influence government policy only if it has two characteristics. First, it can be stated in a simple declarative sentence. Second, once stated it is obviously true.

HEADLINE: The Washington Wives' Book Club

BYLINE: By PAMELA PAUL. 
Pamela Paul is the features editor and children's books editor at the Book Review.

 BODY:
In times of partisan gridlock, economic woe and /public-opinion doldrums, Hillary Clinton, Lynne Cheney and Laura Bush all wrote them. Callista Gingrich recently wrote one. And now Jill Biden, the wife of Vice President Joe Biden, is coming out with one.
Could children's books be the wifely calming salve for this election cycle's blistering political environment?
Last month, Simon & Schuster announced that it would publish Dr. Biden's first children's book, ''Don't Forget, God Bless Our Troops,'' illustrated by Raul Colon, in June. ''Drawing on my experience with my own grandchildren as well as my visits with military families around the country,'' Dr. Biden said in an e-mail interview, ''I thought that a children's book would be the best way to reach children and their parents to help them better understand the impact of having a parent deployed.'' 
Her share of profits from the book will go to charities that support military families. The publisher, too, will offer a cut to charity, though of course it still stands to profit -- because children's books by prominent Washington figures and members of their extended families sell. Since its publication in September, Mrs. Gingrich's book, ''Sweet Land of Liberty'' (whose title comes from the same patriotic hymn as one of Barack Obama's), has sold more than 75,000 copies, according to Regnery, the publisher. Caroline Kennedy's anthologies -- the latest of which, ''Poems to Learn by Heart,'' will be published this October -- routinely hit the best-seller list.
In a publishing landscape battered by competition from assorted screen media, children's literature, especially in the realm of picture books, has been a holdout against electronic distractions. E-books account for only an estimated 5 percent of total sales of books for children under 8, compared with 25 percent for some categories of adult book sales. Published in 2010, Obama's picture book, ''Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters,'' sold more than 400,000 copies, according to the publisher.
''We're going through a very intense political time, and that's why you're seeing a lot of children's books coming out of Washington,'' said Kate Jackson, editor in chief of HarperCollins Children's Books, who has edited offerings from Laura and Jenna Bush. ''Picture books and books for tweens are always a great way to put complex issues like politics into a context that young children can understand,'' she said. ''They get the conversation going.''
For Washington wives, writing a children's book has become almost an expected spousal counterpart to the politician's campaign tract or argument book. ''Spouses have one mandatory obligation -- 'First Do No Harm' -- and one optional assignment: provide a positive magnifying force,'' Mary Matalin, editor at large for Threshold Editions, a division of Simon & Schuster, and a former member of Dick Cheney's staff, wrote in an e-mail. ''Children's books fulfill both.''
After all, what greater, brighter, cleaner route to a voter's heart than through the influence of his or her children -- our nation's future! -- and how better to endear a politician to that voting parent than through a treasured reading experience? George W. Bush's fiasco with ''The Pet Goat'' aside (that story may forever be associated with President Bush's astonished mien as he continued to read to a grade-school class he was visiting in Florida after being told about the attack on the World Trade Center), children's literature is generally considered a powerful and positive force in the grinding political P.R. machine.
Reaching children can also serve a more direct political purpose. When Theodore H. White was gathering material for his book ''The Making of the President, 1960,'' he accompanied one Democratic contender, John F. Kennedy, on a long day driving around the far reaches of a desolate district in Wisconsin. Some 1,200 of the 1,600 people Kennedy interacted with were children, all well below voting age. What, White wanted to know, was the point? Kennedy made it very clear: ''It was important to talk to schoolchildren because schoolchildren talked to their parents when they went home,'' White wrote. In terms of campaigning, visiting children was better, in its way, than pinching the cheeks of babies.
This is no less true today. ''If the book is really standout good, it reinforces the elected's message,'' Mary Matalin said. ''If the book is a garden-variety children's book, it serves as an opportunity to show support for the elected, a sort of voting by book purchase.''
It is not surprising, then, that Jill Biden is represented by Robert Barnett, the Washington lawyer and agent who has brokered book deals for Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama.
''Our husbands are wonderful at reaching adults and the electorate, but it is also important for children to receive an education about what makes our nation so great,'' Callista Gingrich explained in an e-mail. ''I was familiar with many other children's books written by political spouses,'' she added; they ''clearly feel that patriotism is a message that needs to be shared with America's youth.''
But the parameters of book publishing for Washington wives once lay squarely in the domestic sphere, the literary equivalent of Jackie's White House decorating tour: entertaining, first pets, raising a family.
''I think first ladies and political spouses write about children and food and pets because it's a way to make them human without offending anybody,'' said Sally Bedell Smith, a Washington historian who has written books on the Kennedy and Clinton White Houses. ''The subjects are inherently appealing. They're positive and detached from politics. They're autobiographical without being self-absorbed. And how can you not like children?''
Before this latest wave of children's books, White House pets seemed to be the go-to subject. Barbara Bush wrote ''Millie's Book,'' about the elder Bushes' perky, puppy-producing springer spaniel, during the recessionary malaise of the early 1990s. Taking her cue, Hillary Clinton, when she was first lady, published ''Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets'' in 1998 -- a pointed reminder that a real family still gathered for dinner while the Lew/insky scandal raged outside. Not surprisingly, like her mother-in-law, Laura Bush made early literacy a central component of her role as first lady.
Lynne Cheney, who wrote no fewer than six children's books while her husband was vice president, was probably the first Washington wife whose books carried a more overtly political message. A former chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, Mrs. Cheney writes books for young readers exploring American history. Two of them, ''We the People: The Story of Our Constitution'' and ''When Washington Crossed the Delaware: A Wintertime Story for Young Patriots,'' were rereleased in paperback this January, timed to the current election year.
Mrs. Gingrich's book also falls on the didactic end of the storytelling spectrum. In rhyming couplets, the book shows how Ellis the Elephant discovers an assortment of pre-multicultural-revolution events from American history at his local library. (Yes, the Boston Tea Party is in there.) Of the Pilgrims, for example, Ellis learns that ''with the help of God, they survived cold and beast / and celebrated together with a Thanksgiving feast.''
Not only is a political message at the forefront of Mrs. Gingrich's book, but its marketing has also been intertwined with her husband's presidential campaign. Newt Gingrich, a regular presence at his wife's book signings, has openly credited her children's book with helping drive his campaign. ''One of the things that actually saved us, in addition to Callista's stubbornness,'' Mr. Gingrich told The New York Times Magazine in December, speaking of a series of bumps in his campaign, ''was Ellis the Elephant.'' Asked to elaborate, he said: ''It gave you an oasis psychologically. Literally, Ellis was sort of a ray of light.''
Not every Washington spouse necessarily has a political motive, blatant or subtle, explicit or disguised, when it comes to writing children's books. Carole Geithner, the wife of Timothy Geithner, the Treasury secretary, has been a clinical social worker for more than 20 years. She worked on her first novel, about a 13-year-old girl coping with her mother's death from cancer, for five years, beginning well before her husband's appointment to Obama's cabinet.
The book, ''If Only,'' is purposefully understated in its marketing of Ms. Geithner; it gives no hint of her political connection other than the dedication (''For Tim, love of my life . . . ''). She even, Ms. Geithner admitted, considered using her maiden name.
The novel describes how a teenager and her father navigate life in the aftermath of tragedy; the story is more about the author's personal experience, both as someone who lost her mother at a relatively young age (Ms. Geithner was 25) and as a counselor who has specialized in issues of grief and loss, than about making any larger social or political point. Publishers Weekly noted Ms. Geithner's ''expertly'' depicted portrayal of the girl's emotional journey.
Even so, when the book is published next month, some readers may be tempted to parse the text for a political message. ''I understand that there's a natural curiosity -- it's only human,'' Ms. Geithner said in a phone interview. ''But I want people to read the book for the topic or the writing, rather than as an extension of Tim's public persona.''
It's not always wives doing the writing. Among presidential daughters actual and aspiring, in addition to Jenna Bush and Caroline Kennedy, Meghan McCain and Amy Carter (as illustrator) have also issued books for children. In 2006, a re-election year, Ted Kennedy himself released ''My Senator and Me: A Dog's-Eye View of Washington, D.C.''
The Washington children's book tradition goes at least as far back as 1895, when among his many weighty books for grown-ups, Theodore Roosevelt wrote a book for children with Henry Cabot Lodge, ''Hero Tales From American History,'' six years before he took office as president.
In a very different era, Mrs. Gingrich and Ms. Geithner are both already at work on follow-ups -- most likely on books very different from the other's. But that's politics.

HEADLINE: High Gas Prices Give G.O.P. Issue to Attack Obama

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Binyamin Appelbaum and Annie Lowrey contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Rising gasoline prices, trumpeted in foot-tall numbers on street corners across the country, are causing concern among advisers to President Obama that a budding sense of economic optimism could be undermined just as he heads into the general election.
White House officials are preparing for Republicans to use consumer angst about the cost of oil and gas to condemn his energy programs and buttress their argument that his economic policies are not working.
In a closed-door meeting last week, Speaker John A. Boehner instructed fellow Republicans to embrace the gas-pump anger they find among their constituents when they return to their districts for the Presidents' Day recess.
''This debate is a debate we want to have,'' Mr. Boehner told his conference on Wednesday, according to a Republican aide who was present. ''It was reported this week that we'll soon see $4-a-gallon gas prices. Maybe higher. Certainly, this summer will see the highest gas prices in years. Your constituents saw those reports, and they'll be talking about it.'' 
Iran's recent warnings of a disruption in the global oil trade have pushed the price of a barrel of domestic oil to more than $103, a six-month high and up about 34 percent since September. That has helped drive the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline in the United States to $3.52, a 30-cent increase in the past two months. It is already approaching $4 in some places.
Economists say the current price of oil is only a modest drag on the economy. But a big jump -- combined with tensions over Iran and continuing European debt worries -- could present a more significant challenge to America's recovery, they say.
For the president's economic team, the specter of such increases in oil prices comes on the heels of positive economic news that has lifted Mr. Obama's approval rating, including better-than-expected job growth, a surging stock market and a payroll tax deal that will put more money in the pockets of millions of Americans.
But Mr. Boehner's message to his members echoes the aggressive talk coming from the Republican campaign trail, where the men vying for the right to challenge Mr. Obama are increasingly blaming Mr. Obama's administration for rising gas prices. A gallon of gas had dropped to $1.89 when Mr. Obama took office in 2009, in large part because of the fall in oil demand caused by the financial crisis, and has almost doubled since.
''They want higher energy prices. They want to push their radical agenda on the public,'' Rick Santorum said at a campaign event last week, accusing Democrats of pushing alternatives to oil. ''We need a president who is on the side of affordable energy.''
Newt Gingrich wrote on Twitter on Friday that ''gasoline prices are unacceptable. We can do better!'' He urged his supporters to sign a petition on his Web site calling for a return to $2.50-a-gallon gas. ''Drill here. Drill now. Pay less,'' the petition says.
And talking points from the Republican National Committee that go out to conservative commentators every Friday often include rising gas prices among the ''Top Line Messaging'' for the week. A recent ''Pundit Prep'' document cited the national debt, unemployment and the price of gas as the three best ways to define the ''Obama economy.''
The president's political advisers are bracing for battle as they envision the price of gas rising steadily through the summer, as it usually does. As the president's motorcade whisked him through scenic Orange County on Thursday on the way to a California fund-raiser, one sign held by a protester read, ''Gas prices up 91 percent under Obama.''
Aides say they know the attacks are inevitable. But they also say they are prepared to respond forcefully with a defense of the president's energy policies and a critique of the Republican line.
''The president is keenly aware of the impact that higher gas prices have on families trying to make ends meet,'' Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said last week.
For Mr. Obama's economic team, the increase in oil prices is an unwelcome reminder of how global events largely outside their control can hamper a recovery. For the third year in a row, a modest recovery faces head winds as winter turns to spring.
In the spring of 2010, debt crises in Europe, slowing stimulus spending and weakness in the housing market brought an abrupt halt to a brief turnaround in the United States economy. A year later, turmoil in the Middle East, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and more debt problems in Europe did the same. Now, rising gasoline prices, concern over tensions with Iran and, once again, European debt are causing worries.
On a call with reporters on Friday, Alan B. Krueger, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said rising oil prices threatened to eat into household budgets and sap confidence -- as they did last year. But he said the agreement to extend last year's payroll tax cut would help.
''The payroll tax cut provides some cushion for families in case they see their costs go up, possibly because of gasoline prices or for other reasons over the course of the year,'' Mr. Krueger said.
In speeches this spring, aides said, the president will increasingly focus on his administration's actions to raise the fuel efficiency of cars and to open new areas to oil and natural gas development. They said they hoped the moves would counter the accusation that he has stifled oil production. On Friday, the Interior Department announced an expansion of oil exploration in Arctic waters.
Mr. Obama has also begun once again to express his personal concern for the impact of gas prices on pocketbooks, as he did last week while pressing Congress to extend the tax cut, which is about $40 per paycheck for a family making $50,000 a year.
''If we start seeing significant increases in gas prices, losing that $40 could not come at a worse time,'' the president said Tuesday.
A counterattack being planned by the Obama re-election team in Chicago is expected to point out, among other things, Mitt Romney's actions to raise gas taxes when he was governor of Massachusetts. And Mr. Obama's Democratic allies on Capitol Hill are eager to renew a nationwide discussion about tax subsidies to oil companies.
''House Republicans are very good at using every argument they can to shield oil companies from paying their fair share,'' said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ''They have been relentless and fearless protectors of oil company profits.''
Republicans on Capitol Hill say they are eager to criticize the president as gas prices rise, in part with a flurry of legislation aimed at increasing domestic production.
They also plan to use Mr. Obama's decision to block the immediate construction of Keystone XL, a 1,700-mile pipeline that would stretch from Canada to the Gulf Coast. A Republican bill was passed by the House on Thursday to expand offshore drilling and force a permit to be approved for the pipeline.
In an interview, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House whip, mocked Mr. Obama's claim to want an ''all of the above'' energy policy.
''He says it in his State of the Union, and then a week later he kills Keystone,'' Mr. McCarthy said. ''I think energy is going to be one of the major issues in this election, and it's going to peak in two months.''

HEADLINE: Tinseltown in New York

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
NEW YORK played itself. The movie that is Manhattan has seldom been shown off to better cinematic effect than during Fashion Week, which ended on Thursday.
From Lincoln Center to Wollman Rink, backstage setups to elaborate stage sets, wind-whistling piers to spare Bowery galleries, the city shone hard, emanating a distinctive silvery glow, its stone-and-glass verticality a shimmering backdrop for a movie populated by a handful of stars and 3,000 extras -- retailers, journalists, models, agents, bloggers and hangers-on (if that's not a redundancy) -- who come to town twice yearly to infuse the city with energy and a hunk of the $865 million that fashion weeks generated last year.
As in an Antonioni movie, this one was all moods and atmospheres. Vignettes played out wherever you went. Backstage at the Alexander Wang show, for instance, held in cavernous Pier 94, the Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen arrived on time and in unassuming fashion, then folded her tall frame into a chair set before a bank of vanity mirrors and a battery of 20 camera crews recording every move. 
''I've got to do something with this hair,'' said Ms. Bundchen, laughing off questions about the Super Bowl incident in which her muttered defense of her husband, Tom Brady, the New England Patriots' quarterback, briefly made her the Typhoid Mary of the Web.
''It's amazing I have any hair at all after all these years in the business,'' said Ms. Bundchen, as the hairdresser Guido Palau grabbed a hank of her long, sun-streaked hair.
Students of stardom might take lessons from Ms. Bundchen, how she acted as though it was the most natural thing in the world to have her hair done with scores of strangers staring at her. ''Look at me, I'm like Rapunzel,'' she said, and then addressed her claque: ''Let me get dressed now. I've got a coat to sell.''
Beauties were scattered everywhere that day, as is customary during Fashion Week. Girls of the old school like Shalom Harlow lamented the difficulty of finding shoes in size 11; newcomers like Frida Gustavsson sat on the sidelines reading the journals of Keith Haring, an artist who died in 1990, three years before she was born.
''BOYS, fast, fast, fast,'' the fashion show producer Alexandre de Betak exhorted the male models backstage at the Lacoste show on Saturday morning. He was giving them runway directions. ''The girls are so much faster than you. You've really got to run.''
The girls could not run, not really, not in those heels. ''I've never worn heels before,'' said Hailey Hasbrook, a 17-year-old making her Fashion Week debut (first season, first show, ''first everything'') at Lacoste.
''I'm already 5-11,'' and hardly in need of the extra height, said Ms. Hasbrook, who hails from a part of the country where you won't see stilettos until they find a way to graft them onto Birkenstocks. ''I'm from Portland,'' she said.
It was while returning presents on the day after Christmas that Ms. Hasbrook was approached by one of those model scouts whose natural habitat seems to be food-court nooks between Sbarro Pizza and Chick-fil-A.
''This lady ran up to me and said, 'Oh, my God, have you ever thought of being a model?' '' Ms. Hasbrook said. ''And I was, like, uh, kind of I have.''
IN black overalls, a cashmere cardigan and with his trademark red glasses and turtleneck, the playwright Larry Kramer looked like one of those cameo players (''Midnight in Manhattan'') that evoke a frisson in movies while not advancing the plot.
There he was at the Loden Dager show, held in the basement of the Hudson Hotel on Saturday. The sight of him brought to mind the era of his young manhood, a period in 1970s New York that he describes graphically in his novel ''Faggots.'' In those days, the shows people staged in subterranean spaces were seldom about fashion. Overalls were popular among a certain group then, designers like the late Willie Smith and the night-hunters who frequented legendary dives like the Mineshaft and sexual arenas like the now-gone piers and infamous ''trucks.''
Mr. Kramer has often been prophetic at many points throughout his long life, though seldom in terms of style. Yet his overalls were in synch with one of the many curious convergences that arise out of nowhere during fashion cycles: jeggings, hourglass shapes, oxblood, skirts for men.
A fair number of fellows at the Jeremy Scott show on Wednesday (where the flaming creatures of downtown reliably turn out with freak flags flying) wore skirts, but also overalls, their bibs left hanging way, way down.
''Loving your look,'' said Jamie Clayton, the transgender actress, hugging a pal as though being reunited with a lost family member at a refugee camp. Ms. Clayton wore high heels and tights whose cartoon pattern underscored her own curvaceous body and slightly Pixar qualities.
She seemed like someone who came most fully to life in front of the cameras that couldn't seem to get enough of her. A show person, let's call her, to swipe a phrase once used to describe entertainers but useful also for the many characters populating the city when the fashion circus comes to town.
They aren't all featured players but they are all essential, and often, as Pauline Kael once remarked of a Hollywood hambone, they play their roles with such commitment that even their toes act in their shoes.
Consider, for instance, the event horizon required to prepare socialites; Real Housewives; the drag queens who turn up reliably at Fashion Week events. Consider how early in the morning one of the blond Frederic Fekkai spaniels that populate the front rows at a 10 o'clock Michael Kors show have to rise to get their manes perfectly in place.
Waxing, manicures, blowouts, Botox, trainers: When economists run the Fashion Week numbers, do they even calculate for the primping economy? ''Why make things simple when you can make them difficult?'' asked Etienne Russo, the fashion show producer who reliably sets the bar for Fashion Week creativity.
It was Mr. Russo who once imported a Swedish iceberg to Paris for a Chanel show, brought a flash mob to Grand Central Terminal for Moncler Grenoble, and who had the audacity on Sunday to take over Wollman Rink in Central Park for a show that piled New York cliches (Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue,'' a Harlem gospel choir, ice dancers) atop one another, as if to remind everyone that the magic of the movies was first invented in Astoria, Queens, not Hollywood. ''I don't believe in less is more,'' Mr. Russo said. ''Even when I worked with Dries Van Noten, he would say he wanted simplicity, but simplicity that hurts.''
No pain, no gain is an unacknowledged Fashion Week theme. Why mount an ordinary runway show when you can have the artist Rachel Feinstein build a fantastical dreamland set? Marc Jacobs did that Monday, spending on his show an amount roughly equal to several half-million-dollar MacArthur Foundation ''genius awards.'' Those awards finance creative artists for years, if not lifetimes. Mr. Jacobs's show was over in less time than it takes for a cigarette break.
For a W magazine and P & G Prestige party to entertain 1,000 guests at the colossal and poetic Park Avenue Armory, its producers hung 60-foot curtains sewn from 35,000 square feet of linen; imported movie stars like Cate Blanchett; and set up a 50-foot screen for a video installation by the photographer Solve Sundsbo in which Lara Stone turned into a hawk, a tree and David Agbodji. Or was it the other way around?
''The genius of fashion is that it's cinematic, it's immediate, it's easy access, you don't need a ticket,'' said Stefano Tonchi, the editor in chief of W. ''You don't even have to buy the clothes'' to participate in ''the vibe, the mood, the atmosphere.''
What few note about Fashion Week is that fashion is not, in every sense, at all about clothes, RoseLee Goldberg, the art historian and director of the performance art-biennial Performa said that evening. ''No one looks hard enough at the creative energy that comes into it,'' the intensity of unlikely talents that amass in the city two times a year.
''It's all rather amazing,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ''It's not just party time.''

HEADLINE: Wars and Growth

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: What do we know about fiscal policy, and how do we know it? 

 BODY:
What inspired my last post was the work by Bob Hall and Valerie Ramey using changes in defense spending to try to get at Keynesian effects. (See Christy Romer's speech (pdf) for references and an extended discussion). Why do this? Because, as Christy makes clear, you really want natural experiments: big changes in government spending that aren't a response to economic conditions. And basically wars and military buildups -- and then the downsizing after the war -- are the only times this has happened in America. Elsewhere, you get austerity programs, which offer another set of natural experiments.
The Hall approach is to compare changes in real defense spending as a percentage of the previous year's GDP with the actual percentage growth in real GDP. Over the period 1930-1962 -- no point going further, since there hasn't been a good case since the Korean War -- it looks like this:
Clearly, expansionary policy is expansionary, and contractionary policy is contractionary. The apparent multiplier is only about 0.5, but anyone who knows a bit about the history realizes that this is likely to be an underestimate for current conditions: during World War II private spending was constrained by rationing, and postwar effects of the military contraction were partially offset by the pent-up consumer demand; the Korean War was paid for with tax increases amounting to around 4 percent of GDP.
As I argued in the previous post, the reverse is likely to be true for European austerity now: the effects of reduced government spending have surely been reinforced by other factors, so the apparent multiplier of 3 is too high.
But Keynes does really win from these data.

HEADLINE: News Nonprofit in Chicago to Suspend Operations

BYLINE: BRIAN STELTER


HIGHLIGHT: The Chicago News Cooperative was founded in 2009 to compete online with The Tribune and The Sun-Times; its articles have appeared in regional editions of The New York Times. 

 BODY:
The Chicago News Cooperative, a nonprofit news organization that provided news to The New York Times and tried to compete online with The Chicago Tribune and The Chicago Sun-Times, will suspend operations the week of Feb. 26, its editor, James O'Shea, said.
The decision came after the main supporter of the cooperative, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, changed the types of grants that it could quality for, effectively reducing its potential financing. The news organization's second-biggest source of funds, The Times, was then asked to contribute more, but both parties concluded that "did not make economic sense," Mr. O'Shea said in a telephone interview Sunday.
The Times, which twice a week has been including two pages of the cooperative's content in its Chicago edition, will stop doing so at the end of the month. Mr. O'Shea said he was grateful to The Times for supporting the cooperative since its conception. "We would have never gotten off the ground without them," he said.
The Times expressed pride in its relationship with the Chicago News Cooperative. "The C.N.C. was a worthy experiment, created to find a viable model to support enterprising public affairs journalism," said Eileen M. Murphy, a spokeswoman for the newspaper. "While this model was not sustainable in the end, The Times remains committed to looking for solutions in support of an extremely worthwhile goal."
Nonprofit news start-ups have tried - some successfully and some not - to put down roots in several cities. One such organization in California, The Bay Citizen, which contributes material to San Francisco Bay Area editions of The Times, is said to be considering a merger with an older, similar news organization in Berkeley.
In Chicago, Mr. O'Shea and several other former journalists from The Tribune set up the cooperative in 2009 to produce what he called "public service journalism." The start-up employed 15 to 20 people, seven of them full-time employees.
Mr. O'Shea informed the staff of the suspension on Friday. He said he was trying to find financing to continue education coverage.
The start-up, he said, was put at a disadvantage by the Internal Revenue Service, which has not yet determined whether the cooperative and news start-ups like it will qualify for tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status.
The primary lesson, Mr. O'Shea said, is that news start-ups should "try to get at least two to three years of financing" before starting. In recent months, he said, he had spent a substantial amount of time raising money, and "being a journalist, to be honest, that wasn't my favorite part of this."

HEADLINE: For Younger Mothers, Out-of-Wedlock Births Are the New Normal

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: It's good that society no longer stigmatizes single mothers, but is it really good for 53 percent of children born to women under 30 to be born out of wedlock? 

 BODY:
As of 2009, more than half of all children born to women under 30 were born to unmarried women. 
Unmarried mothers, in some areas, have become the norm, no longer stigmatized by society. Regular readers of this blog will know that while births among teenagers are down in recent years, the majority of commenters here, at least, would support, not shun, a teenager of their acquaintance with a baby. That tolerance clearly extends to all unmarried mothers. Many of us pride ourselves on the modernity of this relatively new way of thinking - who would insist that only a family mirroring some 50's-sitcom image of "nuclear" can raise a happy, healthy child?
But is our pride misplaced? Fifty-three percent of all children born to women under 30 is an awful lot of children born outside of what's been considered, for more than a handful of years, the most stable family structure. 
The Times reporters Jason DeParle and Sabrina Tavernise spoke to dozens of people in Lorain, Ohio, a blue-collar town west of Cleveland where the decline of the married two-parent family has been especially steep, with 63 percent of births to women under 30 occurring outside of marriage. The young parents of Lorain said their reliance on the government safety net encouraged them to stay single and that they didn't trust their youthful peers to be reliable partners. Many said they would like to be married - just not right now, and not to each other.
What's most troubling about these figures is that marriage is good for children. 
"Researchers have consistently found that children born outside marriage face elevated risks of falling into poverty, failing in school or suffering emotional and behavioral problems," write Mr. DeParle and Ms. Tavernise. Most births outside of a marriage are to couples who are living together, but marriages last longer than alternative arrangements. Tax-saving economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers may be the exception, but statistically, co-habitation arrangements in the United States are more than twice as likely to dissolve than marriages. 
"Marriage," says Frank Furstenberg, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, "has become a luxury good." 
Overwhelmingly, the more educated you are, the more likely you are to marry before having children. Bearing children outside of wedlock is a trend that's most strongly affecting young adults who are already at an economic disadvantage, and that means that its impact is deeply tangled within a host of other problems, from the decline in blue-collar jobs to the difficulty of finding affordable child care. 
The further we go in this direction, the more single parents (mostly mothers, but not all) will find themselves and their children living without the stability and security that helps build a happy family life. It's hard not to think of this as a problem. But can we condemn the societal result without condemning either the parents or children it describes?
Can we find a way to support marriage at all levels of society without recreating the stigma for unmarried mothers and their children, and should we? Statistically, married parents are better for children in many ways. But is it the marriage, or the greater stability that often correlates with marriage, that makes the difference, and which should we be trying to affect? How concerned should we be about this 53 percent?

HEADLINE: Is This the End of Market Democracy?

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: The decline of the middle class is altering the shape of liberal capitalism as we know it. At least that's what the experts think. 

 BODY:
The 2012 election will offer voters a stark choice between right and left alternatives.
President Obama is calling for:
investing in things like education that gives everybody a chance to succeed. A tax code that makes sure everybody pays their fair share. And laws that make sure everybody follows the rules. That's what will transform our economy. That's what will grow our middle class again.
Republicans, in turn, are denouncing the expansion of a Democratic "entitlement society" and what they see as a trend toward European social democracy. They are calling for sharply reduced taxes, regulation and government spending to free market forces and revive private sector economic growth.
While Americans are going to be able to choose between two contrasting ideologies, what if both choices are off the mark? What if the legitimacy of free market capitalism in America is facing fundamental challenges that the candidates and their parties are not addressing?
Here are some of the issues that are making some politicians and political thinkers uneasy:
Are large segments of the American workforce - millions of people - at a structural disadvantage in the face of global competition, technological advance and ever more sophisticated forms of automation? Is this situation permanent?
Will the share of profits from improving corporate productivity flowing to capital and to high-earning C.E.O.s continue to grow, while the income of wage earners stagnates and their share of profits declines?
Has the surging wealth and income of the top one percent and of the top 0.1 percent reached a tipping point at which the political leverage of the very affluent decisively outweighs the influence of the electorate at large?
Is it possible that in the United States and Europe, democratic free market capitalism is no longer capable of providing broadly shared benefits to a solid majority of workers?
These are matters of concern to many highly respected experts - people not known for leftist jeremiads. Among them are Columbia University professor Jeffrey Sachs; Nobel Prize winner Michael Spence; Francis Fukuyama, senior fellow at Stanford's Center on Democracy; former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers; and three of the nation's foremost labor economists, Richard Freeman and Lawrence Katz, both of Harvard, and David Autor of M.I.T.
None of these authorities is proposing an alternative to, or radical remaking of, free market capitalism, but they are all concerned by the weakening of the social fabric associated with contemporary economic trends and with the damage that can be inflicted by market forces.
Freeman, for example, wrote in an email to The Times that increases in inequality "threaten the success of democratic capitalism." Freeman contends that the:
economic interests of small groups of "crony capitalists" have come to dominate government responses to the financial crisis and ensuing recession. The danger is not an ever-expanding socialist state, per Hayek's road to serfdom, but of a move to economic feudalism, in which a small set of wealthy masters dominate markets and the state and subvert or outsmart efforts to regulate their behavior or rein them in.
The rich, Freeman argues, will always use their resources to protect their interests. But now, he says, "inequality is off the charts" in the United States, giving the rich unprecedented power to influence political outcomes. This reality was forcefully driven home, Freeman says, in the aftermath of the 2008 collapse when the most culpable banks were able to extort continued control over the decisions of policy makers and legislators.
Spence wrote to The Times that capitalist market "incentives are good at efficiency, growth and innovation. They are proving weak or deficient in stability, equity and sustainability." He warns that during the economic transformations that drive globalization:
things change in a non-cyclical way and we are not adapting fast enough. We (advanced countries broadly) are making very poor inter-temporal choices, failing to agree on who pays for what and then deciding implicitly to let our children and grandchildren pay instead.
In a paper published by the Council on Foreign Relations, Spence and co-author Sandile Hlatshwayo argue that the employment problems of the United States do not result from market failure. Just the opposite: the problems arise from an exceptionally efficient global marketplace. Instead of benefiting from the market, many in the United States, particularly those holding mid-level skill jobs that can be performed at lower cost overseas, are paying the costs of efficiency - the victims, in effect, of creative destruction.
Multinational companies, Spence and Hlatshwayo write, "are doing exactly what one would expect them to do. The resulting efficiency of the global system is high and rising. So, there is no market failure." In the postwar period from 1946 to the mid-1970s, the United States benefited enormously from globalization, which opened new markets for American products.
"We now appear to be at a crossroads," Spence and Hlatshwayo contend:
 as emerging economies of less developed nations begin to produce goods at lower cost and often of higher quality than American-made goods. Many of those effects are positive. Consumer goods, for example, are less expensive than they would be in a less open environment. But the distributional effects may be negative. Within countries, inequality may rise. Between countries, the success of the emerging economies may impose costs on richer ones.
Fukuyama, in an provocatively titled essay - "The Future of History: Can Liberal Democracy Survive the Decline of the Middle Class?" - which appeared in a recent issue of Foreign Affairs, warns that 
the benefits of the most recent waves of technological innovation have accrued disproportionately to the most talented and well-educated members of society. This phenomenon helped cause the massive growth of inequality in the United States over the past generation.
Fukuyama's conclusion is pessimistic:
There are a lot of reasons to think that inequality will continue to worsen. The current concentration of wealth in the United States has already become self-reinforcing: as the economist Simon Johnson has argued, the financial sector has used its lobbying clout to avoid more onerous forms of regulation. Schools for the well-off are better than ever; those for everyone else continue to deteriorate. Elites in all societies use their superior access to the political system to protect their interests, absent a countervailing democratic mobilization to rectify the situation. American elites are no exception to the rule.
Sachs and Katz are somewhat more hopeful, but their optimism is based on the politically problematic proposition that the United States can adopt wage and income policies similar to those in Scandinavian countries.
Katz told The Times that
the current trajectory of technological change and globalization leads to a polarization of labor demand in rich countries increasing demand for high-end, college plus jobs using analytical skills and creativity, hollowing out traditional middle skill jobs (bottom half of college, top half of non-college) like middle management, clerical, and manufacturing production, and expanding demand for in-person services.
The United States could moderate these trends and achieve some broadly shared prosperity with increased job training, granting workers more leverage in wage bargaining, infrastructure spending, progressive taxation and an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor, according to Katz. "There are international examples of moving in the direction of Scandinavia," he notes, adding that he is hopeful "about the potential for a vibrant market economy with a strong role for government generating shared prosperity. But not for unfettered 19th century capitalism."
Sachs, in turn, wrote The Times that in his view, "a social democracy - capitalism plus a hefty dose of state support for families, education, early childhood development, higher education, and active labor market policies - can still do the job. The performance of northern Europe, around 120 million people including Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, provides a good illustration of this success." Social Democracy and Europeans' aggressive use of government to lessen class disparities is just what Romney and most other Republicans are campaigning against. It goes without saying that the current European Union crisis leaves Obama and his allies unable to champion the European solution.
Summers, former treasury secretary and director of the National Economic Council, now back working as an economist at Harvard, is also worried about the potential vulnerabilities of capitalism. Summers wrote on Jan. 8, 2012, in the Financial Times:
The spread of stagnation and abnormal unemployment from Japan to the rest of the industrialized world does raise doubts about capitalism's efficacy as a promoter of employment and rising living standards for a broad middle class. The problem is genuine.
While Summers believes that the free market can be reformed, he provides few specifics, although his doubts are explicit:
Serious questions about the fairness of capitalism are being raised. These are driven by sharp increases in unemployment beyond the business cycle - one in six of American men between 25 and 54 is likely to be out of work even after the economy recovers - combined with dramatic rises in the share of income going to the top 1 percent (and even the top 0.01 percent) of the population and declining social mobility. The problem is real and profound and seems very unlikely to correct itself untended.
Economists have been exploring the issues of inequality and mobility for decades, but the collapse of 2008 and its aftermath have intensified these concerns, leading to a stronger interest in the implications for democratic capitalism.
Autor, of M.I.T., has conducted an extensive analysis of job markets demonstrating how advances in technology and trade at times inflict substantial harm on displaced workers. Autor, in an interview, said he believes that on balance, the benefits of trade and technological advance clearly outweigh the losses, but the losses are worse than many have acknowledged, and fall with devastating force on specific populations in the workforce.
Overall, Autor has found that the combination of three trends - automation; the emergence of a trade-based international labor force; and the movement of jobs offshore - has polarized the job market. There is growth at the high and low ends, but the middle collapses:
Concretely, employment and earnings are rising in both high education professional, technical and managerial occupations and, since the late 1980s, in low-education food service, personal care and protective service occupations. Conversely, job opportunities are declining in both middle-skill, white collar clerical, administrative, and sales occupations and in middle-skill, blue-collar production, craft and operative occupations. The decline in middle-skill jobs has been detrimental to the earnings and labor force participation rates of workers without a four-year college education, and differentially so for males, who are increasingly concentrated in low-paying service occupations.
In a detailed study of the effects of imports from China that compares regions where goods from China have replaced those produced locally with regions where imports did not replace local production, Autor and two colleagues found:
Rising exposure (to trade) increases unemployment, lowers labor force participation, and reduces wages in local labor markets. Conservatively, it explains one-quarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in U.S. manufacturing employment. Transfer bene\xAC\x81t payments for unemployment, disability, retirement and healthcare also rise sharply in exposed labor markets. The deadweight loss of \xAC\x81nancing these transfers is one to two-thirds as large as U.S. gains from trade with China.
The debate over the workings of democracy, the market, technology and globalization remains unresolved. The political system instinctively avoids this debate, despite its salience and centrality, because the political costs of engagement are likely to substantially outweigh any potential gains. At an undetermined point in the not too distant future, however, as the "gale of creative destruction" blows through the heartland, the debate will become inescapable.
An earlier version of this column incorrectly described Jeffrey Sachs as a Nobel Prize winner. It also misspelled his first name. It is not spelled Jeffery.

HIGHLIGHT: Gen. Martin E. Dempsey talks about Iran, and Representative Ron Paul, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich weigh in on their standings in the Republican presidential race. 

 BODY:
Iran put up an increasingly aggressive front last week, threatening to cut off oil sales to Europe and posturing over the progress of its nuclear program, as well as drawing blame for assassination attempts on Israelis. The actions suggested that sanctions were working, as American and European officials announced negotiations over Iran's nuclear weapons program might resume soon.
National security and foreign policy officials are to visit the Sunday television shows to weigh in on tensions in the Middle East. On CNN's "Fareed Zakaria GPS," Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, discusses Iran, as well as whether arming the Syrian resistance movement would be a wise decision. Gen. Michael V. Hayden, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Edward S. Walker Jr., former ambassador to Egypt and Israel, will talk about the turmoil on CNN's "State of the Union."

As the Michigan primary approaches, recent polls show Rick Santorum running neck-and-neck with Mitt Romney. Mr. Santorum will discuss his momentum on CBS's "Face the Nation," which will also feature Michael Kranish, co-author of "The Real Romney."
Representative Ron Paul of Texas will talk about his standing in the Republican nominating contest on CNN's "State of the Union." Two other Republicans, Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana and Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, will also talk about the race. Plus, Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, will discuss job creation.
Senator John McCain of Arizona, the ranking Republican member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will join ABC's "This Week" from Afghanistan, weighing in on Iran and negotiations with the Taliban, as well as the Michigan primary. Also, Robert Gibbs, senior adviser to the Obama re-election campaign and former White House press secretary, will talk about the Republican nominating contest and its effects on the president's campaign.
On "Fox News Sunday," Newt Gingrich will address the upcoming primaries, particularly Super Tuesday. And now that Congress has passed an extension of the payroll tax cut, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, will talk about what is next.
Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland - the chairman and ranking member of the House Budget Committee, respectively - join NBC's "Meet the Press" to debate the economy, President Obama's budget proposal and the presidential race.
Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, will be on Bloomberg's "Political Capital."
C-Span's "Newsmakers" asks Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, about several of the recent debates in Washington, including the payroll tax cut extension, insurance coverage for contraceptives and the Keystone XL pipeline proposal.
Kamala D. Harris, Democrat and attorney general of California, discusses foreclosure fraud on TV One's "Washington Watch." She recently brokered the largest share of the nationwide settlement with banks over foreclosure abuses.
Telemundo's "Enfoque" features Representative Francisco Canseco, Republican of Texas, and Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California.
And Univision's "Al Punto" has Antonio Alarcon, who wrote a recent editorial in The Times about how his family had been separated by "self-deportation," an approach to illegal immigration Mr. Romney endorsed.

HEADLINE: Shining New Spotlight On Civil Rights Era

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- Drive through any state in the Deep South and you will find a monument or a museum dedicated to civil rights.
A visitor can peer into the motel room in Memphis where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was staying when he was shot or stand near the lunch counter in Greensboro, N.C., where four young men began a sit-in that helped end segregation.
Other institutions are less dramatic, like the Tubman African American Museum in Macon, Ga., where Jim Crow-era toilet fixtures are on display alongside folk art. 
But now, a second generation of bigger, bolder museums is about to emerge.
Atlanta; Jackson, Miss.; and Charleston, S.C., all have projects in the works. Coupled with the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, which breaks ground in Washington this week, they represent nearly $750 million worth of plans.
Collectively, they also signal an emerging era of scholarship and interest in the history of both civil rights and African-Americans that is to a younger generation what other major historical events were to their grandparents. ''We're at that stage where the civil rights movement is the new World War II,'' said Doug Shipman, the chief executive officer for the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, a $100 million project that is to break ground in Atlanta this summer and open in 2014.
''It's a move to the next phase of telling this story,'' he said.
The collection at the museum, which is to be set on two and half acres of prime downtown real estate donated by Coca-Cola, will include 10,000 documents and artifacts from Dr. King and a series of paintings based on the life of Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, by the artist Benny Andrews, who died in 2006.
Like many of the new museums, the Atlanta center aims higher than the first wave of monuments to the period. It will link the civil rights movement to global human rights, exploring how, for example, Dr. King's speeches helped fuel the Arab Spring.
Although the momentum for the new museums is strong, the recession has shaved the size and shape of some projects, and raising money can be a challenge.
John Fleming, the director of International African American Museum planned for Charleston and a former president of the Association of African American Museums, points to the United States National Slavery Museum in Fredericksburg, Va. That project, led by former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, was supposed to open on 38 acres in 2004. It recently went into bankruptcy, and people who donated money and artifacts are upset.
Although exactly what went wrong is still being debated, Mr. Fleming said that in part the project aimed too high and did not adjust as the economy softened. Mr. Fleming's own project began as an $80 million, 70,000-square-foot museum. Now, it is smaller by $30 million and 20,000 square feet.
''Most black museums have difficulty raising funds,'' Mr. Fleming said. ''Being truthful, I don't think people in the African-American community have stepped up to the plate in terms of making significant donations to these projects.''
Other directors disagree, saying a generation whose parents or grandparents lived through the 1950s and 1960s are now elected officials and on boards, where they have influence over where cultural dollars are spent.
''The folks who actually participated in the civil rights movement are getting to an age where legacy is important,'' said Lonnie G. Bunch III, director of the Smithsonian's African-American museum.
The election of President Obama, Mr. Shipman said, ''caps the civil rights era and opens up the next chapter. There is a distance that allows new questions to be asked.''
As with the Holocaust and other historical events that eventually moved from painful reality to memorials and then to museums and academic scholarship, the importance of the civil rights movement gets heightened as the last of the participants begin to die.
''In some ways, it's very much like the old Civil War veterans passing from the scene. Suddenly, the Civil War became more important,'' said Philip G. Freelon, the architect who has designed most of the major civil rights museums in the country, including the projects at the Smithsonian and in Atlanta and the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, a long-stalled project that finally secured $20 million from the State Legislature last April after Gov. Haley Barbour spoke in its favor.
The package comes with an additional $18 million to build an adjacent state history museum.
''These museums throughout the South are really a sea change,'' said William Ferris, a University of North Carolina folklorist who edited the Encyclopedia of Southern Culture. ''In Mississippi, to see a major civil rights museum is heartening in every sense.''
For some, however, there is concern that the movement to isolate the era in bigger and better museums helps people avoid meaningful conversations about racism that still expresses itself in everything from interactions at a grocery store to the presidential election.
''All of these efforts are important, but we still have not addressed the issue of race in America, and until we do, that hydra is going to keep raising its ugly head,'' said Ayisha Cisse-Jeffries, vice president for global affairs and international policy at the African American Islamic Institute.
And then there is the question of attendance. With so many museums with similar themes, are there enough interested visitors?
Directors say the idea is to create a network of institutions that enhance one another rather than detract. And each place intends to have a specific focus. In Charleston, where fund-raising is beginning for a museum dedicated to slavery, visitors will be able to walk the ground where 40 percent of the Africans who would be sold as slaves arrived. The museum in Washington will be the most prominent. An estimated four million visitors are expected each year.
Its vast collection will be more archival, and will include the original ''Soul Train'' sign, the dress that Rosa Parks wore the day she refused to give up her seat on the bus and the gospel hymn book that belonged to Harriet Tubman.
As with many museums and collections dedicated to African-American history -- there are more than 200 -- the goal is to use black history as a lens on America.
''It is a new day, and the new day means this isn't a time to remedy prior omissions,'' Mr. Bunch said. ''It really is a time to say this is how to understand who we are as Americans.''

HEADLINE: Fearing That a Pay Raise Will Be Bad for Business

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Charles Cestaro runs a prospering business in the Bronx cleaning offices and stores, and he knows firsthand what the work is like because he himself long toiled as a cleaner.
As a teenager, he found a job as a window washer, hauling a bucket and a squeegee to delis and dry cleaners in the North Bronx. He worked his way up, literally, strapping himself to apartment windows 10 floors high and also waxing floors and scrubbing ''way too many bathrooms.''
Today, Mr. Cestaro's Servco Industries, based in a coffee-colored, one-story bunker in Westchester Square, has annual sales of over $5 million and clients that include Sears and Kmart stores. Like many cleaning contractors, he pays most workers $7.25 an hour, the minimum under federal and state law.
The State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg recently announced that they wanted to raise the state's minimum wage to $8.50 an hour, or roughly $17,000 a year. It would be a 17 percent increase, and the first since the previous federal increase, three years ago. ''People who work full time should not be poor,''Mr. Silver said, arguing that the current minimum wage was too low for survival. 
But Mr. Cestaro fears that if he charges more he will lose customers, a concern shared by many other business owners in fiercely competitive, low-skilled businesses like fast-food restaurants and some manufacturing.
''They're not going to want to absorb it,'' Mr. Cestaro, 54, said. ''They'll say, 'Let's do it ourselves. We can save a bundle of money.' ''
Mr. Cestaro, who employs 250 workers, argues that he provides jobs that are in precious demand in a lagging economy. ''There's a need to fill positions that don't require a specific skill,'' he said. ''When the labor rate moves up, what happens to those people who don't have a skill? When the day comes when the labor rate is $11, where I can buy a more skilled labor force because I was forced to pay that wage, what's going to happen to those people who don't have a skill set?''
As he sees it, the 60 to 75 people -- most Latino immigrants -- who every week apply for a job at his company are evidence of the demand for jobs paying $7.25 an hour.
One of Mr. Cestaro's workers, Rosa Castillo, 39, works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at a Kmart in the Bronx, swabbing restrooms, vacuuming floors, emptying trash containers. She works seven days a week so she can earn overtime. She took the job after moving to the city six weeks ago from Mission, Texas, where her mother and six siblings live, and failing to find work as a waitress. She can afford New York, she said, because she lives rent-free at her uncle's apartment. Except for necessities like subway fare, she sends almost all her earnings to her husband, who lives in Honduras with their stepdaughter.
She would like the minimum wage raised but has qualms.
''I think it's good because I'd be able to make more money,'' she said. But she fears that her hours could be cut and that she would earn even less.
Mr. Cestaro, a trimly built, amiable man who favors designer jeans and leather boots, has had his share of lucky breaks, but his business story is mostly one of hard work. He is a workaholic who has not taken a vacation in five years. His major indulgences are his red Ferrari 360 Spider convertible, which costs $240,000, his collection of guitars and the time he spends with his 7-year-old daughter, Giselle (he is a single father).
When rock 'n' roll gigs were not earning him a living at 20, he trimmed his shaggy hair, pulled out his single earring and, in 1979, with his father's financial help, started a door-to-door cleaning company out of his parents' home. Within four years, he was renting a $300-a-month storefront and employing two workers. His first boldface-name client was Giorgio Armani in Manhattan.
He learned how risky the business could be when one of his cleaners accidentally sprayed bleach on a $16,000 Armani dress. Mr. Cestaro, with some proceeds from his insurance company, bought the blemished dress, and his sister altered it into a skirt for his niece.
''It's a nonrespected industry because people can buy the service at the same price you're charging,'' he said. ''People don't look at cleaning bathrooms or carpets as a skilled trade.''
He says that in 1996 he was charging clients $15.50 per worker per hour and that he is probably charging $15.50 to $17.50 today. His profit margin, he said, has declined to 9 percent from about 15 percent a decade ago.
His argument that raising the minimum wage might frighten clients is not uncommon in low-wage industries. Jamie Richardson, vice president of the 415-branch White Castle hamburger chain, said that if New York raised its wage, he might trim staff members or choose new locations in states like Indiana and Tennessee with lower minimums.
''Adding costs is a job killer,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''Our customers are real resistant to paying more.''
However, a champion of raising the minimum wage, David Bolotsky, the chief executive of Uncommon Goods, a Brooklyn-based firm that sells designer gift items and pays its entry-level workers $10 an hour, said, ''I could not look at myself in the mirror and pay somebody $7.25 an hour -- you can't live on it.''
For Mr. Cestaro, figuring out his price point can involve higher mathematics. He charges by floor space and what he calls density; an office floor that has 10,000 square feet with five desks is less costly than one with 80 desks. Apparel stores are a special category; clothing and sales tags have to be picked off the floor before mopping and waxing can begin. Restaurants are also a challenge because of the meticulous detail work required by health department letter grades.
Particularly skilled cleaners will receive up to $11 an hour. Cleaners in buildings that require unionized workers start at $9.20 an hour. Even a $7.25 worker costs an extra $1.74 for every hour worked because of liability and disability insurance, Social Security and other costs. Equipment can also be expensive; drivable scrubbing machines cost up to $12,000 each.
Should the minimum wage be raised this year, Mr. Cestaro cannot charge a store like Sears any more because he is under a long-term contract.
''Sears could care less what the minimum wage is,'' he said, ''because I'm obligated to them until 2015.''

HEADLINE: Not Poor, but Relying on the Safety Net

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Even Critics of Safety Net Increasingly Depend on It'' (front page, Feb. 12):
Somehow an assumption has invaded our thinking that people must take all the government subsidies they can get.
In past generations, it was an considered an embarrassment to need government assistance. Somehow, we have become ''entitled.'' People calculate when to begin collecting Social Security based on how to maximize the number of dollars they can receive. People who are unemployed head straight for the unemployment office to begin to collect their checks, whether they really need the money or not. 
What if instead of complaining to the government, we simply took responsibility for ourselves and declined to apply for any government subsidies we didn't absolutely need? What if we relied on peer pressure rather than government regulations to bring about this change?
It will take time to change back the public perception of ''entitlements'' and to rekindle a pride in not needing help from the government. Then only people who find themselves in the unfortunate position to really need ''charity'' from their fellow citizens will seek out government subsidies.

To the Editor:
Government benefits should make no one feel guilty.
After World War II the deficit was much higher as a percentage of our gross domestic product, but we rejected austerity. In that decade and a half under Harry S. Truman, a Democrat, then Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican, millions of veterans earned college degrees at government expense.
Expanding ''entitlements,'' Social Security became nearly universal, benefits increased and coverage was added for disability. We built Interstate highways, the largest public works program ever. The result was not debt and destruction, but great prosperity.

To the Editor:
Your article makes the revealing point that middle-class people who have increasingly come to depend on government programs to survive ''are frustrated that they need help, feel guilty for taking it and resent the government for providing it.''
That response should not be a surprise. In the United States, the exaggerated ethic of self-reliance makes the acceptance of government help an admission of failure. During the Great Depression the anger and frustration the unemployed felt were often turned inward to feelings of guilt and self-recrimination.
Today right-wing antigovernment rhetoric gives people caught in that bind a release from guilt, allowing them to focus their resentment on the government rather than themselves and to righteously assert the individualistic virtues they violate but still believe in. Such self-defeating duplicity is a tragic symptom of the excessive individualism that currently distorts our politics.

To the Editor:
This article clearly reveals why the ''safety net'' exists and grows.
For the people interviewed, private enterprise doesn't cover what Adam Smith cited as essential to the free market: wages that cover the costs of living according to the standards of the day. So, in a real sense, food stamps, unemployment insurance, school lunch programs, the earned income tax credit and other government programs can be seen as subsidizing businesses that can't afford to pay livable wages instead of being viewed as putting working people ''on the dole.''

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit In Japan Hits Record

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Japan posted a record trade deficit in January as the yen's strength and weaker global demand eroded profits at manufacturers and slowed the nation's recovery from the earthquake and tsunami last year. 
The trade gap widened to 1.48 trillion yen ($19 billion) and shipments dropped 9.3 percent compared with a year earlier, as energy imports surged, the Ministry of Finance reported on Monday in Tokyo. The median estimate of 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a shortfall of 1.46 trillion yen.
The drag from trade risks countering the boost from reconstruction work. The government is making progress in its campaign to rein in the yen, with the currency trading at the weakest in seven months against the dollar after the Bank of Japan last week announced extra monetary stimulus.
''The recovery pace may be slow,'' said Kiichi Murashima, chief economist at Citigroup Global Markets Japan in Tokyo. ''That's because a recovery in exports may be dull and reconstruction demand may not come out as strongly as some people expect.''
The trade figures may have been skewed by a Lunar New Year holiday falling in January instead of February this year, reducing business days in Asia.
Shipments to China, Japan's largest market, fell 20 percent from a year earlier, the biggest decline since August 2009. Exports to Europe slid 7.7 percent and shipments to the United States advanced 0.6 percent.
The Japanese economy contracted an annualized 2.3 percent last quarter. Net exports, or overseas shipments less imports, subtracted 2.6 percentage points from this figure, the government said in a report last week.
The country's trade deficit of 2.49 trillion yen in 2011 was the second largest since World War II. That also contributed to the nation's current-account surplus sliding to a 15-year low in 2011.
The earthquake and tsunami led to the idling of nuclear plants and a surge in energy imports. Japan's liquefied natural gas imports rose 12.2 percent to a record in 2011 as power utilities increased thermal power generation.
Energy needs accounted for most of the gain in imports in January.
''The deficit is still expanding against a background of increasing energy imports,'' said Masaaki Kanno, chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Chase in Tokyo. ''Unless we see a significant increase in the operating rate of nuclear power plants, eventually the rising cost of power will be translated to the corporations.''

HEADLINE: Pressed by Unrest and Money Woes, Egypt Accepts I.M.F. Loan

BYLINE: By LIAM STACK

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Egypt's transitional government announced plans on Sunday to sign a loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund worth $3.2 billion, less than a year after abruptly turning its back on a loan from the international lender, according to state media. 
The $3.2 billion loan will throw a much-needed financial lifeline to Egypt, a country reeling from a year of economic crisis and social unrest after the ouster of the longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak a year ago.
The deal bears a striking resemblance to one Egypt's military rulers negotiated, and abruptly rejected, last spring, citing concerns that it would saddle future governments with such a large debt that it would amount to a violation of Egyptian sovereignty.
Those objections appear to have been eclipsed by the country's mounting economic troubles, which have grown increasingly dire as persistent social unrest has led to a collapse of the tourism industry and the flight of foreign investors.
Since October, seemingly monthly street clashes between protesters and security forces have killed more than 100 people and battered and burned much of downtown Cairo, leaving it divided by concrete walls and coils of razor wire.
The loan will be disbursed in three stages over the next 12 months at an interest rate of 1.2 percent , the state-run newspaper Al Ahram reported Sunday. The first installment, around $1 billion, will be delivered once Egypt signs the agreement in March.
The newspaper also reported that Egypt was negotiating a $1 billion loan from the World Bank, in part to make up for economic assistance pledged by Gulf Arab nations more than a year ago that never materialized.
Egypt's foreign reserves have plummeted from a high of $36 billion, before the revolution, to around $10 billion in late January, as the government has spent vast amounts to bolster the currency, which has come under mounting pressure.
A devaluation of the Egyptian pound may be inescapable, economists say, raising the specter of increasing inflation and the potential for even greater social unrest.
The tourism industry, long a lifeblood of the economy, has all but collapsed since the revolution, and a steady drumbeat of anti-American sentiment in the state-run media seems likely to keep many visitors away.
Egypt's military rulers may also be concerned about the possible loss of more than $1.5 billion of American aid over a dispute with the United States that has driven relations between the allies to a 30-year low.
Egyptian authorities have accused several nonprofit groups, including four supported by the United States, of operating without proper licenses and illegally receiving millions of dollars of American assistance in the last several years.
Criminal charges have been brought against 43 employees of the groups, including 19 Americans. Only seven of the Americans are still in Egypt, but they have been barred from leaving the country.
The American-supported groups include the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute, which have close ties to leaders in the United States Congress. American officials have tried to defuse the crisis through diplomacy, urging the ruling military council to throw out the charges against the Americans or at least allow them to leave the country.
It is an effort that has so far born little fruit. On Saturday, Egypt announced that proceedings against the 43 defendants would begin in a Cairo criminal court on Sunday.

HEADLINE: Pressure, Chinese and Foreign, Drives Changes at Foxconn

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and CHARLES DUHIGG; David Barboza reported from Beijing, and Charles Duhigg from New York.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The announcement Saturday that Foxconn Technology -- one of the world's largest electronics manufacturers -- will sharply raise salaries and reduce overtime at its Chinese factories signals that pressure from workers, international markets and concerns among Western consumers about working conditions is driving a fundamental shift that could accelerate an already rapidly changing Chinese economy.
But the true meaning of Foxconn's reforms, analysts say, will depend in part on how effectively the company can remake an economic system that has relied for much of the last decade on luring migrants to work cheaply for long hours in mammoth factories building smartphones, computers and other electronics. 
Plants depend on workers' being at assembly lines six or seven days a week, often for as long as 14 hours a day. Such facilities have made it possible for devices to be turned out almost as quickly as they are dreamed up.
For that system to genuinely change, Foxconn, its competitors and their clients -- which include Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Dell and the world's other large electronics firms -- must convince consumers in America and elsewhere that improving factories to benefit workers is worth the higher prices of goods.
''This is the way capitalism is supposed to work,'' said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''As nations develop, wages rise and life theoretically gets better for everyone.
''But in China, for that change to be permanent, consumers have to be willing to bear the consequences. When people read about bad Chinese factories in the paper, they might have a moment of outrage. But then they go to Amazon and are as ruthless as ever about paying the lowest prices.''
Foxconn, with 1.2 million Chinese employees, is one of China's largest employers. It assembles an estimated 40 percent of the smartphones, computers and other electronic gadgets sold around the world. Foxconn's decisions set standards other manufacturers must compete with.
The announcement by Foxconn, which said that it would raise salaries as much as 25 percent, to about $400 a month, came after an outcry over working conditions at its factories. In recent weeks, labor rights groups have staged coordinated protests in various countries after reports that some of Apple's Chinese suppliers operate harsh, abusive and dangerous facilities. To stem criticism, Apple hired a nonprofit labor group to inspect the plants it uses.
Workers welcomed the announced raises and overtime limits, though some were skeptical they would cause much real change. ''When I was in Foxconn, there were rumors about pay raises every now and then, but I've never seen that day happen until I left,'' said Gan Lunqun, 23, a former Foxconn worker. ''This time it sounds more credible.''
By bowing to such demands, Foxconn has conceded that employees and consumers have gained a sway once possessed only by Chinese bureaucrats and executives at the global electronics firms that hire Foxconn to build their products.
Foxconn's announcement also reflects how quickly China's economy is shifting. Many of the country's employers are facing labor shortages, which also puts upward pressure on wages, as do inflation and government demands to raise minimum wages.
Over 100 million migrant workers returned to their village homes this month to celebrate China's Spring Festival, otherwise known as the New Year. Traditionally, factories have had no problem luring those workers back. But many Chinese cities are still confronting serious labor shortages, even though the holiday ended weeks ago. A recent Chinese government report said this year's labor shortage was more pronounced than those in previous years.
And just as China's exporters are struggling to cope with labor shortages in coastal regions, they are also confronting higher raw material costs and a strengthening Chinese currency, which makes Chinese goods more expensive in other nations.
''China can't guarantee the low wages and costs they once did,'' said Ron Turi of Element 3 Battery Venture, a consulting firm in the battery industry. ''And companies like Foxconn have developed international profiles, and so they have to worry about how they're seen by people living in places with very different standards.''
No other company in the world has quite the manufacturing scale of Foxconn. Nearly every global electronics company has some tie to the manufacturing giant, and while much of its work can be done cheaply, with low-skilled workers, the sheer volume of goods and scale of its operations make it China's single biggest exporter.
Some of its campuses are considered small cities, with as many as 200,000 workers. Many are housed in dormitories near the assembly lines and are expected to be ready to rush into work should new orders flow in.
The Foxconn model, though, is under pressure. While most companies operate with similar dormitories, wage structures and work schedules, staffing Foxconn's large sites has grown increasingly difficult. A new generation of young people in China are more reluctant to migrate to coastal cities, live in factory dorms and toil long hours. Many are staying closer to home, because of new opportunities in inland provinces. That has created labor shortages on the coast.
Social scientists say young people here are also less willing to accept factory jobs for long periods. Meanwhile, demographic changes have meant China has fewer young people to join the work force.
If the workers will not move to the coast, the logic is that the coastal factories ought to move to where the workers are living. Big manufacturers like Foxconn have responded to such challenges by moving factories inland.
And worried that the old model is dying, Foxconn has announced plans to invest in millions of robots and automate aspects of production.

HEADLINE: Pain Without Gain

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Last week the European Commission confirmed what everyone suspected: the economies it surveys are shrinking, not growing. It's not an official recession yet, but the only real question is how deep the downturn will be.
And this downturn is hitting nations that have never recovered from the last recession. For all America's troubles, its gross domestic product has finally surpassed its pre-crisis peak; Europe's has not. And some nations are suffering Great Depression-level pain: Greece and Ireland have had double-digit declines in output, Spain has 23 percent unemployment, Britain's slump has now gone on longer than its slump in the 1930s.
Worse yet, European leaders -- and quite a few influential players here -- are still wedded to the economic doctrine responsible for this disaster. 
For things didn't have to be this bad. Greece would have been in deep trouble no matter what policy decisions were taken, and the same is true, to a lesser extent, of other nations around Europe's periphery. But matters were made far worse than necessary by the way Europe's leaders, and more broadly its policy elite, substituted moralizing for analysis, fantasies for the lessons of history.
Specifically, in early 2010 austerity economics -- the insistence that governments should slash spending even in the face of high unemployment -- became all the rage in European capitals. The doctrine asserted that the direct negative effects of spending cuts on employment would be offset by changes in ''confidence,'' that savage spending cuts would lead to a surge in consumer and business spending, while nations failing to make such cuts would see capital flight and soaring interest rates. If this sounds to you like something Herbert Hoover might have said, you're right: It does and he did.
Now the results are in -- and they're exactly what three generations' worth of economic analysis and all the lessons of history should have told you would happen. The confidence fairy has failed to show up: none of the countries slashing spending have seen the predicted private-sector surge. Instead, the depressing effects of fiscal austerity have been reinforced by falling private spending.
Furthermore, bond markets keep refusing to cooperate. Even austerity's star pupils, countries that, like Portugal and Ireland, have done everything that was demanded of them, still face sky-high borrowing costs. Why? Because spending cuts have deeply depressed their economies, undermining their tax bases to such an extent that the ratio of debt to G.D.P., the standard indicator of fiscal progress, is getting worse rather than better.
Meanwhile, countries that didn't jump on the austerity train -- most notably, Japan and the United States -- continue to have very low borrowing costs, defying the dire predictions of fiscal hawks.
Now, not everything has gone wrong. Late last year Spanish and Italian borrowing costs shot up, threatening a general financial meltdown. Those costs have now subsided, amid general sighs of relief. But this good news was actually a triumph of anti-austerity: Mario Draghi, the new president of the European Central Bank, brushed aside the inflation-worriers and engineered a large expansion of credit, which was just what the doctor ordered.
So what will it take to convince the Pain Caucus, the people on both sides of the Atlantic who insist that we can cut our way to prosperity, that they are wrong?
After all, the usual suspects were quick to pronounce the idea of fiscal stimulus dead for all time after President Obama's efforts failed to produce a quick fall in unemployment -- even though many economists warned in advance that the stimulus was too small. Yet as far as I can tell, austerity is still considered responsible and necessary despite its catastrophic failure in practice.
The point is that we could actually do a lot to help our economies simply by reversing the destructive austerity of the last two years. That's true even in America, which has avoided full-fledged austerity at the federal level but has seen big spending and employment cuts at the state and local level. Remember all the fuss about whether there were enough ''shovel ready'' projects to make large-scale stimulus feasible? Well, never mind: all the federal government needs to do to give the economy a big boost is provide aid to lower-level governments, allowing these governments to rehire the hundreds of thousands of schoolteachers they have laid off and restart the building and maintenance projects they have canceled.
Look, I understand why influential people are reluctant to admit that policy ideas they thought reflected deep wisdom actually amounted to utter, destructive folly. But it's time to put delusional beliefs about the virtues of austerity in a depressed economy behind us.

HEADLINE: News Start-Up Halting Work

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
The Chicago News Cooperative, a nonprofit news organization that provided news to The New York Times and tried to compete online with The Chicago Tribune and The Chicago Sun-Times, will suspend operations the week of Feb. 26, its editor, James O'Shea, said. 
The decision came after the main supporter of the cooperative, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, changed the types of grants that it could quality for, effectively reducing its potential financing. The news organization's second-biggest source of funds, The Times, was then asked to contribute more, but both parties concluded that ''did not make economic sense,'' Mr. O'Shea said in a telephone interview Sunday.
The Times, which twice a week has been including two pages of the cooperative's content in its Chicago edition, will stop doing so at the end of the month. Mr. O'Shea said he was grateful to The Times for supporting the cooperative since its conception. ''We would have never gotten off the ground without them,'' he said.
The Times expressed pride in its relationship with the Chicago News Cooperative. ''The C.N.C. was a worthy experiment, created to find a viable model to support enterprising public affairs journalism,'' said Eileen M. Murphy, a spokeswoman for the newspaper. ''While this model was not sustainable in the end, The Times remains committed to looking for solutions in support of an extremely worthwhile goal.''
Nonprofit news start-ups have tried - some successfully and some not - to put down roots in several cities. One such organization in California, The Bay Citizen, which contributes material to San Francisco Bay Area editions of The Times, is said to be considering a merger with an older, similar news organization in Berkeley.
In Chicago, Mr. O'Shea and several other former journalists from The Tribune set up the cooperative in 2009 to produce what he called ''public service journalism.'' The start-up employed 15 to 20 people, seven of them full-time employees.
Mr. O'Shea informed the staff of the suspension on Friday. He said he was trying to find financing to continue education coverage.
The start-up, he said, was put at a disadvantage by the Internal Revenue Service, which has not yet determined whether the cooperative and news start-ups like it will qualify for tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status.
The primary lesson, Mr. O'Shea said, is that news start-ups should ''try to get at least two to three years of financing'' before starting. In recent months, he said, he had spent a substantial amount of time raising money, and ''being a journalist, to be honest, that wasn't my favorite part of this.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Iran Raid Seen As a Huge Task For Israeli Jets

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; Scott Shane contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Should Israel decide to launch a strike on Iran, its pilots would have to fly more than 1,000 miles across unfriendly airspace, refuel in the air en route, fight off Iran's air defenses, attack multiple underground sites simultaneously -- and use at least 100 planes.
That is the assessment of American defense officials and military analysts close to the Pentagon, who say that an Israeli attack meant to set back Iran's nuclear program would be a huge and highly complex operation. They describe it as far different from Israel's ''surgical'' strikes on a nuclear reactor in Syria in 2007 and Iraq's Osirak reactor in 1981.
''All the pundits who talk about 'Oh, yeah, bomb Iran,' it ain't going to be that easy,'' said Lt. Gen. David A. Deptula, who retired last year as the Air Force's top intelligence official and who planned the American air campaigns in 2001 in Afghanistan and in the 1991 Gulf War. 
Speculation that Israel might attack Iran has intensified in recent months as tensions between the countries have escalated. In a sign of rising American concern, Tom Donilon, the national security adviser, met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in Jerusalem on Sunday, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, warned on CNN that an Israeli strike on Iran right now would be ''destabilizing.'' Similarly, the British foreign secretary, William Hague, told the BBC that attacking Iran would not be ''the wise thing'' for Israel to do ''at this moment.''
But while an Israeli spokesman in Washington, Lior Weintraub, said the country continued to push for tougher sanctions on Iran, he reiterated that Israel, like the United States, ''is keeping all options on the table.''
The possible outlines of an Israeli attack have become a source of debate in Washington, where some analysts question whether Israel even has the military capacity to carry it off. One fear is that the United States would be sucked into finishing the job -- a task that even with America's far larger arsenal of aircraft and munitions could still take many weeks, defense analysts said. Another fear is of Iranian retaliation.
''I don't think you'll find anyone who'll say, 'Here's how it's going to be done -- handful of planes, over an evening, in and out,' '' said Andrew R. Hoehn, a former Pentagon official who is now director of the Rand Corporation's Project Air Force, which does extensive research for the United States Air Force.
Michael V. Hayden, who was the director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 2006 to 2009, said flatly last month that airstrikes capable of seriously setting back Iran's nuclear program were ''beyond the capacity'' of Israel, in part because of the distance that attack aircraft would have to travel and the scale of the task.
Still, a top defense official cautioned in an interview last week that ''we don't have perfect visibility'' into Israel's arsenal, let alone its military calculations. His views were echoed by Anthony H. Cordesman, an influential military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''There are a lot of unknowns, there are a lot of potential risks, but Israel may know that those risks aren't that serious,'' he said.
Given that Israel would want to strike Iran's four major nuclear sites -- the uranium enrichment facilities at Natanz and Fordo, the heavy-water reactor at Arak and the yellowcake-conversion plant at Isfahan -- military analysts say the first problem is how to get there. There are three potential routes: to the north over Turkey, to the south over Saudi Arabia or taking a central route across Jordan and Iraq.
The route over Iraq would be the most direct and likely, defense analysts say, because Iraq effectively has no air defenses and the United States, after its December withdrawal, no longer has the obligation to defend Iraqi skies. ''That was a concern of the Israelis a year ago, that we would come up and intercept their aircraft if the Israelis chose to take a path across Iraq,'' said a former defense official who asked for anonymity to discuss secret intelligence.
Assuming that Jordan tolerates the Israeli overflight, the next problem is distance. Israel has American-built F-15I and F-16I fighter jets that can carry bombs to the targets, but their range -- depending on altitude, speed and payload -- falls far short of the minimum 2,000-mile round trip. That does not include an aircraft's ''loiter time'' over a target plus the potential of having to fight off attacks from Iranian missiles and planes.
In any possibility, Israel would have to use airborne refueling planes, called tankers, but Israel is not thought to have enough. Scott Johnson, an analyst at the defense consulting firm IHS Jane's and the leader of a team preparing an online seminar on Israeli strike possibilities on Iran, said that Israel had eight KC-707 American-made tankers, although it is not clear they are all in operation. It is possible, he said, that Israel has reconfigured existing planes into tankers to use in a strike.
Even so, any number of tankers would need to be protected by ever more fighter planes. ''So the numbers you need just skyrocket,'' Mr. Johnson said. Israel has about 125 F-15Is and F-16Is. One possibility, Mr. Johnson said, would be to fly the tankers as high as 50,000 feet, making them hard for air defenses to hit, and then have them drop down to a lower altitude to meet up with the fighter jets to refuel.
Israel would still need to use its electronic warfare planes to penetrate Iran's air defenses and jam its radar systems to create a corridor for an attack. Iran's antiaircraft defenses may be a generation old -- in 2010, Russia refused to sell Iran its more advanced S-300 missile system -- but they are hardly negligible, military analysts say.
Iranian missiles could force Israeli warplanes to maneuver and dump their munitions before they even reached their targets. Iran could also strike back with missiles that could hit Israel, opening a new war in the Middle East, though some Israeli officials have argued that the consequences would be worse if Iran were to gain a nuclear weapon.
Another major hurdle is Israel's inventory of bombs capable of penetrating the Natanz facility, believed to be buried under 30 feet of reinforced concrete, and the Fordo site, which is built into a mountain.
Assuming it does not use a nuclear device, Israel has American-made GBU-28 5,000-pound ''bunker buster'' bombs that could damage such hardened targets, although it is unclear how far down they can go.
Earlier this month, a Bipartisan Policy Center report by Charles S. Robb, the former Democratic senator from Virginia, and Charles F. Wald, a retired Air Force general, recommended that the Obama administration sell Israel 200 enhanced GBU-31 ''bunker busters'' as well as three advanced refueling planes.
The two said that they were not advocating an Israeli attack, but that the munitions and aircraft were needed to improve Israel's credibility as it threatens a strike.
Should the United States get involved -- or decide to strike on its own -- military analysts said that the Pentagon had the ability to launch big strikes with bombers, stealth aircraft and cruise missiles, followed up by drones that could carry out damage assessments to help direct further strikes. Unlike Israel, the United States has plenty of refueling capability. Bombers could fly from Al Udeid air base in Qatar, Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean or bases in Britain and the United States.
Nonetheless, defense officials say it would still be tough to penetrate Iran's deepest facilities with existing American bombs and so are enhancing an existing 30,000-pound ''Massive Ordnance Penetrator'' that was specifically designed for Iran and North Korea.
''There's only one superpower in the world that can carry this off,'' General Deptula said. ''Israel's great on a selective strike here and there.''

HEADLINE: Media Hype For Lin Stumbles On Race

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; Twitter.com/carr2n

 BODY:
You don't have to be an economics graduate from Harvard like Jeremy Lin to do the math on the media explosion about Linsanity.
The suddenly celebrated Lin is a four-fer: a God-fearing, Asian-American, Ivy League benchwarmer who has changed the fortunes of the New York Knicks. That's a lot of glorious idiosyncrasy in one camera-ready package, especially in a town teeming with copy-hungry journalists.
Add in the fact that he is an actual team player wearing a Knicks uniform and it's like spotting a unicorn playing point guard at Madison Square Garden.
Since cracking the starting lineup because of an injury and other unusual circumstances, Lin, a 23-year-old, undrafted, unheralded, twice-cut player, has torn up the league, setting records for a first-time starter. 
Unfortunately for Lin and the rest of us, the over-the-top coverage that followed ended over the line, exposing underlying racist tropes that still lurk in the id of American sports journalism, and by extension, the rest of us.
From the start, his run threatened the tabloid supply of puns and superlatives. ''Lincredible!'' shouted The New York Post on Feb. 11. And because tabloids have a back page and front page to shout from, we've sometimes been treated to a double dose of wordplay: ''Lin and a Prayer'' was the cover headline on The Daily News one day last week, while the back page blared ''Just Lin Time.''
But all the froth and fun started to curdle, first on Twitter -- the Fox Sports columnist Jason Whitlock tweeted a crude reference about Lin's anatomy and the boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. suggested that Lin was getting attention because of his ethnicity, not his accomplishments -- and then in the tabloid press -- on Wednesday, perhaps at a loss after several breathless days of punning, The Post went with the unfortunate ''Amasian!''
The combination of Lin's ethnicity and accomplishments created some excess, but no one could have predicted how low it might go. On Saturday, an article on ESPN's mobile site recycled an ancient and blatantly offensive ethnic slur, and in the process suggested that some corners of sports journalism remained a backwater in the culture, a place untouched by a history of civil rights struggle and decades of progress. ESPN quickly changed the headline and has fired the person who wrote it, but not before all but ruining a sweet sporting story.
It would be lovely to rewind the tape and get back to a story that resonated with people like me -- I wouldn't watch pro basketball with your eyes -- for reasons that have nothing to do with Lin's ancestry and everything to do with his improbable rise.
Lin came out of nowhere -- the last Harvard player in the N.B.A. was a half-century ago -- which is all the more unusual in pro basketball, where, unlike pro baseball and football, almost every player comes with a strong pedigree and a high draft number.
The back story was irresistible: Lin was sleeping on his brother's couch on the Lower East Side; as a high school recruit, he was ignored by Stanford even though he played almost just down the street. Every angle was explored, including his Taiwanese grandmother taking in a game on television. (You know that something bigger than sports is under way when a politician mediates a cable dispute that has kept Lin off the air in parts of New York and basks in the reflected glory, as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York did on Friday.)
Pablo S. Torre, now a reporter for Sports Illustrated, first wrote about Lin in 2007 back when he worked at The Harvard Crimson. He has enjoyed watching and contributing to the mushroom cloud of coverage.
''I think there is every kind of demographic outlier in play with this story,'' he said. ''The beating heart of the story, no matter what anybody says, is the fact that he is Asian-American. Yes, the N.B.A. has Yao Ming, but Jeremy is normal-size and from this country, so it creates this huge cognitive dissonance. There is a novelty factor to seeing someone who looks like Jeremy doing this.''
Unfortunately, that novelty presented some asymmetries that turned an unlikely rise on any number of levels into a single note about race. The real story is more complicated and interesting than the one that lived in punny, lazy headlines: Lin is a proud Christian, which brings in the heartland. As an Asian-American, he represents the triumph of the immigrant. East Coast elites can find traction in his Harvard background, while actual basketball fans cannot resist his court knowledge and deft shooting hand.
This is a story that had something for everyone, including the journalists who covered it. Even though sports reporters are thought to be a deeply cynical bunch, every once in while a tale comes along that turns them all into fanboys. Here, amid the millionaires and endless contract talks, was a genuinely heartwarming saga. It may be bad manners to clap in the press box, but that doesn't mean reporters can't root for an amazing story.
The Lin story has broken out into the general culture because it is aspirational in the extreme, fulfilling notions that have nothing to do with basketball or race. Most of us are not superstars, but we believe we could be if only given the opportunity. We are, as a matter of practicality, a nation of supporting players, but who among us has not secretly thought we could be at the top of our business, company or team if the skies parted and we had our shot?
''I think once you get past all of these interesting variables of race, it is the quintessential underdog story,'' said Jason Gay, sports columnist at The Wall Street Journal, calling it the stuff of Hollywood screenplays.
How important is the theme of under-recognized brilliance? Mr. Gay wrote a piece about Ed Weiland, a part-time blogger and FedEx driver who first predicted two years ago -- based on a lot of wonky statistical analysis -- that ''Jeremy Lin is a good enough player to start in the N.B.A. and possibly star.'' For two days last week, that article was the most popular one on WSJ.com. When a journeyman blogger spots greatness in a journeyman point guard and you insert the alchemy of achievement, you've got a tale with legs.
Of course, what Lin is achieving is most likely not sustainable. Reporters who are penning exultant homage will be more than happy to be part of the crew that installs his feet of clay. But for the time being, who can blame them for hopping into the froth and ginning up more?
Sports, even for those of us who spent a fair amount of time being the last picked, are a palliative to the small and large indignities of actual life, a way to change the subject to the triumphs and failings of others. When someone who had been written off takes over Madison Square Garden and owns all the monied players around him, it's hard not to stop typing and marvel, along with the rest of the nation.
''A kid of out of nowhere plays lights-out basketball and has magical success in the center of the media world,'' said Terry McDonnell, the editor of Sports Illustrated, which put Lin on the cover last week. ''What's not to like?''
What's not to like is that part where some doofus writes a blatantly racist headline and a wonderful yarn turns ugly.
It turns out that the road to excess does not lead to the palace of wisdom, as William Blake said a long time ago. Sometimes the road to excess ends up in the ditch.

HEADLINE: Obama's Tax Policy Targets Rising Sector of His Base: the Affluent

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Partisan clashes over President Obama's proposed tax increases have obscured something remarkable: that the affluent Americans targeted by his policy represent a growing share of his own party's base.
You would not know it from Republican cries of class warfare swirling around Mr. Obama's new budget, which reiterates his calls for higher taxes on individuals earning more than $200,000 and households earning more than $250,000. Conventional understanding of election-season populism assumes that the president will be looking to stick it to die-hard Republicans.
In fact, affluent Americans have represented a growing portion of the Democratic Party for a generation. Even though Jimmy Carter won the presidency in 1976, for example, he trailed the Republican incumbent, Gerald Ford, 62 percent to 38 percent among voters in the highest income group (those earning more than $20,000, the equivalent of roughly $80,000 today) that were measured by people conducting exit polls.
By 2000, Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, trailed George W. Bush 54 percent to 43 percent among the highest income group (those earning more than $100,000). In winning the presidency four years ago, Mr. Obama defeated Senator John McCain by 52 percent to 46 percent among voters in the top income group, those earning more than $200,000. 
The conservative author Charles Murray, in his new book ''Coming Apart,'' which is about the nation's widening class divide, identifies ''Super ZIP codes'' that the ''hyper-wealthy and hyper-elite'' call home. Even as he proposed higher taxes on the wealthy in 2008, Mr. Obama beat Mr. McCain in 8 of the top 10 such ZIP codes -- by a ratio of 2 to 1 in communities like Atherton, Calif., Gladwyne, Pa., and Chappaqua, N.Y.
Mr. Obama also continued the Democrats' progress among the much larger group of upper-middle-class voters. In counties with above-average incomes that the research organization Patchwork Nation calls Monied 'Burbs, Mr. Obama received 55 percent of the vote, up from the 49 percent President Bill Clinton received in 1996, the 43 percent that the Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis received in 1988 and the 36 percent Mr. Carter received in 1980.
To make the point that he is not lashing out at opponents, Mr. Obama often notes that his proposals would raise his own taxes or those of allies like Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor. But the Democratic Party's increasing electoral success in upper portions of the income scale points to something broader: an argument that people like him have a civic responsibility to bear more of the burden of deficit reduction and to pay for government spending priorities.
''It is the opposite of a pander,'' said Dante Chinni, the director of Patchwork Nation. And it carries risks as well as potential rewards.
Some fallout appears evident in donations from Wall Street executives, who feel particularly aggrieved by Mr. Obama's criticisms and policies. After besting Mr. McCain four years ago with donations from the securities, hedge-fund and banking sectors, the president has seen the former Bain Capital executive Mitt Romney amass far more cash from each of them, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
And in the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, Mr. Obama is supported by 43 percent and Mr. Romney by 47 percent of voters earning more than $100,000, even as he leads by six percentage points over all in a head-to-head matchup. In 2008, Mr. Obama split voters in the $100,000-plus category evenly with Mr. McCain. Yet Democratic strategists consider that fallout relatively modest and ascribe it more to frustration over gridlock in Washington than ire over potential tax increases. They see Mr. Obama as more vulnerable to defections among economically pinched working class voters than among higher earners whose taxes he would raise.
In large part that owes to the cultural influences that turned a large chunk of well-educated baby boomers toward the Democrats beginning in the 1960s. Those include support for activist government in areas like education, training and job creation, which Mr. Obama argues are necessary to spur growth and stem widening inequality of income and wealth.
''The types of affluent voters who have been going to vote for Democrats are unlikely to be driven away'' by the prospect of higher taxes, said Geoff Garin, a pollster for Democratic candidates and for the ''super PAC'' backing Mr. Obama. ''They have an appreciation for what those higher taxes pay for.''
Polls show the tax increases that Mr. Obama supports on households earning more than $250,000 have broad support among high-income voters along with other Americans. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey in August, 59 percent of those earning more than $100,000 called such taxes ''acceptable,'' mirroring the 60 percent support among all Americans.
To be sure, the number of Americans who would actually pay those taxes -- and vote in November -- is tiny compared with the number who would not. Americans earning more than $200,000 made up just 6 percent of the 2008 electorate. Census data from 2009 show that just 2.6 percent of families earned $250,000 or more.
Moreover, measuring income alone obscures significant differences among the most affluent voters. Democrats fare better among professionals, those with postgraduate degrees, and voters along both coasts, Republicans among those with four-year degrees, business managers and voters in heartland states.
''If you're an Upper West Sider in Manhattan, increased taxes are not as problematic to you as if you're a small-business owner in Cincinnati, Ohio,'' said David Winston, a Republican pollster -- even if both have $400,000 incomes.
That is why some House and Senate Democrats in competitive races remain wary of the tax issue, which has mostly kept the party on the defensive since the Ronald Reagan era. Even when they controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress, Democrats could not muster enough support to end the Bush tax cuts for the most affluent taxpayers in 2010.
Nor were Democrats successful in passing a surtax on million-dollar incomes that they wanted to use to finance their jobs proposals, including extension of existing payroll tax cuts. Amid continued Republican resistance, Congress instead extended those cuts on Friday without offsetting revenue.
Mr. Winston, who advises House Republican leaders as well as Newt Gingrich, sees a renewed opportunity for his party to make headway among affluent voters after the spring primary season. Once the nomination fight is settled, he explained, the Republican standard-bearer can more clearly articulate why avoiding Mr. Obama's tax increases can produce greater economic growth.
Even if Mr. Winston is right, Democrats see other avenues for holding high-income support in such critical targets as the northern Virginia suburbs, the Research Triangle of North Carolina and metropolitan Denver in Colorado. One is environmental concerns, which helps explain why Mr. Obama blocked the Keystone pipeline from Canada despite arguments that it would create jobs.
So are the social issues spotlighted by recent debates over same-sex marriage and contraception, including the Obama administration's decision to require that women get free access to birth control coverage under the new health care law. Mr. Garin said that among secular, well-educated, high-income voters, especially women, that debate will help protect Democrats from Republican attacks on tax increases.
''The extent to which Republicans are creating a divide with well-educated Americans on social issues is extraordinary,'' Mr. Garin said. ''This is not a zero-sum game.''

HEADLINE: In 2012 'State of' Speeches, Glimpses of the 2013 Race

 BODY:
It is a well-worn ritual of New York City's political class: the state-of-the-whatever speech, when major officials, from mayor to borough president, deliver self-defining blasts of oratory, while power brokers and operatives convene for handshakes and gossip. The proceedings, modeled on the president's State of the Union address, typically involve a bit of amateur pageantry, perhaps some Irish step-dancers or Billy Crystal-style video montages. But this year, with a mayoral election coming up, the events have become a chance for some of the City Hall aspirants to provide an early glimpse of the values, visions and attack lines they hope to use to win over voters in 2013.

HEADLINE: Bailout Stand Trails Romney In Car Country

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
As Congress and the White House scrambled in the fall of 2008 to confront the most severe economic crisis since the Great Depression, Mitt Romney felt compelled to say what many in his native Michigan would consider heresy: Do not bail out the troubled American automakers.
Government checks would not solve the car companies' long-term problems, Mr. Romney wrote in an opinion article that he asked The New York Times to publish. The better path, he suggested, was a court-administered restructuring that would leave the companies with costs more in line with the global competition. The article carried the headline ''Let Detroit Go Bankrupt,'' which critics continue to use against him.
General Motors and Chrysler did eventually enter bankruptcy, and the headline was written by an editor, not by Mr. Romney. Yet more than three years later, the position he took still leaves many of his allies in the business world befuddled. It has also opened up an awkward distance between Mr. Romney and some top Republicans in his native state who insist that the $80 billion assistance plan completed by the Obama administration, expanding on steps taken by President George W. Bush, was the only viable path to save the carmakers from ruin. 
But in that tumultuous moment -- just after President Obama's election but before he took office -- Mr. Romney had both personal and political reasons to speak out.
He wrote of the experience of his father, George Romney, who as the head of American Motors had turned that company around, and he drew on his own experience as a private equity manager who had remade companies through bankruptcy. At a time when the bank bailout program that Congress passed six weeks earlier had left many on the right angry and concerned that the response to the financial crisis was undercutting free markets, Mr. Romney's position was in sync with a desire among conservatives to draw the line against further government intervention.
Whether his opposition to the bailout plays as the kind of principled stand that Tea Party voters find reassuring or as an example of the cold, ruthless brand of capitalism that his opponents charge is responsible for his fortune will help determine how Mr. Romney fares in Michigan's primary on Feb. 28 and likely beyond.
The Michigan Republican primary electorate is expected to be very conservative, defined at least as much by the kinds of conservatives who recoil at government bailouts and are suspicious of union power as it is by those with a more direct stake in the auto industry's rebound.
''He gets attacked and mischaracterized for wanting to let Detroit die, and that's not the case,'' said Speaker Jase Bolger of the Michigan House, a Republican who represents a district near Battle Creek on the state's conservative western side. He said Mr. Romney's opposition to the auto rescue on principle could do the candidate more good than harm among primary voters.
''Autos are such an important part of Michigan's heritage, but many people saw this as a government intervention that wasn't going to cure the problem,'' Mr. Bolger added.
The politics of the bailout and the industry's comeback remain complex and not limited to Detroit. After the Michigan primary, the nominating contest moves into states where the automotive industry also has a significant presence: Alabama, Illinois, Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee.
Some Republicans have criticized Mr. Romney's insistence that federal intervention was wrongheaded as an example of what they see as his willingness to say anything to win over skeptical conservatives.
''He's playing the same song as Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck,'' said Bob Lutz, a former vice chairman for General Motors who said he was still so upset with Mr. Romney that he had cast his absentee ballot in Michigan for Rick Santorum.
''I think all of us in the auto industry who knew what the situation was were profoundly disappointed and, I would say, angry,'' Mr. Lutz said. ''We all saw it for what it was, which was a political ploy to the right.''
The Obama campaign sees a potential advantage and is moving to seize it. An Obama campaign official said allies will be dispatched across Michigan this week to hold news conferences raising Mr. Romney's opposition to the auto company loans and attacking his economic policies as beneficial to the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.
Mr. Romney has defended his 2008 plan, most prominently in an opinion article last week for The Detroit News, as essentially a blueprint for the path that Detroit ended up taking. ''The course I recommended was eventually followed,'' he wrote.
His 2008 opinion article advocated a managed bankruptcy process, one that would help General Motors and Chrysler shed excess labor, pension and real estate costs. He also called for profit-sharing with the unions and for the federal government to invest in new fuel economy technology.
All of those things eventually happened, as Mr. Romney said. Chrysler went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2009. General Motors' filing followed in June. But Mr. Romney's detractors say his defense falls apart at ''eventually.''
To go through the bankruptcy process, both companies needed billions of dollars in financing, money that auto executives and government officials who were involved with Mr. Obama's auto task force say was not available at a time when the credit markets had dried up. The only entity that could provide the $80 billion needed, they say, was the federal government. No private companies would come to the industry's aid, and the only path through bankruptcy would have been Chapter 7 liquidation, not the more orderly Chapter 11 reorganization, these people said.
In fact, the task force asked Bain Capital, the private equity company that Mr. Romney helped found, if it was interested in investing in General Motors' European operations, according to one person with direct knowledge of the discussions.
Bain declined, this person said, speaking anonymously to discuss private negotiations.
Mr. Romney's Republican allies in Michigan are seeking to shift attention to other topics.
''I think too much time has been spent on this issue,'' said Gov. Rick Snyder, who has endorsed Mr. Romney but differs with him on the bailout.
Mr. Romney's position that General Motors and Chrysler should have immediately filed for bankruptcy without receiving federal assistance, Mr. Snyder said in an interview, was an option that some Republicans found more palatable than providing billions in loans.
''I wouldn't judge either one as a wrong answer,'' Mr. Snyder added. ''One got done. And it's behind us.''
But while Mr. Romney's position could resonate among grass-roots conservatives, it continues to rankle Republicans in the auto industry.
''I fully support an entrepreneurial, free-enterprise capitalist system that must include failure and the consequences of failure,'' said Mike Jackson, chief executive and chairman of AutoNation, the largest auto retailer in the country. ''I think the American people in principle agree with Mitt Romney. Unfortunately, we were in the midst of a historic, catastrophic, financial meltdown. And it was one of those moments where the reality trumped your principles. You had to hold your nose.''
Mr. Jackson, who said he had voted for Mr. Romney in the Florida primary last month, called the candidate's position on the bailout ''a circle that can't be squared.''
Mr. Romney's position is fraught on other levels. As an example of how many different constituencies it touches in sometimes awkward ways, one of his major campaign donors, Stephen A. Feinberg, benefited from the bailout. Mr. Feinberg's firm, Cerberus Capital Management, owned Chrysler when the government stepped in.
Mr. Romney's campaign sees some potential advantages beyond a resonance with small-government conservatives in his continuing insistence that the federal government should have stayed out of the car business. They say it demonstrates consistency, a trait Mr. Romney's critics often say he lacks because of reversals on issues like abortion.

HEADLINE: Deals to Split EMI Spur Scrutiny and Criticism

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO; Eric Pfanner contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A week after the Grammy Awards celebrations, the music industry is hunkering down for what could be an intense yearlong fight over corporate consolidation.
The ownership landscape of the major music companies has shifted significantly in the last year. In May, the Warner Music Group was sold to Access Industries, a conglomerate controlled by the Russian-born billionaire Len Blavatnik, and in November Citigroup reached deals to split EMI -- home to the catalogs of the Beatles, Coldplay and Katy Perry -- between Sony and the Universal Music Group.
The EMI deals are subject to approval by regulatory agencies in the United States, in Europe and elsewhere. The Federal Trade Commission has been investigating the mergers since late last year, and on Friday, Universal, which had bid $1.9 billion for EMI's recorded music division, filed its merger application with the European Commission. 
Sony, which led an investment consortium in a $2.2 billion offer for EMI's music publishing assets -- the copyrights for songwriting and compositions -- is expected to submit its filing soon.
If approved, the sales would reduce the number of major players from four to three and give Universal and Sony substantial advantages over Warner. Battle lines have been drawn throughout the industry, with Warner and independent labels lobbying to block the deals and consumer groups expressing concern that the deals would stifle competition and innovation.
''Turning music into a two-horse race is not good for artists, not good for consumers and certainly not good for the development of the online market,'' said Helen Smith, executive chairwoman of Impala, a collective of small music companies that has been a vocal opponent of mergers over the last decade.
In a statement on Friday, Universal said it would ''work closely with the commission and remain confident of securing clearance.''
Critics of the deals point to the imbalance in market share that would result among the remaining major companies. Universal would control about 40 percent of the global market for recordings, and Sony about 32 percent for music publishing. (Warner has about 15 percent of the global recordings market, according to the British trade publication Music & Copyright.)
Edgar M. Bronfman Jr., a former chief executive for Warner who remains a board member, said at a recent media conference that a combined Universal-EMI would be a dangerous ''supermajor.'' He added that Warner, which has already hired firms in Washington like Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck to lobby the F.T.C., would fight the deal ''tooth and nail.''
In some European countries, Universal would control half the market, a level sure to prompt close scrutiny. Yet regulators may be sympathetic toward a beleaguered, and drastically changed, business, with sales plunging and new entrants like Apple gaining powerful positions.
''Yes, it's a different market, but 50 percent of a shrinking market is still 50 percent of a market,'' said Emmanuel Legrand, a London-based consultant and former international editor of Billboard magazine.
The F.T.C.'s investigation, already in its so-called second request stage, will probably stretch into the summer, while the process in Europe could take six months or more. Media analysts expect a greater challenge for Universal because Sony's power would be diluted: it owns half its current music publishing venture, Sony/ATV (Michael Jackson's estate owns the other half), and would have only a 38 percent stake in EMI's publishing.
Universal is expected to argue that a larger company would be better able to keep prices down to combat piracy, according to three executives briefed on its plans. But Universal may encounter a precedent set in its earlier takeover of BMG Music Publishing, when the European Commission found that big labels ''have succeeded in imposing higher licensing rates for recording rights'' than smaller ones.
Ms. Smith said she hoped the commission would block the deals ''outright,'' but most music executives and analysts expect the review process to result in a negotiation over divestments, with Universal required to sell chunks of its holdings, especially in overseas markets. The company has already said it would sell $680 million in ''noncore assets'' to help finance the deal.
Smaller labels are especially worried about the leverage Universal may gain in negotiations with online music services, which generally need licenses from labels and publishers to distribute music. With such a large market position, the critics say, Universal could effectively dictate terms to technology companies -- even big ones like Apple -- and stunt development.
''This is a tremendously large thumb on the scale of a developing digital music ecosystem,'' said Casey Rae-Hunter, deputy director of the Future of Music Coalition, an artists' advocacy group, which last week wrote to the F.T.C. outlining its objections.
A smooth takeover of EMI is essential for Universal, which assumed all the regulatory risk from Citigroup and agreed to pay the bulk of the $1.9 billion purchase price within 10 months, whether it was approved by European regulators or not.

HEADLINE: The Epoch Of Clinton, So Close Yet So Far

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Monica Lewinsky doesn't matter anymore.
It's remarkable, really, how little resonance that Clinton sex scandal has today. The White House intern who shook the world is barely ever mentioned in the 2012 presidential campaign. If her name comes up at all, it's as an asterisk to Newt Gingrich. Critics like to point out that while Mr. Gingrich was leading the Republican charge to impeach President Bill Clinton in 1998, he was concealing his own extramarital affair with Callista Bisek, the young Congressional staffer who is now his third wife.
The Monica Lewinsky imbroglio is nonetheless at the center of a two-part, four-hour documentary called ''Clinton'' that will be shown Monday and Tuesday on PBS. It's a long, solemn and supposedly reflective look back at the life and times of Bill Clinton that feels as if it were made the day he left office in 2001. 
Amid all the furor over the Starr Report, Linda Tripp and a stained blue dress, it was hard back then to see what really mattered. Eleven years on ''Clinton'' doesn't try to find out. The documentary is still too distracted by the Starr Report, Linda Tripp and the stained blue dress.
The film breathlessly chronicles every misstep and triumphant comeback of Mr. Clinton's picaresque career in order to rue the damage his lifelong recklessness did to his reputation and his legacy. (Though actually, despite all that happened between 1992 and 2001, the former president is doing just fine.)
What the film doesn't do is give viewers a more compelling reason to go back and relive that epoch. The film hits all the familiar Clinton milestones -- childhood in Hot Springs, Ark.; abusive stepfather; Oxford; courtship of Hillary Rodham; the Arkansas gubernatorial races; Gennifer Flowers; Travelgate; Somalia; Whitewater; etc. -- without exploring the deeper happenings that turned out to have had a more lasting impact on the world.
Yet two of the major cataclysms shadowing our times, the Sept. 11 attacks and the 2008 credit collapse, have roots that reach back to the Clinton administration.
The 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, which turned out to be a dress rehearsal for Sept. 11, isn't included in the narrative. The rise of Osama Bin Laden and the failed missile strikes against Al Qaeda training camps in 1998 are noted in passing and presented almost as a pesky foreign policy crisis that briefly distracted Mr. Clinton from the more enduring Monica Lewinsky scandal.
And there is no mention whatsoever of the repeal of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, one of several fateful steps that the Clinton administration -- in concert with Republicans -- took in the name of deregulation. Some policies, like making home mortgages more accessible, helped fuel the economy, but they also heedlessly left Wall Street and other financial institutions free of adult supervision. With the help of the Bush administration that followed, those actions opened the way to derivatives trading that led to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a domino line of multibillion-dollar bailouts to prevent the implosion of the world's financial system.
Put it this way: Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, is one of many Clinton administration alumni interviewed on camera, and while the PBS crew spoke to Mr. Rubin in 2010, he wasn't asked about Glass-Steagall or any of the other decisions that he helped design and that after the 2008 credit debacle look so shortsighted. Mr. Rubin went on to become a top official at Citigroup and earned more than $100 million over 10 years -- until Citigroup also teetered on the edge of self-destruction and had to be rescued with a $45 billion bailout.
Instead, Mr. Rubin is asked about the administration's 1993 budget proposal to cut spending and raise taxes. ''Twenty-two million new jobs were created,'' Mr. Rubin says proudly. ''Productivity went up. Incomes rose at all levels. And, for the first time in 30 years, we had a federal surplus.''
A lot of former allies are allowed to present themselves in the best possible light, without any hindsight, cautionary notes or credibility checks, including Dick Morris, a political strategist and former Clinton adviser who fell out of favor, had a change of heart and is now a contributor to Fox News.
''I said to him, 'The problem that presidents have is not the sin, it's the cover-up, and you should explore just telling the American people the truth,' '' Mr. Morris recalls telling the president. (In Mr. Morris's recollection Mr. Clinton was humbly grateful for his sage advice but didn't have the nerve to follow it.)
Lucianne Goldberg, the literary agent who helped Linda Tripp entrap Ms. Lewinsky, is quoted at length, as is Michael Isikoff, the investigative reporter who first got wind of the White House affair. So are many of the journalists and biographers who made their reputations by chronicling how Mr. Clinton lost his.
Joe Klein, the author and journalist who wrote ''Primary Colors,'' a roman a clef about the Clintons' first presidential campaign, is cited more than most and is also given the last word.
He disagrees with historians and former aides who say Mr. Clinton squandered his gifts and hobbled his potential for greatness. ''I don't know if you can say of a president who served us well and improved our material good that it was a wasted opportunity,'' Mr. Klein argues. ''And it was sure a lot of fun to watch.''
''Clinton'' is fun to watch too, but mostly it's a wasted opportunity.

HEADLINE: Florida Set For New Cut In Spending On Colleges

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Florida lawmakers contend that education is essential to high-wage jobs in the state, but the Legislature is again expected to slash millions of dollars from the budget for higher education and may usher in another round of tuition increases.
A proposal in the House would reduce state financing by nearly $250 million next year and would allow universities to increase tuition by as little as 8 percent and as much as 15 percent. A measure in the Senate would cut more than $500 million and would allow smaller institutions that are defined as colleges to raise tuition by 3 percent (the full-scale universities would not be permitted to raise tuition). 
The cuts in Florida began four years ago and have continued unabated. Since 2008, state spending on education has dropped by 24 percent and is now at 2003 levels. Meanwhile, universities have raised tuition every year, putting many students in a financial bind. Florida's 11 public universities have been raising tuition 15 percent a year for the past four years, and some of them for five years, although they still rank among the least expensive in the nation.
Forty-one states cut higher education spending last year, from 1 percent in Indiana and North Carolina to 41 percent in New Hampshire, according to a recent study conducted by the Illinois State University Center for the Study of Higher Education and the State Higher Education Executive Officers group.
Eduardo J. Padron, the president of Miami Dade College, said the cuts in higher education spending in Florida were short-sighted.
''At a time when institutions are growing and trying to serve a lot of students who realized that the only way to become a part of the middle class is by getting a college education, the state continues to disinvest in education,'' said Dr. Padron, whose college has country's largest enrollment (not including online schools) and graduates the most two-year degrees to blacks and Hispanics. ''There should be no question that at this point in America today, investment in higher education is paramount.''
Gov. Rick Scott, who in 2011 sought steep spending cuts to public schools, changed course this year. Calling a good education the ''bedrock of any sound, sustainable economy,'' Mr. Scott pushed to increase spending on public elementary, junior high and high schools next year by $1 billion, a move that would come close to making up the $1.3 billion cut last year.
But he did not include additional money for universities and colleges, although he did not advocate any reductions, either. The governor also strongly opposes letting universities raise tuition again.
''I don't believe in tuition hikes,'' said Mr. Scott, a Republican, who added that he wanted the state's universities to focus more on science, technology, engineering and math.
Colleges and universities are in a quandary: Spending cuts, combined with a freeze on tuition, mean fewer teachers and the closing of certain programs.
Under the Senate budget proposal, Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton stands to lose $47 million, one-third of the financing it receives from the state.
''The passage of the proposed budget cuts to Florida Atlantic University would have a devastating effect on the future of F.A.U.,'' said Mary Jane Saunders, the university's president. ''F.A.U. provides a $4 billion economic impact to its six-county service region, and these cuts would be shattering to all we serve.''
Dr. Padron, whose college serves some of the state's poorest students and who says he raises tuition as a last resort, agreed. ''If we have budget cuts and we don't have the opportunity to raise tuition, we are going to be in crisis mode,'' he said.
For some universities, the situation is dire. The University of South Florida in Tampa stands to lose a crippling 58 percent of its financing under the Senate bill. It was singled out as the result of a fight with Senator JD Alexander, chairman of the Budget Committee, over the university's unwillingness to sever its ties with its Lakeland branch.
Mr. Alexander, who is serving out his final year in the Senate because of term limits, has pushed for independence for the Lakeland campus, the University of South Florida Polytechnic, which has 4,400 students. He wants to make it the state's 12th university, but the University of South Florida opposes the idea.
A flood of e-mails, calls and appearances at the Capitol last week by University of South Florida students and faculty members led to some relief: Senate budget writers freed up $25 million for the university.
Mr. Alexander said the cuts were calculated according to each school's reserve fund. The University of South Florida said it did not have the most reserve funds, yet it drew the largest cut. The university will also lose out because it must absorb $25 million in costs associated with the effort to close the Lakeland campus.
The budget bill still includes language for turning the Lakeland campus into the state's 12th university.
''I think for any university to fly in the face of an entire Legislature would be a foolhardy decision,'' Mr. Alexander said last week.
Mr. Alexander's treatment of the university has led to a barrage of criticism in Tampa, and he has been accused of being vengeful.
''The whole notion that we would set up a 12th university when we are cutting the budget for the other 11 is ridiculous,'' said Pam Iorio, who served two terms as Tampa's mayor and left the job last year. ''This is just something that he wants. He wants it as a legacy project, to be able to leave office and to say in his hometown that this university was created by him.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 29, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Feb. 20 about proposed budget cuts to higher education in Florida erroneously attributed a distinction to Miami Dade College. It leads the nation in awarding the most two-year degrees to black and Hispanic students; it does not award the most four-year degrees to those two groups of students. (Georgia State University awards the most four-year degrees to black students and Florida International University has the most Hispanic graduates earning four-year degrees.)

HEADLINE: Leading Off: Linsanity's Flip Side, Not So Pretty

BYLINE: LYNN ZINSER


HIGHLIGHT: Leading Off: Linsanity gets an ugly backlash after Knicks loss on Friday, but after a victory over the Mavericks on Sunday, the full swoon is back. 

 BODY:
Even when you acknowledge it, the worst of human nature never really goes away. And even when you understand the generally sophomoric maturity level of much of the public discourse about sports, it was still hard not to flinch at the ugly side of Linsanity that poked out from a dark hole after the Knicks and their new-sensation point guard Jeremy Lin had the temerity to lose a game last Friday. There were peeks of it before then, of course, but when the phenomenon stumbled even just a bit, it triggered a sort of knee-jerk instinct to denigrate. Most bizarrely, some of it came from ESPN, which has an overriding economic incentive to wring every last ratings point out of Linsanity, whether Lin's heritage is Asian or Australian or thawed from the glaciers of Antarctica.
Yes, ESPN proffered an apology and disciplined its main offenders, and Lin and the Knicks restored the story line to a full swoon by beating the defending champion Mavericks on Sunday night. This was a relief because you could only imagine what childish anti-Asian slurs would accompany an actual losing streak of any kind -- the first person caught waving chopsticks at a game should be immediately teleported to some previous century. 
Lin had easily his most impressive performance, convincing Mike Vaccaro of The Post that both he and the Knicks are for real. He did it, as Jeff Caplan writes on ESPN.com, against one of the league's stingiest defenses and one that tried to conjure up specific ways to stop him. It didn't work. Instead, Lin-mania, with the celebrities climbing on board, took over Madison Square Garden again.
Where this goes from here is anyone's guess because as Bill Reiter writes on Foxsports.com, Carmelo Anthony's return from injury will become another plot twist. We know the Knicks won't win every single game for the rest of the season, which means the anti-Lin crowd could get even uglier, writes Doug Farrar on Yahoo.com. There will be more volleys like the one from Dallas's Jason Terry, who said Lin's success was 95 percent due to Knicks Coach Mike D'Antoni's system, as Adrian Wojnarowski writes on Yahoo.com. As we know, all the spare-part point guards that D'Antoni have tried since joining the Knicks have succeeded so wildly. At least those are garden-variety basketball slurs. It's the other kind that make you wonder when the sophomores will grow up.
Fortunately, not every achievement in the N.B.A. gets put through such a wringer. When Kevin Durant and Oklahoma City put on an offensive showcase that included Durant's 51 points, people just say wow. And when the Lakers' Kobe Bryant rips his own franchise for the trade rumors dogging the team, people just sigh. There has been almost no reaction to the Heat's latest dominating winning streak, and as Chris Tomasson writes on Foxsports.com, that's just fine with the Heat players, who likely enjoy a break from the stream of reasons for people to scowl at LeBron James. This will end shortly, however, as the Heat have a date with Linsanity this week.
The weekend's other sports highlights included a golf tournament, although that's only because Phil Mickelson almost won it. Mickelson's near-miss at Riviera coupled with his Tiger Woods-crushing at Pebble Beach has breathed life into the sport, writes Gary Van Sickle on Golf.com, because "Phil's back!" headlines are nearly as coveted as "Tiger's back!" ones in a sport weary of anonymous major winners. Farrell Evans writes on ESPN.com that Mickelson should be encouraged by his game despite not winning Sunday and golf fans should be encouraged that he continues to produce trademark Mickelson detours, like this shot that ended up in a guy's shorts.
You might have noticed that baseball kicked off spring training this weekend, with all ears on the various levels of apology offered by the Boston pitchers now famous for their beer and fried chicken habits. And the N.H.L. season continued its march toward the trade deadline with Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist getting some support as the potential most valuable player in the whole league, which would much rather talk about that than its latest snafu with a suspicious game clock.
In college hockey, the news was sobering when Boston University's Max Nicastro was arrested on rape charges, the second B.U. player this season arrested after disturbing incidents.
After that, we'll happily take a case of Linsanity, ugly side and all.

HEADLINE: Intergenerational Accounting at the Public Mutual Fund and Insurance Company

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Assessing tax paid and benefits derived across the span of people's lives provides a more accurate picture than here-and-there snapshots, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The government is not literally a mutual fund and insurance company. But in many ways, it operates like one, and greater awareness of the parallels would improve the quality of public debate over public spending. 
Most discussions of taxes and benefits treat either one or the other in isolation. This is not helpful. Imagine telling investors what they pay for shares of a company without explaining what they get in dividends or capital gains, or explaining the costs of insurance without specifying the benefits. 
What both investors and taxpayers should focus on is the difference between costs and benefits, appropriately discounted to reflect differences in their timing.
But most discussions of taxes focus only on what is paid rather than net taxes (the difference between taxes paid and benefits received). Many focus even more narrowly on federal income taxes, ignoring state and local taxes and Social Security contributions.

Likewise, many discussions of the social safety net describe the benefits that individuals receive without asking what taxes they have paid or will pay in the future. When comparisons are made, as in a fascinating report last week in The New York Times, they are often limited to federal taxes and benefits within programs such as Social Security and Medicare. 
But the state and local taxes that individuals pay should also be factored in, especially since they help pay for the education of future workers who will help finance Social Security and Medicare in the years to come. 
Most reports that purport to look at net benefits, like one published by the Tax Foundation, simply focus on one point in time. But most public spending in the United States is conditioned on age, not income. 
Children are the primary beneficiaries of educational spending. When they grow up and enter paid employment, they typically pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. Upon retirement, the balance tips the other way. 
Net benefits should be defined over an individual's life cycle, comparing all taxes paid with all benefits received, an approach sometimes referred to as generational accounting. 
The economist Laurence Kotlikoff and Scott Burns wrote a popular book on the subject, "The Coming Generational Storm," in 2004. The basic model outlined in the book, as well as in more scholarly publications, projected unsustainably high net tax rates for future generations and was widely used as a rationale for reducing public commitments to the elderly. 
But the definition of net benefits that Professor Kotlikoff and other advocates used excluded the benefits of expenditures on education as well as spending on public goods like highways, environmental regulation and the military and has been criticized on many other grounds.
The most powerful critique, in my opinion, emerges from an alternative estimate of public transfer accounts in the United States published by the economists Antoine Bommier, Ronald Lee, Timothy Miller and Stephane Zuber that explicitly takes the benefits of public education into account. 
Their analysis reveals a much more sustainable intergenerational contract from which most Americans directly benefit. By their calculations, increasing public investments in education have more than offset the increased tax burden of support for the elderly. In other words, benefits received both early and late in life add up to more than the value of taxes paid.
I've described a similar way of looking at intergenerational transfers in two earlier posts, one offering a simple estimate of "tax payback year," calculating how many years it would take average taxpayers to repay the value of public spending on their education and another summarizing research (to which Ronald Lee and Timothy Miller also contributed) on the economic contributions of parents -- who, after all, are raising future taxpayers. 
None of these estimates settles the debate over what the best level of public spending would be, and none provides the information that taxpayers need to estimate their own net lifetime government benefits, be they positive or negative, at any given point in time. 
But these estimates illustrate a basic feature of the Public Mutual Fund and Insurance Company. We pool investments in a very important set of productive assets - the capabilities of the younger generation - and the payoff helps provide for our health and security in old age. Adults have an incentive to invest in public education because public pensions allow them to capture part of the returns.
As we engage in efforts to renegotiate some aspects of this intergenerational contract, voters deserve a better picture of how they are personally affected by it. They also deserve a clear explanation of why and how previous intergenerational accounting efforts have gone awry.

HEADLINE: An American City Disappearing Before My Eyes

BYLINE: MORT ROSENBLUM


HIGHLIGHT: My home on Ile St-Louis, in the heart of Paris, dates back to the 1600s, and except for pipes and wires tucked out of sight, it looks pretty much as it did 300 years ago. But each time I returned to Tucson, Arizona, more was gone. 

 BODY:
 You can go home again, Thomas Wolfe notwithstanding. But if home is Tucson, the centuries-old Arizona outpost that ripped out its own mud heart, forget about it.
 As Arizona celbrates its centennial, the monthly magazine, Arizona Highways, pictures 100 surviving territorial landmarks. In Tucson, first inhabited about 400 B.C., it found only a handful: a bit of Fort Lowell, built to ward off Apaches, Old Main at the university, a rich guy's home, a desert lab and a ranch.
San Xavier Mission was featured. Begun in the 1600s to "civilize" Indians, the White Dove on the Desert loomed in the distance in 1776 when Spanish colonials built the Presidio and some of North America's only town walls. Far from downtown, it escaped a city council bent on evangelizing renewal.
Much remained when I left in 1967 to cover madness and mayhem abroad as a reporter. Soon after, bulldozers flattened 92 acres, sending deeply rooted Mexican families into diaspora. The plaza and barrios that had throbbed with life gave way to an Anytown, U.S.A., convention center so shoddy that it was later torn down for another try.
That was for starters. The elegant El Conquistador Hotel, with its ornate gardens and tiled pool, was leveled for a 70s-style shopping mall. And so on.
Each time I came back, more was gone. True, cities change. But my home abroad on le St-Louis, in the heart of Paris, also dated to the 1600s. Except for pipes and wires tucked out of sight, it looked pretty much as it did 300 years ago. 
Some of old Tucson was saved, converted into law offices and gentrified homes. But the spirit was gone. In 1999, a grand plan dubbed Rio Nuevo was supposed to give downtown some fresh life. After about a quarter-billion dollars, much of it spent on imported consultants and fancy blueprints, it remains in timeless limbo.
All this is about buildings. The real calamity is human. Tucson wanted to attract tourists. And a majority of townsfolk, predominantly Anglos (the term in the heavily Latino Western and Southwestern United States for non-Hispanic white people) by the 1960s, figured no one wanted to see a bunch of Mexicans. 
Lydia Otero, a university professor born in Tucson, wrote "La Calle," a remarkably measured book about how her world was razed around her. "Now they are trying to go back and create what the city fathers tore down," she told a local reporter.
But that, of course, is impossible. You can't remake the past with plaster and a paintbrush.

HEADLINE: Permira Sifts for Bargains, Even in Europe's Periphery

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: In what might seem a counterintuitive move, the private equity firm is looking for pockets of value amid Europe's economic turbulence. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Kurt Bjorklund does not seem worried about Europe's sovereign debt crisis.
As competitors pull back from the troubled market, his private equity firm has doubled down on the region, picking through distressed companies from Dublin to Dubrovnik.
Since the start of 2010, Permira, one of the largest buyout specialists in Europe, has spent almost $6 billion, including acquisitions in debt-ridden countries like Spain and Ireland. The firm bought the call center operator Genesys from the Franco-American telecommunications company Alcatel-Lucent for $1.5 billion in early February.
 "This is the right time to be staying in - not getting out of - the market," said Mr. Bjorklund, a co-managing partner at Permira, which has assets of 20 billion euros. "Europe is a complicated place to do business, but the outlook for investing is good."
Now, the private equity firm is playing up its Continental roots, as it looks to expand in the United States and elsewhere. To differentiate itself from rivals, Permira, in part, highlights it regional network of offices. The firm operates in eight European countries, compared to three for Blackstone and two for Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
"You can't do private equity in Europe if you are just based in London," said Mr. Bjorklund, 42, who joined the firm in 1996 after working for the Boston Consulting Group in Sweden. In each country, private equity firms require on-the-ground knowledge, says Mr. Bjorklund, who is from Finland.
Permira will need to draw on that experience as the European economy slides toward recession. The gross domestic product of the euro zone is expected to contract 0.5 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Southern European countries - where Permira currently has six holdings - will be the worst hit. Spain's economy is forecast to shrink 1.7 percent this year, while Italian G.D.P. is predicted to fall 2.2 percent.
The private equity industry has felt the ripple effects of the economic turmoil. As banks have pulled back on lending, buyout firms have been reaching deeper into their pockets to finance deals. Last year, debt - or leverage - represented 55 percent of European buyout deals, compared to 66 percent in 2007, according to data provider Standard & Poor's LCD.
"It has become more difficult to finance buyout deals," said Peter Roosenboom, a private equity professor at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. "Leverage isn't as cheap as it was before the crisis."
Permira has ridden out previous periods of uncertainty. The private equity firm was founded in 1985, after the buyout divisions of the European asset manager Schroder were spun off as a separate business. Since then, it has weathered the reunification of Germany, the creation of the euro as well as the slow growth and high unemployment that have characterized Europe's economy over the last two decades.
Last year, valuations across the firm's three active funds increased by a combined 16 percent, compared with a more than 30 percent rise recorded in 2010. Its portfolio of 25 companies, including the German high-end fashion retailer Hugo Boss, the Asian casino operator Galaxy Entertainment and the Spanish fast-food chain Telepizza, currently has a combined market value of around $80 billion.
Amid the upheaval, Permira is trying capitalize on Europe's fragmented markets. The private equity firm focuses on leading local companies in a small number of sectors, like financial services and consumer products. Then it consolidates those businesses to create larger regional players.
With growing demand for low-cost travel, Permira joined forces with rival Axa Private Equity last year, merging three online travel Web sites across the Continent. Each company - eDreams of Spain, Opodo of Britain and GO Voyages of France - had a strong market share in specific areas in Europe, but now cover all 27 countries in the region.
Permira also emphasizes global brands with a significant portion of revenues overseas. Last December, it bought a controlling stake in Netafim, a leading water irrigation company majority owned by three kibbutzim in Israel. Despite its Israeli heritage, Netafim holds a dominant market share in more than 100 countries worldwide.
The Permira team spent over a year - and more than 60 separate trips to Israel - convincing the owners to sell. In the end, the firm beat out other leading private equity firms, after owners interviewed an executive from another Israeli company in Permira's portfolio.
"We had to convince them that we would be able to take the company forward," said Jorg Rockenhauser, 45, the head of Permira's Frankfurt office.
With less debt financing available, Permira's network of offices across Europe could give it at a competitive advantage, according to Stefano Caselli, a finance professor at Bocconi University in Milan. Private equity players can no longer offer high valuations, financed by debt, to takeover targets, so local contacts able to woo companies are increasingly important.
"Investors are looking for private equity firms with strong roots and high levels of expertise," Mr. Caselli said. "Today, leverage isn't enough. You have to fundamentally know the company you're investing in."
Still, convincing investors to part with cash just as Europe's economy is going from bad to worse remains a tough sell. Permira has been raising a new 6.5 billion euro fund - one third smaller than its previous fund raised in 2006. Tom Lister, 47, Permira's other co-managing partner who is based in New York, said he had spent a lot of time with potential United States investors explaining the implications of the Continent's debt crisis. Much of the discussions have focused on short-term problems facing the euro zone, like the bailout of Greece.
Despite the challenges, Mr. Lister said Permira's long-term American backers have experience investing in Europe and understand the Continent will most likely bounce back from its current difficulties.
"There's more uncertainty for U.S. investors because of the lack of information coming out of Europe," said Mr. Lister, who joined Permira in 2005 after more than a decade with New York buyout firm Forstmann Little. "But North American investors continue to commit funds to Europe."
Permira's returns will depend on its finding buyers for its assets. In November, the firm sold the Dutch animal feed company Provimi to Cargill for $2.1 billion, more than doubling its initial investment. Permira also sold one-third of its stake in Galaxy Entertainment last September for $616 million.
Future deals may be more difficult. The market for initial public offerings is still shaky. Nonfinancial companies also are wary of spending their cash reserves on acquisitions, given continued weakness in the broader European economy. In 2010, Permira shelved its plans to take the British fashion retailer New Look public because of volatility.
But the private equity firm is willing to wait out the tumult. The amount of distressed assets in Europe is likely to rise, and Permira is currently focused on expanding, not reducing, its portfolio of companies, according to Mr. Bjorklund.
"We never want to be held hostage to an I.P.O. as the only possibility," Mr. Bjorklund said. "If you have a market-leading business, you will always have different exit opportunities."

HEADLINE: Could Israel Go It Alone in Iran? Would the U.S. Be Sucked In?

BYLINE: THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE


HIGHLIGHT: As Iran punches back against European sanctions, cutting off its limited shipments to France and Britain, military planners in the U.S. and Europe seem to be sending a signal of their own to Israel: wait. 

 BODY:
"All the pundits who talk about 'Oh, yeah, bomb Iran,' it ain't going to be that easy," Lt. Gen. David A. Deptula, the retired top intelligence official of the U.S. Air Force tells Elisabeth Bumiller in her latest story examining the possibility of an attack on Iran. General Deptula planned the American air campaigns in 2001 in Afghanistan and in the 1991 Gulf War. 
As Iran cut off its oil shipments to France and Britain, what sounded like an orchestrated and rising chorus of Western military voices seemed to be warning Israel off military action any time soon. A chief argument is that Israel might not have the capability to carry out such a complicated attack alone. The fear in the West is that Israel may carry out such an attack anyway. 
"In a sign of rising American concern, Tom Donilon, the national security adviser, met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in Jerusalem on Sunday, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, warned on CNN that an Israeli strike on Iran right now would be 'destabilizing,' " Elisabeth reports. "Similarly, the British foreign secretary, William Hague, told the BBC that attacking Iran would not be 'the wise thing' for Israel to do 'at this moment.' "
Perhaps the Americans and the British - as well as the French and the Germans - believe sanctions, which are increasingly biting in the streets of Iran, will be able to do more than military action to blunt what the West sees as Iran's drive toward nuclear military capability. 
Though the obstacles of an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities would be serious for the United States military too, American planners tell Elisabeth, only the U.S. could carry out the necessary strikes: 
The possible outlines of an Israeli attack have become a source of debate in Washington, where some analysts question whether Israel even has the military capacity to carry it off. One fear is that the United States would be sucked into finishing the job - a task that even with America's far larger arsenal of aircraft and munitions could still take many weeks, defense analysts said. Another fear is of Iranian retaliation.

HEADLINE: Cardinal Dolan Sets Agenda for Return to New York

BYLINE: SHARON OTTERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Awaiting the cardinal when he returns home are issues like health coverage for contraception, an outreach to immigrants, a renewed focus on charity and the renovation of St. Patrick's Cathedral. 

 BODY:
ROME - After a week of indulging in Italian cooking, chatting with fellow new cardinals from around the world and sharing his elevation with crowds of visiting pilgrims, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said Monday that he was eager to return home and laid out four challenges to the archdiocese as among his priorities. 
Cardinal Dolan spoke in an interview just before his formal audience with Pope Benedict XVI, the last ceremony of the week. Upon his return, he said, he first wanted the church to be more effective locally and nationally in its outreach to immigrants, particularly Latinos, who are no longer in Catholic schools in the numbers they once were. 
"The church has been the engine of welcoming people, caring for them and getting them settled as happy, productive citizens who are loyal citizens and loyal Catholics," he said. "It bothers me that for the first time in American Catholic history, we may not be responding well to the needs of immigrant children in our Catholic schools." 
Second, he wants the archdiocese to renew its focus on charity, because with the state of the economy, the needs of the poor are great. "A month ago, we had a food drive," he said, "and we are already getting near out of food again."
Third, he believes American bishops need to have a clearer and more effective pastoral message on heterosexual marriage, because so many Roman Catholics nationally are not marrying, and many are divorcing. 
"We've got to be better heralds, trumpeters, about what beautiful, life-giving lifelong marriage is," he said.
And fourth, literally at his doorstep, the archdiocese needs to raise about $160 million to fix St. Patrick's Cathedral.
"This just isn't some face-lift," he said. "We literally get two or three buckets of stones every day that have fallen. We are talking about safety, security, a new roof, leaks, those precious stain glass windows that are rattling."
Nationally, Cardinal Dolan has been leading a charge by Catholic bishops against a White House mandate that would require some religious institutions, like Catholic hospitals, to provide health coverage for contraception. 
It is a stance that has made him a hero to many of the hundreds of pilgrims who traveled with him in Rome, like Dennis J. Crilly, 69, from Somers, N.Y. "Dolan is going to be a voice in the wilderness crying out on moral issues" in the political sphere, he said. "He knows the moral true north and is not afraid to say it."
But Cardinal Dolan said he and his fellow American bishops did not plan to align themselves with any particular candidate or party in the coming election, and instead plan to wield influence by speaking out on issues important to the church, like abortion and marriage. 
Even the most loyal Catholics, he said, "cherish the fact that we are American and that our bishops do not interfere graphically in partisanship." And beyond that, he said, that kind of approach can backfire. "We bishops are pretty realistic to know that sometimes one of the best things we can do for a candidate whom we may not particularly like is to dramatically support his or her opponent," he said.
During the last week, as he celebrated his elevation in the church with 21 other new cardinals, he said he had learned about the problems that Catholics face in repressive nations like China - revelations, he said, that make him more grateful than ever to be an American. 
It was a week of personal joy for the cardinal. Not only did he receive his red hat from the pope, but his appointment also allowed him to honor some of those closest to him. 
On Monday, Cardinal Dolan clutched the elbow of his mother, Shirley, 84, as they mounted the white marble steps of a hangar-size Vatican reception hall for a formal audience with the pope. On Sunday, two of his nieces, Shannon Williams, 21, who had survived cancer as a child, and Erin Stidley, 34, whom he chose because she is pregnant, walked down the aisle of St. Peter's to present the communion gifts.
But there were personal challenges, too, including to his effort to diet, which at banquets and lunches was in little evidence here.
His new cardinal's ring is so tight that when reporters asked to take a closer look on Sunday, he could not remove it to show the inscription inside.
With the start of Lent on Wednesday, he said, "it will be no more pasta; it's going to be a lot of celery sticks, celery sticks without any salt."
A previous version of this post misstated the day of a news conference as Monday.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Lessons From Chuck Norris

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Do you think the president's budget would help your business? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: A Surplus of Yawns
President Obama's budget, which includes $24 billion in cuts, sets off an election year fight. Here's agood summary. The Calafia Beach Pundit says that fiscal austerity might not be so bad after all (Paul Krugman disagrees). Accounting Today sums up the budget's tax changes as does Andrew Fieldhouse. Ezra Klein compares the Obama and Romney budgets and confirms that "our government is a big insurer with a big army." Larry Doyle prefers Paul Ryan's budget. Keith Hennessey says the administration's 2.5-to-1 ratio of spending cuts to tax increases "is bogus." Kent Hoover breaks down what the budget means for entrepreneurs. The chairman of the House Small Business Committee says the budget is bad for small business. But business groups just yawn. Rick Newman explains whynone of it matters anyway. Suzy Khimm points to five things you probably missed.
The Economy: Sentiment at a Lull
Small-business sentiment is in a lull and the National Federation of Independent Business denounces Washington. Barbara Taylor explains how small businesses can hurt the economy. The Pulse of Commerce Index falls. Industrial production and producer prices (pdf) remain unchanged. Retail sales increase, as do the Residential Remodeling Index and builder confidence. But this quarter's S.&P. 500 earnings growth was not so hot. Manufacturing tech orders were up in December. The Fed has few supporters for QE3. Here's a surprise: economists aren't so good at forecasting.
Your People: Vision, Values and Alignment
Apple scores best for corporate reputation. CareerBliss names the happiest companies in America. One owner creates a strong culture by spending three days a week "working from home where I focus on just three things: vision, values and alignment." David Butcher offers five bold ideas for business. Looks like there's a shortage of demand planning analysts, and guess what: businesses that employ undocumented workers do better. Here's how to keep sick staffers at home. Gallup reports that health costs and government regulations continue to curb small-business hiring. Fewer tech companies are sending jobs overseas. A man is almost attacked by a jealous monkey.
Management: Be a Doer
Join a Google employee turned entrepreneur for a video interview on Wednesday. Seth Godin points out the curious nature of selfishness: "Sharing your money, your ideas, your insights, your confidence ... all of these things return to you. Perhaps not in the way you expected, and certainly not with a guarantee, but again and again the miser falls behind." Roshawn Watson offers the ultimate guide to becoming a doer: "It is important to every doer to honor his differences and use them to his competitive advantage." Here are eight inspirational videos to get you pumped. Nipun Mehta offers five reasons to serve others. Or maybe we should all just move to Bermuda.
Ideas: Cultivating Fans and Followers
Krista Neher explains why Google Plus is important. Hewlett-Packard and Business Matchmaking plan to continue their event series for 2012. A South Korean company is revolutionizing the way small businesses get fans and followers. Here's how Jimmy Kimmel earns nearly $2 million a year on YouTube. Crowdspring's Mike Samson suggests 10 things entrepreneurs can learn from politicians, including: "Between elections, good politicians continue to energetically market their ideas, their legislative priorities and their brands." Here's how indie brewers are outpacing beer-industry growth. The hotel industry is adapting to travel habits. Delta leads the airline industry in pet deaths. TD Bank introduces a new checking account suite for small business. No joke: A man has a heart attack at The Heart Attack Grill.
Starting Up: Learning From Chuck Norris
The start-up rate is at thelowest point on record, but this entrepreneur is on a mission to change that. There's an increase in subscription commerce start-ups. And an online payments start-up increased its revenue tenfold in 2011. Evan Peelle says that everything he learned about start-ups came from Chuck Norris, including: "In the same way that Chuck Norris takes down armies singlehandedly while getting paid like a rock star," pay-per-click advertising "can transform your business overnight."
Around the Country: Toilet Paper Production
Entries for a Black Enterprise Small Business Awardare due by March 16. John Splendido offers advice for running on a business trip. Snow or no snow, small businesses in Philadelphia find a way to prosper. A new bill may hurt Rhode Island tanning salons. Toilet paper productionis booming in New Hampshire. Manufacturing activity in New York expanded for a third consecutive month.
Around the World: Investing in North Korea
An entrepreneur says opportunities are great in India today and this video explains how to start a manufacturing business there. Some companies are eager to invest in North Korea. Can you guess which country is deepest in debt? Here's a list of Africa's top 20 start-ups. The world's largest shopping malls are in China. Small businesses that rushed to Chinese factories to have their products made are turning to American manufacturers. Meanwhile, the next leader of China tours the American heartland. Mark Perry reports on the emerging world energy map. Frozen canals in Amsterdam make for some pretty cool skating.
Red Tape Update: Linsanity Hits the Patent Office
A payroll tax cut extension deal is completed and the president wants to extend the health care tax credit to more small businesses. There is a voice for entrepreneurs, and he's right inside the government. When it comes to taxes, entrepreneurs are still climbing Mount Paperwork, and Dan Danner of the National Federation of Independent Business offers suggestions that could make both small businesses and the Internal Revenue Service happier. Inevitably, Linsanity reaches the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Marie Forleo wants help giving away $10,000 to entrepreneurs.
Marketing: Is Sales Icky?
Scott Gerber offers seven examples of marketing magic using Facebook fan pages. In this video, Andrew Lock asks whether Google AdWords is still worthwhile for small businesses. John Souza lists 10 reasons social media campaigns fail, including: "Content drives your social campaigns, but treating this content like you treat print media content is a bad idea." Facebook is reportedly tracking calls from small-business pages. A father shoots his daughter's laptop to get her off Facebook. Some feel that Pinterest combines the best partsof Facebook, Tumblr and Etsy. Jill Konrath lists five things sales representatives should never do. Robbi Hess says small businesses need to engage in both face-to-face and online networking. James Chartrand says being a sales rep isn't icky: "If you feel uncomfortable selling, you lack faith in what you sell." Starbucks attracts gun owners.
Technology: An App to Find Apps
Online software can increase your company's growth 10 ways. Tom Simonite explains how to upgrade your hard drive to infinity. Tablet sales will "blow past" PC sales by 2015. Stephanie Buck lists five mobile apps to improve small-business productivity. There are so many apps that we now need these apps to find apps. Kyle Lacy offers stats about consumer mobile use, including: "Nine percent of all cell owners searched for the price of a product they found in a physical store but ultimately purchased it at that store." A start-up in Maryland uses cutting-edge chemical technology to improve the efficiency of lithium ion batteries. Google is planning a massive "Experience Center." Cloud services for small businesses will hit $68 billion by 2014. A cloud tsunami rolls over Florida.
Boss of the Week
A Philadelphia bakery owner, Sonya Akines, shares the biggest lesson learned during her first year as a business owner: The key to being a successful dreamer and entrepreneur is, "You change the plans as you go."
This Week's Bests
Path to Success. Ingrid Wickelgren explains how to achieve success in seven short steps, including, "Write a gratitude letter": "If addressing an individual is uncomfortable or inappropriate, pen a note to yourself about all the things that are going well or that you feel fortunate to have. Set aside a time each day to do this. For instance, write one journal entry each night just before bed listing the good things that happened to you and what you are grateful for. Too much of the time, we focus on our fears and problems, because those relate to situations we need to avoid or solve to survive. But if you stop to count your blessings, you will realize how lucky you are."
Leadership Lesson. Hitendra Wadhwa explains how Lincoln became America's greatest president: "Changing oneself isn't easy, so even as president, Lincoln's anger occasionally consumed him, making him pour it out in letters to critics, errant generals, and others. He had the self-discipline though to not dispatch these 'hot' letters; they were later discovered, unsigned, in a drawer in the president's desk. In this way, one small step at a time, Lincoln built his self-discipline, and through it, the character of his presidency. Lincoln's journey suggests that the true measure of a leader lies not in how much we cultivate and exploit our strengths, but in how we work on tapping, in Lincoln's words, the 'better angels of our nature' to use our strengths in the service of a cause much higher than our own personal gain."

HEADLINE: Reads and Reactions: Santorum's Rise

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney is still the most probable nominee, but he has lost his air of inevitability, and even his claim to being the most electable Republican has come into question. 

 BODY:
Reactions
Our last Reads and Reactions came just two weeks ago, but that was when Mitt Romney was the clear front-runner in the polls. He was about to notch a commanding win in Nevada, Rick Santorum was polling in the midteens nationally and Newt Gingrich was the main anti-Romney candidate.
But, as FiveThirtyEight pointed out, Mr. Romney had yet to finish in front in one area of the country: the Midwest.
Nate Silver wrote on Feb. 5: "Imagine ... that Mr. Santorum wins both Minnesota and Missouri. That could revive his campaign, especially given that he also took Iowa. Mr. Santorum is, in many ways, a more dangerous opponent for Mr. Romney than Mr. Gingrich at this point."
FiveThirtyEight gets plenty wrong, but not this one. Mr. Santorum won not only those two states, but he upset Mr. Romney in Colorado as well. At the very least, Mr. Santorum has tacked on a few extra miles onto Mr. Romney's race.
Mr. Romney is still the most probable nominee, but he seems to have lost his air of inevitability, which may change his campaign's calculus. At The American Prospect, Patrick Caldwell highlighted Mr. Romney's somewhat lacking field operation, something FiveThirtyEight has noticed, too. Mr. Caldwell wrote:
Romney has built a campaign that is just good enough to dispatch a lackluster field of opponents. Santorum's sudden rise in the polls threatens that. A meager field staff would have been sufficient to dispatch Romney's competitors when he was the runaway front-runner, yet might not be enough to right his path now that he's vulnerable.
Not only does Mr. Romney seem to have lost the "inevitable" tag, his "most electable" tag is also in dispute. Nathaniel Rakich, at his Baseballot blog, wrote that Mr. Romney's inability to connect with white, working-class voters would at least partially negate one of President Obama's chief weaknesses - an inability to connect with white, working-class voters. "Much of Romney's advantage derives from the fact that he is perceived to be strongest in a matchup with Obama - in other words, the most electable Republican," Mr. Rakich wrote. "But given this new information, the candidate with the most credible claim to that mantle may be Rick Santorum." 
Mr. Romney's rocky stretch has even renewed talk of a brokered convention. The Week magazine had a great overview of how a brokered convention would work, how it might play out and why it's still unlikely.
Next up are Michigan and Arizona on Feb. 28. FiveThirtyEight's Michigan forecast has Mr. Santorum as a 72 percent favorite to win the state. Jonathan Bernstein, writing at The Washington Post, thinks those odds are too kind to Mr. Santorum - andMr. Silver raised questions about them earlier today. Still, Mr. Bernstein laid out the significance of a Romney loss in Michigan, saying it would - at a minimum - prolong the Republican nominating process well beyond Super Tuesday on March 6.

HEADLINE: How to Get the Rich to Share the Marbles

BYLINE: JONATHAN HAIDT


HIGHLIGHT: Experiments with chimps and three-year-old children point the way toward greater economic justice. 

 BODY:
Suppose scientists discovered a clump of neurons in the brain that, when stimulated, turned people into egalitarians. This would be good news for Democratic strategists and speechwriters, who could now get to work framing arguments about wealth and taxation in ways that might activate the relevant section of cerebral cortex.
This "share-the-spoils" button has been discovered, in a sense, but it may turn out to be harder to press than Democrats might think.
Pretend you're a three-year-old, exploring an exciting new room full of toys. You and another child come up to a large machine that has some marbles inside, which you can see. There's a rope running through the machine and the two ends of the rope hang out of the front, five feet apart. If you or your partner pulls on the rope alone, you just get more rope. But if you both pull at the same time, the rope dislodges some marbles, which you each get to keep. The marbles roll down a chute, and then they divide: one rolls into the cup in front of you, three roll into the cup in front of your partner.
This is the scenario created by developmental psychologists Michael Tomasello and Katharina Hamann at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig, Germany. In this situation, where kids have to pull for anyone to get marbles, the children equalize the wealth about 75% of the time, with hardly any conflict. Either the "rich" kid hands over one marble spontaneously or else the "poor" kid asks for one and his request is immediately granted.
But an experiment must have more than one condition, and the experimenters ran two other versions of the study to isolate the active ingredient. What had led to such high rates of sharing, given that three-year-olds are often quite reluctant to share new treasures? Children who took part in the second condition found that the marbles were already waiting for them in the cups when they first walked up to the machine. No work required. 
In this condition, it's finders-keepers. If you have the bad luck to place yourself in front of the cup with one marble, then your partner is very unlikely to offer you one, you're unlikely to ask, and if you do ask, you're likely to be rebuffed. Only about 5% of the time did any marbles change hands.
But here's the most amazing condition - a slight variation that reveals a deep truth. Things start off just as in the first condition: you and your partner see two ropes hanging out of the machine. But as you start tugging it becomes clear that they are two separate ropes. You pull yours, and one marble rolls out into your cup. Your partner pulls the other rope, and is rewarded with three marbles. What happens next?
For the most part, it's pullers-keepers. Even though you and your partner each did the same work (rope pulling) at more or less the same time, you both know that you didn't really collaborate to produce the wealth. Only about 30% of the time did the kids work out an equal split. In other words, the "share-the-spoils" button is not pressed by the mere existence of inequality. It is pressed when two or more people to produce a gain. Once the button is pressed in both brains, both parties willingly and effortlessly share.
Tomasello has found that chimpanzees doing tasks similar to this one do not share the spoils, in any of the conditions. They just grab what they can, regardless of who did what. They don't seem to keep track of who was on the team. Tomasello believes that the "share-the-spoils" response emerged at some point in the last half-million years, as humans began to forage and hunt cooperatively. Those who had the response could develop stable, ongoing partnerships. They worked together in small teams, which accomplished far more than individuals could on their own.
So now let's look at a key line in President Obama's State of the Union address: "we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules." The president is making three arguments about fairness in this one sentence, but do any of them press the "share-the-spoils" button? If you think that the economy is like a giant marble dispenser with a single rope, then you'd probably agree that if everyone does their "fair share" and pulls on the rope as hard as they can, then everyone is entitled to a "fair share" in the nation's wealth. But do Americans perceive the economy as a giant collaborative project?
My parents were teenagers in New York City during the Second World War. The home front really was a vast and sustained communal pull. My mother remembers saving up nickels and dimes to buy a war bond. She lingered by her aunts and uncles, waiting for them to finish packs of cigarettes, so that she could grab the foil wrappers for the aluminum recycling campaign.
My parents were part of the generation that went through the depression, a world war, and then the cold war together. This generation accepted federal controls on wages during the war as being necessary for the common good. In the years after the war, the combination of high taxes on top earners, social norms against exorbitant pay, and an increasingly sturdy safety net brought income inequality down from a peak in 1929 to a long valley from the 1950s through the 1970s. It's a period known as "the great compression."
The compression went into reverse in the 1980s, and since then, inequality has risen to levels approaching those of 1929. Democrats have long sounded the alarm about rising inequality, but for decades they got little traction among the electorate. It's only in the last few months, since Occupy Wall Street popularized the concept of the 1 percent, and since we all learned that Mitt Romney pays less than 14% in federal taxes, that the nation's attention has been focused on the earnings of the super-rich. Will the Democrats' new emphasis on fairness be enough to rally the nation to raise the top tax rates? Will Obama's new progressivism press the right moral buttons?
America is in deep fiscal trouble, and things are going to get far worse when the baby boomers retire. Normally, when a nation faces a threat to its very survival, a leader can press the shared-sacrifice button. Churchill offered Britons nothing but "blood, toil, tears and sweat." John F. Kennedy asked us all to "bear the burden of a long twilight struggle" against communism. These were grand national projects, and everyone was asked to pitch in.
Unfortunately, President Obama promised he would not raise taxes on anyone but the rich. He and other Democrats have also vowed to "protect seniors" from cuts, even though seniors receive the vast majority of entitlement dollars. The president is therefore in the unenviable position of arguing that we're in big trouble and so a small percentage of people will have to give more, but most people will be protected from sacrifice. This appeal misses the shared-sacrifice button completely. It also fails to push the share-the-spoils button. When people feel that they're all pulling on different ropes, they don't feel entitled to a share of other people's wealth, even when that wealth was acquired by luck.
If the Democrats really want to get moral psychology working for them, I suggest that they focus less on fairness - which is about whether everyone got what they deserved - and more on fairness-which is about whether honest, open and impartial procedures were used to decide who got what. If there's a problem with the ultra-rich, it's not that they have too much wealth, it's that they bought laws that made it easy for them to gain and keep so much more wealth in recent decades.
Sarah Palin gave a speech last September lambasting "crony capitalism," which she defined as "the collusion of big government and big business and big finance to the detriment of all the rest - to the little guys." I think that she was on to something and that she was right to include big government along with big business and big finance. The problem isn't that some kids have many more marbles than others. The problem is that some kids are in cahoots with the experimenters. They get to rig the marble machine before the rest of us have a chance to play with it. 
The research reported on in this article was published in 2011 in Nature, 476, p. 328-331. (Hamann, K., Warneken, F., Greenberg, J. R., & Tomasello, M. Collaboration encourages equal sharing in children but not in chimpanzees.)

HEADLINE: A Charm Offensive Against AIDS

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
SOWETO, South Africa -- Shortly after Michel Sidibe became executive director of the United Nations' AIDS prevention agency, a court in Senegal sentenced nine gay men, all AIDS educators, to eight years in prison for ''unnatural acts.''
In one of his first moves as the new chief of U.N.AIDS, Mr. Sidibe flew to Senegal to ask its aging president, Abdoulaye Wade, to pardon the men.
Mr. Sidibe, the son of a Muslim politician from Mali and a white French Catholic, asked the president -- who is married to a white Frenchwoman -- if he had ever suffered discrimination.
''Oh, Sidibe, you have no idea,'' came the reply. ''And for not marrying a Muslim.'' 
''Then, Uncle,'' Mr. Sidibe said, using the African way to politely address an older man, ''why do you accept that men here are put in jail for eight years just for being gay?''
Mr. Wade thought about it and promised to call his justice minister. Shortly afterward, the charges were dropped.
Asked if his predecessor -- Dr. Peter Piot, a Belgian and one of the discoverers of the Ebola virus -- could have gotten the same results, Mr. Sidibe said, ''Without doubt, it would have been more difficult. It would be very automatically perceived as 'the white people moralizing to us again.' Since I'm African, I can raise it in a way that is less confrontational.''
Asked about that, Dr. Piot laughed and agreed, saying he sometimes thought his African missions, like those of the U2 singer Bono, ''felt like a junior Tanzanian economist and Hugh Masekela coming to Washington to scold Congress for its budget deficit'' -- with Congress having to grin and bear it because it needed Tanzania's cash.
Mr. Sidibe, 59, is a former relief worker, rather than a physician, and, along with English and French, he speaks West African Mandingo, the Tamashek of the Tuaregs and other languages.
With a combination of bonhomie and persistence, he has delivered difficult messages to African presidents very persuasively in his three years in office: Convince your men to get circumcised. Tell your teenage girls not to sleep with older men for money. Shelve your squeamishness and talk about condoms. Help prostitutes instead of jailing them. Ask your preachers to stop railing against homosexuals and order your police forces to stop beating them. Let Western scientists test new drugs and vaccines, despite the inevitable rumors that Africans are being used as guinea pigs.
''You can't say 'no' to Michel,'' said Dr. Piot, who hired him away from Unicef. ''I was at a conference in Ethiopia in December, and for the first time, I felt I was hearing 'ownership' of AIDS by African countries. They weren't talking so much about the donors, but about it as their own problem. I think he had a lot to do with that.''
Thanks, in part, to Mr. Sidibe's intensive lobbying, South Africa and China are rapidly revising their approaches to the epidemic, and he hopes Russia and India soon will too. And the notoriously conservative African Union has created a committee to help populations it previously ignored: homosexuals, prostitutes and drug abusers.
Mr. Sidibe is from so deep in Africa that his professional career actually began in Timbuktu, helping Tuareg nomads. (His grandfather, he said, was a Fulani nomad in the same desert.)
He has the African shtick down. He calls anyone younger than him ''my brother'' or ''my sister.'' He seems to remember, and hug, everyone he has met before, from drivers to senators to journalists. He regales guests at cocktail parties with long parables about chameleons that he learned as a teenager in circumcision school (a bonding ritual that many African men remember with a mix of fondness and terror -- a cross between boot camp and a bar mitzvah, but ending with a collective bris, sometimes done with a spear blade.)
And he is a relentless joker.
In South Africa, he passed through a maternity clinic in Soweto and greeted the women, whose bellies were bulging out of their robes. Ten minutes later, passing by again, he stopped. ''Ladies, you are still waiting?'' he teased. ''What is happening here? You must complain.''
Minutes later, in the circumcision ward, he was introduced to a stunning young surgeon, Dr. Josephine Otchere-Darko.
''Oh, my goodness, my sister, it is too late for me,'' he said flirtatiously. ''But do men here not mind being circumcised by a woman? In my country, it would be culturally impossible.''
Some men refused, Dr. Otchere-Darko acknowledged, but most didn't mind.
''Let us see,'' he said, wrapping his arm around her and sweeping her down the line to the first man waiting.
''My brother, I am a doctor, and so is this beautiful young woman. Whom do you choose to do your operation?''
The poor man gulped and looked nervously from one to the other, until Mr. Sidibe patted him on the shoulder and let him in on the joke.
Minutes later, the kidding ended as he met with infected women who had just given birth.
''You are the age of my last daughter,'' he said to a 21-year-old woman cradling her newborn. Crouching down so he could touch her knees, he asked if she knew how she had been infected.
''I am not sure,'' she answered softly, ''but when I was 12, I was raped by my cousin.''
Another cousin, sitting beside her, added, ''He raped all of us girls in the family as we came of age.''
''Where is he now?'' Mr. Sidibe asked, clearly upset.
''He is in jail,'' she said. ''But not for that.''
For the rest of his South Africa trip, Mr. Sidibe used that story to push politicians to attack their country's rape crisis.
Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi, South Africa's health minister, said Mr. Sidibe pursued him relentlessly at a United Nations conference in New York until they met. They became co-conspirators in getting Jacob Zuma, the country's new president, to budget more money for AIDS drugs and to press drug companies to lower prices. ''I was new to my office, and this man was just chasing me,'' Dr. Motsoaledi said. ''He insisted South Africa must take leadership on AIDS for Africa. I said: 'What about Botswana?' But he insisted.''
Mr. Sidibe then pursued Mr. Zuma.
When the two finally talked, Mr. Sidibe said, he appealed both to Mr. Zuma's sense of social justice and to his vanity, telling him the lives saved would be his noblest legacy.
(Mr. Zuma's predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, spent years questioning the existence of the virus and made drugs hard to get. Dr. Piot called his own dealings with Mr. Mbeki ''a total failure.'')
In a major speech in 2010, Mr. Zuma increased the national AIDS budget by 30 percent and, along with Mr. Sidibe, publicly took an AIDS test.
Thirteen million South Africans have done so, and nearly 500,000 people are getting treatment.
Mr. Sidibe also met with King Goodwill Zwelithini of the Zulus, one of South Africa's largest tribes, to give him evidence that circumcision -- which the king's ancestor Shaka had banned in the 1820s -- protected men against AIDS. In 2010, the king ordered all Zulu men -- perhaps five million -- to have the operation.
They aren't legally required to obey, but more than 75,000 have done so, said Dr. Zwele Mkhize, the premier of KwaZulu-Natal, the Zulu homeland.
Globally, Mr. Sidibe says, he is trying to ''be a voice for those without one.'' The groups that most need help, he argues, are the ones that no politician wants to be photographed with: gay men, prostitutes, transvestites, heroin users.
The only category in which there has been major progress is cutting transmission from mothers to babies.
''That's populist,'' Mr. Sidibe noted. ''Even the Tea Party would not oppose that.''
While the global battle against AIDS is still being lost, it is being lost less badly. Four years ago, 250 people were newly infected for every 100 people getting treatment; that number is now down to 200.
Mr. Sidibe gives most of the credit for that to a combination of generosity of donors, particularly from the United States, and to mundane but important societal changes like adults having fewer extramarital affairs and parents talking to their children about sex.
He fights conservatives on his agency's board, even allowing one agency magazine to be printed with a busty beauty on the cover -- and no clue until the photo spread on Brazilian transsexuals inside that she had once been a man.
He publicly congratulated India's ''hijra'' community of eunuchs and transsexuals on a court's overturning of the country's 160-year-old colonial-era sodomy laws.
Mr. Sidibe has also fought hard against harsh anti-gay laws in Africa, against hate crimes like the ''corrective rapes'' of lesbians by South African gangs -- and against the widespread belief that homosexuality is a Western import. He pressed China to admit that H.I.V. was spreading rapidly among gay men and drug users and that the 500,000 Chinese working in Africa and 40 million migrant laborers, many of whom visit prostitutes, were potential risk pools.
In 2009, he appeared in an awareness campaign with the basketball star Yao Ming.
China, which Mr. Sidibe described as ''immune to pressure, but very pragmatic,'' soon reversed several policies.
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao spoke at the United Nations in 2010 about holding the hands of AIDS patients, and zero-tolerance drug policies were dropped in favor of methadone and syringe-exchange. Mr. Sidibe was also one of the first to call for changing global policy to ''test and treat,'' which means putting infected people on drugs as soon as they are infected. While initially expensive for donors, it makes patients 96 percent less likely to infect others, ultimately saving money.
He is, of course, frustrated that donors have cut back, and has endorsed the controversial proposed ''Robin Hood tax,'' which would charge a fraction of a cent on every currency exchange transaction, and channel it to global health programs.
Mr. Sidibe focuses his lobbying on the BRICS countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. If each takes the lead in its region, he says, it will drag others along.
For example, without South African leadership, efforts in Lesotho and Mozambique will fail because their men work in South African mines and its hospitals are so advanced.
''In my village they said: If you want to kill the snake, you must hit the head,'' he said. ''In Africa, South Africa is the epidemic's head.''
Similarly, he said, former Soviet satellites still depend on Russia and have similar heroin-driven epidemics, so he is pushing for syringe-exchange and methadone programs.
Mr. Sidibe attributes his diplomatic skills to his unusual family.
His father was sent to France during World War II and fell in love. ''He was one of the first Africans married to a white lady, and when she came down to Mali in 1946, it was very difficult for them,'' Mr. Sidibe said.
Both families initially rejected the union, but they stayed married for 55 years, till his father's death.
In Marxist post-colonial Mali, Mr. Sidibe's father was a leader of the Social Democrats, risking imprisonment.
Mr. Sidibe had a traditional Malian birth, at home, with a midwife, protected by his grandmother's ''magic water.''
His first nickname was ''Trompe la Mort'' -- Fooler of Death -- because the umbilical cord was around his neck.
His family was well enough off to buy him shoes -- which he always took off on his way to school so his classmates wouldn't find out.
And when his brother, who was born in France and lived with his grandparents, finally rejoined the family at age 9, Michel, who was 6, had to fight for him every day. (One reason for the constant school punch-ups was that his lighter-skinned brother refused to admit being African; he also ran home at the first sign of trouble.)
Mr. Sidibe still calls his 88-year-old mother daily. When she saw him on TV getting an award from an American gay rights group, she asked, ''So, my son -- are you gay now?''
''No, Mama, not yet,'' he replied.
But his ''true mentor,'' Mr. Sidibe said, was a mentally ill man he used to pass on his way to school. He slowly befriended the man, who was known as Makan the Geek, to protect him from other boys who threw stones.
And when Makan was taken to an asylum, his mother let Michel take him food.
Helping someone who offered no more than a mute smile in return, he said, was a good lesson in empathy.
His father also ''told me to see people first as human beings, not as president or prime minister. That's why I can relate to a lady in the U.S. or to King Mswati in Swaziland.''
And whenever he declares a new goal, like zero new mother-to-child infections, he describes it as the one he wants to retire on.
''If we can win this one,'' Mr. Sidibe will say, ''I can go back home and sit under my mango tree and feel proud.''

HEADLINE: Restore Integrity at the Port Authority

BYLINE: By JAMESON W. DOIG. 
Jameson W. Doig, a professor in government at Dartmouth, is the author of ''Empire on the Hudson,'' a history of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

 BODY:
Hanover, N.H.
THE Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has been the subject of sustained criticism in the past several weeks. Some of it focuses on the sharp toll increases, together with the confusing justifications offered by the authority's commissioners for the increases. Then there is the recent ''audit report,'' a blistering critique commissioned by the authority, at the urging of the governors, which asserts that it is a ''dysfunctional organization suffering from a lack of consistent leadership.''
But these criticisms fail to address an important underlying issue -- the growing problem of patronage and cronyism that is infecting this critical agency, which operates the region's airports, bridges, tunnels, ports and the PATH train system. The governors of New York and New Jersey have been unable to resist meddling in the day-to-day operations of this multibillion-dollar agency and unwilling to appoint members to the authority's board of commissioners who will use their independent judgment to carry out a sustained program of critically needed transportation improvements without continual political interference. 
This was not always so. The bistate agency was created in 1921 and designed -- much like the Federal Reserve Board -- to be insulated from patronage demands and other short-term political pressures generated by mayors, legislatures and the governors themselves. Unlike regular government agencies, the Port Authority is overseen by 12 commissioners, six appointed by each governor, for six-year terms; it was designed so that a new governor could not simply dismiss the commissioners and replace them with friends or party loyalists.
For the first 75 years, this worked well: the commissioners allowed the executive director to recommend who should be chosen to manage the authority, and he was also given the power to protect department heads from the drumbeat of demands for patronage appointments. Career staff members studied problems like the need for bridges and tunnels (resulting in the construction of the George Washington Bridge and five other crossings), airport expansion and modernization, the development of maritime container ports and a wide range of other complex projects. Engineering analysis and traffic studies were carried out by experts; their studies were closely examined by respected senior staff members and the commissioners; pressures to meet short-term political goals of local politicians and state officials were almost always fended off; and projects were completed, often under cost and within the estimated time.
(Two exceptions underscore the advantage of political insulation: While the George Washington Bridge was being designed in the 1920s, New Jersey's governor demanded that the authority use wire rope from a New Jersey company, generating jobs in Trenton; with the help of Alfred E. Smith, New York's governor, the agency successfully resisted that demand. And when the Port Authority Bus Terminal was being constructed, two powerful state senators, one from New York and the other from New Jersey, demanded that ''their'' company be given the main contract; the authority's engineering staff examined the record of spotty past construction work by that organization and -- with the support of the commissioners and both governors -- selected a stronger firm.)
In recent years, the governors of both states have bypassed the commissioners and imposed their own choices as executive director and deputy director (one appointed by each governor, resulting in managerial confusion at the top of the agency). As a result, there have been seven executive or acting executive directors in the past 10 years, hindering the authority's ability to maintain a steady course. Moreover, outside political demands, mainly coming from the governors' offices, have generated jobs for the politically connected -- initially just a handful for each state, but growing steadily over time. Their political patrons have protected these men and women from removal, and the executive director and senior staff members have had to work around these individuals, whose qualifications have in most cases been more political than substantive.
Since Chris Christie became governor of New Jersey in 2010, the Port Authority has faced an increase in demands that party workers and their family members be given jobs. While decrying ''cronyism'' in government offices, Governor Christie has become the primary agent of patronage and favoritism at the agency. He has urged the authority to hire more than 50 men and women, according to records provided by the authority in response to a wrongful-termination lawsuit. Those hired appear to be qualified mainly through their political activities. For example, four are former Republican mayors and eight have served as Republican staff members at local and state levels. The positions range from fairly senior (manager of a marine terminal and director of capital projects) to midlevel (financial analysts, auditor, project manager) to entirely operational (toll collectors and track workers).
Faced with this politicization, the six New Jersey commissioners stood by passively. So did Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the six New York commissioners. Asked about those hirings at a recent news conference, Governor Christie said, ''I make no apologies about trying to put some people in place who are going to understand what the view of this administration is'' and who will execute ''in a way that's consistent with my policies.'' How that reasoning applies to toll collectors and track workers is unclear, but in any event, it is the standard excuse whenever patronage is king.
The negative impact on morale at the authority and the burden of working around the less competent members of the new staff are costs that seem to concern neither the governors nor the commissioners. Yet the ability of the agency to respond to the challenges it faces -- completing the World Trade Center, carrying out a large menu of other regional construction and modernization tasks, while trimming costs -- is handicapped by this array of patronage employees.
What is to be done? The 12 commissioners need to exercise the power that is formally theirs -- ending their recent tendency to be simply obedient assistants to the governors, passively accepting patronage appointments and whatever actions fit a governor's short-term political needs. Under the interstate compact that created the authority, the commissioners are expected to exercise their independent judgment to carry out a coherent program of transportation improvements that will stimulate economic development in the region. Their six-year terms mean that neither governor can simply fire those with whom he disagrees.
Either governor can resort to vetoing Port Authority projects, hoping thereby to intimidate the agency; but that action -- at times threatened in previous decades -- generates a political cost that governors have almost always found too great to endure. In any case, when it comes to the region's future, it is surely better for the agency's leaders to confront the wrath of the governors and other politicians than to stand by while the Port Authority withers into a pool of patronage and diminished competence. In time, the governors themselves will realize that their own reputations, as well as the health of the bistate region, will be stronger if they adopt a more constructive stance.

HEADLINE: The Love Of the Law, Still Fulfilled

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
He has the white hair and the black robe.
But this judge, up on the bench in Queens Supreme Court, is a little different from most of the other 1,200 in the state's courts. Judge Allen Beldock, 92, is paid nothing. Zip. Nada. No salary. In this era of budget cuts, no honorarium.
Not even gas money. 
Of course, after 44 years on the bench, coming to work just about every day is second nature, he said recently, maybe 130 pounds soaking wet, judicial robe included, leaning back at a desk he uses at the courthouse on Sutphin Boulevard in Jamaica.
''If I were not a judge, I wouldn't be doing anything,'' he said. ''What would I be doing if I were not a judge? What am I even qualified to do? I've been a judge for 44 years. My father was a butcher. I'm not trained to be a butcher.''
So, four days a week, Judge Beldock gets into his eight-year-old Chevrolet Impala, which has seen better days, and makes his way to the courthouse. Mondays and Tuesdays he shepherds damage suits. Thursdays and Fridays he supervises jury selection.
Of course, for most of those 44 years, he did get a check, first as a full-time judge hearing criminal cases, and later, after he officially retired more than 20 years ago, as a judge paid a daily rate of $300 to handle civil cases. Then the fiscal crisis hit the courts about a year ago, the budget was cut and a lot of the retired judges who had been $300-a-day ''judicial hearing officers'' went home.
Not Judge Beldock. Like a hardy few other retired judges around the state -- one or two in Manhattan, at least one in Brooklyn -- he has continued with a more or less full schedule for no compensation whatsoever.
Why? Well, there is the love of the law. But there are other contributing factors.
''I don't read books,'' Judge Beldock said.
''I've done all my traveling,'' he said.
And the city's glittering cultural life? ''I'm not a big fan of museums. I've been to them.''
One of his three quite-grown children, Neil Beldock, 55, said in a separate interview that it was almost as if his father had no choice: ''I think he just loves going to court and being in court every day.''
Judge Beldock ruled out returning to practicing law, as he did for years before Mayor John V. Lindsay appointed him to the bench in 1968. ''I don't want to deal with clients,'' he said.
But working, he added, does beat one of the alternatives. ''Too many of my friends that I did have over the years, when they stopped working or retired, they died,'' he said with a matter-of-factness befitting a lifelong New Yorker.
Judges, all-powerful when they are sitting up a step or two on the bench, evidently are just mortals. Judge Beldock said a dozen of them used to crowd around a big table every day at the Flagship Diner on Queens Boulevard. These days, he said, he is often the only one.
''They're dead,'' he said. ''You'd be amazed. I could give you a list.''
In reports and hearings, bar associations have bemoaned the loss of the judicial hearing officers, saying that they helped the overburdened judiciary keep some limits on ballooning court delays and that their decades of experience could be useful. But the salad days for retired judges do seem to be over.
For some of them, the end of their judging may be a little hard to take, though they do get healthy pensions and good benefits. For Judge Beldock, the per diem job also brought growing acknowledgment as the decades passed and he became a senior statesman of the courts. The Daily News recognized him a couple of years ago as the oldest state judge at work in the five boroughs. That was before the cuts.
At first, while court officials were deciding whether to permit some of the retirees to come back as volunteers, his new unemployment was strange. Long a widower, Judge Beldock said he would be unsure how to begin the day if a tie and a black robe were not involved. ''I'd just feel, 'I gotta get up because I gotta eat to live,' '' he said. ''I'd buy the paper and I would read.''
Some paid judges and some lawyers disparage the volunteer judges as dabblers. But in his courtroom the other day, some lawyers waiting for cases said Judge Beldock seemed to be the real thing.
''He's still as sharp as I would imagine he was,'' said Bradley M. Wanner, a young lawyer.
John J. Proios, a lawyer himself for 49 years, said Judge Beldock ''is like me, an old goat.''
The task at hand, setting schedules for recently filed suits, was not too demanding. But the proceedings may have seemed a touch more official because of the white-haired gentleman on the bench, peering through bifocals, as judges do.
In an interview, an appeals court judge with many years' experience in the courts, Justice Randall T. Eng, said Judge Beldock had had that judicial look since Mr. Eng first appeared before him as a young prosecutor in the early 1970s.
''He always had white hair,'' Justice Eng said. ''He actually hasn't changed much.''
Judge Beldock said that even back at the beginning, he was proud of the position.
''I'm called 'Judge' wherever I go,'' he said. Maybe you cannot put a price on that.

HEADLINE: In Reality And Film, A Battle For Schools

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- On Tuesday officials in Adelanto, a California desert town, are set to consider whether parents there can be the first to take over a failing public school under a new state law that is being closely watched around the country.
The Hollywood version? It's already a done deal.
In a rare mix of hot policy debate and old-fashioned screen drama, 20th Century Fox is preparing a September release for ''Won't Back Down.'' The film heads smack into the controversies around so-called parent trigger laws that in California and a handful of other states allow parents to dump bad teachers and overrule administrators in bottom-ranked schools.
Viola Davis, an Oscar nominee as best actress for ''The Help,'' plays a teacher who risks career and friendships to join the revolt. Maggie Gyllenhaal is the single mother who sells cars, tends bar and rouses parents to take charge of their grade school. 
Holly Hunter, the union rep, loves her teachers and so she fights the takeover with a ploy you might expect from a corporate villain.
''When did Norma Rae get to be the bad guy?'' Ms. Hunter mutters. Her role recalls the title character in the pro-union film ''Norma Rae,'' as she navigates the ferocious politics of education reform's nuclear option, the trigger laws.
These measures have backers on both ends of the political spectrum and on both economic extremes: from Bill Gates, whose charitable foundation supports the takeover movement, to the poor or working-class parents of Adelanto. But they have also pushed unions and school administrators into an unwelcome role as opponents of change.
Now the trigger laws have connected with a movie culture whose new preoccupation with timeliness lends urgency and risk to reality-inspired dramas that in the past were usually set safely in the past.
''Won't Back Down'' describes itself as being ''inspired by actual events.'' But it portrays a fiercely contested school takeover -- set in Pittsburgh, though Pennsylvania does not have a trigger law -- before any has occurred in real life.
Texas, Ohio and Connecticut are among states that now permit a trigger process. But a take-over in Adelanto would be the country's first, according to Ben Austin, the executive director of Parent Revolution, which promotes the tactic with backing from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
''I thought it was a prank,'' Mr. Austin said of his surprise at a call in which he learned that Walden Media, backed by the conservative-leaning billionaire Philip Anschutz, was shooting a drama in which teachers and parents aim to take charge.
For Walden, the film is a second shot at an education-reform movie. With Mr. Gates and the progressive-minded Participant Media, Walden was among the financial backers of the documentary ''Waiting for 'Superman.' ''
That film, released in 2010, advocated, as potential solutions to an education crisis, charter schools, teacher testing and an end to tenure. But it took in only about $6.4 million at the box office and received no Oscar nominations after union officials and others strongly attacked it.
''We realized the inherent limitations of the documentary format,'' said Michael Bostick, chief executive of Walden. Now, he said, the idea is to reach a larger audience through the power of actors playing complicated characters who struggle with issues that happen to be, in his phrase, ''ripped from the headlines.''
''Detachment,'' by Tony Kaye, another film set in troubled schools, is set to open in New York and Los Angeles next month.
Daniel Barnz, the director and a writer of ''Won't Back Down,'' said he had wanted to recreate the thrill of past action-inspiring social dramas without being snared in partisan debate. Working from an earlier script by Brin Hill, he introduced the parent-trigger mechanism as a plot device but insisted that the character played by Ms. Davis be a teacher, thus bringing teachers into the reform process.
''I am extremely pro-union,'' Mr. Barnz said. In the movie's fictionalized law for Pennsylvania (which, because it was shot there, helped subsidize the film's $20 million budget with a tax credit), a school takeover could occur only if a majority of both parents and teachers were to demand it, rather than parents alone, as in California.
Wythe Keever, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania State Education Association, a teacher's union, said his organization, though wary of existing trigger laws, would look more kindly on a system that included teacher input. But he cautioned against another premise of ''Won't Back Down'': that union contracts have sometimes impeded reform.
''Collective bargaining is not the problem,'' Mr. Keever said in an interview on Friday. ''It produces protections not only for the teachers, but for the students.''
Mark Johnson, who produced ''Won't Back Down,'' said the film's humanity might outshine its politics. ''With issues movies, some of those you remember best you remember for the people, not the issues,'' he offered.
For Ms. Davis, certainly, the appeal is personal. In what she called her first real leading role -- in ''The Help,'' she fronted an ensemble -- Ms. Davis described her character as wrestling personal demons while fighting for something that does not involve race. ''I've never had that,'' she said.
As for education, she added, experience persuades her of the need for teachers and mentors who can operate outside the system. ''I'm sorry, I just know if you don't have a strong advocate for a child, they're not going to make it,'' she said in an interview.
Ms. Gyllenhaal framed her character, a frustrated parent, as ''someone who doesn't think of herself as an activist at all,'' but ''gets radicalized by the situation she's in.'' She is much like Meryl Streep in the activist thriller ''Silkwood,'' Ms. Gyllenhaal noted, or the flawed, sexy legal crusader played by Julia Roberts in ''Erin Brockovich.''
Events in that film occurred in Hinkley, Calif., which, coincidentally, is near Adelanto, the town where a trigger petition will be reviewed on Tuesday at a school board meeting that could match a big moment in ''Won't Back Down.''
''Next Tuesday night's board meeting will see a show of force'' by both parents in favor of the takeover and the California Teachers Association, whose Adelanto chapter has helped those opposing it, said an internal memo circulated among Parent Revolution executives last week. The memo predicted confrontations between supporters and opponents and said that ''a range of provocative techniques'' would frame the session.
If teachers were included in a trigger attempt -- as happens in ''Won't Back Down'' -- the California Teachers Association, which has avoided taking a formal position, would look more favorably on the action, suggested Frank Wells, a union spokesman.
Still, he voiced surprise that the parent trigger laws should become a subject for Hollywood at all. ''I can't wait for 'Vouchers 3-D: The Movie,' '' he said.

HEADLINE: Yesterday's Moonshiner Is Today's Microdistiller

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
PARROTTSVILLE, Tenn. -- This is a story about a man named Marvin Sutton and how he proved that the road from criminality to commodity is sometimes shorter than it looks.
Until his death in 2009 at the age of 62, Mr. Sutton, known as Popcorn, was a moonshiner. He was not quite the last, as he often claimed, but he was probably the most famous ever to work out of Cocke County, which long had a claim as the nation's moonshining capital.
It may yet again. As of last Thursday, microdistilleries are legal in Cocke County for the first time. And at the head of the line is a distillery making Mr. Sutton's recipe.
Nestled in the rocky embrace of the Great Smoky Mountains, Cocke County was a moonshine center for as long as anyone here can recall. 
For most families, in a rugged place with few opportunities, it was a matter of survival. But for an enterprising few, making and hauling untaxed and unregulated liquor became a profitable, dangerous and inevitably romanticized trade.
Making moonshine later began to give way to growing marijuana, and by the 1960s the county was notorious for chop shops, cockfighting rings, prostitution and corrupt officials. Over the decades, the lawless elements have been corralled for the most part. But the bad old image of Cocke County lingers. And irks.
''They're having to live down now that reputation they got some time ago,'' said Al Schmutzer Jr., who for 32 years was the district attorney here.
Thus the complicated legacy of Popcorn Sutton.
A North Carolinian by birth, Mr. Sutton learned to distill in Cocke County, where he was known as an affable rogue and a maker of potent but fine-tasting corn whiskey. He lived in a cluttered cabin on a wooded hill where he also built his stills, gave pistols to the incoming sheriffs and fathered so many children that no one has any idea of the exact accounting.
But perhaps his greatest gift, and his most notable departure from the standard moonshining model, was in the field of marketing.
''He's very atypical,'' said Duay O'Neil, who writes a weekly column in The Newport Plain Talk about the county's history. ''He gave the world what they expected of a moonshiner. He dressed the part and he talked the talk.'' Mr. Sutton's beard and profanity were equally effusive.
''And he made a good product,'' Mr. O'Neil added, ''which I can say from experience.''
In 1999, Mr. Sutton published ''Me and My Likker,'' a rambling, obscene and often hilarious account of his life in the trade. Soon after, he was featured in a documentary ''This is the Last Dam Run of Likker I'll Ever Make'' (later recut as ''The Last One''), which he sold out of a North Carolina junk shop. It became a cult hit, leading to newspaper features, occasional meetings with celebrities and a high-profile role in a 2007 History Channel documentary.
At one point, Mr. Sutton even made business cards.
''I told him, 'Old man, you can't be a movie star and make liquor too,' '' said Mark Ramsey, a close friend. ''He said, 'You can't sell it if nobody knows you got it.' I don't know whether he had a point or not.''
In March 2008, Mr. Sutton, who had had run-ins with the law about once a decade, was arrested by federal authorities after offering to sell nearly 1,000 gallons of moonshine to an undercover agent. Despite a guilty plea, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison by a federal judge plainly displeased with Mr. Sutton's fondness for publicity. It came as a shock, said his friends, to whom he had sworn he would not go to prison.
While under house arrest, Mr. Sutton befriended a 29-year-old former motocross racer named Jamey Grosser, who came to Tennessee with plans to set up a legal distillery. Mr. Sutton sold Mr. Grosser the recipe for his whiskey and they worked out a partnership deal.
Then, on the morning of March 16, 2009, four days before Mr. Sutton was to report to prison, he climbed into the green Ford Fairlane parked in his yard and, having rigged a pipe from the tailpipe through the back seat, killed himself.
The Popcorn Sutton industry was far from finished.
The Discovery Channel made him a principal figure in a series about moonshiners. One of Mr. Sutton's daughters, a surgeon in Alaska, has sued his widow over the rights to his book. Another daughter wrote her own book, ''Daddy Moonshine.''
Pam Sutton, whom he married in 2007, has made Popcorn Sutton T-shirts, key chains and ladies' undergarments. ''He would like the attention but he would swear he didn't,'' she said, adding that strangers frequently show up at the house wanting tours.
A few months after Mr. Sutton's death, a state law allowing microdistilleries was passed. Mr. Grosser, who now had a new partner in Hank Williams Jr., set up a distillery in Nashville, which as of last fall began producing 800 cases of Popcorn Sutton's Tennessee White Whiskey a month.
Mr. Grosser has long planned to open a distillery in Cocke County, possibly with a museum attached. He discussed it with county officials, who had come to see Mr. Sutton's legacy, in a rather amusing twist, as a potentially rich source of tax revenue in a county that has its economic struggles.
But Cocke County was among several counties that remained exceptions to the microdistillery law. The county board held a vote on whether to opt in, and the members unanimously voted no.
Norman Smith, who is on the board, said he objected to alcohol on moral grounds, but also feared that this would only reinforce stubborn and unfair stereotypes. ''Our school system's winning national awards,'' he said. ''And you've got an image of: 'They can make moonshine. That's all they can do.' ''
Proponents made a simple counterargument. ''We've had such a bad reputation for so long,'' said Mr. Ramsey, ''why not turn it around and make some money off it?''
When the board took a new vote last October, most members voted to opt in, prompting the legislature to include Cocke County in the microdistiller law. After all these years, Mr. Sutton's whiskey is now legitimate here, from production to consumption.
This would be to Mr. Sutton's liking, Mr. Ramsey said, as he wanted to leave his widow comfortable. But Mr. Ramsey also suspects that Mr. Sutton would himself probably have kept doing it the old way. His final message to the public seems to bear that out. On the footstone of his grave, there is only a four-word phrase. ''Popcorn Said -- '' it begins, and the rest is unfit to print.

HEADLINE: Some Doubt A Settlement Will Eliminate Mortgage Ills

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Even as government officials prepare to unveil new standards this week for how banks treat millions of Americans facing foreclosure, housing advocates and homeowners are skeptical the rules will be able to do something past efforts have not: provide a beleaguered borrower with one individual to help them navigate the mortgage maze.
While the entire process of seeking a mortgage modification is complicated and time-consuming, few elements are as maddening as the inability to get through to a representative at the bank, or being asked for the same documents again and again. 
So the promise of a single point of contact has emerged as a crucial element in the much-ballyhooed $26 billion settlement reached earlier this month involving state attorneys general, the federal government and the five biggest mortgage servicers. These rules will apply nationwide and come with commitments of strong enforcement by federal and state authorities, but they carry a familiar ring for those experienced in the foreclosure process.
Last April, the industry made many of the same pledges under a consent order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and since then, consumer representatives say, there has been barely any improvement, adding that loan files continue to be handed off from one agent to another, sometimes weekly, and that even when a single person is assigned to their cases, one phone call after another goes unreturned.
''It doesn't seem like much has changed,'' said Josh Zinner, co-director of the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project, or Nedap, a resource and advocacy center that works with community groups in New York. ''We're still seeing the same systematic problems.''
Susan Hall, a homeowner in Cotati, Calif., who has been trying to modify the terms of her mortgage since October 2009, thought she was in luck last October when she got a letter informing her that a single person had been assigned to her case by her servicer, Bank of America. Within weeks, she got three more letters, all with different names as her ostensible point of contact. None of them proved able to help.
''I just keep getting passed from one person to another,'' she said. To make matters worse, her house is now valued at less than her mortgage, putting her among the 10.7 million American mortgage holders who are so-called underwater borrowers. ''Nobody is willing to talk to me.''
The architects of the new settlement say they are keenly aware of these complaints, and the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Shaun Donovan, alluded to them when he announced the deal with Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Ally Financial on Feb. 9.
''No more lost paperwork, no more excuses, no more runaround,'' he said. The new standards, he added, would ''force the banks to clean up their acts.''
Besides improved servicing standards to be released in the next few days in Washington, the deal is also supposed to provide one million underwater borrowers with reductions in what they owe on their mortgages or the ability to refinance at lower rates. An additional 750,000 people who lost their homes to foreclosure from the beginning of 2008 to the end of 2011 are eligible to receive checks for up to roughly $2,000 each.
While most homeowner advocates welcome the new settlement, many are skeptical about whether the banks will actually change their behavior.
''There's a lot I've seen over the past few years that makes me very wary,'' said Lisa Sitkin, a lawyer with Housing and Economic Rights Advocates in Oakland, Calif. ''Things fall through the cracks all the time. Our view is that the banks are still not doing what needs to be done.''
Despite last April's settlement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, for example, she said: ''Things have improved only marginally. Every week, the banks come up with new ways to make borrowers' lives incredibly difficult.''
Officials at the comptroller's office insist that the banks have made considerable progress since the consent order was agreed to last spring, adding that the single point of contact and other improvements should be largely in effect by the end of 2012.
''We are satisfied they are moving in that direction,'' said Bruce Krueger, lead mortgage expert at the comptroller's office and a member of its large bank supervision team. ''These are large companies with a lot of complicated processes. It's not just about putting a Band-Aid on the issue, it's about getting the issue right.''
In some cases lately, frustrated homeowners have had more success. From July of last year to January, Stacy Brown of Brentwood, Calif., said she had called her single point of contact at JPMorgan Chase 30 times and managed to get in touch only once. But after repeatedly calling the executive offices at JPMorgan and also filing complaints with regulators like the comptroller's office and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Ms. Brown managed to find another, more effective representative and was recently approved for a modification. ''It's a miracle,'' she said. ''She actually picks up the phone when I call.''
As for Ms. Hall, Bank of America officials say she was declined for a modification under the federal government's HAMP mortgage modification program, but they are still reviewing her case and exploring other options that would still permit a modification or principal reduction.
Bank of America officials said that they began converting customers to the single point of contact system in the third quarter of last year, and that the conversion process was completed at the end of last month. JPMorgan Chase said it has reduced the backlog of customer complaints by 62 percent since they peaked last year.
Last year's agreement with the comptroller's office is not the only enforcement action that has been slow to pay dividends. Three and a half years after a landmark settlement to resolve complaints against subprime giant Countrywide Financial, the architects of that deal say they hope the servicing standards that will be unveiled this week in Washington will have more of an impact.
''The problems haven't been rectified and borrowers continue to get the runaround,'' said Terry Goddard, who until last year served as Arizona's attorney general and was among the designers of the Countrywide settlement. ''It was not successful, and I hope it's a powerful lesson about what needs to be done in this agreement. Trust, but verify.''

HEADLINE: Sewage's Toxic Smell, Smothered by Coffee

BYLINE: By SINDYA N. BHANOO

 BODY:
Coffee lovers around the world can rejoice: The piles of grounds they discard could help rid the world of the toxic smell of sewage. 
Writing in The Journal of Hazardous Materials, researchers at the City University of New York report that coffee grounds can absorb hydrogen sulfide gas, a big part of what makes sewage smell so terrible.
Today, activated carbons or porous coals are used in treatment facilities to draw hydrogen sulfide from sewage. But when coffee grounds are transformed into activated carbon, the researchers found that they sop up sulfur particularly well. That's because of a key ingredient in coffee: caffeine.
Caffeine contains nitrogen, which increases carbon's ability to eliminate sulfur from the air, said Teresa J. Bandosz, a chemist and chemical engineer at CUNY and an author of the report. To carbonize the coffee grounds, she and her colleagues mixed the grounds with water and zinc, and then dried the mixture in an oven. Dr. Bandosz hopes that entrepreneurs might take the research and turn it into a business.
A coffee drinker herself, Dr. Bandosz came up with the idea because she throws out piles of coffee grounds. ''Fresh coffee would work even better -- it has more caffeine,'' she said. ''But it is not economical.''

HEADLINE: Permira Sifts For Bargains, Even at Edges Of Europe

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT. 
Andrew Ross Sorkin, whose DealBook column normally appears on this page, is off.

 BODY:
LONDON - Kurt Bjorklund does not seem worried about Europe's sovereign debt crisis.
As competitors pull back from the troubled market, his private equity firm has doubled down on the region, picking through distressed companies from Dublin to Dubrovnik.
Since the start of 2010, Permira, one of the largest buyout specialists in Europe, has spent almost $6 billion, including acquisitions in debt-ridden countries like Spain and Ireland. The firm bought the call center operator Genesys from the Franco-American telecommunications company Alcatel-Lucent for $1.5 billion in early February.
''This is the right time to be staying in - not getting out of - the market,'' said Mr. Bjorklund, a co-managing partner at Permira, which has assets of 20 billion euros. ''Europe is a complicated place to do business, but the outlook for investing is good.''
Now, the private equity firm is playing up its Continental roots, as it looks to expand in the United States and elsewhere. To differentiate itself from rivals, Permira, in part, highlights it regional network of offices. The firm operates in eight European countries, compared to three for Blackstone and two for Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. 
''You can't do private equity in Europe if you are just based in London,'' said Mr. Bjorklund, 42, who joined the firm in 1996 after working for the Boston Consulting Group in Sweden. In each country, private equity firms require on-the-ground knowledge, says Mr. Bjorklund, who is from Finland.
Permira will need to draw on that experience as the European economy slides toward recession. The gross domestic product of the euro zone is expected to contract 0.5 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Southern European countries - where Permira currently has six holdings - will be the worst hit. Spain's economy is forecast to shrink 1.7 percent this year, while Italian G.D.P. is predicted to fall 2.2 percent.
The private equity industry has felt the ripple effects of the economic turmoil. As banks have pulled back on lending, buyout firms have been reaching deeper into their pockets to finance deals. Last year, debt - or leverage - represented 55 percent of European buyout deals, compared to 66 percent in 2007, according to data provider Standard & Poor's LCD.
''It has become more difficult to finance buyout deals,'' said Peter Roosenboom, a private equity professor at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. ''Leverage isn't as cheap as it was before the crisis.''
Permira has ridden out previous periods of uncertainty. The private equity firm was founded in 1985, after the buyout divisions of the European asset manager Schroder were spun off as a separate business. Since then, it has weathered the reunification of Germany, the creation of the euro as well as the slow growth and high unemployment that have characterized Europe's economy over the last two decades.
Last year, valuations across the firm's three active funds increased by a combined 16 percent, compared with a more than 30 percent rise recorded in 2010. Its portfolio of 25 companies, including the German high-end fashion retailer Hugo Boss, the Asian casino operator Galaxy Entertainment and the Spanish fast-food chain Telepizza, currently has a combined market value of around $80 billion.
Amid the upheaval, Permira is trying capitalize on Europe's fragmented markets. The private equity firm focuses on leading local companies in a small number of sectors, like financial services and consumer products. Then it consolidates those businesses to create larger regional players.
With growing demand for low-cost travel, Permira joined forces with rival Axa Private Equity last year, merging three online travel Web sites across the Continent. Each company - eDreams of Spain, Opodo of Britain and GO Voyages of France - had a strong market share in specific areas in Europe, but now cover all 27 countries in the region.
Permira also emphasizes global brands with a significant portion of revenues overseas. Last December, it bought a controlling stake in Netafim, a leading water irrigation company majority owned by three kibbutzim in Israel. Despite its Israeli heritage, Netafim holds a dominant market share in more than 100 countries worldwide.
The Permira team spent over a year - and more than 60 separate trips to Israel - convincing the owners to sell. In the end, the firm beat out other leading private equity firms, after owners interviewed an executive from another Israeli company in Permira's portfolio.
''We had to convince them that we would be able to take the company forward,'' said Jorg Rockenhauser, 45, the head of Permira's Frankfurt office.
With less debt financing available, Permira's network of offices across Europe could give it at a competitive advantage, according to Stefano Caselli, a finance professor at Bocconi University in Milan. Private equity players can no longer offer high valuations, financed by debt, to takeover targets, so local contacts able to woo companies are increasingly important.
''Investors are looking for private equity firms with strong roots and high levels of expertise,'' Mr. Caselli said. ''Today, leverage isn't enough. You have to fundamentally know the company you're investing in.''
Still, convincing investors to part with cash just as Europe's economy is going from bad to worse remains a tough sell. Permira has been raising a new 6.5 billion euro fund - one third smaller than its previous fund raised in 2006. Tom Lister, 47, Permira's other co-managing partner who is based in New York, said he had spent a lot of time with potential United States investors explaining the implications of the Continent's debt crisis. Much of the discussions have focused on short-term problems facing the euro zone, like the bailout of Greece.
Despite the challenges, Mr. Lister said Permira's long-term American backers have experience investing in Europe and understand the Continent will most likely bounce back from its current difficulties.
''There's more uncertainty for U.S. investors because of the lack of information coming out of Europe,'' said Mr. Lister, who joined Permira in 2005 after more than a decade with New York buyout firm Forstmann Little. ''But North American investors continue to commit funds to Europe.''
Permira's returns will depend on its finding buyers for its assets. In November, the firm sold the Dutch animal feed company Provimi to Cargill for $2.1 billion, more than doubling its initial investment. Permira also sold one-third of its stake in Galaxy Entertainment last September for $616 million.
Future deals may be more difficult. The market for initial public offerings is still shaky. Nonfinancial companies also are wary of spending their cash reserves on acquisitions, given continued weakness in the broader European economy. In 2010, Permira shelved its plans to take the British fashion retailer New Look public because of volatility.
But the private equity firm is willing to wait out the tumult. The amount of distressed assets in Europe is likely to rise, and Permira is currently focused on expanding, not reducing, its portfolio of companies, according to Mr. Bjorklund.
''We never want to be held hostage to an I.P.O. as the only possibility,'' Mr. Bjorklund said. ''If you have a market-leading business, you will always have different exit opportunities.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Yemen's President Cedes Authority With Election, but Hopes to Retain Influence

BYLINE: By LAURA KASINOF

 BODY:
SANA, Yemen -- A day before a national vote that will signify the formal end of his presidency, Ali Abdullah Saleh signaled his hope to be an anomaly in the Arab Spring: a toppled autocrat who can preserve some degree of influence in his nation's governance.
''I say farewell to the authority,'' Mr. Saleh said in a written statement read Monday by an anchor, Amal al-Sharamy, on Yemen state TV. 
''I remain with you a citizen loyal to his homeland, his people and his nation as you have known me through thick and thin,'' Ms. Sharamy read as she began to weep. ''I will perform my duty and my role in serving the country and its just causes'' via the ruling party.
Yemenis are scheduled to formalize the selection of a new president on Tuesday when they go to the polls, where there will be only one candidate, Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansour al-Hadi, who was nominated in a deal between the ruling party and formal opposition parties. The vote will serve as a mechanism to formally remove Mr. Saleh from power and strip him of his authority.
Though it is hardly an exercise in democracy, it is an important transitional moment for a nation that has been mired in conflict for more than a year, leaving its troubled economy in tatters and many people dead or wounded.
The prospect of an end to the violence and a chance at rebuilding delighted many Yemenis and provoked a noticeable change of mood on the streets of Sana.
''It's finished,'' said Obaid Ahmed, a thin taxi driver wearing a blue scarf wrapped around his head. ''The war is over. There are no more checkpoints. Seventieth Street is open -- the situation is improving,'' he said, referring to a large street that passes in front of the Presidential Palace and has been closed since a fatal bomb attack on Mr. Saleh's mosque in June. Its closure jammed traffic in Sana for months, making commuting across the city a test of patience.
But there was also a recognition by many that the transition of power was merely a first step, with lots of work awaiting a nation that has become increasingly troubled. One task ahead is the need to restore the ability to fight terrorism as Al Qaeda and its followers have taken advantage of the power vacuum in Yemen to spread their influence and control.
A high-ranking Yemeni official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject said the United States would be playing a leading role in the restructuring of the armed forces after Mr. Hadi officially became president. John Brennan, President Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser, said there would be a series of visits from United States officials who would focus on a variety of issues, including military restructuring.
''There needs to be a national army and national military that is going to fight against Al Qaeda,'' Mr. Brennan said in a telephone interview. United States assistance will go only to military and security units that are commanded by individuals who ''are going to be professional and direct their forces appropriately,'' he said. ''We believe the Yemeni people are tired of having Yemeni military point their guns at one another.''
Speaking from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Mr. Brennan said the United States ''applauds President Saleh's most recent statement supporting the election and Vice President Hadi's candidacy, and we encourage President Saleh to continue to play a constructive role as Yemen's political transition moves forward.''
The United States government has had an extensive -- and at times frustrating -- relationship with Mr. Saleh over the past year while trying to ease him out of office. The autocrat, who has ruled this impoverished nation for more than 33 years, finally signed on to an internationally brokered agreement in November, transferring some of his presidential powers to Mr. Hadi and paving the way for Tuesday's vote.
Having just finished a short trip here to the Yemeni capital, Mr. Brennan said he sensed ''hope and optimism'' from the nation's leading officials in regard to the transition process.
Yet this hope, which many Yemenis are expressing for the first time in a long time, was also tempered by continuing violence.
In the southern port city Aden, there was an explosion on Monday at a voting center when gunmen open fired at a military unit, killing one soldier, Reuters reported. Voter turnout in the south, where a local secessionist movement is discouraging the population from taking part in the election, is expected to be very low. The same is expected in far northern Yemen, in Saada Province, which is controlled by a militant rebel group known as the Houthis.
The vote on Tuesday also did not guarantee an end to a violent clash between Mr. Saleh's supporters and the opposition. Over the past year, a powerful military commander, Maj. Gen. Ali Mohsin al-Ahmar, split from the president and announced his support for a popular protest movement that swept through the country as similar popular uprisings spread across the Arab world.
The feud between Mr. Saleh and General Ahmar, which was waged on the streets of Sana and is not yet resolved, is a lingering issue ''simmering beneath the surface,'' Mr. Brennan said.
Although General Ahmar has promised publicly on several occasions that he would leave Yemen after Mr. Saleh agreed to step down, he has so far failed to keep his word. The general's troops are still deployed in the northwestern section of the capital, although other government forces have been withdrawn over the past few months.

HEADLINE: The Airlines' Ground Game

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Having weathered the 2008 downturn in the global economy, many airlines have begun investing millions of dollars in upgrading their lounges, installing special armchairs and offering premium liquors, new food selections and, in the case of one carrier, free hairdressing services.
One impetus for the improvements, said Henry Harteveldt, co-founder of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel research company, is that most of the carriers based in the United States are now part of global airline alliances. 
''The airlines have to make sure their clubs are offering something close to what their partners are offering,'' Mr. Harteveldt said.
In addition, he said, the airlines have been looking over their shoulders and seeing new competitors. ''The Air France hub in Paris is no longer just competing with Lufthansa and British Airways,'' he said. ''It's competing against carriers in the gulf and Asia.''
Mr. Harteveldt called airport lounges ''one of the most important branding elements for an airline.'' He added: ''Even though some airlines have begun to improve their planes' passenger cabins, there's only so much they can do. They have much more flexibility in how they design their lounges.''
Peter Vlitas, senior vice president for airline sales and marketing for Protravel International, a travel management company based in New York, said the improvements were also an outgrowth of efforts to woo top-paying travelers.
''Airlines understand that in order to service high-yield, first- and business-class clients they need to offer a complete airport-to-airport experience, not only in the air but also on the ground,'' he said.
Since November, Cathay Pacific has refurbished a lounge in Frankfurt and opened its first lounge in the United States, in San Francisco. The lounge in San Francisco features a noodle bar and special chairs, with a leather seat, a table, power socket, coat hook and privacy screen, providing a convenient space to eat, work and relax.
Cathay Pacific has also renovated the business-class section of the Wing, its flagship lounge in Hong Kong, with an expanded noodle bar and a new coffee loft that serves specialty coffees and freshly baked pastries. The first-class section of the Wing will close soon for renovation; when it reopens late this year, it will feature new Champagne and cocktail bars.
Lufthansa recently introduced a new design for its lounges, after its research found ''the basic need for a comfortable seat is of outstanding importance'' to travelers, said Thomas Gesing, head of product management, lounge services, for the airline.
The airline has thus developed a new leather armchair for its refurbished Senator and business-class lounges in Dubai and Boston. Other new lounges will open this year and next in Delhi, Berlin, Frankfurt and Newark. The new design includes free wireless Internet access, an office, a bistro and a relaxation zone.
Qantas is opening new lounges in Singapore and Hong Kong at the end of this year. It is also almost tripling the size of its first- and business-class lounges in Los Angeles, with completion scheduled by 2014. As in the Australian airports, new lounges will feature decor by the Australian designer Marc Newson, who also designed the interior of Qantas's A380 aircraft, and menus developed by the chef Neil Perry, from Sydney.
Virgin Atlantic will open a new Clubhouse lounge at Kennedy International Airport in New York in March that will be twice the size of the airline's current lounge there and be located beyond security, unlike its predecessor. It will also offer free hairdressing services by Bumble and Bumble.
Last September, Virgin Atlantic opened the Grey Goose Loft, a bar on the upper level of its Heathrow Clubhouse in London that serves cocktails made from Grey Goose vodkas free of charge.
Similarly, Delta last October announced a luxury bar concept for its domestic Sky Clubs. The bars, which will ultimately be available at 24 clubs, sell Diageo premium wines and spirits, including Jose Cuervo tequila, Johnnie Walker blended scotches and Moet & Chandon Champagne, as well as special cocktails, like a Bloody Mary made with Ketel One vodka. Alcoholic beverages served elsewhere in all Delta lounges continue to be free.
Mr. Harteveldt said both Grey Goose and Diageo are probably subsidizing the special Virgin Atlantic and Delta bars, through sponsorship fees or in other ways, to get ''exposure to, and trial by, a very relevant audience.''
Since 2010, American Airlines has refurbished both its Admirals Club and Flagship Lounge at Heathrow and refurbished lounges in Boston and Tokyo and at Kennedy and Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington. It also opened a new lounge in San Francisco.
In addition, the airline has converted a lounge in Miami for use by its premium travelers and those of its fellow Oneworld alliance carriers British Airways and Iberia. It will refurbish an existing club and open a new club at La Guardia this year.
Peter Bates, a marketing communications consultant in Tarrytown, N.Y., travels over 200 days annually, he said, and has already visited some of the new lounges. ''None of us likes to travel all the time,'' he said. ''If you can get a little bit of refuge from a very busy airport and have a pleasant experience, then it starts to make travel bearable.''

HEADLINE: Catholic Gains In Health Care Include Strings

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
As Roman Catholic leaders and government officials clash over the proper role of religion and reproductive health, shifts in health care economics are magnifying the tension. Financially stronger Catholic-sponsored medical centers are increasingly joining with smaller secular hospitals, in some cases limiting access to treatments like contraception, abortion and sterilization.
In Seattle, Swedish Health Services has offered elective abortions for decades. But the hospital agreed to stop when it joined forces this month with Providence Health & Services, one of the nation's largest Catholic systems.
In late December, Gov. Steve Beshear of Kentucky turned down a bid by Catholic Health Initiatives, another large system, to merge with a public hospital in Louisville, in part because of concern that some women would have less access to contraceptive services. 
And in Rockford, Ill., there is resistance to a plan by OSF HealthCare, run by the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis, to buy a hospital because of new restrictions that would require women to go elsewhere if they wanted a tubal ligation after a Caesarean section.
About 20 such deals have been announced over the last three years, by one estimate, and experts expect more as stand-alone hospitals and smaller systems with no Catholic ties look to combine with larger and financially stronger institutions, in part because changes under the federal health care law are forcing all hospitals to become much more efficient.
There is already considerable tension between Catholic-run medical institutions and the Obama administration over insurance coverage for contraception for employees. The cultural divide over reproductive health is playing out on the campaign trail as candidates debate hot-button issues like abortion and contraception.
But while the growth of Catholic-run hospital networks is a testament to their long history and operational skill, local and state officials, doctors and advocates in many communities are concerned that some procedures that run counter to Catholic doctrine may no longer be available or will be much more limited. Some doctors fear they may not be able to do what's best for patients, forced to wait to treat a woman who is miscarrying, for example, or to send a rape victim elsewhere for an emergency contraceptive.
The restrictions at any given hospital may not be clear. ''Women simply don't know what they're getting,'' said Jill C. Morrison, senior counsel in health and reproductive rights at the National Women's Law Center.
The confusion is likely to increase.
''We are starting to see what was rare in the past,'' said Lisa Goldstein, who follows nonprofit hospitals for Moody's Investors Service and predicts more such partnerships. The institutions themselves are grappling with how to remain true to Catholic doctrine and serve a broader community. About one-sixth of all patients were admitted to a Catholic hospital in 2010. In many smaller communities, the only hospital within miles is Catholic.
''That is a constant challenge,'' said Sister Carol Keehan, president of the Catholic Health Association of the United States, which represents the nation's roughly 600 Catholic hospitals. ''It's a challenge we take very seriously.''
Being a Catholic hospital means adhering to the church's religious directives about care, Sister Carol said, but she says hospitals also see their mission much more broadly, including caring for those who are less fortunate and treating patients with respect.
At the Seton Healthcare Family in Texas, a unit of Ascension Health -- the nation's largest Catholic system and largest nonprofit system -- officials say partnerships with struggling community hospitals are integral to their mission. Seton's first partnership, in 1995, was to operate Brackenridge, a public hospital in Austin, because Seton was ''not doing enough to care for the poor and vulnerable in central Texas,'' said Charles J. Barnett, an Ascension executive.
In that case, Mr. Barnett says the system never agreed to provide services like elective abortions and sterilizations, and public officials and hospital administrators initially struggled to find a compromise. Although another system eventually offered sterilizations on a separate floor of the hospital, complete with a separate elevator, another hospital now provides those services.
One large system, Catholic Healthcare West in San Francisco, announced in January that it was severing its formal ties to the church to better work with hospitals that did not share its faith. The system, renamed Dignity Health, operates 25 Catholic hospitals, which will remain Catholic, and 15 non-Catholic hospitals. While none of Dignity's hospitals will provide elective abortions or offer in vitro fertilization, the non-Catholic hospitals will not have to adhere to the church's religious directives.
Dignity officials declined interview requests.
Even as Catholic Healthcare West, however, the system was not without controversy. One of its Catholic hospitals performed what it considered a life-saving abortion in 2009, but the local bishop in Phoenix disagreed, and the nun who allowed the procedure was excommunicated.
In many communities, like Rockford, the question is an intensely practical one: How will patients, particularly women, use services barred by the church? Because none of the city's three hospitals perform elective abortions, the debate has largely focused on whether a woman who has a C-section can have her tubes tied afterward.
''It would just be an inconvenience to the patient and the physician, who has to make life-and-death decisions,'' said Dr. Ronald Burmeister, a retired obstetrician in Rockford who is concerned about the merger.
The merger itself was prompted by the increasing need for hospitals to combine. Despite the federal government's concern about possible antitrust implications, many believe the city can support just two hospitals. ''Rockford needed a strategic partner,'' said Andrew K. Bachrodt, a managing director for Kurt Salmon Associates, which advises nonprofit hospitals. OSF already owns a Rockford hospital, OSF Saint Anthony Medical Center.
OSF says Rockford needs fewer hospitals and wants to expand its network to better serve the area. ''It's all about how to deliver care, coordinated and efficient care,'' said Robert C. Sehring, an executive at OSF.
OSF has already developed an arrangement in which affiliated doctors can prescribe birth control pills through a separate practice.
A woman who wanted a tubal ligation immediately after a C-section would be able to go to a competing hospital, if her insurance plan allowed. ''It's not like we're eliminating female sterilization procedures,'' said Kris L. Kieper, the chief executive of the YWCA in Rockford, who serves on an advisory committee for the OSF hospital there.
In Louisville, the debate focused on contraceptive services, like elective sterilizations, that had been provided by the University of Louisville Hospital, one member of a planned three-party merger that would have created a large statewide system. There was considerable uncertainty over whether University Hospital would be required to follow Catholic policies, according to a report by the Kentucky attorney general. Officials initially said the hospital would follow Catholic directives but then focused on certain procedures.
''While this evolving explanation may represent an accurate description of the proposed legal structure of the consolidation, it has cast a cloud of vagueness and skepticism over the issue in the public eye,'' the report concluded.
Asking women to go across town to another hospital for services is not a solution, said Dr. Peter Hasselbacher, a retired university official who follows health policy in Kentucky. And while women in Louisville generally have a choice of hospitals, women in rural communities may not, he said, adding that many of Catholic Health Initiative's Kentucky hospitals are the only hospital available.
Catholic Health says there was never a possibility that University Hospital would be allowed to perform services like elective sterilizations. ''Our position around the ethical and religious directives never changed. How we communicated that evolved and changed over time,'' said Paul Edgett, a senior vice president at the system.
Mr. Edgett says the system will consider future partnerships with non-Catholic hospitals, including University Hospital, as it seeks to position itself as a stronger system as health care evolves. ''We all have to adopt and adapt,'' he said. But, he added, ''we're not going to compromise our values in the process.''

HEADLINE: New Cardinal Outlines Four Goals for Archdiocese

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

 BODY:
ROME - After a week of indulging in Italian cooking, chatting with fellow new cardinals from around the world and sharing his elevation with crowds of visiting pilgrims, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said Monday that he was eager to return home and laid out four challenges to the archdiocese as among his priorities.
Cardinal Dolan spoke in an interview just before his formal audience with Pope Benedict XVI, the last ceremony of the week. Upon his return, he said, he first wanted the church to be more effective locally and nationally in its outreach to immigrants, particularly Latinos, who are no longer in Catholic schools in the numbers they once were. 
''The church has been the engine of welcoming people, caring for them and getting them settled as happy, productive citizens who are loyal citizens and loyal Catholics,'' he said. ''It bothers me that for the first time in American Catholic history, we may not be responding well to the needs of immigrant children in our Catholic schools.''
Second, he wants the archdiocese to renew its focus on charity, because with the state of the economy, the needs of the poor are great. ''A month ago, we had a food drive,'' he said, ''and we are already getting near out of food again.''
Third, he believes American bishops need to have a clearer and more effective pastoral message on heterosexual marriage, because so many Roman Catholics nationally are not marrying, and many are divorcing.
''We've got to be better heralds, trumpeters, about what beautiful, life-giving lifelong marriage is,'' he said.
And fourth, literally at his doorstep, the archdiocese needs to raise about $160 million to fix St. Patrick's Cathedral.
''This just isn't some face-lift,'' he said. ''We literally get two or three buckets of stones every day that have fallen. We are talking about safety, security, a new roof, leaks, those precious stain glass windows that are rattling.''
Nationally, Cardinal Dolan has been leading a charge by Catholic bishops against a White House mandate that would require some religious institutions, like Catholic hospitals, to provide health coverage for contraception.
It is a stance that has made him a hero to many of the hundreds of pilgrims who traveled with him in Rome, like Dennis J. Crilly, 69, from Somers, N.Y. ''Dolan is going to be a voice in the wilderness crying out on moral issues'' in the political sphere, he said. ''He knows the moral true north and is not afraid to say it.''
But Cardinal Dolan said he and his fellow American bishops did not plan to align themselves with any particular candidate or party in the coming election, and instead plan to wield influence by speaking out on issues important to the church, like abortion and marriage.
Even the most loyal Catholics, he said, ''cherish the fact that we are American and that our bishops do not interfere graphically in partisanship.'' And beyond that, he said, that kind of approach can backfire. ''We bishops are pretty realistic to know that sometimes one of the best things we can do for a candidate whom we may not particularly like is to dramatically support his or her opponent,'' he said.
During the last week, as he celebrated his elevation in the church with 21 other new cardinals, he said he had learned about the problems that Catholics face in repressive nations like China - revelations, he said, that make him more grateful than ever to be an American.
It was a week of personal joy for the cardinal. Not only did he receive his red hat from the pope, but his appointment also allowed him to honor some of those closest to him.
On Monday, Cardinal Dolan clutched the elbow of his mother, Shirley, 84, as they mounted the white marble steps of a hangar-size Vatican reception hall for a formal audience with the pope. On Sunday, two of his nieces, Shannon Williams, 21, who had survived cancer as a child, and Erin Stidley, 34, whom he chose because she is pregnant, walked down the aisle of St. Peter's to present the communion gifts.
But there were personal challenges, too, including to his effort to diet, which at banquets and lunches was in little evidence here.
His new cardinal's ring is so tight that when reporters asked to take a closer look on Sunday, he could not remove it to show the inscription inside.
With the start of Lent on Wednesday, he said, ''it will be no more pasta; it's going to be a lot of celery sticks, celery sticks without any salt.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Ireland Makes Pitch To Official From China

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS DALBY

 BODY:
DUBLIN -- Ireland has positioned itself to become China's springboard into Europe, Irish government officials said on Monday at the conclusion of a three-day official visit by Xi Jinping, the vice president of China, who is expected to succeed Hu Jintao as its paramount leader next year. 
Mr. Xi came to Ireland, the only European Union country he will visit on his world tour, accompanied by a delegation of 150 business executives. The Irish government is hoping that Chinese companies will follow the lead of many American multinationals, like Pfizer, Google and Facebook, that have based their European headquarters in Ireland.
''We had very fruitful discussions in our meeting, and we also concluded a number of important memoranda of understanding between Ireland and China in the areas of investment, education and business,'' Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland said on Monday. Mr. Kenny said he accepted an invitation from Mr. Xi to visit China next month.
Ireland is hungry for all the investment it can attract. Its economy was battered first by the financial crisis, and then by deep cuts in public spending as the country struggled to honor the terms of an international bailout. Unemployment is running at 14 percent and record numbers of people are emigrating in search of work.
In the past, Irish officials looked mainly to the United States, Britain and the Continent for prospective investors, but they now find that they must focus more on emerging markets.
Ireland's pitch to China was its usual combination of low corporate tax rates, a well-educated work force of English speakers and ready access to the European Union's market of 500 million people. The country's technological skill, particularly in agribusiness and education, was also emphasized.
During Mr. Xi's three-day tour of Ireland, which included events ranging from a tour of a small farm on the Atlantic seaboard to a lavish performance of the ''Riverdance'' stage show in Dublin, Mr. Xi said that China offered ''tremendous business opportunities'' for Irish companies.
''High-tech and emerging industries can become a priority in China-Ireland economic cooperation and trade,'' Mr. Xi said at a forum on investment and trade in Dublin, speaking through an interpreter and adding that ''business leaders of our two countries need to seize opportunities to expand'' such cooperation ''for mutual benefit.''
Mr. Xi's visit was met with some protests over human rights abuses in China, but the numbers of demonstrators were small, and government officials said they had raised human rights issues with their Chinese visitors only ''in a general way.''
Unlike the vast majority of foreign dignitaries who visit Ireland, Mr. Xi granted no interviews during his stay.

HEADLINE: Gay Marriage Halo Effect

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
On Thursday, Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York, announced tough new teacher evaluation standards. Rupert Murdoch's New York Post was so pleased that it put the news on its front page, with the headline, ''Gov's Class Act.'' Liberal supporters of the teachers' union, so far as I could tell, basically said nothing.
That same day, in neighboring New Jersey, the State Assembly passed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage -- something that Cuomo had fiercely championed in New York last year, and the passage of which brought him great acclaim from liberal and gay rights groups. In New Jersey, however, the reaction of the governor to the passage of the bill was altogether different: Chris Christie, the tough-talking conservative -- who has been pummeling unions since he took office -- vowed to veto the marriage bill. Which he did, the very next day. 
Christie's veto was widely seen as a political maneuver: ''Frankly, I don't think Chris Christie has an antigay bone in his body,'' Steven Goldstein, the chairman of Garden State Equity, told The Times's Kate Zernike. Christie's boisterous anti-union rhetoric and extreme budget-cutting, among other things, gave rise to a Christie boomlet in the early stages of this presidential campaign season. Though Christie decided not to run, he will almost certainly be a leading contender if he runs in 2016. Hence his supposed need to stay on the right side of the social conservatives who oppose same-sex marriage. (Christie says he wants the voters to decide whether homosexuals should marry.)
Yet if Christie's presumed motivation for opposing same-sex marriage was political, why doesn't anyone ever seem to mention the political benefits reaped by Cuomo in New York for supporting it? I am not suggesting that his belief in the rights of gays and lesbians to marry isn't genuine. But surely, there was a political calculus as well. In effect, it has given him a pass among Democratic Party liberals, even as many of his policies have been downright Chris Christie-like.
Even before taking office, for instance, Cuomo gave an interview to Nick Confessore of The Times laying out his strategy for countering ''the well-financed labor unions he believes have bullied previous governors and lawmakers into making bad decisions.'' He proposed cutting billions from Medicaid, and instituting medical malpractice reform, which would limit what patients could get in malpractice cases. His first budget squeezed savings from schools, health care and social services. He initially opposed extending a so-called millionaires' tax (though, eventually, he grudgingly conceded). He has called for tuition increases at the State University System, and for limiting retirement benefits for new city and state workers. He has pushed through the Legislature a 2 percent cap on property tax increases -- the exact same amount as Chris Christie's property tax cap in New Jersey. Just the other day, The Times published an article about how Cuomo is attempting to consolidate power -- just as Christie is accused of doing in New Jersey.
Without question, Cuomo has done all this with a finesse that the blunt-spoken Christie lacks; that's one reason liberals haven't been up in arms even as he has chipped away at many of their sacred cows. ''I am a progressive Democrat who's broke,'' he told Confessore in another interview, suggesting that he was simply doing the tough things that had to be done, given the difficult economy, and the budget shortfalls he faced.
But his role in the same-sex marriage fight has also been a huge factor. The fight took place soon after that first budget was passed, and it overshadowed everything that had come before. Cuomo had promised to support same-sex marriage when he was running for governor, and, after it passed, he was lionized. It also took place after a string of same-sex marriage defeats in other states, which heightened the importance of its passage in New York. In retrospect, Cuomo helped turn the tide. That's also why, even now, months later, his halo has lost little of its luster.
There is one other point worth mentioning about the political calculus of both Cuomo and Christie. It is becoming increasingly evident that on the issue of same-sex marriage, the New York governor is on the right side of history, and the New Jersey governor is on the wrong side. Since Cuomo signed New York's marriage bill, Washington State has approved a same-sex marriage law and Maryland could approve one this week. Other State Legislatures have bills in the works. Most conservatives under the age of 30 view same-sex marriage as a nonissue.
Suddenly, four years seems like a very long time. By 2016, it is not inconceivable that same-sex marriage will be a widely accepted part of American life. In which case, Cuomo will have gained another political advantage by supporting it when he did. And Christie's veto, meanwhile, may not look so politically astute after all.

HEADLINE: Romney Goes After Santorum on Budget, in a Battle He Didn't Bargain For

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG; Trip Gabriel contributed reporting from Steubenville, Ohio.

 BODY:
CINCINNATI -- Mitt Romney was barely six minutes into a campaign speech here on Monday afternoon, dwelling on the success story of a local bioscience company, when he broached a topic that is suddenly confounding his Republican presidential aspirations: Rick Santorum.
''Senator Santorum goes to Washington and calls himself a budget hawk, and after he's been there a while, he says he's no longer a budget hawk,'' Mr. Romney said, his voice rising for emphasis as he looked out at the row of cameras before him. ''Well, I am a budget hawk.''
As Mr. Santorum was greeted by a large and enthusiastic crowd four hours away in Ohio's coal country, he made no mention of his rival at all, a clear sign that the tables have turned -- for now, at least -- in the Republican nominating contest, leaving Mr. Romney scrambling to regain his command over the race.
While Mr. Romney may not know for weeks or even months whether he will win the nomination, his performance over the next seven days will most likely provide a telling signal about whether he can persuade the party at last to embrace his candidacy. 
After a stretch in which Mr. Santorum's focus on appealing to conservatives through social issues has dominated the campaign, Mr. Romney has two high-profile opportunities this week to steer the conversation back to the economy and defeating President Obama: a debate on Wednesday in Arizona followed by a speech on Friday in Michigan that his campaign is billing as a major policy address. Both states will hold their primaries next Tuesday.
There are few outward signs that panic has set in at the Romney campaign -- the delegate-by-delegate chess game has only begun -- but concern is palpable among Mr. Romney, his allies and Republican Party elders, many of whom are increasingly fretting aloud about the prospect that he may not be as electable as he seemed only weeks ago.
''It's way too premature to be talking about something like that,'' said Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a top supporter of Mr. Romney, when asked about the growing worries from some of his colleagues about the need to prepare for a backup Republican candidate. ''He knew that this was going to be a long haul. He's been through it before.''
But Mr. Romney has not been through this moment before, so far from persuading conservative activists that he has the strongest potential as a nominee to appeal to independent voters and defeat Mr. Obama.
''I wish this was over,'' Alex Triantafilou, the Republican Party chairman in Cincinnati, said in an interview Monday, adding that he was not taking sides but eager to avoid a protracted fight. ''I'd rather air our attacks at the president.''
The Romney campaign has shed much of the bravado that was often on display last year when it focused on Mr. Obama and all but ignored its Republican rivals. (During a Chicago visit in May, aides to Mr. Romney sent leftover pizza to the Obama re-election office, just to make the campaign aware that they were on the president's home turf.)
Mr. Romney had hoped to resume his confident posture against Mr. Obama with a Chicago speech on March 20, the day of the Illinois primary. But those plans are on hold, given that talk of the general election is all but forbidden now, and that Mr. Romney could still be battling Mr. Santorum.
For the next seven days, the campaign is intensely focused on Michigan, which has emerged as a pivotal state for Mr. Romney, whose candidacy would be devastated by a loss in his boyhood home. The campaign and a supportive ''super PAC,'' Restore Our Future, have been relentlessly attacking Mr. Santorum in television advertisements that paint him as a Washington insider and serial user of earmarks.
But Mr. Romney's aides have also heightened their focus on Super Tuesday on March 6 and beyond. Acutely aware that Ohio could prove just as important as Michigan, the campaign has dispatched its Florida state director, Molly Donlin, here to Ohio to oversee the operation.
''A win in Michigan will definitely help in Ohio, but there will still need to be an Ohio campaign,'' said Curt Steiner, a Republican strategist in Ohio who is supportive of Mr. Romney. But, he said, a loss in Michigan will necessitate a major effort: ''It will signal to Romney supporters in Ohio that Ohio better be a firewall -- or else.''
The campaign had something of a setback last week when a top Ohio official who had endorsed Mr. Romney in October, Attorney General Mike DeWine -- a former two-term United States senator -- switched his allegiance to Mr. Santorum. While Mr. Romney's campaign shrugged that off in public, questioning how much support Mr. DeWine would bring with him, a top Ohio Republican said that behind the scenes, top donors and supporters were trying to keep others from following suit to quell an ''uprising.''
While it once operated under the hope that it would have the race effectively won after Super Tuesday, the Romney campaign is also laying groundwork in states that will vote on March 13. The campaign dedicated a press release from Boston on Monday to trumpet new support from the Mississippi secretary of state, Delbert Hosemann.
Restore Our Future is advertising against Mr. Santorum in Mississippi and Alabama, as well as in the Super Tuesday states of Tennessee and Oklahoma.
But although campaign spending and tactics have repeatedly helped Mr. Romney put down insurgent threats this year -- and could do so again in Michigan -- several supporters said in interviews that the campaign machine had for the most part done what it could, and that closing the deal with Republican voters rested squarely with Mr. Romney, starting with the debate on Wednesday evening in Arizona.
Mr. Romney's supporters acknowledged that he had been slow to recover from the triple losses to Mr. Santorum in Minnesota, Missouri and Colorado. And complicating matters, Mr. Romney was forced to play on the less comfortable political turf of social issues immediately afterward.
First he was confronted by the Obama administration's abandoned attempt to force religious organizations to provide coverage for birth control, which necessitated a response from all Republican candidates. The same week, he and his rivals attended the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, where he asserted his ideological bona fides by declaring he was a ''severely conservative'' governor in Massachusetts, which drew criticism from movement stalwarts for both its veracity and its phrasing.
After gathering in their Boston headquarters to strategize for a dramatically changed landscape -- with some supporters worrying they were in a ''bunker mentality'' -- Mr. Romney's campaign aides exuded more confidence on Monday. They were especially buoyed by a sense that advertising and other factors seemed to be slowing Mr. Santorum's momentum in Michigan.
But as Mr. Romney held one public campaign event on Monday, Mr. Santorum raced through four stops in Ohio and Michigan. He is hoping that a grass-roots appeal can counter the muscle of Mr. Romney's organization.
''Ohio is going to make a huge difference,'' Mr. Santorum said, speaking to yet another large crowd in Steubenville. ''You have the opportunity here to stand up and shout loudly across this country that you want a true conservative.''

HEADLINE: Europe's Stocks Rose Ahead of Deal on Greek Debt

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
European shares closed near a seven-month high on Monday as finance ministers in the euro zone edged closer to a long-awaited agreement on a rescue package for Greece.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares rose 0.7 percent, to 1,090.95 points. Volume was low, at 69.5 percent of the 90-day average, with Wall Street closed for Presidents' Day.
''We have had quite a good run year-to-date and a lot of it is premised on Greece getting its bailout,'' said Michael McNaught-Davis, head of international equities at Scottish Widows, a money management firm. ''There may be another day of euphoria, but then we will get back to normal and could sell off a bit.'' 
On Monday, finance ministers inched toward approving a second bailout for debt-laden Greece that would resolve the Greek government's immediate repayment needs. The agreement was nearly complete early Tuesday in Europe.
On Monday, stocks rose almost across the board. Banks, many of which have significant exposure to Greece and other peripheral euro zone countries and have taken a hit on their balance sheets, were among the biggest gainers.
Euro zone bank stocks rose 2 percent, and are up 18 percent in 2012. The sector has benefited from more confidence that the euro zone debt crisis is being contained and from the European Central Bank's long-term refinancing operation, providing cheap financing.
''While there remains broad skepticism that this bailout will effectively draw a line under the long running Greek debt saga, it would appear that markets believe that for now, an imminent messy default scenario could well be averted,'' said Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets.
Mining stocks gained after China, a top metals user, cut the amount banks must hold in reserve, which should allow more lending to improve its economy. China's central bank effectively made available an estimated $55.6 billion to $63.5 billion in additional cash for lending, which could raise demand for metals.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Basic Resources Index rose 1.6 percent, taking its gain in 2012 to 16 percent.
Signs of economic recovery, notably in the United States, have helped increase the appetite for risk, and defensive sectors have underperformed, with the health care index up just 0.4 percent in 2012.
The FTSEurofirst 300 pan-European index is up 8.9 percent in 2012, leaving it ripe for a pullback.
''The markets are looking short-term overbought, and I expect some consolidation could occur,'' said Bob Parker, senior adviser at Credit Suisse. ''In the near term, I expect very choppy trade.''
Mergers and acquisitions continued to help markets.
The Norwegian group Petroleum Geo-Services rose 9.2 percent after posting surprisingly strong fourth-quarter results and saying seismic prices would rise in 2012.
The German DAX rose 1.46 percent, to 6,948.25, after JPMorgan said in a note that it was its preferred European national index because of its exposure to emerging markets.
''It remains attractively priced, at 1.4 times price-to-book, offering 10 percent upside to last year's peak levels and 35 percent to the 20-year median,'' JPMorgan analysts said.
The DAX outperformed the FTSE 100 in London, which was up 0.68 percent on Monday, and the CAC 40 in Paris, which rose 0.96 percent.

HEADLINE: Marketing Budgets Rise for Some Giants

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
For the last couple of months, forecasters have been predicting that 2012 would be a better year for Madison Avenue and media companies as more marketers increased advertising budgets. That outlook is starting to brighten further as some of the biggest spenders reveal plans to open their wallets even wider than had been expected.
Of course, those plans could change suddenly if the economic recovery reversed course or a crisis abroad rattled consumer confidence. And not every giant marketer is buoyantly optimistic. 
For instance, Paul Bulcke, chief executive at Nestle, said last week that he did not expect 2012 ''to be any easier'' than 2011, which he called ''a challenging year.'' Also, purveyors of pantry staples like General Mills and J. M. Smucker have reduced their earnings forecasts for 2012.
Still, the skies seem to be sunnier as marketers including Coca-Cola, Kraft Foods, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever step up spending or product introductions or both.
''We've got a real exciting year ahead of us,'' Keith Weed, chief marketing and communications officer at Unilever in London, said in an interview last week during a visit to New York.
Despite the challenging economy, he added, ''we're interested in stimulating consumer demand.''
Unilever ''will be investing more in media'' spending, Mr. Weed said, declining to be specific; the company spends more than $6.6 billion a year on advertising. The mix will include more ads in digital and social media as those media continue to gain favor with consumers, he added, because ''we fish where the fish are.'' Unilever is buying ad space from companies like Apple and Facebook.
Unilever was heartened, Mr. Weed said, by the response last year of American consumers to the introduction of a brand of ice cream bars, Magnum, that the company sells in markets like Asia, Europe and the Middle East.
''The launch was a tremendous success,'' he said, adding that ''I think you'll see more'' new products from Unilever that could be categorized as ''indulgent and fun'' or ''simple pleasures,'' in categories like food, personal care and teas.
One new product that Unilever has begun to introduce in the United States is a brand named Simple, a skin-care line that is already sold in countries like Australia and Britain. A campaign now under way promotes Simple products as ''sensitive skin experts.''
Procter & Gamble, a principal competitor of Unilever's, started last week what it described as the ''intrigue phase,'' or teasers, for its introduction of Tide Pods, a one-step laundry tablet that will be promoted with a marketing budget estimated at $150 million for the first year. The ''reveal phase'' is to begin on Sunday, with a commercial for Tide Pods during the ABC broadcast of the 84th Academy Awards.
Reckitt Benckiser, which competes with Procter and Unilever, said it would increase worldwide ad spending this year by $:100 million, or almost $160 million. Reckitt Benckiser sells household product brands like Air Wick, Calgon, Finish, French's, Veet and Woolite.
The bump in the Reckitt Benckiser ad budget, hefty as it may be, pales in comparison to those announced by the Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo.
PepsiCo said it would raise ad spending in 2012 for brands like Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola and Tropicana by $500 million to $600 million, with up to an additional $100 million to be spent in retail realms like store display racks. The goal is ''to turn around market share declines,'' Dara Mohsenian, an analyst for Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note.
And Coca-Cola said it would reduce business costs $550 million to $650 million by the end of 2015 and reinvest the money in areas like marketing and building brands.
Those intentions by major marketers are, needless to say, putting happy faces on executives at leading media companies.
''As we sit here today nearly seven weeks into the new year, I am truly excited about what we are seeing,'' Leslie Moonves, chief executive at the CBS Corporation, said in a conference call on Wednesday as he discussed the company's financial results.
''The first quarter alone is looking to be extremely strong,'' he added, and ''I am confident this will be an even better year than the last.''
Jon Steinlauf, executive vice president for ad sales and marketing at Scripps Networks Interactive, which owns cable channels like Food Network, HGTV and Travel Channel, said he believed ''the television business is incredibly healthy.''
''Companies are now making a greater investment to add market share in their categories,'' Mr. Steinlauf said last week in an interview at a programming presentation by Travel Channel, ''and most advertisers are saying to themselves that television is still the primary medium to move product.''
The growth in ad spending is ''a trend we started seeing about a year ago, when the economy started coming out of its deep recession,'' Mr. Steinlauf said, and ''I don't think there's any turning back.''

HEADLINE: Greece Opts to Open the Bailout Box

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Greece and its European partners finally reached agreement on a new bailout package after marathon talks in Brussels. But, as politicians await the reaction of the Greek public, there are no illusions that the deal alone will resolve the country's economic malaise. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The grueling talks that finally produced a bailout agreement for Greece in the early hours of Tuesday morning seem to have been about as much fun as watching an all-night session of Deal or No Deal.
Greece's version of the popular television quiz show is simply called Deal, which might indicate that there is something in the Greek psyche that is always open to reaching a compromise, despite the evidence in recent weeks of nerve-jangling brinkmanship on the part of the country's negotiators.
My colleague Stephen Castle explains the numbers and concludes that the agreement could be a new turning point in the European debt crisis, which has raised questions about the viability of the euro itself. 
The agreement among European finance ministers on extending the new (EURO)130 billion lifeline to Greece heads off the prospect of a Greek default next month. But officials are not claiming that it will resolve either the country's or the Continent's chronic debt problems at a stroke. 
The marathon negotiations highlight the argument that Europe's problems are linked to lackluster growth, which some economists say is being exacerbated by the very austerity measures being imposed to confront the debt crisis.
As Paul Krugman wrote on his blog this weekend: "Watching Europe sink into recession - and Greece plunge into the abyss - I found myself wondering what it would take to convince the chattering classes that austerity in the face of an already depressed economy is a terrible idea."
European leaders are aware that they cannot ignore the pro-growth argument. In a joint letter to Herman Van Rompuy, the European Union president, 12 leaders of the 27-member bloc on Monday called for growth and increased trade to be high on the agenda of a European summit scheduled for next week.
The signatories, predominantly free-market conservatives who included David Cameron, the British prime minister, called for a new focus on trade with the United States, Russia and China.
"We need to inject political momentum into deepening economic integration with the U.S., examining all options including that of a free trade agreement," wrote the 12, who also included leaders of Italy, Spain and Poland.
Notable absentees among the co-signers were the leaders of France and Germany, who have put their own vision for Europe's economic revival to Mr. Van Rompuy, focusing on tighter budget oversight and the establishment of a permanent rescue mechanism.
Germany has been singled out as a target of anger among Greeks who see themselves as increasingly impoverished by the austerity measures imposed on them by the Union.
European leaders may be breathing a sigh of relief after successfully wrapping up the bailout deal in Brussels. But the Greek Street has yet to deliver its verdict.

HIGHLIGHT: The problem with claiming that liberal abortion laws always lead to lower abortion rates. 

 BODY:
As a follow-up to Sunday's column on abortion and contraception, I should say something about the indefatigable Will Saletan's most recent attempt to make his recurring "pro-life case for Planned Parenthood." In the piece, written in the wake of the Komen controversy, Saletan cited a recent study from the Guttmacher Institute looking at trends in abortion worldwide, which included the following analysis:
We found that the proportion of women living under liberal abortion laws is inversely associated with the abortion rate in the subregions of the world. Other studies have found that abortion incidence is inversely associated with the level of contraceptive use, especially where fertility rates are holding steady, and there is a positive correlation between unmet need for contraception and abortion levels.
Here's Saletan on what these findings mean for public policy:
In other words, if you outlaw abortion and limit contraception, you get more abortions, because more women who don't want to have babies get pregnant. And when women who don't want to have babies get pregnant, they find ways to get abortions, whether you like it or not. The way to get fewer abortions is to provide contraception-and to teach people to use it diligently, which is a moral project, not just a technical one. That way, fewer women who don't want to have babies get pregnant. And the abortion rate goes down.
But the Guttmacher report in question never compares like to like. Instead of looking at otherwise-similar countries that have variations in abortion law, the study compares rich (like Western Europe and North America) to poorer (like Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa). This makes it extremely difficult to tell whether the trend toward lower abortion rates in Western democracies really reflects the success of "safe, legal and rare," as Saletan would have it, or whether it's mainly a consequence of the enormous gap in wealth and development that still separates the West from the rest. (Many social ills tend to diminish with economic growth, and many pro-lifers would agree that a general increase in prosperity and human flourishing can do as much to reduce the abortion rate as any law or custom.) America is not analogous to Chad or Vietnam, to put mildly, and if what we care about is reducing the American abortion rate, surely it makes more sense to look at the consequences of abortion restrictions in developed countries that already have widespread contraceptive access, rather than just comparing the developed world to developing countries and leaving it at that.
This is why I keepemphasizing the difference in abortion rates between conservative regions and liberal regions within the United States itself. (If Planned Parenthood were the pro-life movement's best friend, then one would expect Massachusetts to have a lower abortion rate than Mississippi, rather than the other way around.) But it isn't just America: In Western Europe, where there's a great deal of variation in terms of gestational limits and the mix of counseling and waiting periods required of women seeking abortions, the supposedly inevitable correlation between liberal abortion laws and lower abortion rates doesn't necessarily show up. Yes, liberals can justly claim the permissive Netherlands, with some of the most lowest abortion rates on the continent, as a "safe, legal and rare" success story. But in general Catholic and Catholic-influenced countries like France, Italy, Spain and Germany tend to have somewhat more restrictions on abortion and somewhat lower abortion rates than, say, the Scandinavian nations and Great Britain. (See p. 14 in this Planned Parenthood presentation for a turn-of-the-millenium comparison.) And then there's the case of Ireland, which still has the most restrictive abortion laws of any Western European nation. If you calculate the Irish abortion rate based on the number of Irish women who obtain abortions in the United Kingdom, it would be about one fourth of the English abortion rate. Presumably illegal abortions raise that figure somewhat, but there's no evidence that Ireland is a hellhole of back-alley procedures: Indeed, the Irish have some of the lowest maternal mortality rates in the entire world.
Obviously there are a wide variety of variables influencing all of these statistics, and correlation isn't causation when it seems to serves the pro-life argument anymore than when it seems to serve the pro-choice side. But at the very least, for countries like the one we live in - developed, rich, stable, post-feminist and post-demographic transition - the commonplace claim that abortion restrictions don't reduce (and may even increase) abortion rates looks shaky rather than dispositive.

HEADLINE: Baltimore Grand Prix, on the Cusp of a Second Chance

BYLINE: ROY FURCHGOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Plagued by lawsuits and divisive management in its inaugural year, the race weekend is expected to receive a new management team this week, led by a veteran IndyCar promoter. 

 BODY:
BALTIMORE -- Two months after lawsuits for unpaid fees threatened the existence of the event, officials are close to confirming a new promoter for the Baltimore Grand Prix, which had its inaugural running over Labor Day weekend last year.
The city's Board of Estimates recently held a preliminary review of a five-year contract with a new promoter, Downforce Racing, led by Dale Dillon, a veteran promoter and organizer of races in the IndyCar series. He is joined by Felix Dawson and Dan Reck of Wilkes Lane Capital, a financial advisory firm specializing in the energy sector, according to a media release issued by the city. The Board of Estimates is scheduled to receive the final contract, which it is expected to approve, on Wednesday.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Dillon, an Indianapolis-based construction executive who previously managed operations for IndyCar events in Toronto and St. Petersburg, Fla., described the 2011 Baltimore Grand Prix as a successful event that suffered from inefficient management.
"It doesn't take a staff of 40 to do this," he said of managing a race weekend. The previous promoters, Baltimore Racing Development, mismanaged their financial resources, he added. "They spent a lot on consultants that didn't do them a whole lot of favors."
Based on what he described as "amazing" ticket sales from last year's event, Mr. Dillon said subsequent grand prix weekends should be moneymakers.
The financial troubles of the inaugural grand prix began well before the drop of the starter's flag. Baltimore Racing Development was the subject of lawsuits for nonpayment of obligations. Debts continued to mount, prompting the city to cancel its five-year agreement with B.R.D. in December. Estimates of unpaid fees have reached as high as $12 million, with more than $4 million owed to the city.
The city considered four groups to take over the contract, but in a written statement, the city said that none of the groups competing with Downforce Racing, Mr. Dillon's group, "demonstrated the ability to secure an IndyCar Sanction Agreement required for the race and/or the experience to put on an IndyCar street race."
IndyCar has remained neutral on the individual qualifications of the candidates under consideration. "We never saw the proposals and we don't know who any of those groups are," Sarah Davis, the senior director for business affairs at IndyCar, said in an interview. "But we are fully supportive of the city's decision and process," she added.
Mr. Dillon had the luxury of being a known entity during the bidding process. He acted as general manager of the 2011 grand prix in the three weeks preceding the event.
The contract submitted to the Board of Estimates included features aimed at preventing a replay of last year's financial turmoil. The city will collect a percentage of ticket sales, which will be held by a city-appointed trustee and paid out only by written approval of the city. Baltimore will also collect a 10-percent admissions and amusement tax, as well as a $3.50 event fee at the point of ticket sale. There is a similar agreement with the state of Maryland. "When the ticket agency collects the funds, it gets deposited into three accounts," Mr. Dillon said. "We have no access to the city and state escrow."
Downforce Racing will not be held responsible for debts owed by B.R.D., according to the city. "The state is going after them for the admissions taxes, on the city's behalf," Ryan O'Doherty a city spokesman, said of B.R.D. in an interview. "The city is considering further legal action on the rest," he added.
Ultimately, the city wants race fans to return to its Inner Harbor area, where an estimated 75,000 spectators crowded in to watch Will Power win the first IndyCar race to be contested on the city's surface streets. "It is in the best interest of the local economy and we put new safeguards in place to protect the taxpayers going forward with a new team," Mr. O'Doherty said.

HEADLINE: He Took the Code, but Was It a Federal Crime?

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: The reversal of the conviction of Sergey Aleynikov, a computer programmer accused of stealing trade secrets from Goldman Sachs, highlights how difficult it can be to figure out what is - and is not - a federal offense. 

 BODY:
In white-collar crime, the line between questionable business practices and criminal conduct can be quite thin, often dependent on technical distinctions in statutes. The reversal of the conviction of Sergey Aleynikov, a computer programmer accused of stealing trade secrets from Goldman Sachs, highlights how difficult it can be to figure out what is - and is not - a federal offense.
Mr. Aleynikov was charged with taking source code used in Goldman's high-frequency trading system, a valuable tool that allowed the firm to execute within nanoseconds high-volume computer-driven trades of securities and commodities. He took the code after agreeing to work for a rival firm that planned to set up its own trading system and admitted that he violated Goldman's confidentiality policy. 
The indictment alleged violations of two federal laws: the Economic Espionage Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property provision. In a rare step, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the conviction immediately after the oral argument of his appeal and ordered the Federal District Court to process Mr. Aleynikov's release from prison. 
The case involved figuring out what comes within the statutory prohibition of theft of trade secrets and interstate transportation of stolen property. Mr. Aleynikov argued that all he took was source code that was used in parts of Goldman's trading system but not the entire program, which was highly confidential and never disclosed by the firm. Prosecutors claimed that the code was an important component for building the system, and its use in developing competing programs would diminish the value of Goldman's trading operation.
The Second Circuit did not announce the reason for overturning Mr. Aleynikov's convictions, issuing only a terse order stating that an opinion would be issued "in due course." In Mr. Aleynikov's brief and at the oral argument, the focus was on whether the computer code came within the two statutes. By reversing both convictions, the appeals court appears to have adopted a narrow approach to whether computer source code has been stolen when it was only downloaded for use by a competitor.
Congress enacted the Economic Espionage Act in 1996, and while one part of the law prohibits stealing trade secrets for foreign governments, the more commonly used provision is 18 U.S.C.  1832, which covers any theft of business trade secrets for personal gain. The statute is complex, even compared to other federal provisions, reaching any person who knowingly acts "with intent to convert a trade secret, that is related to or included in a product that is produced for or placed in interstate or foreign commerce, to the economic benefit of anyone other than the owner thereof, and intending or knowing that the offense will, injure any owner of that trade secret" through theft.
The key to Mr. Aleynikov's case is whether the code is a "product that is produced" under the Economic Espionage Act. As an open source code it was not for sale, but it was used by Goldman as part of its trading system that dealt in securities and commodities. The issue was whether part of a computer program was itself a "product" connected to interstate commerce, the basis for federal jurisdiction.
Mr. Aleynikov argued in essence that the code was only one part of a larger system, so downloading it for future use when he started working a the new firm on its own system did not come within the Economic Espionage Act , even if it could have been prosecuted as a theft under state law.
The Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property provision of the law, 18 U.S.C.  2314, has much deeper roots than the Economic Espionage Act, passed by Congress in 1934 at the urging of J. Edgar Hoover and the Justice Department to help federal agents combat organized crime rings that specialized in stealing securities and other valuables that were fenced in other states.
The statute covers any person who "transports, transmits, or transfers in interstate or foreign commerce any goods, wares, merchandise, securities or money, of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud."
The Supreme Court has not reviewed any prosecutions under the Economic Espionage Act, but in Dowling v. United States it took a narrower view of what constitutes "good, wares, [or] merchandise." The decision reversed a conviction for interstate transportation of bootleg records secretly made from Elvis Presley concert tapes because the recordings themselves were not transported, only the records made from them. According to the high court, "the provision seems clearly to contemplate a physical identity between the items unlawfully obtained and those eventually transported, and hence some prior physical taking of the subject goods."
Similarly, Mr. Aleynikov claimed that the source code was not "goods, wares, [or] merchandise" to constitute a violation of the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property provision because he took only intangible property that was not worth anything until it was later incorporated into a high-speed trading system. While Goldman might have been harmed by a competitor's system, it did not suffer the loss of its own trading platform fromMr. Aleynikov's downloading of the source code.
Both the Economic Espionage Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property provision use terms like "product" and "goods" that fit best with thefts of tangible items. The statutes can be applied to intangibles like a computer program because it is something that can be put into immediate operation, like a car, and its value is intrinsic.
Source code falls into a gray area, however, because it may not have any independent value until it is incorporated in a much larger system that must be designed and implemented. While the code is a starting point, it may be more like a recording of Mr. Presley that was misused but not stolen.
Prosecutors often find themselves in a difficult position when new technologies and business processes have to be fit into older statutes that might contain gaps in their coverage. The classic type of trade secret theft is taking the plans for a new product or blueprints for a machine, while downloading source code that can make designing a competing computer program does not fit that simpler form of the offense. Laws sometimes have to be contorted to cover areas that are on the edge of legality, but courts are often reticent about contorting the meaning of the statutory language to reach new areas.
Congress could fix the problem by rewriting the Economic Espionage Act to cover a wider range of trade secrets, but that creates the danger that knowledge about customers or internal sales strategies could become the basis for prosecuting a former employee who uses that information in a new job. It is not clear that the federal government should criminalize private disputes between employers and employees, or turn everything confidential in a business into a trade secret.
Mr. Aleynikov's case may well end up in the Supreme Court because the issue of trade secret protection is one of growing importance as the Justice Department focuses more on white-collar crimes involving businesses. The court could takea narrow approach to the Economic Espionage Act like it did with the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property provision in Dowling, which means Congress would have to consider whether there is a gap in the law it needs to address.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo to Buy Energy Loan Unit From BNP Paribas

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The North American energy loan business of BNP Paribas holds about $9.5 billion worth of financing commitments, with about $3.9 billion that has actually been lent out. 

 BODY:
Wells Fargo agreed on Tuesday to buy the North American energy loan business of the French bank BNP Paribas, helping to bolster its capital reserves.
Under the terms of the agreement, Wells Fargo will pick up BNP's North American business, concentrated largely in the United States. Based in Houston, the unit currently holds about $9.5 billion worth of financing commitments, with about $3.9 billion that has actually been lent out.
Terms of the deal, including the price paid by Wells Fargo, were not disclosed.
The sale is aimed at shoring up the financial strength of BNP Paribas as Europe's banks continue to be tested by new capital rules and the battering of the Continent's debt crisis. Such institutions have been looking to shed their lending commitments, in particular.
BNP has already laid off 1,400 employees as part of its goal to sell off $92 billion in risk-weighted assets by the end of the year.
Despite the size of the North American energy business, the deal will increase BNP's Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of a bank's ability to weather financial shocks, by only 0.05 percent. 
"Though it was a difficult decision, we are pleased to have secured a premium on the sale of the business," Everett Schenk, the head of BNP's North American operations, said in a statement. 
The transaction, meanwhile, will allow Wells Fargo to continue growing as rivals retrench. The firm, which emerged from the financial crisis as one of the country's stronger banks, reported a 20 percent gain in quarterly profit last month. That has helped underpin an expansion effort that includes buying a number of businesses that extend Wells Fargo's corporate lending reach.
"The acquisition of this established and well-managed business is a unique opportunity for Wells Fargo to continue to grow its industry-leading energy banking business," Mike Johnson, the head of Wells Fargo's corporate banking group, said in a statement.
BNP Paribas was advised by Lazard and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.

HEADLINE: Under Volcker, Old Dividing Line in Banks May Return

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: The Volcker Rule may create a divided world where the old investment banks are challenged by upstarts that are not limited by the rule. 

 BODY:
The Volcker Rule, and its limitations on bank trading, may have the unintended effect of dividing the world back into investment banks and commercial banks. The unusual twist here is that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley may end up stuck on the wrong side of the fence, treated under the law as commercial banks instead of the investment banks they once were.
The backdrop to this issue is that it is increasingly clear that banks are simply unable to make as much money from proprietary and other trading businesses as they did before the financial crisis. Take Goldman Sachs. In 2007, Goldman had revenue of $7.6 billion from traditional investment banking, but $31.2 billion in revenue from trading-related operations. Last year, Goldman had just $17.3 billion in revenue related to trading operations.
This is a trend likely to accelerate. Under the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, derivatives are to be traded on central clearing agencies rather than between investment banks as before the financial crisis. Heightened bank capital requirements prevent warehousing large amounts of securities and increase the cost of financing. Then there is the Volcker Rule, which is likely to substantially reduce much of the banks' profits from their trading businesses.
Last week, Moody's Investors Service put Goldman, Morgan Stanley and 15 other global banks on a ratings watch, saying that "the combination of changed operating conditions and increased regulatory requirements and restrictions has diminished these firms' longer-term profitability and growth prospects."
The Volcker Rule, to be sure, also has benefits for the large banks. The more complicated the Volcker Rule, the less regulators will be able to understand it, leaving the banks with more loopholes. In addition, the rule may pose a barrier to entry to some commercial banks that can't afford the sophisticated regulatory apparatus to comply with the rule.
But given the sums involved, the question is whether we have reached a breaking point. How will Goldman, Morgan and the other banks that depend on trading revenue try to reclaim their profits?
One possibility would be for the banks to stop being bank holding companies, a regulatory status they chose in order to survive the financial crisis.
Before the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act overturned the depression-era Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, the American financial system was divided between investment banks and commercial banks. The commercial banks were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and subject to heightened regulation to ensure the safety of their deposits.
In contrast, the five large investment banks - Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers - were not regulated as banks. In exchange for lighter regulation, the five investment banks financed themselves through the private markets and could not rely on the Federal Reserve for financing of their operations.
After Gramm-Leach-Bliley, the investment banks largely stayed unregulated while the commercial banks like Citigroup and Bank of America behaved more like investment banks, increasing their trading operations.
During the financial crisis, the old-style investment banking model fell apart. Lehman Brothers collapsed and Bear Stearns nearly so. Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America.
Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, took a life-saving investment from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, while Goldman took capital from Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Morgan and Goldman also elected to become bank holding companies and regulated as banks.
By the time the dust settled, all of the nation's banks now looked like commercial ones and the investment banking model was dead. Goldman and Morgan were now subject to stricter regulation and oversight. As the Volcker Rule looms, becoming a bank holding company has proved to be a Faustian bargain.
Still, the Volcker Rule is not all gloom and doom for everyone on Wall Street. It is actually a real-life experiment in market efficiency. If the Volcker Rule truly makes the cost of markets higher, then it will reduce the profits of the big banks.
But the Volcker Rule does not apply to private equity funds, hedge funds and smaller investment banks that do not themselves own banks.
So if the Volcker Rule is really a drag on the economy, hedge funds and smaller investment banks that are not subject to it may try to interject themselves and bridge the gap that the investment banks can no longer fill.
The latter-day MF Globals of the worlds - nonbank financial firms - will have an incentive to become the next Goldman or Morgan, though it is hoped with better luck than Jon S. Corzine's actual MF Global. These newcomers will not be burdened by the full application of the Dodd-Frank Act and can sidestep the Volcker Rule.
The possibility of a new firm emerging overnight to challenge the big banks is low, but markets move quickly and there are some big players who are capable of emerging in the coming years. The Blackstone Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and Apollo Global Management, for example, are turning themselves from private equity firms into general service investment managers and engaging in investment banking businesses. Whether it is private equity firms, smaller investment banks or a new operation, given the profits to be made, it is likely Wall Street will find a way to close this gap.
The Volcker Rule may thus in the long term create a divided world where the old investment banks are challenged by new upstarts who are not limited by this rule. If these new competitors arise, it may even be that Goldman and Morgan reach the breaking point and give up their bank holding company status, removing the Volcker Rule straitjacket. This would allow all of them to return to their old trading practices.
Technically, this is legally possible. Each of these banks would have to elect not to be treated as a commercial bank and dispose of any banking operations. Each would still be subject to regulation, but would rid itself of the Volcker Rule's restrictions on trading. But while this is technically possible, given the public mood right now, neither is likely to want to risk the public censure it would bring.
While the idea of Goldman, Morgan or even Merrill Lynch ridding itself of its bank holding company status seems far-fetched today, the idea of new investment banks emerging is not.
The Volcker Rule, for all its good intentions, may perhaps unleash a burst of rapid financial innovation to do something it never intended: recreating the prefinancial crisis division between investment banks and commercial banks.

HEADLINE: Florida Investor Sues Paulson's Hedge Fund

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: A prominent Florida investor has sued Paulson &#038; Company, alleging that the hedge fund did not conduct the proper due diligence when evaluating an investment in the Sino-Forest Corporation. 

 BODY:
There was a time, not long ago, when the hedge fund manager John A. Paulson seemed to be practically untouchable.
Shuttled from meeting to meeting in a caravan of black S.U.V.'s, Mr. Paulson was living the hedge fund dream -- he had made billions with a prescient bet on the collapse of the housing market, and billions more in the following years betting on the increasing value of gold.
But one year has made all the difference for Mr. Paulson. After making an ill-timed bet on an economic recovery in the United States and sinking more than $800 million into a Chinese timber concern later accused of fraud, one of his largest funds lost nearly 50 percent in 2011. The scandal at the timber company, the Sino-Forest Corporation, appeared to be one of the first big gaffes in the worst year of Mr. Paulson's investing career.
Now, an investor lawsuit stemming from that loss has surfaced as well.
On Tuesday, a prominent Florida investor sued Paulson & Company, accusing the firm of not conducting the proper due diligence when evaluating the investment in Sino-Forest. The company lost billions in market value when a little-known investment firm published a report likening it to a "Ponzi scheme."
Paulson & Company's "reckless indifference" and "failure to conduct the required proper due diligence in this foreign environment, amounts to gross negligence and breach of defendant's fiduciary duties," according to the complaint filed by Hugh F. Culverhouse.
In a statement, the firm listed a number of institutions that apparently missed the warning signs about Sino-Forest as well. 
"As in all our investments, Paulson has access to the same information that everyone else in the securities markets does," the statement said. "Like other public market investors, we must rely on audits and underwriter due diligence for comfort that financial statements and disclosures are accurate and reflect the true state of affairs at companies with publicly traded securities."
Mr. Paulson has told investors he lost close to $500 million on the trade, raising a number of questions for investors. Why did Mr. Paulson own 14 percent of a small firm that was not heavily traded? Why did the hedge fund not know about the concerns regarding Sino-Forest's timber holdings? 
In a call with investors, Mr. Paulson himself acknowledged that his hedge fund did not conduct proper due diligence on the company, and that his traders had heard grumblings about Sino-Forest before the critical report, according to the complaint.
But in his response to the complaint, Mr. Paulson said the net losses were much smaller than the overall losses of $500 million.
"Because Paulson & Co. sold a substantial portion of its Sino-Forest shares from early 2010 through May 2011, the net realized loss to the portfolio for the full life of the position was C$105 million," the statement said, a figure in Canadian dollars nearly equal to $105 million.
In his statement, Mr. Paulson also said that:
The fact is that Sino-Forest apparently passed numerous legal and institutional controls and scrutiny, such as:
 Listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange, where companies must meet specific financial, legal, auditing and other standards, since 1995;
 Clean audit opinions on financial statements from Ernst & Young and other major auditors for fifteen fiscal years;
 Independent review and valuation of forest assets by international consultant Poyry for eleven of the past twelve years;
 Eight securities offerings from 2004 to 2010 led by major securities firms (including Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Toronto-Dominion Securities and Dundee Securities), each of which undertook due diligence on the company as part of underwriting;
 Independent board majority with seven of nine directors, including four businessmen (including Simon Murray, non-executive chairman of Glencore International, who was also previously chairman of Deutsche Bank in Asia and Group Managing Director of Hutchison Whampoa), one former senior investment banker, and two former senior accountants; and
 Wide following among sell-side research analysts (10 for equity, 10 for fixed income) and ratings agencies (S&P, Moodys, Fitch), with one of those analysts having been to China to visit Sino-Forest for each of the past seven years.

HEADLINE: Meredith Whitney Lands Book Deal

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: The banking analyst Meredith Whitney has signed a deal with Portfolio, an imprint of Penguin Group, to write a book about the growing problems in the municipal bond market. 

 BODY:
Meredith Whitney, the banking analyst who made a name for herself with a series of hard-nosed reports about the financial sector, is ready to plant her own literary flag.
Ms. Whitney has signed a deal with Portfolio, an imprint of the Penguin Group, to write a book about the growing problems in the municipal bond market, according to a statement from the publisher. The book, tentatively titled "Downgraded: Why the Next Economic Crisis Will Be Local," is expected to hit bookstore shelves in November. 
In the book, Ms. Whitney - who shook bond markets with an appearance in 2010 on "60 Minutes" in which she predicted scores of municipal defaults - will "reveal why America's cities and states are in deeper trouble than is commonly realized," according to the publisher.
Ms. Whitney made a name for herself as an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, where she gained attention for a report in 2007 on Citigroup that correctly predicted the bank would cut its dividend. In 2009, she started the Meredith Whitney Advisory Group, and has since been a regular on the business television circuit, in addition to being featured in Michael Lewis's book, "The Big Short."
Despite her newfound celebrity, Ms. Whitney's 2010 call on municipal bonds, in which she predicted "50 to 100 sizable defaults," has not exactly panned out. Only a handful of defaults have come to pass, and Ms. Whitney's reputation for prescience has suffered as some critics have accused her of alarmism.
Still, as a Paris Hilton-imitating, professional-wrestler-marrying market maven, Ms. Whitney is doubtless one of the most entertaining equity analysts out there. (A bit of a tallest leprechaun contest, but still.) 
"Since late 2008, dozens of American school districts, agencies, towns and cities have been taken under state control due to their inability to manage their own finances and pay their debts," Portfolio said in its statement explaining the book's premise. "According to Whitney, the evidence points to a mounting fiscal crisis in America's towns and states that will drive a political and economic wedge between the haves and have-nots."
The book deal, Ms. Whitney's first, was negotiated by Robert B. Barnett, the literary superlawyer who has represented clients like Barack Obama and Sarah Palin (and who recently arranged a reported $4 million advance for Amanda Knox, the American student who was convicted of murdering her roommate in Italy but subsequently set free). The size of Ms. Whitney's advance is unknown. 
Will Weisser, Portfolio's associate publisher, declined to comment on whether Ms. Whitney had enlisted the services of a co-writer, but said she was "very heavily into the process of writing" and was on track to meet her deadlines.
"We expect it to be somewhat controversial," Mr. Weisser said. "Obviously there are a lot of strong feelings on this issue."

HEADLINE: Recalling Nixon in China, 40 Years Later

BYLINE: JOHN F. BURNS


HIGHLIGHT: It was a moment in history: the morning 40 years ago Tuesday when Richard Nixon touched down to be greeted by the Chinese premier, Zhou Enlai, at the airport in what Westerners in those days still called Peking. 

 BODY:
It was a moment in history, of a kind that those of us in the resident foreign press corps knew we would probably not see the likes of again: the morning 40 years ago Tuesday, when Richard Nixon touched down to be greeted by the Chinese premier, Zhou Enlai, at the airport in what Westerners in those days still called Peking.
As if it were yesterday, I see the crisp blue and white of Air Force One, "United States of America" emblazoned on its fuselage; the flutter of the Chinese and American flags in the winter wind; the band of the People's Liberation Army playing a somewhat toneless version of "The Star-Spangled Banner"; the historic handshake at the foot of the gangway. Premier Zhou was immaculate in manner as always, while Nixon was heavily masked by television makeup, in what seemed like a parody of the lessons he learned from that 6 o'clock shadow moment in his televised debates with John F. Kennedy. And me, in my 20s, so seized with it all, so nervous, that all I managed were a few largely illegible scribbles in my notebook. 
Not that it mattered, for that sky-blue day is as clear in its detail now as it was then. How often since have I cherished the note of mischief that the Chinese smuggled into that solemn moment. Plain as could be, inscribed on a large posterboard at the rim of the airport apron that overlooked the cockpit of Air Force One, picked up by the television cameras relaying images of that famous handshake, were Mao's words in Chinese, set in white on a red background in the manner of the "big character" posters of the Cultural Revolution: "Make trouble, fail; make trouble again, fail again, until their doom. This is the logic of all imperialists and reactionaries the world over, and they cannot go against it. This is Marxist law." 
If the board had been bigger, the inscription might have added these still blunter words from the same passage: "When we say 'imperialism is ferocious,' we mean that its nature will never change, that the imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives, that they will never become Buddhas, till their doom." But the Chinese, ever economical in their dealings with foreigners, must have felt that they had made their point with sufficient clarity. Even many in the press corps traveling with the president failed to notice the message: that China, too, was a great nation, welcoming the leader of the world's most powerful country as an equal, unminded to bow its knee even modestly as the price of ending a generation of estrangement. 
I was then the Peking correspondent of The Globe and Mail of Toronto, the only Western newspaper at the time with a correspondent based in China. The Globe then did not have correspondents in some of Canada's own big cities. The posting was the product of an arrangement made more than a decade earlier, when China -- trading for Canadian wheat in massive quantities to compensate for the widespread famine that followed Mao's disastrous Great Leap Forward in the 1950s -- suggested that The Globe open a bureau in Peking, in exchange for a small but symbolic North American foothold in Canada for the official New China News Agency, which functioned then as an outpost of the Chinese state intelligence apparatus.
If the arrangement was The Globe's passport to China, it proved, in time, to be my passport to The New York Times. Lacking its own correspondent in China until the Nixon visit began the wider accommodation between Washington and Peking, The Times had been publishing by syndication some of The Globe's stories from China. 
To be a "local" correspondent, in the sense of not being part of President Nixon's traveling press corps, was to some extent a disadvantage. To be sure, we were on hand when the president visited the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, the idyllic lakeside city of Hangzhou, and finally, for the farewell banquet in Shanghai, an event awash in heads-back, swallow-it-whole toasts -- with the maotai firewater favored by the Chinese on such occasions -- that left Nixon, audibly that night, somewhat the worse for wear. 
But, as also happened during Henry Kissinger's follow-up trips to China, we who were based in China were in coach class, professionally speaking, a step or 10 lower on the rungs of access and privilege than the Barbara Walterses, the Dan Rathers and, not incidentally, the Max Frankels. Then The Times's Washington bureau chief and later a generous and far-seeing mentor as the paper's executive editor in the 1990s, Max won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the trip.
Still, there are worse things for a reporter than being an outsider, and being forced to resort to improvisation, shoe-leather energies and end-run plays, all invaluable when confronted with resistance, like the Chinese bureaucracy, with only a nodding acquaintance with the First Amendment.
On the evening of that first day, the "locals" were seated so far from the table in the Great Hall of the People where Premier Zhou hosted Nixon with a state banquet that we had to stand on our seats with binoculars to glimpse what American television viewers were seeing close-up. In my frustration (and my concern not to look a complete fool in my report), I waited until the banquet ended, then raced through the madding crowd of guests to the top table. There, I made a close inspection of the gold-embossed menu cards, along with the similarly gilded place cards ("Richard Milhous Nixon, President of the United States") and ivory chopsticks where the two principals had been sitting. 
A felonious thought occurred: How about simply taking all of it, and hiding it in my pocket, as a matchless souvenir? The stern-faced Chinese security official, statue-straight in his Mao suit, seemed to counsel against it, but just then one of those improbable things happened, proving again that a reporter pushing the boundaries can make his own luck. The security man turned his head for a moment, and winked. And off I went with my guilty booty.
But I hadn't reckoned -- and there were many in our profession who made this error -- with the inimitable Helen Thomas, stalwart of United Press International, dean of the White House press corps, a newswoman so ferocious that her cohorts used to say it was a brave man who would presume to step between her and a telephone. As we tripped down the red carpet to the main doors of the Great Hall, she asked me what it was she had seen me looting. And I told her. Within 24 hours, a telegram was delivered to my Peking flat -- "Mr. John Burns, China" -- from a New York curio dealer offering me $25,000, as I remember it now, for the entire suite of mementos, about two-thirds of my annual income at the time. 
Naive as I then was to the ways of the world -- or principled, as I would like to think -- I cabled a rejection, saying I could not stoop to making a profit from my work, or more properly put, from my light-fingered diversion. Some years later, as I was preparing to leave Peking for a new job as a reporter on The Times metro desk in New York, George H. W. Bush, then head of the American Liaison Office in China, a quasi-embassy that grew from the Nixon visit, and also my doubles tennis partner, offered over our last game together to send them in the diplomatic bag to Nixon. He was then disgraced and living in San Clemente, Calif. When last I heard, they still resided there in the Nixon presidential library, along with the letter I wrote to the former president wishing him well. But that, of course, is another story.
What was accomplished in those days of February 1972 is so well known, so thoroughly rehearsed in the histories and biographies of that era, as well as in John Adams's terrific opera, that it needs little in the way of further pontificating by me. As Nixon said in the handwritten letter he sent thanking me for the return of the purloined pieces, it was the high point of his presidency, and, he hoped, the accomplishment for which he would be remembered after the scandal of Watergate dimmed. 
The visit brought about the rapprochement between the two great nations that continues to develop today, in awkward fits and starts, and occasional eruptions of distemper, just as that big-character poster at the airport suggested it might. And it put me on the path to the terrific years, 35 and counting, that I have spent as a foreign correspondent for The Times. I've often said that it's a life of adventure and reward, in terms of the extraordinary people and places and events that are part of the fabric of a foreign correspondent's life, that I would have chosen to live unpaid had I been born the grandson of a John D. Rockefeller or a J. Pierpoint Morgan. But little that I have seen has been quite so momentous, or quite so exhilarating, as that far, fierce hour watching the arrival of Richard Nixon in Peking.

HEADLINE: Obama Calls on Congress to 'Keep Going'

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama surrounded himself with Americans who have benefited from lower payroll taxes and expanded unemployment insurance in an effort to pressure Congress to do more to help the middle class. 

 BODY:
President Obama surrounded himself on Tuesday with beneficiaries of lower payroll taxes and expanded unemployment insurance to dramatize the value of both steps and to pressure Congress to do more to help the middle class.
Noting that the two measures will, on average, put an extra $40 in the paychecks of Americans, Mr. Obama challenged Republican lawmakers to pass his administration's other proposals, including making it easier to refinance home mortgages and rewarding companies for generating new jobs in the United States.
The extra cash from the tax cut, the president noted, would help pay for groceries and cushion Americans against "the rising cost of gas, which is on the minds of a lot of people right now."
"Now my message to Congress is: don't stop here, keep going," Mr. Obama said at the midday session, flanked by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and several Americans who were invited to attend after they shared stories with the administration of what the tax cut and jobless insurance meant to them. 
The gathering at the White House was one of several the administration has organized in recent weeks to highlight what the president says are the real-world effects of implementing his economic agenda. 
As a toddler fussed throughout his remarks, Mr. Obama called on Congress to send him the payroll tax bill to sign this week. But, referring to Mr. Biden, he warned that if lawmakers kept blocking his other proposals, "Joe and I are going to act."
Republicans, for their part, questioned why the White House was celebrating yet another temporary extension of a tax cut, with the unemployment rate higher than when Mr. Obama pushed through his economic stimulus in 2009 and the federal debt breaking records.
"It's not a victory when the economy is still so weak that you feel the need to grant a temporary reduction in the payroll tax," said the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. "It's a victory when this kind of government relief isn't needed at all."
Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, noted that Republicans, led by Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, were ready to package together several bills that would benefit small businesses, and he challenged Democrats in the Senate to support them.

HEADLINE: Tax Code Not Aligned With Basic Principles

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: With its relatively heavy taxes on labor, light taxes on unearned income and broad ranges of rates within the same income levels, the American tax code violates fundamental principles of income taxation. 

 BODY:
It is clear that the rising inequality of wealth and income and how the wealthy should be taxed will be major issues in the political campaign. 
All the Republican candidates are committed to at least preventing any increase in taxes on those with large incomes. President Obama is pressing the so-called Buffett Rule that would require those making $1 million a year or more to have an effective federal tax rate (taxes divided by income) of at least 30 percent, while raising the top statutory tax rate for those with incomes over $250,000 to 39.6 percent from 35 percent.
One problem that undoubtedly will arise is how to generalize about any particular income class's tax burden. As I pointed out last week, tax burdens depend a lot on how one defines "income." In particular, the tax law makes a sharp distinction between income earned through wages and salaries, sometimes called "earned" income, on the one hand, and income from capital, or "unearned" income.

Wage income is very heavily taxed because both the income tax and payroll tax apply to it. The lower one's income is, the more likely that it consists solely of wages. Therefore, the heavy taxation of labor necessarily hits hard those with low and middle incomes.
By contrast, income from capital is lightly taxed. Unrealized capital gains are untaxed, realized gains are taxed at a maximum rate of just 15 percent, and gains held until death are never taxed. Moreover, wealthy hedge fund managers are permitted to treat their managerial fees as if they are capital gains, something that is called "carried interest." Dividends on corporate stock are also taxed at a maximum rate of 15 percent.
The wealthier one is, the less his or her income is derived from labor. According to the Tax Policy Center, households in the middle three quintiles get about 70 percent of their total income from wages and salaries. Those in the top quintile get 55 percent of their income from labor. 
For those in the top 1 percent of the income distribution, only about 30 percent of their income comes from labor and for those in the top tenth of 1 percent, just 20 percent of their income comes from labor. 
By contrast, those with low and middle incomes derive very little of it from capital. The bottom 80 percent of households get less than 4 percent of their income from capital. For those in the top quintile, however, 16 percent of their income comes from capital. And among the top 1 percent it is 35 percent.
But looking at the data this way understates how low taxes on capital benefit the wealthy, because if one looks only at capital income, virtually all of it goes to them. Those in the top quintile get 86 percent of all the capital income in the United States - $960 billion out of $1.1 trillion in total capital income. Most of that went to the top 1 percent, which received $633 billion - 57 percent of the total. And the top 0.1 percent got two-thirds of that.
The point is that a tax system that lightly taxes capital and heavily taxes labor is necessarily going to benefit the wealthy. As this chart illustrates, federal tax rates on the wealthy have been falling since 1978, when Congress cut the maximum capital gains rate to 28 percent from 35 percent.
We rationalize this mainly on the grounds that increasing the stock of capital is good for everyone. For example, it will raise productivity, which in the long run will raise wages for all workers.
The empirical question of whether sharply lower taxes on capital, and hence the wealthy, has actually raised saving, investment and productivity is one I will revisit. Suffice it to say that since 2003, when the current tax rates on capital gains and dividends were instituted, the economy offers little, if any, evidence on this score. (Before 2003, capital gains were taxed at a maximum rate of 20 percent and dividends were taxed like wages and salaries.)
The point I want to make here is that differential tax rates on different forms of income mean that tax burdens will vary not only between income classes but within them as well. The latest Economic Report of the Presidenthas an interesting table that illustrates this point.
For the wealthy, we can see, effective tax rates vary between 12 percent for those at the lower end of the top quintile and 29 percent for those at the upper end. Among the top 1 percent, effective rates vary between 9 percent and 35 percent. 
Those paying the highest effective rates are, no doubt, those such as doctors and lawyers with large incomes consisting mostly of salaries.
Thus we see that the bottom tenth of those in the top 1 percent pay well less in federal taxes as a share of their income than at least 25 percent of those in the bottom income quintile. And 25 percent of those in the top 1 percent pay less than substantial numbers of households in the upper three quintiles.
I couldn't find the raw data underlying that in the table, but the Census Bureau put the floor for households in the second quintile at $20,000 in 2010. For the third quintile, the floor was $38,043; for the fourth $61,735; for the fifth $100,065, and for the top 5 percent $180,810.
We can see, then, that the tax system in the United States violates the fundamental principles of income taxation. Those are "vertical equity," which says that those with upper incomes should pay a higher effective tax rate than those with modest incomes - as far back as Adam Smith, ability to pay has always been a core principle of taxation - and "horizontal equity," which says that those with roughly the same income ought to pay roughly the same taxes.

HEADLINE: The Ad Wars Come to Michigan

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: The "super PAC" supporting President Obama has bought $238,000 worth of airtime in the Detroit and Flint media markets. 

 BODY:
The airwaves in Michigan will soon be thick with political ads as a number of "super PACs" and at least one presidential campaign went on a buying spree Tuesday, nailing down what commercial time they could ahead of the state's primary next Tuesday.
Making its first major ad buy this year, the super PAC supporting President Obama, Priorities USA Action, has secured $238,000 worth of air time in the Detroit and Flint markets, according to a group that tracks political media spending. Priorities USA Action did not immediately release a commercial or respond to a request for comment.
Michigan is one the swing states that the president and his advisers believe he stands a solid chance of winning. Mr. Obama's plans to revive the country's manufacturing base could help him with blue-collar voters there. And the state has been showing signs of economic resurgence as the auto industry adds more jobs. Mr. Obama has stood behind his backing for the federal government's $80 billion assistance package to American auto makers, while Mitt Romney and other Republican presidential candidates have criticized it as an example of government overreach.
Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies like Priorities USA Action are seeking to highlight the differences between the president's economic agenda and Mr. Romney's, which will get a full airing on Friday when Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, delivers a major speech in downtown Detroit, where he is expected to unveil a new tax plan.
Republicans are adding to their efforts in Michigan. The super PAC supporting Rick Santorum, the Red, White and Blue Fund, has put almost $700,000 into advertising in the state so far and bought another $600,000 in air time on Tuesday.
Restore Our Future, the pro-Romney super PAC, added $400,000 to its spending, bringing its total there to $2.2 million.
The campaign of Ron Paul on Tuesday released an unconventional new commercial - perhaps the first in the history of a presidential campaign to use the words "dude" and "groovy" - that attacks Mr. Santorum's credibility as a fiscal conservative. "Is this dude serious?" the ad asks before listing a number of spending votes Mr. Santorum took as a member of Congress. A media strategist put the amount of the purchase at $50,000 on cable television.
Mr. Romney's campaign and the super PAC supporting him have already been the most active in Michigan. They have committed a combined $3.7 million to television advertising there plus another $350,000 on radio. Mr. Santorum and his super PAC have so far booked $1.4 million worth of airtime of their own.
Beyond Michigan, Mr. Romney's super PAC was very active on Tuesday, buying more than $2 million of time in states that will hold their primaries next month: Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma and Tennessee.

HEADLINE: In Michigan, Voters Question Romney's Conservative Credentials

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: In Shelby, Mich., voters ask about abortion, religious liberty and the kind of Supreme Court justices that Mitt Romney would appoint as president. 

 BODY:
SHELBY, Mich. -- Mitt Romney wants to talk about the economy -- badly. It's his longed-for comfort zone. It's his standard stump speech. It's the issue that has consumed his campaign.
The Republicans voters at a town hall here? Not so much.
During a campaign event on Tuesday, they bombarded Mr. Romney with questions about how he would protect religious liberty against government intrusion; about the depth of his commitment to fighting to abortion; about whether he would appoint strict constructionist judges to the Supreme Court; and about what kind of vice presidential nominee he would name.
It was a vivid reminder of the degree to which an intense new round of Republican primaries starting next week may turn not on Mr. Romney's favored political battleground -- how to turn around the country's finances -- but on much trickier terrain that has repeatedly frustrated his political plans this year: his ideological commitment as a conservative.
If there was any state where the economy would singularly animate primary voters, it would be Michigan, where the recession took an especially brutal bite out of the automotive industry.
And yet ... while the questions from the audience here, over the course of about 45 minutes, had a polite and friendly tone, there was no hiding their skeptical subtext. Those ardent conservatives choosing between Mr. Romney and Senator Rick Santorum are still not sure how the former Massachusetts governor stacks up on the handful of issues that animate them. 
"I want to hear you say it," said Feleiteau Epley, 58, to Mr. Romney. "That you are 100 percent pro-life. No abortions."
Mr. Romney, who is running behind in the polls here, did not oblige. Instead, he described himself as "pro-life"-- a slightly less rigid position that left Ms. Epley, who is considering voting for Mr. Santorum, unsatisfied.
Mr. Romney, who was born in Michigan and is the son of its former governor, took pains to cast himself as an long-standing and unwavering conservative. Asked about his vice presidential choice, should be become the nominee, he began by promising that his selection would be "pro-life" and "somebody who is conservative to the core," before adding that the person must be "unquestionably an individual who could lead the nation if something happened to me."
Pressed on the kind of judges he would put on the high court, he declared that he would follow the path of President George W. Bush in naming those who do not stray from the words of the founding fathers.
"If I am president of United States, I will make sure the people we appoint to the bench are people like Roberts and Alito and Thomas and Scalia, people who believe in following the Constitution."
Queried about his stances on abortion and gay marriage, he recalled his days as governor of Massachusetts, when he had fought back against a court decision allowing gay couples to marry. "I have fought for traditional marriage," he said
Tellingly, Mr. Romney sought to portray Mr. Santorum, a darling of the Republican right, as not conservative enough, especially on spending. Advisers have acknowledged that Mr. Santorum's record of conservatism on social issues is all but unimpeachable, leaving a narrow opening for Mr. Romney to challenge his right-wing credentials.
"I think a Tea Partier would find it very interesting that Rick Santorum voted to raise the debt ceiling five times without getting compensating reductions in spending," Mr. Romney said in response to a question, later mocking the senator for a $500,000 earmark to the Pittsburgh Zoo for a polar bear exhibit. "I don't think that is consistent with a person who is a conservative. I don't think Rick Santorum's track record is that of a fiscal conservative."
Barbara M. Miller, 77, an attendee who said she had not yet decided on who gets her vote in next Tuesday's primary, said that so far, she had found a deeper connection with Mr. Santorum, a fellow Roman Catholic who has made religion and morality a central theme of his campaign. "I think our country has turned away from religion," she said. "We need God in everyday life."
One of the event's most telling moments came when Ms. Epley asked about abortion. She told Mr. Romney that she had been deeply impressed with his answers until that point, and could see herself voting for him -- but just needed a bit more reassurance. When she did not receive it, she approached him on the rope line and whispered a followup question, she said. Did he oppose abortion in the case of rape and incest, too, she asked. Mr. Romney told her he did not, she said.
She was crestfallen. "Rick Santorum," she said, "is 100 percent pro-life. Now I am very torn."

HEADLINE: Can Santorum Win in November?

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Santorum is more electable on paper than in reality. 

 BODY:
If one were to invent a Republican politician whose background and beliefs were ideally suited to a general-election campaign against Barack Obama, that dream candidate would share a number of qualities with Rick Santorum.
He would hail from the Midwest - a region filled with recession-battered swing states where the president's support is weaker than in the country as a whole. He would be a Catholic rather than an Evangelical or a Mormon, because the Catholic vote swings back and forth between the two parties in ways that other religious demographics don't. He would have a strong personal and biographical connection to blue-collar whites, a bloc of voters whose support President Obama has always had difficulty winning. His record would be conservative enough to excite the Republican Party's base, but leavened with enough moderation and even populism on economic issues to reassure anxious middle-income voters that the Republican Party doesn't just exist to serve Wall Street and the rich.
Santorum checks all of these boxes, while Mitt Romney - his Michigan ties and attempts to play the tribune of the middle class notwithstanding - decidedly does not. Which is why, as Romney flails and Santorum rises, a few pundits have found themselves tiptoeing toward what seems like the most counterintuitive of all possible conclusions: The possibility that the long-shot former senator from Pennsylvania, not his supposedly more electable rival, might stand a better chance of winning in November.
This idea seems laughable if you assume that most swing voters are fiscal conservatives and social moderates, allergic to culture-war appeals and pining for a dream ticket of Michael Bloomberg and Olympia Snowe. But as New York magazine's Jonathan Chait has explained, there's more than one kind of "moderate" in American politics:
There are, very roughly speaking, two kinds of swing voters. One kind is economically conservative, socially liberal swing voters. This is the kind of voter you usually read about, because it's the kind most familiar to political reporters - affluent and college educated. But there's a second kind of voter at least as numerous - economically populist and socially conservative. Think of disaffected blue-collar workers, downscale white men who love guns, hate welfare, oppose free trade, and want higher taxes on the rich and corporations. Romney appeals to the former, but Santorum more to the latter.
In effect, Santorum has stepped into the Mike Huckabee-shaped hole in the Republican field. Like Huckabee, his political persona is worlds away from the Washington-New York definitions of "middle-of-the-road." But a mix of social conservatism and economic populism has a great deal of general-election potential - especially in a contest against a president whose style of liberalism can seem professorial, condescending and aloof.
The operative word, though, is "potential." In outline, Santorum's profile fits the looming fall campaign almost perfectly. Fill in the details, though, and the argument for his electability largely collapses.
All things being equal, a Rust Belt background would be a potential advantage for a Republican presidential candidate. But a Rust Belt background that includes an 17-point repudiation from the Pennsylvania electorate that knew Santorum best looks more like a liability instead.
All things being equal, both Catholicism and social conservatism are potential assets in a campaign against a president who has spoken condescendingly about Middle Americans who "get bitter" and "cling to guns or religion." But a Catholic conservatism that manifests itself in campaign-trail critiques of contraception promises to alienate many more voters (female voters, especially) than it attracts.
All things being equal, a populist style that's at odds with the Acela corridor's attitudes and values can often play well in the heartland. But no presidential candidate can succeed without a modicum of favorable media coverage, and so a successful populist needs to be able to disarm elite journalists (as Huckabee so expertly did, schmoozing on The Daily Show and elsewhere) as often as he alienates them. And nobody has ever used the word "disarming" to describe Rick Santorum's approach to politics.
That's because the former senator has the instincts of an activist, rather than of a president or statesman. Whether the topic is social issuesor foreign policy, his zeal exceeds his prudence, and as a result his career is littered with debating society provocations (referencing "man-on-dog" sex in an argument about gay marriage, using his doomed 2006 Senate bid to educate Pennsylvanians on the evils of Hugo Chavez, etc.) that have won him far more enemies than friends. His passion for ideas and argument often does him credit, but in a national campaign it would probably do him in.
In the (still-unlikely) event that Santorum captured the nomination, then, his campaign would probably be to social conservatism what Barry Goldwater's 1964 campaign was to small-government conservatism: A losing effort that would inspire countless observers to declare the loser's worldview discredited, rejected, finished.
In the longer run, a Santorum candidacy might suggest a path that a more electable pro-life populist could follow, much as Reagan ultimately followed Goldwater.
But in the short run, it would almost certainly be a debacle - a sweeping defeat for the candidate himself, and a sweeping setback for the causes that he champions.

HEADLINE: Grubb & Ellis Files for Bankruptcy and Agrees to Sell Assets to BGC

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: The commercial real estate company Grubb &#038; Ellis agrees to sell nearly all of its assets to BGC Partners, a firm run by Howard W. Lutnick, who is also the chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald. 

 BODY:
Grubb & Ellis has found a new home.
The commercial real estate company, which grew from a single office in San Francisco in 1958 to become one of the nation's largest brokerage firms, filed for bankruptcy this week, blaming the financial crisis for wiping out the commercial property market. 
In conjunction with the Chapter 11 filing, Grubb & Ellis agreed to sell nearly all of its assets to BGC Partners, a financial brokerage firm that broke away from Cantor Fitzgerald in 2004.
 "BGC's strong capital base, robust technology and deep commitment to its brokers provides Grubb & Ellis with scale along with the resources needed by our professionals to deliver exceptional service to our clients," Thomas P. D'Arcy, chief executive of Grubb & Ellis, said in a statement announcing the sale. "We are confident this will be a seamless transition for our clients and that becoming part of BGC is an extremely attractive opportunity for our brokerage professionals and employees."
In its bankruptcy declaration, filed on Monday in the Southern District of New York, Grubb & Ellis listed $150 million in assets and $167 million in debts. 
The company was hurt by "the 2007-2009 meltdown of the financial markets," Michael J. Rispoli, the company's chief financial officer, wrote in the petition, and by an ill-fated merger in 2007 with NNN Realty Advisors at the top of the real estate market. Revenue in the company's transaction services business plunged to $173 million in 2009 from $312 million in 2007, it said in the filing.
"The combined effect of these adverse economic conditions and liabilities and losses associated with disposed businesses severely strained Grubb & Ellis's liquidity and hampered its ability to continue as a going concern," Mr. Rispoli wrote.
As Grubb & Ellis continued to struggle with the torpid real estate market in recent years, its problems led to more problems. Recently, the company said in its Chapter 11 filing, high-performing brokers who accounted for 30 percent of Grubb & Ellis's 2011 brokerage revenue had left the company. 
"As the personal relationships among Grubb & Ellis's brokers and clients are essential to its continued successful operations, it is critical that the debtors' financial condition and liquidity be quickly stabilized and that the debtors' employees are made confident in the businesses' ability to continue as a going concern," Mr. Rispoli wrote.
Grubb & Ellis tried to sell its core businesses beginning last March, the filing said, but failed to find suitable bidders. Now, after the bankruptcy filing, BGC is stepping in to pick up the pieces.
BGC, which is run by Howard W. Lutnick, also the chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald, has dipped a toe in the real estate sector recently. In October, it bought Newmark Knight Frank, a real estate services firm based in New York. At the time, Mr. Lutnick said the acquisition was "the beginning of a dramatic new footprint in commercial real estate by BGC."
BGC will provide financing of up to $4.8 million to keep Grubb & Ellis operating while the acquisition closes, according to the filing.
On Monday, in announcing the Grubb & Ellis deal, Mr. Lutnick again boasted about his firm's push into the commercial real estate sector.
"This transaction reflects the deep and unwavering commitment of BGC -- the fastest-growing, and one of the world's largest, global brokerage companies serving the financial markets -- to build a premier position in real estate services," he said. "We agreed to acquire Grubb & Ellis because we believe Newmark Knight Frank's and Grubb & Ellis's broad knowledge and extensive brokerage expertise, combined with BGC's powerful proprietary technology and our strong financial backing, will enable Grubb & Ellis to thrive and grow as part of the BGC family of companies."

HEADLINE: Romney's Money Problems

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney spent $12.2 million more than he raised in January, ending the month with just $7.7 million in cash on hand. That sort of pace is not sustainable. 

 BODY:
As my colleague Nicholas Confessore notes, the Republican presidential candidates are becoming increasingly dependent on money raised by "super PACs" and are raising relatively little through traditional channels.
Mitt Romney raised slightly more than his Republican rivals in January. His campaign committee, Romney for President, brought in $6.5 million in January, according to a report filed with the Federal Election Commission. By contrast, Newt Gingrich raised $5.6 million, and Rick Santorum and Ron Paul each raised $4.5 million.
But his fund-raising pace was fairly weak despite wins in New Hampshire and Florida. And Mr. Romney spent far more than his rivals in January - $18.8 million, compared with $5.9 million for his next-closest competitor, Mr. Gingrich.
More worrisome, Mr. Romney spent more than he took in; his cash flow was negative $12.2 million for the month. He exited January with just $7.7 million in cash on hand. 
That sort of pace is not sustainable. Were Mr. Romney's campaign to continue to raise and spend money at the same rate as in January, it would have only about 20 days of expenditures before money ran out.
Although the pace of the electoral calendar was relatively slow in the first part of February, Michigan and Arizona are fairly large states, as are some like Ohio and Virginia that vote on Super Tuesday. Although the calendar then returns toward mostly smaller states, Illinois - fifth in United States population and with the third-largest media market in Chicago - votes on March 20.
The busy slate in January presents plenty of opportunities for candidates to spend money, but it also gives them a chance to earn it back by soliciting contributions after they achieve success in primaries and caucuses. In recent campaigns, in fact, candidates have broken close to even in January over all.
In 2008, the eight Republican candidates combined to spend $42.0 million in January. But they brought in $43.5 million, enough to cover their expenses.
The Democrats raised more ($62.5 million) and spent more ($67.5 million) in January 2008, but still kept their books roughly in balance for the month. They ended it with a combined $65.8 million in cash on hand, although some campaigns, like Hillary Rodham Clinton's, had begun to accumulate a significant amount of debt.
By contrast, the six major Republican campaigns that had filed with the F.E.C. as of Monday night - Michele Bachmann's report was not yet available - raised $22.0 million but spent $37.1 million in January. And they finished the month with just $13.4 million in cash on hand.
Mr. Romney's negative $12.2 million cash flow represented the worst January in the F.E.C.'s online records, which cover election cycles since 2000. The previous record had been held by George W. Bush, who raised $2.0 million but spent $12.8 million in January that year, for a net $10.8 million outflow. Mr. Bush's total would have been larger than Mr. Romney's if adjusted for inflation, however.
But Mr. Bush exited January 2008 with $20.5 million (before inflation), about three times what Mr. Romney's campaign had at the end of last month.
One problem is that Mr. Romney has never done very well with small donors. In January, his campaign brought in just $1.2 million in unitemized contributions, a category that covers donations of $200 or less. That total was the worst of the four remaining Republican campaigns; Mr. Santorum brought in $2.6 million in unitemized contributions; Mr. Gingrich, $2.5 million; and Mr. Paul, $2.1 million.
Mr. Romney's relative lack of support from small donors is problematic for two reasons. First, voters who contribute to a campaign are usually among its most enthusiastic supporters and can generally be counted on to turn out for it.
Second, small donors can be tapped into again and again until they reach their contribution limits (current $2,500 for the primary and another $2,500 for the general election). By contrast, donors who have already contributed their maximums can give no more, although they can contribute to "super PACs" or other Republican-affiliated groups. Thus, a candidate who fits this pattern may be at risk of seeing the pace of fund-raising slow down as the campaign drags on.
Restore Our Future, the "super PAC" supporting Mitt Romney, also spent more than it took in during January and had a cash flow of negative $7.3 million for the month. However, its balance sheet remained strong, as it exited January with $16.3 million in cash and no debt.
The "super PACs," however, have spent almost all of their money on television advertising - much of it negative - leaving candidates without the robust organizational infrastructures that the Democrats built in 2008 or Mr. Bush did in 2000. Although Mr. Romney's "ground game" is strong compared with that of his rivals, it is fairly weak by historical standards, with his campaign generally establishing just one field office in each major state, according to his campaign Web site.
Even if Mr. Romney's fund-raising pace were to pick up, it might be too late to rectify the difference. Barack Obama's campaign spent $40.9 million in fourth quarter of 2007, much of it in field offices and infrastructure. By contrast, Mr. Romney's campaign spent $19.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. And whereas Mr. Obama's fund-raising pace significantly accelerated in January 2008 - his campaign brought in $36.8 million - Mr. Romney's has not.
The discrepancy may help explain Mr. Romney's relatively poor performance so far in caucuses, which are usually contests of enthusiasm and organization. If Mr. Romney's voters somewhat lack enthusiasm, a great campaign infrastructure might have been enough to make up the difference, but a middling one might not be.
Unless Mr. Romney's fund-raising pace picks up or he wraps up the nomination fairly quickly, he might need to consider self-financing, as he did in 2008. But that decision could carry some risk. Voters may be reluctant to contribute to a campaign once it looks like the candidate is willing to foot the bill himself, and such a decision could play into unfavorable narratives about Mr. Romney and his wealth. In addition, self-financed candidates have a poor track record in federal and state elections, although it is not clear whether there is any causal relationship.
It is not uncommon for campaigns to live paycheck to paycheck, so to speak, in the early-voting states, and sometimes they can survive it. John Kerry's campaign had $7.7 million in cash at the end of January 2004 - the same amount Mr. Romney has now - and Mr. Kerry's campaign accumulated $7.0 million in debt, while Mr. Romney has none. The Republican nominee in 2008, John McCain, had only $5.2 million in cash after the January primaries and $5.5 million in debt.
The calendar was much more front-loaded in 2008 than it is this year, however, and Mr. Kerry never endured a major stumble after winning in Iowa and New Hampshire, so his campaign was able to turn its attention to the general election quickly. What is problematic for Mr. Romney is his high burn rate coupled with what could be a prolonged nomination process.
As is to be expected when one party has a competitive nomination and the other does not, Mr. Romney and his rivals are losing ground to the Democratic incumbent, Mr. Obama.
Describing Mr. Obama's finances is more challenging because he solicits donations through four separate fund-raising arms. One is its campaign committee, Obama for America, which raised just $9.3 million in January (with $11.9 in total revenue after accounting for transfers from other committees and other accounting items). However, Mr. Obama may also receive some support from the Democratic National Committee, which raised $6.3 million. In addition, the Democratic National Committee and Obama for America jointly run two fund-raising bodies, the Obama Victory Fund and the Swing State Victory Fund, which together raised $13.8 million in January. 
Obama for America ended January with $76.0 million in cash on hand, and the four related organizations combined had $98.7 million.
Although those are impressive-sounding figures, they are not as strong as those of Mr. Bush in 2004. After the January fund-raising period in 2004, Mr. Bush's campaign committee had $104.4 million in cash on hand, or $122 million when combined with the Republican National Committee.
Of greater concern to Mr. Obama might be the "super PACs." The major one supporting him, Priorities USA Action, brought in just $59,000 in January, and most of it came from a single donor. The paltry sum may have inspired Mr. Obama's strategists to begin explicitly encouraging donations to the "super PAC" - something they had avoided before since it conflicted with the spirit of Mr. Obama's public criticism of the Citizens United decision.
In the long run, it is not necessarily obvious that Democrats are less likely to receive "super PAC" support than Republicans; the political preferences of the very wealthy are eccentric, and tend to run toward fiscal conservativism but social liberalism. In fact, Democrats have been slightly more reliant than Republicans on contributions from the very wealthy since at least 1990, somewhat contradicting the proletarian image that the party likes to adopt. However, in the 2010 election cycle, "super PAC" contributions were larger to Republican-affiliated groups ($47.3 million) than to Democratic ones ($36.4 million), and a single contribution from a billionaire like Shelden Adelson could outweigh thousands of smaller ones.
A detailed table of January fund-raising figures for presidential campaigns since 2000 is below.

HEADLINE: Heralding End of 'Dark Times,' Christie Offers Budget That Is Bigger and Cuts Taxes

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
TRENTON -- After two years of enforcing austerity, Gov. Chris Christie argued on Tuesday that New Jersey could afford to have it all, presenting a budget he said would cut income taxes by 10 percent at the same time it gave money to schools, provided for the poor and met the state's pension obligations.
The governor, who has made himself a promising star in the Republican Party with tough budgets in the first half of his term, proclaimed that ''we have left the dark times'' as he proposed a $32 billion budget, a 3.7 percent increase over last year's spending. While still less than the budget of 2008, when the economy faltered, it would be the largest of his tenure. 
''Today, I ask this chamber a simple question,'' he said, speaking before the Democratic-controlled Legislature. ''Why not cut income taxes for all New Jerseyans when our fiscal house is now in order?''
''Because we have made the tough choices in these last two years,'' he added, ''we can make the right ones now.''
But Democrats noted that the bigger burden for most residents is not income taxes but property taxes, which have increased by 20 percent since Mr. Christie took office, according to the state's own figures, after cuts to the rebates and credits that previous governors used to reduce the state's unusually high property taxes.
The $213 million increase in school aid, which Mr. Christie said would result in the biggest state contribution ever, fell short of restoring the cuts he made to schools in his first budget, two years ago.
The governor's budget depends on a sizable increase in revenue and a robust economic recovery -- anticipating that sales, corporate and income taxes will increase 7.5 percent over the next fiscal year -- even as revenue projections have fallen short by $325 million in the first six months of the current one.
And while Mr. Christie said there would be no cuts to property tax relief, the budget presumes a reduction in the number of people seeking it.
Democrats argued that the income tax cut, which would be phased in over three years, was aimed more at presidential primary voters in Iowa than wallets in New Jersey.
''He is trying to persuade or appeal to a national audience,'' said Louis Greenwald, the majority leader in the Assembly. ''He is missing the point that in New Jersey, the tax crisis is singularly property taxes.''
The governor promoted a new 2 percent cap on property tax increases passed with the support of the Legislature.
A recent study found that the average New Jersey household spent 11 percent of its income on property taxes, nearly triple the national average, and a Rutgers-Eagleton poll conducted Feb. 9-11 found that while 52 percent of registered voters in New Jersey favored the income tax cut, 76 percent would prefer to reduce their property taxes first.
Still, the Democrats acknowledged the difficulty of fighting against a tax cut. ''Most people think they're going to get $750,'' Mr. Greenwald said, when in fact, families making $50,000 would get a reduction of about $80 and those making $100,000 would get a $275 reduction when the tax cut is fully phased in. It would begin to take effect in July.
The Democrats said they would continue to fight to restore the so-called millionaires' tax on the wealthiest families, as other states have done, and on relieving property taxes.
With that, they set up another fight with the governor, who declared in his speech, ''So there is no mistake in my intention: I will veto any tax increase again.''
After cutting the earned-income tax credit last year, Mr. Christie's budget would increase it beginning next year.
Mr. Christie also proposed increasing spending on higher education by $108 million and spending $1 million on a revived proposal for an Urban Scholarship Program to help students in failing schools attend private ones.
The budget also proposed reorganizing several agencies, which the Christie administration said was aimed not at saving money, but at providing better service.
It would create a new division focused on children in the Department of Children and Families, and a new Division of Aging Services to coordinate care for the elderly. It would provide $24.7 million in new money for people with developmental disabilities, helping to move 130 people off the waiting list for community residential services.
It would steer $5.6 million saved by closing Hagedorn Psychiatric Hospital in Glen Gardner, scheduled for June, to the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services, and provide an additional $10 million to help place people who would have been institutionalized in community housing.
The psychiatric hospital itself would be the new site for the expansion of a program that helps homeless veterans.
The budget would also provide an additional $2.5 million to set up mandatory drug courts for nonviolent offenders.

HEADLINE: Under Volcker, the Old Dividing Line in Banks May Return

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, a former corporate lawyer, is a professor of law and finance at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
The Volcker Rule, and its limitations on bank trading, may have the unintended effect of dividing the world back into investment banks and commercial banks. The unusual twist here is that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley may end up stuck on the wrong side of the fence, treated under the law as commercial banks instead of the investment banks they once were.
The backdrop to this issue is that it is increasingly clear that banks are simply unable to make as much money from proprietary and other trading businesses as they did before the financial crisis. Take Goldman Sachs. In 2007, Goldman had revenue of $7.6 billion from traditional investment banking, but $31.2 billion in revenue from trading-related operations. Last year, Goldman had just $17.3 billion in revenue related to trading operations. 
This is a trend likely to accelerate. Under the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, derivatives are to be traded on central clearing agencies rather than between investment banks as before the financial crisis. Heightened bank capital requirements prevent warehousing large amounts of securities and increase the cost of financing. Then there is the Volcker Rule, which is likely to substantially reduce much of the banks' profits from their trading businesses.
Last week, Moody's Investors Service put Goldman, Morgan Stanley and 15 other global banks on a ratings watch, saying that ''the combination of changed operating conditions and increased regulatory requirements and restrictions has diminished these firms' longer-term profitability and growth prospects.''
The Volcker Rule, to be sure, also has benefits for the large banks. The more complicated the Volcker Rule, the less regulators will be able to understand it, leaving the banks with more loopholes. In addition, the rule may pose a barrier to entry to some commercial banks that can't afford the sophisticated regulatory apparatus to comply with the rule.
But given the sums involved, the question is whether we have reached a breaking point. How will Goldman, Morgan and the other banks that depend on trading revenue try to reclaim their profits?
One possibility would be for the banks to stop being bank holding companies, a regulatory status they chose in order to survive the financial crisis.
Before the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act overturned the depression-era Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, the American financial system was divided between investment banks and commercial banks. The commercial banks were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and subject to heightened regulation to ensure the safety of their deposits.
In contrast, the five large investment banks - Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers - were not regulated as banks. In exchange for lighter regulation, the five investment banks financed themselves through the private markets and could not rely on the Federal Reserve for financing of their operations.
After Gramm-Leach-Bliley, the investment banks largely stayed unregulated while the commercial banks like Citigroup and Bank of America behaved more like investment banks, increasing their trading operations.
During the financial crisis, the old-style investment banking model fell apart. Lehman Brothers collapsed and Bear Stearns nearly so. Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America.
Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, took a life-saving investment from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, while Goldman took capital from Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Morgan and Goldman also elected to become bank holding companies and regulated as banks.
By the time the dust settled, all of the nation's banks now looked like commercial ones and the investment banking model was dead. Goldman and Morgan were now subject to stricter regulation and oversight. As the Volcker Rule looms, becoming a bank holding company has proved to be a Faustian bargain.
Still, the Volcker Rule is not all gloom and doom for everyone on Wall Street. It is actually a real-life experiment in market efficiency. If the Volcker Rule truly makes the cost of markets higher, then it will reduce the profits of the big banks.
But the Volcker Rule does not apply to private equity funds, hedge funds and smaller investment banks that do not themselves own banks.
So if the Volcker Rule is really a drag on the economy, hedge funds and smaller investment banks that are not subject to it may try to interject themselves and bridge the gap that the investment banks can no longer fill.
The latter-day MF Globals of the worlds - nonbank financial firms - will have an incentive to become the next Goldman or Morgan, though it is hoped with better luck than Jon S. Corzine's actual MF Global. These newcomers will not be burdened by the full application of the Dodd-Frank Act and can sidestep the Volcker Rule.
The possibility of a new firm emerging overnight to challenge the big banks is low, but markets move quickly and there are some big players who are capable of emerging in the coming years. The Blackstone Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and Apollo Global Management, for example, are turning themselves from private equity firms into general service investment managers and engaging in investment banking businesses. Whether it is private equity firms, smaller investment banks or a new operation, given the profits to be made, it is likely Wall Street will find a way to close this gap.
The Volcker Rule may thus in the long term create a divided world where the old investment banks are challenged by new upstarts who are not limited by this rule. If these new competitors arise, it may even be that Goldman and Morgan reach the breaking point and give up their bank holding company status, removing the Volcker Rule straitjacket. This would allow all of them to return to their old trading practices.
Technically, this is legally possible. Each of these banks would have to elect not to be treated as a commercial bank and dispose of any banking operations. Each would still be subject to regulation, but would rid itself of the Volcker Rule's restrictions on trading. But while this is technically possible, given the public mood right now, neither is likely to want to risk the public censure it would bring.
While the idea of Goldman, Morgan or even Merrill Lynch ridding itself of its bank holding company status seems far-fetched today, the idea of new investment banks emerging is not.
The Volcker Rule, for all its good intentions, may perhaps unleash a burst of rapid financial innovation to do something it never intended: recreating the prefinancial crisis division between investment banks and commercial banks.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Yemen Orchestrates an Election To Hasten the President's Exit

BYLINE: By LAURA KASINOF

 BODY:
SANA, Yemen -- Yemenis voted Tuesday in an election that was predetermined, with one candidate on the ballot for president. But the lack of choice did little to dim the palpable joy on the streets here where the vote meant the formal end of an autocrat's rule and the chance to move past a violent, yearlong political crisis.
The electoral exercise on Tuesday means that Ali Abdullah Saleh will no longer be Yemen's president after more than three decades in power. He is to be replaced by his loyal, longtime vice president, Abed Rabu Mansour Hadi, in a peaceful transfer of power orchestrated under pressure from Yemen's neighbors in the Persian Gulf region, and Western nations.
Mr. Saleh, who has recently been receiving medical treatment in New York after a failed assassination attempt last year, agreed to step down only after having turned his security forces on unarmed demonstrators calling for democracy, killing dozens and prompting some in the military to side with the opposition. It was a bloody conflict that damaged the economy while giving Al Qaeda an opportunity to expand its influence. So the vote was seen as a step forward. 
At one polling place here in the capital, five women, veiled in black from head to toe, waited patiently for their turn to vote. The air was quiet in the musty stone room where one by one they stepped up to a table to register their thumbprints and check a box on the white ballot slip.
''We all agree to Abed Rabu,'' said one of the women, who identified herself as Umm Abdullah, displaying her ink-stained thumb after she finishing voting. ''He is enough for us. We want to end this crisis.'' Outside the polling place, a group of men burst into patriotic songs.
Voter turnout appeared to be high here, as long lines wrapped outside polling places in schools and outside mosques. Sporadic gunfire was heard throughout the day in various neighborhoods of Aden, a southern port city, residents said. Seven people were killed by gunfire, including three government soldiers, according to local news reports.
Supporters of the president voted because the election was endorsed by Mr. Saleh, while the opposition's supporters voted to ensure Mr. Saleh's ouster. Whatever the motivation, for the first time in more than a year, the popular spirit was optimistic in this conflict-stricken capital where the sound of shelling used to echo every night.
The uprising here was not swift and triumphant like the revolutions of Tunisia or Egypt, or the all-out warfare of Libya and Syria. Rather, a slow-burning revolution of sit-ins, negotiations and international pressure has pushed out Mr. Saleh, making him the fourth Arab autocrat forced from power in the wave of popular uprisings that continue to roil the region.
Yemen was not without violence, though, as powerful allies of Mr. Saleh decided to take up arms against him and supported the protest movement calling for his ouster, eventually fracturing the government and forcing Mr. Saleh to enter into negotiations over his exit strategy. An agreement that gave Mr. Saleh immunity from prosecution contributed to a resolution.
''The change that has taken place was not a voluntary change, for sure,'' said Abdel-Karim al-Iryani, a former prime minister under Mr. Saleh who still acts as an adviser to the president. ''The spearhead of the change, despite what the situation might be now, was the youth protesters.''
The end of Mr. Saleh's rule does not yet put Yemen on the road to democracy, though. Mr. Saleh is most likely to return to Sana and will retain considerable influence, through the prominence of his family and tribe, which have dominated the Yemeni military for the past three decades. Mr. Saleh ruled Yemen as if he were a tribal sheik, pitting different players against one another and using the resources of the state -- jobs and money -- to win allies. Cronyism substituted for the rule of law, and little effort was put into building the infrastructure required for a stable state. All authority in the country had been consolidated in the Saleh presidency.
But Mr. Saleh's influence will be weakened when Mr. Hadi, a southerner, takes over.
''The political stage is wide open to create a new political system,'' Mr. Iryani said. ''That new political system cannot be the same as it was before. There is a consensus that the dominance of the military and tribal sheiks that has controlled the stage is now no longer acceptable.''
Mr. Hadi's role as president is to lead a transition to a more democratic system. After he formally takes power, the ruling and opposition parties intend to begin a national dialogue to draw up a new constitution. Previous efforts to do so ground to a halt, and even with Mr. Saleh gone, all parties may not be willing to participate. That may be especially true of the Houthi rebels who control Saada Province in the north and the southern separatist leaders, many of whom are living in exile.
Others are worried that Mr. Hadi will remain loyal to Mr. Saleh.
''He will play according to Saleh's rule,'' said Abdel Kader al-Guneid, a well-connected opposition supporter in Taiz. ''His pocket is full. He has no power base, but the ambassadors and the opposition stand behind him nicely.'' But Mr. Guneid added that voter turnout in Taiz was very high because ''people want to see the back of Ali Abdullah Saleh.''
The United States ambassador to Yemen, Gerald M. Feierstein, said that Mr. Saleh's political future was uncertain.
''If he is running things from behind the scenes, it's because the new government has not asserted itself,'' the ambassador said. ''What we want to see is see this government develop and take on their full role and responsibilities. That will eliminate the potential or people from outside the government to interfere.''
As soon as the ballots are tallied, Mr. Hadi will be sworn in as president of the Republic of Yemen, probably next week. Yemeni officials say that Mr. Saleh will return to Yemen this week.
The leader of Yemen's Socialist Party, Yassin Saeed Noman, who played an active role in the negotiations between the ruling party and opposition over the past year, warned of the uphill battle for the new government.
''Hadi will face a lot of problems, you see, not just because it's Hadi, but any person would,'' he said. ''He has to face very complicated issues.''
Yet despite his worries, Mr. Noman still sounded brighter than he had all year.
''This is the first such experiment in the past 33 years, so let us be optimistic,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Sonic Drive-In Revives 'Out of Work' Spokesmen

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
WITH the unemployment rate above 8 percent, Americans are taking extreme measures to get hired -- even, apparently, brand spokesmen.
T. J. Jagodowski and Peter Grosz, who starred in humorous and largely improvised ads for Sonic Drive-In from 2002 to 2010, appear in about a dozen videos uploaded to YouTube over the last few weeks.
Proclaiming to be commercials produced by the two, the videos include such mishaps as the spokesmen promoting popcorn chicken in a car overrun by live chickens. 
''We want our old jobs back,'' explains a Facebook page featuring the two. ''Now we make our own commercial-things without permission from the man.''
A Web site features a petition for consumers to sign that demands their return. The effort culminated with a commercial that was posted to YouTube on Tuesday and which will go on the air this Monday. ''Hey there, America,'' Mr. Grosz begins in the ad. ''You may remember us as the two guys who used to be in all those Sonic commercials.''
Mr. Jagodowski says, ''But then they phased us out.''
''So we decided to go rogue and make our own commercials,'' Mr. Grosz continues.
After a montage from the online videos, they triumphantly reveal they have been rehired, and the commercial closes with the screen text, ''The two guys are back.''
It turns out, however, that this was not really a job-seeking effort by the spokesmen but a publicity stunt by the brand.
After Sonic decided to bring back the spokesmen, ''we sort of imagined that they could pester the company to get their jobs back,'' said Jeff Goodby, co-chairman and creative director of Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group, which produced the commercials and the online videos.
The spokesmen were originally cast by Barkley in Kansas City, Mo., when it was the agency of record for Sonic. They ''were put away a little too early because if they stayed around they really would have come into their own in the social media context,'' Mr. Goodby said.
Character-driven viral campaigns often owe much of their success to YouTube. For example, Old Spice commercials and online-only videos featuring Isaiah Mustafa have attracted nearly 200 million views.
The fictional effort of the spokesmen to get their jobs back served as a premise to set up Facebook and Twitter accounts and a YouTube channel on their behalf, and all will now be repurposed to promote the characters and Sonic.
While the job-seeking premise might strike a chord with the ranks of the unemployed, Mr. Goodby said that was not the impetus.
''It wasn't intended to resonate in that way,'' Mr. Goodby said.
But Darren Tristano, an executive vice president of Technomic, a food industry consulting and market research firm, said consumers still are apt to identify with the idea of seeking employment.
''So many Americans are underemployed or unemployed that I think that's how we are going to relate to these guys,'' Mr. Tristano said. ''It may be more subliminal but it's going to be effective.''
Originally named Top Hat Drive-In, Sonic began in Shawnee, Okla., in 1953 and now has more than 3,500 locations in 43 states.
Customers order over microphones in individual parking spaces, and carhops -- typically on roller skates -- deliver the food. Naturally the highest concentration of restaurants is in warmer states including Texas, and, according to the company, the busiest month tends to be May, the slowest January.
Revenues of both company- and franchised-owned restaurants totaled about $3.6 billion in 2011, which made Sonic the fourth-largest fast-food chain, behind McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's.
The company spent $122.5 million on advertising in 2010 and $104.9 million in the first nine months of 2011, according to the most recent data available from the Kantar Media unit of WPP.
In late January, Sonic got an unexpected jolt of publicity when Giorgio Fareira, a folk singer, was in a car with friends when they pulled into a Sonic in Connecticut. Mr. Fareira, who was in the passenger seat and happened to have his guitar, decided on the spot to sing the order into the microphone to a good-humored Sonic employee, while a friend in the backseat with an iPhoneshot a video, which she posted on YouTube.
Versions of that video drew more than two million views. (''If this music video doesn't make you happy and hungry,'' advises a post about it on the Web site Gizmodo, ''you are dead inside.'') While brands occasionally disapprove of unauthorized content on YouTube, Sonic embraced Mr. Fareira, and through its public relations agency helped the singer get booked on the ''The Ellen DeGeneres Show'' on Feb. 14.
''We all got a big kick out of it right off the bat,'' said J. Clifford Hudson, chief executive of Sonic. ''Now we're really kind of helping evolve his career a little bit further.''
As for the spokesmen, neither had expected to be returning to Sonic. Mr. Grosz previously worked as a writer for ''The Colbert Report'' and currently appears on NPR's ''Wait Wait ... Don't Tell Me!'' as a panelist. Mr. Jagodowski performs improvisational comedy frequently in Chicago.
''We both thought that it had been a really nice and enjoyable run but that it was done,'' Mr. Jagodowski said.
Mr. Grosz, who said income from the commercials is primarily what paid for his home in Los Angeles, had been pleased when the previous campaign kept getting renewed year after year.
''At first it was gravy, and then it was a cherry on the top of the gravy,'' said Mr. Grosz. ''A lot of times, if you get paid it's for really soul-sucking things, but I'm proud of what we're doing with Sonic.''

HEADLINE: Cuba's Housing Revival

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Havana Journal about Cuba's real estate boom (''Cuba Unleashes the Pent-Up Energy of Real Estate Dreams,'' Feb. 16) did not mention perhaps the most important cause of our neighboring country's dilapidated housing stock: the scarcity and inflated prices of building materials caused by the United States' economic blockade. 
Cuba has to go to suppliers half way around the world to get paint, wall board, lumber and plumbing fixtures. I know that our unemployed manufacturing workers would welcome the chance to provide those products.
Ending the ridiculous and spiteful blockade could be a win-win for both new Cuban homeowners and American workers.

HEADLINE: Consumer Inquiry Focuses On Bank Overdraft Fees

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is beginning an inquiry into how banks levy overdraft fees they charge customers who bounce checks or withdraw more than they have in their accounts using debit cards or automated teller machines, the head of the agency said Tuesday.
Richard Cordray, the director of the bureau, said the inquiry would focus on whether some banks misled consumers in 2010 when they put in place new Federal Reserve regulations for overdraft protection. The agency will try to determine whether banks routinely reorder customer transactions to maximize potential overdrafts, and will seek data on the effect of overdraft fees on young and low-income bank customers. 
Coming a little more than a year and a half after the Federal Reserve issued a new set of regulations governing overdraft rules for banks that issue A.T.M. and debit cards, the renewed scrutiny is unlikely to please bankers, many of whom are already wary of the regulatory burden they say the consumer bureau is likely to impose on banks.
In a speech on Wednesday to bankers and consumer advocates at the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College in Manhattan, Mr. Cordray plans to announce that the consumer bureau will request data from banks about practices and from consumers about their experiences with overdraft fees and protection.
''Overdraft practices have the capacity to inflict serious economic harm on the people who can least afford it,'' Mr. Cordray will say, according to an excerpt of his prepared remarks made available on Tuesday. ''We want to learn how consumers are affected and how well they are able to anticipate and avoid paying late fees.''
Among the topics for additional study is whether banks commingle all of a customer's daily business and process the largest transactions first, which could maximize the number of transactions that set off an overdraft fee, agency officials said.
The consumer bureau says the inquiry is a fact-finding exercise rather than an investigation of allegations of wrongdoing. But it could lead to new rules being issued by the bureau, which last year took over the regulation of consumer banking. That job previously was spread among several agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
Already, the bureau has devised a model of what it calls a ''penalty fee box,'' a notification that would appear prominently on checking account statements of customers who have overdrawn their account, detailing what fees were assessed.
In addition to public feedback on the penalty fee box, the agency plans to seek information to back up anecdotal reports it has received of misleading marketing of the Federal Reserve regulations that went into effect in July 2010.
Those regulations required that consumers opt in for banking services that provide overdraft protection for A.T.M. and debit card transactions. The consumer bureau has found that opt-in rates differ significantly among banks, raising questions about how banks presented choices about the new rules to consumers.
Jurisdiction over that regulation transferred to the consumer bureau in October. But the American Bankers Association has already told officials there that different banking regulators have continued to enforce on banks ''a diversity of expectations'' about overdraft practices, said Richard Riese, senior vice president for regulatory compliance at the bankers association.
When the Federal Reserve's guidelines were completed in 2010, ''our members all had the expectation that they were investing in something that would be settled,'' Mr. Riese said. But a month after those regulations took effect, the F.D.I.C. proposed further overdraft rules, he said. The association is preparing a comment letter to the consumer bureau about ''the type of burden that comes from a lack of regulatory uniformity,'' Mr. Riese added.

HEADLINE: Egypt's Step Backward

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Sadly, the transitional government in Egypt today appears determined to shoot itself in both feet.
On Sunday, it will put on trial 43 people, including at least 16 U.S. citizens, for allegedly bringing unregistered funds into Egypt to promote democracy without a license. Egypt has every right to control international organizations operating within its borders. But the truth is that when these democracy groups filed their registration papers years ago under the autocracy of Hosni Mubarak, they were informed that the papers were in order and that approval was pending. The fact that now -- after Mubarak has been deposed by a revolution -- these groups are being threatened with jail terms for promoting democracy without a license is a very disturbing sign. It tells you how incomplete the ''revolution'' in Egypt has been and how vigorously the counter-revolutionary forces are fighting back. 
This sordid business makes one weep and wonder how Egypt will ever turn the corner. Egypt is running out of foreign reserves, its currency is falling, inflation is rising and unemployment is rampant. Yet the priority of a few retrograde Mubarak holdovers is to put on trial staffers from the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, which are allied with the two main U.S. political parties, as well as from Freedom House and some European groups. Their crime was trying to teach Egypt's young democrats how to monitor elections and start parties to engage in the very democratic processes that the Egyptian Army set up after Mubarak's fall. Thousands of Egyptians had participated in their seminars in recent years.
What is this really about? This case has been trumped up by Egypt's minister of planning and international cooperation, Fayza Abul Naga, an old Mubarak crony. Abul Naga personifies the worst tendency in Egypt over the last 50 years -- the tendency that helps to explain why Egypt has fallen so far behind its peers: South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brazil, India and China. It is the tendency to look for dignity in all the wrong places -- to look for dignity not by building up the capacity of Egypt's talented young people so they can thrive in the 21st century -- with better schools, better institutions, export industries and more accountable government. No, it is the tendency to go for dignity on the cheap ''by standing up to the foreigners.''
That is Abul Naga's game. As a former Mubarak adviser put it to me: ''Abul Naga is where she is today because for six years she was resisting the economic and political reforms'' in alliance with the military. ''Both she and the military were against opening up the Egyptian economy.'' Both she and the military, having opposed the revolution, are now looking to save themselves by playing the nationalist card.
Egypt today has only two predators: poverty and illiteracy. After 30 years of Mubarak rule and some $50 billion in U.S. aid, 33 percent of men and 56 percent of women in Egypt still can't read or write. That is a travesty. But that apparently does not keep Abul Naga up at night.
What is her priority? Is it to end illiteracy? Is it to articulate a new vision about how Egypt can engage with the world and thrive in the 21st century? Is it to create a positive climate for foreign investors to create jobs desperately needed by young Egyptians? No, it's to fall back on that golden oldie -- that all of Egypt's problems are the fault of outsiders who want to destabilize Egypt. So let's jail some Western democracy consultants. That will restore Egypt's dignity.
The Times reported from Cairo that the prosecutor's dossier assembled against the democracy workers -- bolstered by Abul Naga's testimony -- accused these democracy groups of working ''in coordination with the C.I.A.,'' serving ''U.S. and Israeli interests'' and inciting ''religious tensions between Muslims and Copts.'' Their goal, according to the dossier, was: ''Bringing down the ruling regime in Egypt, no matter what it is,'' while ''pandering to the U.S. Congress, Jewish lobbyists and American public opinion.''
Amazing. What Abul Naga is saying to all those young Egyptians who marched, protested and died in Tahrir Square in order to gain a voice in their own future is: ''You were just the instruments of the C.I.A., the U.S. Congress, Israel and the Jewish lobby. They are the real forces behind the Egyptian revolution -- not brave Egyptians with a will of their own.''
Not surprisingly, some members of the U.S. Congress are talking about cutting off the $1.3 billion in aid the U.S. gives Egypt's army if these Americans are actually thrown in prison. Hold off on that. We have to be patient and see this for what, one hopes, it really is: Fayza's last dance. It is elements of the old regime playing the last cards they have to both undermine the true democratic forces in Egypt and to save themselves by posing as protectors of Egypt's honor.
Egyptians deserve better than this crowd, which is squandering Egypt's dwindling resources at a critical time and diverting attention from the real challenge facing the country: giving Egypt's young people what they so clearly hunger for -- a real voice in their own future and the educational tools they need to succeed in the modern world. That's where lasting dignity comes from.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Man Killed Girlfriend With Car, Authorities Say

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
FORT LEE, N.J. (AP) -- A man angry that his girlfriend was trying to break up with him struck her with his car and repeatedly drove over her body, prosecutors said Tuesday in charging him with murder. 
The man, Charles Ann, 26, had been dating Aena Hong, 25, for about a year, and the pair had a tumultuous relationship, said John Molinelli, the Bergen County prosecutor.
Witnesses told the police they saw a woman on foot arguing with the driver of a 2011 Hyundai Sonata at about 5 p.m. on Monday in this northern New Jersey borough next to the George Washington Bridge, directly across the Hudson River from Manhattan.
The driver of the car headed away from the woman, turned around, rapidly accelerated and hit her as she was crossing an intersection, witnesses said. The driver then drove back and forth over the woman's body three times, investigators said.
Ms. Hong, who lived in Fort Lee, was pronounced dead at a hospital. The police found the Hyundai Sonata, registered to Mr. Ann, in Fort Lee a few hours later.
Mr. Ann, who is unemployed, was arrested at 4 a.m. on Tuesday at a friend's apartment in Flushing, Queens.
Mr. Ann, a native of South Korea, came to the United States in 2009 and is a naturalized United States citizen who lives in Fort Lee, the authorities said. He was carrying a large amount of cash and his passport when he was arrested, leading investigators to believe that he might have been preparing to flee the country, Mr. Molinelli said.
Mr. Ann was being held in $3 million bail and was awaiting extradition to New Jersey. It was unclear if he had a lawyer.

HEADLINE: Generating High-Tech Ideas Ensconced in Historic Stamford

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE NEGRONI

 BODY:
STAMFORD, Conn. -- The old Town Hall here, a Beaux-Arts building on the National Registry of Historic Places, has sat unused for 25 years, a victim of Stamford's rapid growth in the 20th century. But the Town Hall will join the 21st-century economy, with the announcement this month that it would become an incubator for business start-ups in a 10-year lease agreement with private investors.
The Stamford Innovation Center, as the venture is called, is expected to open by summer, and aspiring entrepreneurs will get work space, mentoring and access to investors. 
Acting as a corporate sponsor for the venture will be Sikorsky Aircraft, the helicopter maker and military contractor based in nearby Stratford, Conn. The company, a subsidiary of United Technologies, has leased 2,000 square feet on the building's second floor, and will coach tenants and may even invest in them, said Chris Van Buiten, the vice president for Sikorsky Innovations, a network of employees focused on finding new technologies.
Sikorsky is priming the pump by issuing five technological challenges to the public that, on the surface, are aviation related. It is seeking proposals on, among other things, ways to apply wireless monitoring to digitized aircraft and to obscure the visibility of airplanes in flight. Successful applicants will have use of the company's space at the Town Hall for a year.
''In much the same way that Sikorsky does not make the engines or avionics that are installed into our helicopters,'' Mr. Van Buiten said, ''likewise will some next-generation technology solutions not be produced by us.''
The Stamford Innovation Center is renting most of the old Town Hall from the city. The Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development provided a half-million-dollar loan to turn the building into modern office space.
In 2008 the city began renovating the Town Hall, with the hope of finding a tenant. It spent $16 million enlarging the space and making it handicapped-accessible. Patty Meagher, a founder of the Innovation Center, remembers the time she and the others involved with the project first considered leasing the building as the work was completed in 2010. ''Remember the line from that movie, 'You had me at hello'? That was the initial reaction,'' she said when they first saw the limestone facade, iron-railed staircase, terrazzo floors and brilliant murals on the walls of several rooms.
The location was also an asset, she said, in the shadow of Stamford Town Center mall, steps from the city's library, theater, shopping and dining districts.
There are no restrictions on the kinds of ideas that will be considered for the center, so long as the directors believe there is potential for turning them into successful businesses. A few start-ups are already working in the building on projects as varied as a GPS-enabled community news site and the use of cloned immune cells for medicine.
As fledgling businesses develop, tenants will be introduced to venture capitalists, many of whom live or work in the area, Ms. Meagher said. The investors and entrepreneurs, she said, ''will be meeting each other, interacting, and that's how these companies could very well get funded.''
Business incubators are very of-the-moment across the country. In Chandler, Ariz., the City Council financed a biotechnology-themed center, while a center in Portland, Ore., focuses on sustainability. Nearly three-quarters of these enterprises are sponsored by economic development agencies, governments or academic institutions, according to the National Business Incubation Association. The Stamford Innovation Center is among the 25 percent that are private, with aspirations to become profitable businesses based on rents charged to tenants and educational programs offered to the public.
Over the last five years there have been 150 incubation centers opened nationwide, the association said. While no studies cite the recession as motivating that growth, Linda Knopp, the group's research and policy director, said she believed the economy played a role. ''More communities at least start considering the business incubation concept during economic downturns,'' she said, ''as they're looking for ways to stimulate economic growth and create jobs.''
Certainly that is the goal in Stamford, with a population of 122,643, which has an unemployment rate of 7.1 percent, lower than the state and the nation as a whole, but which has lost jobs in the financial and manufacturing sectors and has had an increase in office vacancies. One quarter of the city's 13 million feet of business space is unoccupied, said Laure Aubuchon, the director of the Stamford Office of Economic Development.
''We are a victim of our own success, because we keep building space,'' Ms. Aubuchon said. But she said the upside is that when the entrepreneurs are ready to start their businesses they will be able to find affordable rents in Stamford.
Sikorsky has set a goal of incubating at least two viable companies a year. Barry Schwimmer, a founder of the Innovation Center who is managing the opening, said Sikorsky was setting an example that he hoped other large companies would follow.
''It is a fairly unique model,'' he said, adding that such communication between large, established businesses and small, untested ones was ''virtually unheard-of.''
What is developed here will most likely have wider applications, Mr. Van Buiten of Sikorsky said. He offered the example of paint that changes color on a military helicopter, which could also be sold to the automobile industry. ''We'd be willing to spend a lot of money,'' he said of a product like that. ''But think of how that would appeal to teenagers if a car company could offer that kind of paint on a Scion at $1,500.''

PERSON: Amalia de Fortabat 

HEADLINE: Amalia de Fortabat, 90, Dies; Noted for Art and Scandal

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat, who vaulted to fame after her scandalous marriage to a cement tycoon, then expanded his empire after his death and became a major art collector and philanthropist as well as the richest woman in Argentina, died on Saturday at her home in Buenos Aires. She was 90.
Her family announced her death. 
Mrs. Fortabat was married to another man when the cement mogul Alfredo Fortabat, 27 years her senior and also married, asked her to dance. As he recounted the story to biographers, he had followed her to Paris from Argentina to ask that question. She said yes. He told her he loved her. They traveled through France, Italy and the Aegean. He asked her to marry him. She said yes again.
The romance was the talk of Buenos Aires. Soon, two divorces ensued, at a time when that was not easily done in heavily Roman Catholic Argentina. They were married in Uruguay in 1947 and reaffirmed their vows in ceremonies four more times.
Mr. Fortabat died of a stroke in 1976 at the age of 81, leaving Mrs. Fortabat with a cement conglomerate, more than a million acres of ranchland, 170,000 head of cattle, three airplanes, a helicopter, a yacht and real estate around the world, including a 14-room duplex in the Pierre hotel in Manhattan.
After a period of mourning, Mrs. Fortabat went to work managing the company, Loma Negra, Argentina's biggest supplier of cement and concrete. She became known as the ''Dama del Cemento'' -- the cement lady. She won government contracts from the military dictatorship of the 1970s to build dams, roads and stadiums while tripling the company's assets. Before long it had captured three-quarters of the nation's cement business.
''I went to work as if I understood everything,'' she said. ''And, finally, I understood very well.''
She amassed a fortune estimated at $1.8 billion, though America Economia, a Latin American business magazine, now lists it as $902 million. Still, it made her the third-richest person in Argentina and the richest woman there at her death.
As a businesswoman, she diversified into fields like banks, a newspaper, a radio station and an 1,800-mile railroad. As a volunteer public servant, she was appointed Argentina's roving ambassador-at-large and president of the National Arts Foundation. As a philanthropist, she gave many millions to various causes, including the arts, the veterans of Argentina's war with England over the Falkland Islands and refugees from the war in Kosovo in 1999. As a socialite in Argentina, New York and Europe, she was often photographed with friends like David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger.
As a patron of the arts, Mrs. Fortabat paid $6.4 million in 1980 for J. M. W. Turner's painting ''Juliet and Her Nurse,'' at the time a record price for a painting sold at auction. In 2008, she built Museo Fortabat, a modernist museum in Buenos Aires designed by Rafael Vinoly to house her large and much admired art collection. It includes a portrait Andy Warhol did of her in the style of his Marilyn Monroe prints.
Maria Amalia Lacroze de los Reyes Oribe was born in Buenos Aires on Aug. 15, 1921. Her grandfather had established the city's first streetcar line, and an ancestor was the first president of Uruguay. Known as Amalita, she moved to Paris when she was a year old. Her first language was French, and her second was English. When she was 14, she said, a fortuneteller revealed her future: ''You'll marry a maharaja.''
In 1942 she married a lawyer, Hernan Saenz Valiente Lafuente. They had a daughter, Maria Inez de Lafuente, who survives her, along with three grandchildren.
Amalita was at the theater with Mr. Lafuente, her fiance at the time, when she met Mr. Fortabat in 1941. He invited them to sail on his yacht, the Tigre Fortabat, but said he could not bear to go to their wedding. Five years later he followed the couple to Paris to ask Mr. Lafuente's wife to dance.
In recent years, Mrs. Fortabat had respiratory problems and repeated hip replacements. In 2002, she sold some paintings, including a Degas for $16.5 million. She sold the cement company to a Brazilian buyer for $1.025 billion in 2005. Last year, she sold the duplex at the Pierre for $19.5 million.
For all the uproar that her divorce and marriage caused in the 1940s, Mrs. Fortabat was scandalized herself in 1997 during a literary contest that her Fortabat Foundation was sponsoring. A jury had decided to give the prize to ''The Anatomist'' (1998), a novel by Federico Andahazi that tells of a scientist who studies clitorises, first by examining corpses, then prostitutes. Mrs. Fortabat did not approve.
She bought a newspaper ad saying the subject matter did not ''contribute to the exaltation of the highest values of the human spirit.'' In the end, she agreed to give Mr. Andahazi the $15,000 award that went with the prize but not the prize itself.
Mr. Andahazi, who is also from Argentina, said he had chuckled at first but then felt something else, telling The New York Times, ''Being pitted against the most powerful woman in Argentina sent a shudder down my spine.''

HEADLINE: Tax-Cut Bill Includes Updates To Jobless Benefits System

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Tucked into a $140 billion bill extending emergency jobless benefits and a temporary cut to payroll taxes are several provisions intended to modernize the country's outdated unemployment insurance system.
Experts described the little-noticed changes as marginal improvements, but important ones, and said they promised to aid the long-term jobless and help hold down the unemployment rate in future recessions.
''We've had the same unemployment insurance system since the 1930s, and it really was designed for a different time,'' Alan B. Krueger, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview. ''Most people on unemployment insurance back then had been temporarily laid off from manufacturing jobs. Obviously, that's not true now -- these are people who are often moving into a whole new industry.'' 
The bill, which passed Congress on Friday and President Obama has said he will sign, allows states to use unemployment insurance money for programs that help move the jobless back into the work force. Such programs, like Georgia Works, often offer employers wage subsidies for taking on and retraining jobless workers.
The bill also requires states to reassess the eligibility of workers for their unemployment insurance -- confirming, for instance, that a person receiving long-term benefits is actively searching for a job. That reassessment provides an opportunity to tailor career counseling and other re-employment services to the long-term jobless.
The bill additionally expands ''work sharing'' programs that can help reduce layoffs at big businesses. In effect, businesses would have the option of cutting the hours of five workers by 20 percent each, say, rather than laying off one worker. The business could then use unemployment insurance money to help supplement the workers' wages to make up for the lost hours.
The changes were a product of intense partisan wrangling, but have won bipartisan support since the bill's passage. Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and one of the bill's primary negotiators, described the reforms as ''historic'' in a statement, saying that the changes would ''help the unemployed get the training and resources they need to move from an unemployment check to a paycheck.''
Many conservative economists and research groups have applauded modernizing the unemployment insurance system and reorienting it toward helping jobless workers find new employment through the kinds of provisions included in the bill.
President Obama, who has repeatedly called for turning the unemployment insurance system into a ''re-employment insurance'' system, also described the ''important reforms'' as a victory on Tuesday.
Experts doubt that the changes will do much to wrench down the current unemployment rate or solve the long-term unemployment crisis. Only strong economic and jobs growth will do that, they said. But they said that the new provisions could help encourage employers to hire some of the 43 percent of unemployed workers who have been out of a job for more than six months. Moreover, the changes could help to reduce layoffs down the road.
Work force experts say the current unemployment insurance system does little to help workers search for jobs, or to consider new industries or acquire new skills, if need be.
''Today, our re-employment services mostly happen online or on the phone, and in groups,'' said George Wentworth, a senior staff attorney with the National Employment Law Project. ''Twenty-five years ago, you actually had hands-on assistance,'' he added.
Mr. Wentworth said the new provisions to assess the needs of long-term unemployed workers might help some of them expand their job searches. ''If they're someone who's holding out for a specific industry or occupation, there will be someone to point out that the demand is not there, and to help them broaden their expectations.''
Economists also applauded the work-sharing provisions, which have found success in states including Connecticut and Rhode Island as well as in countries like Germany.
''Work sharing is an incredibly smart thing to do,'' said Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute, a research institution in Washington. ''But it's a tragedy that we didn't do that on a large scale over the past four years.''
The provision may help reduce layoffs in the coming years, Ms. Shierholz said, supporting the recovery. She also said that being laid off tended to hurt a worker's earnings and career prospects down the road. Work-sharing helps to minimize economic pain and keep families afloat, she said.
The bill maintains a two-percentage-point payroll tax cut for 160 million wage-earners through the end of 2012. It also keeps additional weeks of unemployment insurance for the long-term jobless, though it starts to taper the maximum weeks of benefits to 73 from 99. Additionally, it prevents a sharp drop in reimbursement rates for doctors who accept Medicare.
The bill contains other changes to the unemployment insurance system, as well. It allows states to screen and test unemployment insurance recipients for drug abuse, in certain cases. But it does not require people receiving unemployment insurance to enroll in a high school equivalency program, as some politicians had suggested.
The White House has previously called for a much broader range of policies to aid the long-term unemployed and help American workers upgrade their skills, including the American Jobs Act released in the fall.
''My message to Congress is: Don't stop here, keep going,'' Mr. Obama said Tuesday, calling on Congress to keep passing provisions to aid workers.

HEADLINE: Medtronic's Results Continue to Slide

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Medtronic reported disappointing quarterly results on Tuesday, reflecting continued weak demand for its implantable heart defibrillators and spine products, two of its leading products. 
The company said sales in each of those units fell 9 percent in the period, showing no improvement from poor performances that have lasted several years.
Medtronic's business has been hurt by a series of setbacks, most recently the weak global economy, which has pressured governments to cut health care spending and has kept patients out of the doctor's office.
''The year-over-year decline is not sustainable. We urgently need to see signs of improvement'' in Medtronic's spine business, the chief executive, Omar Ishrak, told analysts on a conference call.
If no improvement is accomplished, he added, ''we will need to assess our strategy and approach to this business.'' Mr. Ishrak said options included internal alternatives, meaning that the company would not necessarily try to sell the unit.
Stock in Medtronic, which is based in Minneapolis, fell 95 cents, to $38.99 a share.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Mayor Sets Sights On a Bigger Democratic Stage

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Antonio R. Villaraigosa was elected mayor of this city in 2005 on a wave of excitement that began collapsing within two years, as he confessed to an extramarital affair with a television reporter, struggled to run City Hall amid an economic downturn and disappointed supporters who thought he was drawn to the glamour, rather than the grit, of the job.
''Failure: so much promise, so much disappointment,'' proclaimed a Los Angeles Magazine cover article in 2009. The same magazine had hailed his election three years earlier with the headline ''Pop star mayor.''
But last week, Mr. Villaraigosa could be found next to President Obama here, as Mr. Obama announced him as chairman of the Democratic National Convention. The next day, he played host to Xi Jinping, the Chinese vice president, at a luncheon and a Lakers' game. 
And these days, analysts say that for all his early troubles, Mr. Villaraigosa is building a record on crime, mass transit expansion and the environment that, if short of the original promise of his mayoralty, is substantial and is positioning him for advancement.
''I'll acknowledge there have been big challenges over the years,'' Mr. Villaraigosa said in an hourlong interview in his office at City Hall one recent morning, putting at the top of that list his failed marriage and the economic downturn that pounded the city. ''But I was persistent and dogged in what I tried to do.''
With a little more than one year left in the final term in office for Mr. Villaraigosa, a reappraisal of him is under way amid signs that he is orchestrating a shift in his political fortunes. Mr. Villaraigosa's name has returned to the small list of next-generation Democrats who have been waiting in the wings as members of the old guard of California politics move closer to retirement.
''There are plenty of people in L.A. who aren't going to feel great about him personally -- that's always going to be true,'' said Raphael J. Sonenshein, the head of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles. ''But he's really made a comeback that will pay off in a statewide race. He has politically recovered in a lot of ways.''
Maria Elena Durazo, the executive secretary treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, A.F.L.-C.I.O., said that when the mayor took office, ''he jumped in, he tried to do a bunch of different things. Some panned out, some didn't.''
''In the last year, I think he's settled down to become much more thoughtful,'' she said. ''The ideas that he's pushing forward, he's really been focused on them. Maybe he learned some stuff from the first few years.''
None of which is to say that Mr. Villaraigosa has recaptured the electric popularity that he enjoyed in the flush of his initial election, as a mayor of Mexican descent in a city with a vibrant and expanding population of Mexican-Americans. (He was its first Latino mayor in more than a century.) When his convention appointment was announced, a group of city workers that has battled with the mayor responded on its Twitter account: ''Can this genius really be advancing politically after the disaster he has been to Los Angeles?''
One of the people seeking to succeed him, Austin Beutner, whom Mr. Villaraigosa appointed as his first deputy mayor, has been sharply critical of ''the barnyard called City Hall,'' as he describes his former place of work.
For his part, Mr. Villaraigosa, in the interview, argued that he had repaired much of the damage he caused with the affair, but he also attributed many of his difficulties to an economy that had forced a retrenchment and layoffs.
Asked to list the disappointments of the past seven years, Mr. Villaraigosa, characteristically, pushed aside the query to respond with a detailed list of what he viewed as under-recognized accomplishments: crime rates at record lows, a rollback of gang activity, a $40 billion mass transit system financed by a half-cent tax he helped persuade voters to pass, and tough environmental regulations.
While there may be some dispute as to how much credit Mr. Villaraigosa deserves for all that -- crime is going down across the country -- it is a more substantive record than he would have been able to boast about a few years ago.
''People miss a lot of Antonio's accomplishments and also overestimate the ability of the mayor to fix the problems in his midst,'' said Peter Dreier, a political science professor at Occidental College. ''He's been governing at a time when it's almost impossible to be a successful mayor. But he's been as successful as one can hope for.''
That said, Mr. Villaraigosa's centerpiece pledge to take over the Los Angeles schools, as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg did in New York, was blocked. His promise to plant a million trees has been the subject of mockery. His staff has been plagued by turnover. And traffic is, perhaps, marginally better, if that.
The mayor was, as usual, dapperly attired but looked fatigued, with lines on his face that were not there seven years ago. Even on this busy day, Mr. Villaraigosa, who has made little secret of his distaste for the way his tenure has been portrayed here, was clearing time to give media interviews and was doing his best to control how they turned out. ''Can you use this quote?'' he said at several times.
There are some obvious echoes between the tenures of Mr. Villaraigosa and Mr. Obama. Both are evocative politicians who were viewed as symbols of changing racial attitudes. Both raised hope particularly on the left. Both paid a price of having to deliver on those expectations during a tough economy. The mayor noted some of those parallels when pressed about criticism of his tenure.
''You hear the same criticism of the president,'' he said. ''I think that happens if you run a campaign of hope and promise.''
Yet, as Mr. Villaraigosa acknowledged, at least some of his problems were the result of his own behavior, starting with the affair with a reporter who covered him. ''I think that disappointed a lot of people,'' he said. ''I think that was probably the biggest thing. People just felt let down. I had to work to regain their trust.''
Beyond that, his mayor-about-town style, which might have worked in New York, seemed jarring in a city more accustomed to ostentation in Hollywood than City Hall, particularly after he was fined for accepting free tickets to 34 concerts and basketball games. ''Some people get nervous because they think I'm too open,'' he said. ''I'll get up and dance. I'll play the congas at a party. I walk that red carpet, and I'm comfortable. I'm comfortable in the poorest communities. I'm comfortable in a black church.''
To no small extent, whatever new stature Mr. Villaraigosa may enjoy is a result of his turning his attention beyond Los Angeles and to the national stage, much the way a president struggling domestically might arrange an overseas trip. Even before his appointment as head of the convention, he was named the head of the United States Conference of Mayors, and in that position he has been a regular figure on national television as he pressed for cutting military spending and sending money to cities, particularly for mass transit programs.
''You have to respect his political skills,'' Mr. Sonenshein said. ''But I think his political skills are such that they sometimes cause less recognition for his substantive skills than is fair. If you see the politician all the time, you don't see the mayor. I think that's a source of frustration.''

HEADLINE: In G.O.P. Race, A New Breed Of Superdonor

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE, MICHAEL LUO and MIKE McINTIRE; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Last June, Harold C. Simmons, a wealthy Texas businessman, sent a $100,000 check to Americans for Rick Perry, a ''super PAC'' preparing for Mr. Perry's entry into the presidential race. A few months later, he donated $1 million to a different pro-Perry group through his company. In December, as Mr. Perry's fortunes waned, Mr. Simmons wrote another check, this one for $500,000, to Winning Our Future, a super PAC supporting Newt Gingrich.
But Mr. Simmons was not done. In mid-January, as Mr. Gingrich was headed toward a victory in the South Carolina primary, Mr. Simmons wrote a $100,000 check to Restore Our Future, the super PAC supporting Mitt Romney. And toward the end of the month, as Restore Our Future used his money to help bludgeon Mr. Gingrich with attack ads in Florida, Mr. Simmons sent yet another $500,000 check to Mr. Gingrich's super PAC.
''He generally supports conservative Republican candidates,'' said Chuck McDonald, a spokesman for Mr. Simmons. ''I assume he was just trying to be helpful.'' 
Mr. Simmons's contributions -- all told, he has given more than $14 million to Republican super PACs so far this cycle -- make him the exemplar of a new breed of superdonor in presidential politics. About two dozen individuals, couples or corporations have given $1 million or more to Republican super PACs this year, an exclusive club empowered by the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision and other rulings to pool their money into federal political committees and pour it directly into this year's presidential campaign.
Collectively, their contributions have totaled more than $50 million this cycle, making them easily the most influential and powerful political donors in politics today. They have relatively few Democratic counterparts so far, with most of the leading liberal donors from past years giving relatively small amounts -- or not at all -- to the Democratic super PACs.
And unlike in past years, when wealthy donors of both parties donated chiefly to groups that were active in the general election campaign, the top Republican donors are contributing money far earlier, in contests that will determine the party's presidential nominee.
''What unites them? They're economic conservatives,'' said Christopher J. LaCivita, a Republican strategist who helped advise Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a forerunner of this cycle's super PACs, and who in 2008 co-founded another Republican advocacy group, the American Issues Project, that ran advertisements against President Obama.
''Most of these guys are serious business tycoons,'' Mr. LaCivita added. ''They've built something big -- usually something bigger than themselves.''
Some of the superdonors, like Mr. Simmons and Robert J. Perry, a Texas homebuilder, are longtime backers of independent groups that were active in past campaigns, like the Swift Boat group, which in 2004 challenged the Vietnam War record of Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee.
Several attend the exclusive, secretive gatherings of wealthy conservative donors hosted twice a year by the billionaire Koch brothers. Many move in the same social or political circles: Sheldon Adelson, a billionaire casino executive who is close to Mr. Gingrich, serves on the board of the Republican Jewish Coalition with Paul Singer, a hedge fund executive and a top contributor to Restore Our Future.
Some of the million-dollar-plus donors, however, are relatively new to the world of big-league political giving and appear to be motivated by personal connections to particular candidates. Paul B. Edgerley and his wife, Sandra, for example, together gave $1 million to the pro-Romney super PAC. Mr. Edgerley is an executive at Bain Capital, Mr. Romney's former firm.
A few of the megadonors gave through limited liability companies, shielding their identity. One $1 million donation to Restore Our Future came from F8 LLC, a company whose listed address in Utah leads to an accounting firm. A charitable foundation linked to Sandra N. Tillotson, co-founder of the skin care company Nu Skin, uses the same address. Ms. Tillotson was reimbursed by Restore Our Future in July for what appeared to be costs associated with a fund-raiser at her New York apartment.
But the superdonors all have one thing in common: they are by definition deep-pocketed, willing and ready to give far more than the $2,500 checks that donors to candidates are limited to writing. Some of them have almost singlehandedly financed super PACs that support favored candidates.
Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal, has given Endorse Liberty, a super PAC supporting Representative Ron Paul of Texas, at least $2.6 million, the bulk of the group's donations so far. Mr. Adelson and his family have contributed over $10 million to Winning Our Future, the group supporting Mr. Gingrich.
''I might give $10 million or $100 million to Gingrich,'' Mr. Adelson said in a coming profile in Forbes magazine.
The motivation and logistics behind these large contributions remain something of a mystery. Most megadonors and the campaigns they support are reluctant to talk about the hidden scaffolding of high-level political giving. But glimpses of it emerge in public records.
Mr. Perry, who has donated $3.5 million to Republican causes in the current cycle, rarely speaks publicly about his contributions. However, he testified in a 2007 lawsuit that he occasionally got calls directly from candidates asking for money, and that he sometimes decided to write a check after reading or hearing about a promising politician.
Saying that his ''habits are to give more aggressively as we go into the election,'' Mr. Perry said that in addition to supporting candidates on the national level and in Texas, he liked to give to governor's races in ''other states that are not so big, so that my contributions can make a difference.''
The lawsuit was brought against the Republican Governors Association by a Democratic candidate for governor in Texas, who said the group did not comply with state campaign disclosure rules in 2006. A judge ruled against the association, which has appealed; Mr. Perry was not a defendant.
Several of the biggest donors to Restore Our Future, the super PAC backing Mr. Romney, share the candidate's Mormon faith. A quartet of companies connected to Melaleuca, a company based in Idaho that makes nutritional supplements and home care products, donated a combined $1 million to Restore Our Future.
The company is headed by Frank VanderSloot, a national finance co-chairman of the Romney campaign and a graduate of Brigham Young University, Mr. Romney's alma mater. ''I am very concerned about the direction of the country and especially the administration's constant attacks on free enterprise,'' Mr. VanderSloot said in an e-mail.
Many of the biggest givers to the pro-Romney super PAC hail from the world of finance, particularly private equity and hedge funds. Julian H. Robertson Jr., who has given at least $1.25 million to Restore Our Future, is considered one of the godfathers of the hedge fund industry.
A few of the superdonors are friends: Foster S. Friess, the chief donor to the Red White and Blue Fund, a super PAC backing Rick Santorum, occasionally spars with Mr. Adelson over his support for Mr. Gingrich's super PAC. ''Sheldon's prime motivation is his love for Israel, which I share,'' Mr. Friess said, adding that he had spoken to Mr. Adelson recently. ''But my motivation is, I owe this country so much.''

HEADLINE: Romney Finds Unexpected Challenges as Michigan Weighs His Favorite Son Status

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
NOVI, Mich. -- This was supposed to be a state, at last, where Mitt Romney could coast. After all, he grew up here. His father, an automobile executive, had been the governor. And the last time there was a Republican presidential primary in Michigan, Mr. Romney won handily.
Yet, with less than a week until Michigan Republicans vote and with polling suggesting that Rick Santorum is mounting a serious challenge, Mr. Romney finds himself urgently pouring resources into his home state -- unveiling gauzy television ads aimed at reminding residents of his family roots and rolling out endorsements from a virtual who's who in Lansing: the governor, a former Senate majority leader, the attorney general, a former attorney general, and on and on.
While Mr. Romney's comments against the federal bailout of the auto industry have drawn particular attention in Michigan, his troubles among Republican voters here appear to have less to do with his views on the bailout -- which plenty of them say they were not keen on either -- than with a shifting political landscape in a changing state and a fading, and in some cases tattered, emotional bond to the Romney name. 
''Sure, I'd love to be able to say that our president is from Michigan, but that's not all that matters to me,'' said Cindy Minier, a Republican Party chairwoman from Presque Isle County, who said she was leaning toward Newt Gingrich or, given a second choice, Mr. Santorum. ''When it comes right down to it, I just don't feel that Romney is a real conservative -- not a real, true one.''
It is hard to remember that in 2008, Michigan voters perceived Mr. Romney as the more conservative Republican beside Senator John McCain of Arizona, who ultimately won the nomination. This time, of course, others are claiming that mantle. Meanwhile, Michigan is changing too, with its long-struggling economy in the uncertain midst of transition, the emergence of Tea Party groups and conservatives who helped Republicans win a wave of elections in 2010, and an ever-growing generational split between those for whom 1950s- and 1960s-era images of Mitt Romney with his father still stir nostalgia and younger people with blurry memories of Gov. George W. Romney, or none at all.
''It's a joke,'' Randy Bishop, 54 and a Tea Party organizer, said of Mr. Romney's emphasis on his connections to Michigan. ''He left after high school, became the governor of Massachusetts and never looked back.''
Mr. Bishop criticized Mr. Romney for the health care insurance law he supported in Massachusetts, portrayed him as a ''moderate in lockstep with the establishment folks'' and described Michigan's economy as a far cry from the manufacturing capital over which Mr. Romney's father presided. Mr. Bishop said he would vote for Mr. Santorum.
In a way, much of Michigan is only beginning to meet Mr. Santorum, the former senator from Pennsylvania. Even some supporters here acknowledged that they had not given particular attention to him until this month, when he won a series of races elsewhere. Michigan's influential Right to Life political action committee said it would not endorse any one Republican over the others; all oppose abortion, it says. But Mr. Santorum drew praise from voters who said their evangelical Christian or Roman Catholic faith drove their political outlook, particularly from voters in the state's western section and rural northern stretches.
Plenty of Republicans -- even some of Mr. Santorum's supporters -- said they believed that Mr. Romney would ultimately win here, given a flood of advertisements and support from influential Republican leaders. Mr. Romney certainly has a base of loyal supporters, some of whom seemed to view the outcome of Michigan's primary as carrying a special, personal weight, and the notion that Mr. Romney might actually be in trouble here as reason to redouble their efforts now.
''His family made a substantial effect on our state, and you just can't take that away from him,'' said Al Heilman, 76, who said he still had a photograph socked away somewhere of himself meeting Mr. Romney's father decades ago.
Mr. Heilman, a Republican chairman from Kalamazoo County in the southwestern part of the state, said some people seem to want to penalize Mr. Romney for his business experience. ''I don't understand people who kick people in the shins because they've been successful -- profits make the world go around,'' Mr. Heilman, who retired after running a confections and nuts business, said. ''Look, we're on a dive, and this is the time for a true businessman like Mitt Romney who can turn around the country.''
In places like Oakland County, the suburbs outside Detroit where Mr. Romney was raised, he is expected to make some of his strongest showings. Among hundreds of well-dressed Republicans who strolled into a Lincoln Day dinner in a ballroom here in Novi the other night, many referred to their choice for president simply as ''Mitt,'' and a few actually said, ''Who else?''
But even here there also are shaky signs. Frank Spatafore, 74 and a retired industrial engineer, said he was stunned when his small club of Republican friends polled its presidential preferences at a recent meeting, and Mr. Santorum won.
''I know that Mitt Romney is a good guy and a good family man, but when a politician form-fits himself so much to what he thinks people want, I just don't know anymore,'' said Mr. Spatafore, who added that he, too, favored Mr. Santorum.
In this part of the state, where nearly everyone knows someone who has worked in the car business, Mr. Romney's comments about a federal bailout for American automakers have drawn special notice. Mr. Romney has said he believes that General Motors and Chrysler should have entered into a managed bankruptcy process without an infusion of federal assistance. His position puts him in a slightly uncomfortable spot, even beside some who have endorsed him, like Gov. Rick Snyder, who has taken care not to criticize the auto bailout.
But Mr. Romney's opposition to a bailout is more far more likely to be an issue in a general election here -- where Democrats have won presidential elections since 1992 -- than in a Republican primary. For one thing, Mr. Santorum, too, has spoken against the bailout. Perhaps more importantly, some Republican voters -- even those who excitedly described how Michigan's auto industry now appears to be returning, with growing jobs and record profits -- say that they, too, oppose government bailouts, even for Michigan's beloved cars.
''Nobody should get bailout for anything,'' said Joanie Paris, 67, of Livingston County, between Lansing and Detroit. ''Let the free market take its course.''
Still, for some people here, Mr. Romney's remarks on the bailout seemed to call up a subtler, more personal note -- something separate from a philosophical view on government intervention and more about the tenuous nature of Mr. Romney's ties to the place, the very connections his campaign is trying to bolster with ads in which he recalls visiting the car show with his father and speaks of Michigan as home.
''They're trying to play on my heartstrings, and it's doing nothing,'' said Ms. Paris, who said she was voting for Mr. Gingrich.

HEADLINE: Obama Offers to Cut Corporate Tax Rate to 28%

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama will ask Congress to scrub the corporate tax code of dozens of loopholes and subsidies to reduce the top rate to 28 percent, down from 35 percent, while giving preferences to manufacturers that would set their maximum effective rate at 25 percent, a senior administration official said on Tuesday.
Mr. Obama also would establish a minimum tax on multinational corporations' foreign earnings, the official said, to discourage ''accounting games to shift profits abroad'' or actual relocation of production overseas. 
With the framework for changes that the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, will outline on Wednesday, Mr. Obama will enter an election-year debate with Republicans in Congress and in the presidential race who seek even lower taxes for businesses. But an overhaul of the corporate code is unlikely this year, given that political backdrop and the complexity of an undertaking that would generate a lobbying frenzy as businesses vie to defend old tax breaks or win new ones.
The announcement comes two days before Mitt Romney, a Republican candidate for president, is expected to expand on his economic platform in Detroit.
The administration plan to revamp a corporate code that is widely derided as inefficient and anticompetitive has been in the works at Treasury for two years, and is a priority of Mr. Geithner. Yet he has been preoccupied with crisis management, and is unlikely to see the project through since he plans to leave office after this year.
The proposed overhaul ''will help level the playing field for businesses and allow the government to collect needed revenue while promoting economic growth,'' Mr. Geithner told a Congressional committee last week, without details.
Republicans and business groups complain that the 35 percent corporate tax rate is among the highest in the world, leaving American companies at a competitive disadvantage. They typically seek a 25 percent rate, with many of them saying that the current tax breaks should be kept in place as well.
Nonpartisan tax analysts consistently find that corporations here on average pay just slightly more than their competitors in other developed countries after exploiting the many tax breaks and loopholes. Recent news accounts have highlighted the low effective rates paid by companies like Google, Boeing and General Electric.
One analysis concluded that 115 of the 500 companies in the Standard and Poor's stock index paid a total corporate tax rate -- federal and otherwise -- of less than 20 percent over a five-year period. A study by the Government Accountability Office in 2008 found that 55 percent of American companies paid no federal income taxes during at least one year in a seven-year period it studied.
''Under the current tax system, the United States will soon have the highest statutory corporate tax rate among developed countries, within a system that features a large number of tax expenditures for special interests,'' said a senior administration official, who did not want to speak ahead of Mr. Geithner except on condition of anonymity.
''This puts American businesses -- especially those in areas like manufacturing that are subject to more intense international competition -- at a disadvantage. And this system is also unnecessarily complicated for America's small businesses.''
Earlier this year, Mr. Obama proposed to end tax breaks for companies that move jobs overseas and to create new breaks for those that bring jobs back.
Corporate taxes make up an increasingly small share of the federal government's revenue, in part because of tax-avoidance maneuvers by businesses.
Mr. Obama is proposing that the simplification of the corporate code should not add to the deficit, and that most or all revenue raised by closing tax breaks should be used to lower rates or offset the cost of new or existing tax breaks favoring manufacturing, clean energy, and research and development activities, according to administration officials.
Mr. Obama is not proposing to overhaul the tax code for individuals, though he was spoken of it as a goal. Both codes were last revamped a quarter-century ago and the accretion of tax breaks in recent years has given rise to widespread calls, including from Mr. Obama's 2010 Bowles-Simpson fiscal commission, to overhaul the tax systems in a way that raises enough revenue to both lower rates and reduce annual budget deficits.
But every tax break has its defenders, from homeowners who want their mortgage-interest deduction to corporations protective of depreciation tax breaks.
In October, Dave Camp of Michigan, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed a 25 percent corporate rate without saying how he would offset the sizable revenue loss.
An analysis in November from Congress's nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which was requested by House Democrats, reported that even if every corporate tax break were scrapped, the 35 percent corporate rate could not be reduced below 28 percent without adding to deficits. Republicans disputed that, citing a group of relatively obscure tax breaks that the Congressional analysts did not count.
Even so, the administration and Congress would have a political and mathematical challenge in eliminating or reducing tax breaks enough to lower corporate rates as they propose to do without adding to deficits. Underscoring the difficulty, just two popular tax breaks -- for accelerated depreciation of businesses' capital investments and write-offs of research and experimentation costs -- account for the bulk of the revenue the government foregoes to benefit corporations.
Not only are those two provisions unlikely to be repealed, the Obama administration and both parties in Congress support making the research credit permanent.
While Mr. Obama has emphasized federal policies to help manufacturers since he took office at the height of the recession -- most prominently by rescuing the auto industry -- his attention has become even more pronounced as he seeks re-election in battleground states like those in the Midwest where manufacturing is a mainstay.
For tax purposes, however, the administration would have a challenge in defining manufacturing to determine what companies would benefit from a lower rate.
While details were sketchy, an official said Mr. Obama's tax framework would ''refocus the manufacturing deduction and use the savings to reduce the effective rate on manufacturing to no more than 25 percent, while encouraging greater research and development and the production of clean energy.''
For multinational corporations, officials say the administration will oppose any shift to a territorial system of taxing offshore profits, which could exempt most of corporations' foreign earnings from American income taxes. Mr. Camp and many other Republicans and corporations favor such a change, and are certain to oppose Mr. Obama's proposal for a minimum tax on foreign earnings.
While the United States is virtually alone in taxing multinational companies' foreign earnings, it allows the companies to avoid taxes indefinitely by keeping profits overseas. But that encourages accounting schemes and offshore investments, critics say.

HEADLINE: Replace Javits With Center in Queens? Too Far From Sights, Convention Experts Say

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Trade show and hotel executives have complained that the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center is too small since the day the long, black-glass building opened in 1986 on the West Side of Manhattan.
But now that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and a Malaysian conglomerate are proposing to replace the Javits Center with the nation's largest convention hall on a site 12 miles away in Jamaica, Queens, industry executives are not so sure it is a smart move.
Conventioneers and other visitors come to New York expecting to see Broadway shows during their down time, eat in famous restaurants and shop on Fifth Avenue, trade show managers and hotel operators say. None of that exists at the relatively remote Aqueduct racetrack in Queens, where the Malaysian company, Genting Group, hopes to build a 3.8-million-square-foot convention center and 3,000 hotel rooms and enlarge its existing gambling hall. 
More to the point, they add, Aqueduct is a 60-minute subway ride from Times Square. They fear that some conventions, trade shows and conferences will decide to go elsewhere.
''The industry is skeptical about the viability of the Aqueduct site,'' said Jeff Little, a 40-year trade show veteran. ''It has the potential to be a big white elephant. It's true that there are large shows that can't go to the Javits, but that doesn't mean that they'll go to a large facility at Aqueduct.''
Mr. Little's view was amplified a week ago at a meeting of the New York chapter of the International Association of Exhibitions and Events in Manhattan. After listening to a presentation by a top Genting executive, Christian Goode, one trade show manager jumped up and asked the crowd, Who wants to see the Javits closed? Not a single hand shot up in assent from the 125 people in attendance.
''We know that Javits is the most successful convention center in the country in terms of bookings,'' said Mark Schienberg, president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association. The association produces the biggest trade show in New York, the annual auto show in April, which draws 1.1 million visitors. ''But people want to be in the heart of Manhattan. Do they want to be on the fringes of Queens?''
Manhattan hotel operators, especially those who benefit from the trade shows and conventions at Javits, also have their qualms about the Aqueduct project, although they do not necessarily want to criticize a plan sponsored by Mr. Cuomo. The Javits Center has one of the highest utilization rates of any convention center in the nation.
''We want them to leave the Javits Center alone,'' said Michael J. Stengel, marketing vice president for Marriott hotels in New York City. ''If they want to build a center in Queens, fine. Good luck. I know we're not putting a hotel out there anytime soon.''
Genting's $4 billion proposal emerged in January during a speech by the governor, who offered it as an economic development initiative that would enable New York to attract the largest events, ''driving demand for hotel rooms, restaurant meals and creating tax revenues and jobs, jobs, jobs.'' He added that the Javits, which is undergoing a $500 million renovation, would later be demolished and its prime 18 waterfront acres redeveloped. That renovation has been financed by a $1.50-per-room hotel tax imposed in 2005.
Mr. Cuomo said the Queens proposal would cost taxpayers nothing, since it would be financed by Genting. But the company wants highway and transit improvements that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
''No decisions have been made or are imminent as to when Javits redevelopment would begin,'' Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for the governor, said Tuesday. ''Any redevelopment will occur pursuant to a comprehensive master plan reflecting community and shareholder input.''
Mr. Goode tried to reassure trade show managers last week that Genting was pursuing a different customer than Javits -- large trade shows that cannot go to New York because Javits is too small. But many executives say there is not enough convention business to justify a complex of 3.8 million square feet.
''Our project would not compete with Javits,'' said Stefan Friedman, a spokesman for Genting. ''It would compete with the convention centers across the country that are currently eating New York's lunch.''
The Genting proposal is also inextricably linked to its lavish gambling hall at Aqueduct, which features 5,000 electronic slot machines and table games. With Mr. Cuomo also advocating legalized full-scale casinos, Genting, a major casino and resort operator in Asia and England, wants assurances that it will be the exclusive gambling operation in the city.
At the meeting last week, Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, a nonpartisan research group, spoke in favor of plans to move the city's convention center outside of the city's core, like the centers in Milan, Paris and other European cities.
But few industry figures have embraced the idea. Ken McAvoy, vice president of Reed Exhibition Companies, a leading national events organizer, said Genting's proposal was too big and in the wrong place.
''We believe another exhibit hall in the tristate area is needed, maybe a million square feet,'' Mr. McAvoy said. ''I'm not sure the location is correct.''

HEADLINE: High-End Retailers Report Strong Profits, but Walmart Shoppers Still Struggle

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
The holidays turned out to be a lot brighter at the high end, judging by the results of four major retailers who reported earnings on Tuesday.
Walmart, Macy's, Home Depot and Saks Fifth Avenue all reported sales increases for their fourth quarters ending in January. But while Walmart had to lower prices so aggressively that it hurt its profit, retailers focusing on higher-income customers crowed about the solid prices those shoppers paid.
For consumers with higher incomes, ''I think there's generally more confidence today than there was at this time last year,'' said Macy's chairman and chief executive, Terry J. Lundgren. But, he added, where someone is ''making decisions between filling up their gas tank or buying shoes or a handbag, that consumer certainly is more impacted.'' 
Walmart has been holding down prices to get customers to spend. ''We've seen the unemployment numbers come down a little bit, and that's really good, but that hasn't stopped the paycheck cycle,'' said Charles M. Holley Jr., Walmart's chief financial officer, referring to customers spending paycheck-to-paycheck.
Price cuts meant Walmart's fourth-quarter margin in the United States decreased by $100 million. For the company as a whole, fourth-quarter margin fell by 0.4 percentage points, to 24.3 percent of sales.
Saks Fifth Avenue, meanwhile, which said it was selling items like fine jewelry, fragrances and men's accessories at a fast clip, had a ''historically high gross margin rate performance,'' said the chairman and chief executive, Stephen I. Sadove, in a statement. There was ''reduced promotional activity'' throughout the year as the company increased its full-price sales, and its margins for the year rose to 40.8 percent of sales, from 40.1 percent. For the quarter, margin fell 0.2 percentage point to 37.6 percent.
At Macy's, a decline in margin was not because of lower prices throughout the store, but because of a free-shipping promotion and markdowns on cold-weather gear, said Mr. Lundgren in an interview. Holiday discounts ''were about the same level as last year and they were all planned,'' he said.
The average price paid for items at Macy's and Bloomingdale's rose 9 percent in the quarter, because of some inflation in commodity costs and better sales of expensive items like jewelry.
Mr. Lundgren added that the Bloomingdale's business was particularly strong. ''The Bloomingdale's customer is categorized as that consumer who's buying more luxury product, and that business was very good, and you've seen that from some of the other luxury retailers,'' he said.
Macy's gross margins declined by 0.3 percentage point for the quarter and for the year, but its margins, at 40.4 percent for the year and 41 percent for the quarter, were much higher than Walmart's.
Home Depot said that sales at stores that had been open at least a year, also known has same-store sales, had increased in 13 of its 14 categories, and that it was seeing improvement in the professional-contractor sector. Sales in states where housing markets were particularly hard-hit by the recession, like Florida and California, were continuing to improve.
''The performance of our business, particularly in the back half of 2011, would suggest a strengthening market,'' said Home Depot's chairman and chief executive, Frank Blake.
Same-store sales rose 5.7 percent for the fourth quarter. And two indicators of high-end momentum also rose: transactions over $900 increased by 3 percent, while the professional-contractor business, which handles expensive home renovations, posted increases in transactions and the amount spent. ''We're starting to see the beginnings of an improvement among the professional contractors, which is great,'' said Carol B. Tome, chief financial officer.
Home Depot's margins increased 0.29 percentage point from the same quarter a year ago, to 35 percent, which was mostly because of supply-chain improvements, Ms. Tome said.
Apart from their profit margins, all the retailers posted sales increases, though with mixed results.
Walmart reported the second consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales; the retailer had been in a same-store sales slide for nine quarters before that.
The company said Tuesday that its domestic sales grew 2.4 percent in the quarter, to $72.8 billion, while sales at stores open at least a year increased 1.5 percent.
To achieve that, though, Walmart's domestic profit margin slipped lower. Throughout its divisions, the company's consolidated net income fell 13 percent for the quarter, but Mr. Holley said in a telephone call with reporters that the drop was because of a net income number a year ago that was buoyed by a tax benefit from the disposal of a German business. He said the more accurate number to look at was income from continuing operations, which rose 3.4 percent for the quarter, to $5.2 billion.
Sales rose 5.8 percent to $122 billion.
Executives said customers took advantage of programs like layaway over the holidays and responded to the 10,000 or so items that Walmart had brought back to stores. Visits to stores and the average amount spent per visit both rose during the quarter.
January 2012, the last month of the quarter, was the strongest month in terms of sales and traffic, Mr. Holley said. The company did not offer layaway after the holidays.
''It wasn't the time that we had the layaway -- that speaks to the momentum we have in the Walmart business,'' he said. ''We feel very good about where we are with market share grabs in most categories that we operate in.''
''Top-line results were generally in line with expectations, but surprisingly did not demonstrate any improved momentum versus'' levels in the third quarter, a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst, Colin McGranahan, wrote in a note to clients.
Macy's net income rose almost 12 percent from the fourth quarter a year ago, to $745 million, while its same-store sales rose 5.2 percent. Online sales for Macys.com and the Bloomingdales.com unit rose 40 percent from a year ago, and the company said it expected online sales in 2012 to exceed $2 billion.
At Saks, sales of luxury items pushed fourth-quarter net income up 48 percent to $37 million. Same-store sales rose 7.7 percent for the quarter.
At Home Depot, net income for the fourth quarter increased 32 percent to $774 million, while sales rose 6 percent to about $16 billion.

HEADLINE: In Tightening Race, Top G.O.P. Candidates Race to Capture 2 Battleground States

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and JEFF ZELENY; Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Jeff Zeleny from Phoenix. Reporting was contributed by Michael Barbaro from Shelby, Mich., Katharine Q. Seelye from Phoenix, and Dalia Sussman and Allison Kopicki from New York.

 BODY:
In the brilliant sunshine of Arizona, Rick Santorum aggressively challenged Mitt Romney in a state where the Tea Party is strong and the politics of immigration are poised to take center stage at a debate on Wednesday night.
And in the gritty cold of Michigan, the advertising air war intensified, as Mr. Romney increasingly faced questions about his conservative credentials from voters in his home state, a place of grim economic news and plenty of cultural conservatives.
Together, the two states -- separated by about 1,700 miles -- are the immediate battlegrounds for a Republican presidential contest that appears to be tightening drastically in the week before voters go to the polls to award the biggest single-day cache of delegates since the race began.
Mr. Santorum held two events in Arizona on Tuesday as he sought to seize on anecdotal and polling evidence that Mr. Romney's large lead in the state may be quickly evaporating. 
Speaking to about 500 people at the Maricopa County Lincoln Day luncheon, Mr. Santorum tipped his hat to the Tea Party movement, many of whose members had packed into the large Shriners' hall to hear him speak.
''We need to take everything from food stamps to Medicaid to housing programs to education training programs,'' he said. ''We need to cut 'em, cap 'em, freeze 'em, send 'em to the states and say that there has to be a time limit and a work requirement,'' he said, the rest of his words drowned out by thunderous applause.
Mr. Santorum is scheduled to address Tea Party activists near Tucson on Wednesday.
Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona, who plans to make an endorsement in the race after the debate, said in an interview that Mr. Santorum was eroding Mr. Romney's advantage because ''he comes across as straightforward, honest and solid.'' She said she believes that Mr. Romney is conservative, but that many voters do not.
Mr. Romney has been building an organization in Arizona for months, aided by an endorsement from Senator John McCain, the state's senior Republican. But on the eve of the nationally televised debate, one of Mr. Romney's top supporters in the state expressed concern about his chances of winning. Randy Pullen, a former chairman of the Arizona Republican Party who endorsed Mr. Romney last year, said Tuesday that he was no longer certain that Mr. Romney would win the state's primary. He said he believed Mr. Romney's 20-point lead had evaporated, declaring, ''Now it's a dead heat.''
Mr. Pullen said Mr. Romney's campaign had been unsuccessful -- and, in his view, had not tried hard enough -- in its effort to connect with Republican activists willing to unite around beating President Obama.
''There has to be some enthusiasm in the race,'' Mr. Pullen said in an interview. ''Right now there's not much. I don't regret my decision, I'm just frustrated. I think he's honest and straightforward, but the real Romney needs to come out. We need to see the energy, and we need to see the passion we've seen from the other candidates.''
In Michigan, Mr. Romney held a town-hall meeting in Shelby to talk about the difficult economy in the state and his plans to help turn around the nation's fiscal situation. Mr. Romney hinted Tuesday that he would soon unveil a new tax plan that would feature ''a flatter, fairer, broader-based tax system.''
But voters at the town hall peppered him with questions about social issues instead, forcing him off message.
It was a vivid reminder of how much the Republican primaries next week may turn on terrain that has repeatedly frustrated Mr. Romney's political ambitions this year: questions about his commitment to the conservative cause.
''I want to hear you say it,'' said Feleiteau Epley, 58, to Mr. Romney at the Shelby Town Hall. ''That you are 100 percent pro-life. No abortions.''
Mr. Romney did not oblige. Instead, he described himself as ''pro-life'' -- making room for exceptions in the case of incest, rape and when the life of the mother is at stake -- a position that left Ms. Epley, who is considering voting for Mr. Santorum, unsatisfied.
The latest Michigan polls generally show a tight race between the two candidates after a surge in support for Mr. Santorum. A Detroit News survey last week showed the race effectively tied.
In 2008, Mr. Romney won Michigan with the support of conservatives, who made up 56 percent of the electorate and turned out in greater numbers than they had in the 2000 primary, which Mr. McCain won.
The dynamics are similar in Arizona, where four years ago, two-thirds of the state's Republican primary voters said that they considered themselves conservative. In the 2010 exit polls for Mr. McCain's re-election to the Senate, nearly half of all voters said they supported the Tea Party.
A new Arizona poll by Time/CNN/ORC International on Tuesday showed the race effectively tied there. In the poll of 467 likely Republican primary voters, Mr. Romney had 36 percent to Mr. Santorum's 32 percent. The poll has a margin of sampling error of five percentage points.
Advisers to Mr. Romney say they are counting on a cushion from early voting in Arizona, where the campaign had been pushing supporters to cast ballots while Mr. Romney was on a winning streak in the Florida primary and the Nevada caucuses.
But buoyed by the new poll numbers, Mr. Santorum's campaign is pushing hard in Arizona. On Tuesday, Mr. Santorum cast himself as an ''outsider'' even as his Republican rivals sought to accuse him of being a creature of Washington.
''We shook things up to its very core, exposed scandal after scandal,'' Mr. Santorum said of his time as a congressman from Pennsylvania.
Mr. Romney and a ''super PAC'' backing his campaign have hammered Mr. Santorum as a big spender, accusing him of voting to raise the national debt ceiling and of earmarking millions of dollars in federal spending for pet projects.
Those attacks are being made frequently in Michigan, where commercials are flooding the airwaves. Mr. Romney's campaign and the super PAC supporting him have committed a combined $3.4 million to television advertising there plus $350,000 more on radio. Mr. Santorum and the super PAC backing him have so far booked $1.4 million worth of air time of their own and added $614,000 more for ads in Michigan through the day of the primary next Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the super PAC supporting Mr. Obama, Priorities USA Action, secured $238,000 worth of air time in the Detroit and Flint markets. Restore Our Future, the PAC supporting Mr. Romney, reserved an additional $2 million worth of television time in a half-dozen other states with coming primaries. And Representative Ron Paul of Texas released an ad on Tuesday attacking Mr. Santorum's credibility on fiscal issues.
''Is this dude serious?'' the ad asks before listing a number of spending votes Mr. Santorum took as a member of Congress.

HEADLINE: Before Critical Debate, Gingrich Is Urged to Be Himself

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- As Newt Gingrich prepares for what may be the last debate of the primary season, much in need of another comeback, his campaign has a new saying born of frustration with two earlier lackluster debates: ''Let Newt be Newt.''
Mr. Gingrich, more than any other candidate, has seen his fortunes ebb and flow with debates, and there is a consensus in his team that his big loss in Florida's Republican presidential primary last month was in no small part because of debates in which he strained to look above the fray. According to one top aide, Mr. Gingrich's two daughters had advised him to strike a presidential pose, but that was not the Newt Gingrich voters craved. 
''To some extent,'' said Bob Walker, another top adviser, ''we didn't let Newt be Newt in those debates.''
In the debate on Wednesday in Mesa, Ariz., the first in nearly a month, Mr. Gingrich will not be center stage. His advisers believe that will allow him to remain unscathed while Rick Santorum, the current leader in national polls, and Mitt Romney do battle.
''They can be the Chihuahuas, and he can be Churchill,'' said Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Mr. Gingrich.
The stakes are high for Mr. Gingrich, who is low on money and facing eclipse by Mr. Santorum's surge even in Southern states that were to be his bulwark. He needs to give voters, especially conservatives, a reason to return to him.
''He's got one shot,'' said Keith Nahigian, who managed Representative Michele Bachmann's campaign before her withdrawal. ''He has to do something substantial. He blew two debates pretty badly.''
After Mr. Gingrich won South Carolina on Jan. 21, he ignored openings at the two debates in Florida to criticize Mr. Romney, accepting advice that he refrain from being aggressive, even though the fiery, combative Mr. Gingrich is what rallied so many of his supporters.
One of Mr. Gingrich's daughters, Kathy Lubbers, a senior adviser to the campaign, said she did not recall what advice she gave her father about the Florida debates.
Herman Cain, campaigning with Mr. Gingrich in Georgia, last week told crowds, ''I knew I had the right guy when Speaker Gingrich at that debate did a smackdown of the media on the very first question,'' referring to a CNN debate in South Carolina.
Ms. Conway, who is a pollster, said she and the campaign's top ad creator, Rex Elsass, ''were beside ourselves'' over the advice Mr. Gingrich received in Florida to remain above the fray, writing ''memo after memo that you've got to go on the attack.''
''Newt's got to be Newt,'' she added. ''He doesn't have to act presidential.''
While candidates traditionally prepare for debates with fat briefing books and by practicing answers to anticipated questions, Mr. Gingrich likes to say his only debate coaches are his two grandchildren, who remind him to smile and be brief.
That is not the full story. Although he does not hold formal debate prep sessions, senior advisers weigh in with suggestions about what issues he should expect to address and offer possible responses.
''It's important at times for the team to give him some ideas of what questions we think might come up,'' said Mr. Walker, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who is a longtime friend. ''He has to feel comfortable in doing it the way he thinks it should be done. He's had enough experience over the years to be able to handle it on his own. We just need to give him some things to think about in terms of issues so he has some responses in mind.''
Mr. Gingrich's advisers think he will have an advantage as Mr. Santorum is peppered with questions about the social issues that he has made the centerpiece of his campaign, especially controversial remarks against prenatal testing and contraception. Mr. Gingrich is being advised to emphasize instead his latest economic issue, rising gasoline prices and his pledge to expand drilling to drop the price of gasoline to $2.50 a gallon.
One of Mr. Gingrich's biggest applause lines while campaigning is that no American president should ''ever have to bow to a Saudi king,'' a reference to a 2009 incident in which President Obama bent deeply while greeting a Saudi ruler. His campaign recently added a photograph of the encounter to the home page of its Web site.
Mr. Santorum is expecting Mr. Gingrich to come after him, but he will most likely repeat the effective point he made in Florida debates, in which he lumped Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Romney together as once favoring individual health care mandates, the heart of Mr. Obama's health care overhaul.
''There's no doubt that Gingrich is a great debater, but there's no great performance that will enable him to rewrite history,'' said Alice Stewart, a spokeswoman for Mr. Santorum.
One important difference heading into Wednesday's debate, sponsored by CNN and the Arizona Republican Party, is that Mr. Gingrich has no other public appearances that day, a departure from previous debate days when he campaigned vigorously and, his staff believes, was tired during the debate.
''You can't help, after you've gotten the adrenaline going a couple of times during the day, being a little weary by the time you get on the stage that night,'' Mr. Walker said. ''A lot of the plan here is to make certain he has time to relax.''
Ms. Conway said, ''It's tough for Newt to chill,'' but that is the right plan for him on debate day. ''The best prep for Newt is a Diet Coke and time to think,'' she said. ''Not to study. Time to think.''
''In Florida he had one too many people talking in his ear, and nobody appreciated that until after the fact,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Israel Watches Syria, Hopefully, but Warily

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- As Israelis watch the bloody confrontation between the Syrian people and the government of President Bashar al-Assad, they are torn by two sentiments: The downfall of Mr. Assad would deal a major blow to Iran and so would be welcome. But without a central authority, Syria could descend into being a land of chaos and terrorist bases on Israel's northeast border.
Nearly a year into the Syrian uprising, the predominant view in Israel today is the former, that Mr. Assad must go, not only because he has killed thousands of civilians, but because he is a linchpin in the anti-Israel Iranian power network that includes Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
''Iran is investing very heavily in trying to save the Assad regime,'' Dan Meridor, Israel's intelligence minister, said at a briefing on Monday. ''If the unholy alliance of Iran, Syria and Hezbollah can be broken, that is very positive.'' 
Efraim Halevy, who has served as both national security adviser and chief of the Mossad intelligence agency, made a similar point in a recent opinion article, saying that close international attention to Syria could obviate any need for a much riskier military attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
''Ensuring that Iran is evicted from its regional hub in Damascus would cut off Iran's access to its proxies (Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza) and visibly dent its domestic and international prestige, possibly forcing a hemorrhaging regime in Tehran to suspend its nuclear policies,'' he wrote in The New York Times. ''This would be a safer and more rewarding option than the military one.''
Israeli government and intelligence analysts say they believe the most likely outcome of the current struggle in Syria is chaos. They base that on observing four parameters: the loyalty of Mr. Assad's security forces, the economic situation, the participation in protests in the main cities of Damascus and Aleppo and the possibility of international intervention.
Their conclusions are that a vast majority of the Syrian security forces remain loyal to Mr. Assad, and that will not change soon; that Iranian economic aid to Syria is generous and vital and keeps the system going; that the participation within Damascus and Aleppo in antigovernment activity remains low; and that the chance of American or European military intervention in Syria is near zero.
''I see no appetite for any foreign power to come in and put boots on the ground, as happened in Afghanistan and Libya, and I see a divided opposition,'' one government analyst said. ''The American plate is totally full, and the same is true of the Europeans.''
As a result, Israeli officials and intelligence analysts say they also worry about an increased presence by Al Qaeda in Syria and the possibility that Syria's large storehouse of arms could end up in the hands of Hezbollah and other anti-Israel groups.
At the annual Herzliya conference on Israeli security held several weeks ago, Defense Minister Ehud Barak spoke of this concern.
''We are following in particular the possible transfer of advanced weapons systems to Hezbollah, which break the delicate balance in Lebanon,'' he said.
He was referring to long-range ballistic weapons able to reach anywhere in Israel, advanced antiaircraft systems, which threatened Israel's action over Lebanese airspace, and unconventional weapons, especially chemical, according to Prime Source, a risk consultancy firm in Israel.
If such a transfer of arms happened, Israel would have to decide whether to strike a convoy and risk provoking the Assad government into a direct confrontation with Israel, potentially shifting attention away from its internal woes, experts said.
Prime Source concluded that Israel would be likely to strike only if the weapons changed the strategic picture because they were, for example, chemical arms. If the weapons were interchangeable with those already in Hezbollah's hands, Israel would most likely not attack, it said.
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and annexed it in 1981 in an act never accepted internationally. While Syria has not given up its claim to the area, it has kept the border trouble-free for nearly four decades. Still, Israel worries that Mr. Assad might lose control, permitting infiltrations, that the Golan Heights could become to the north what the Egyptian Sinai has become to the south: a staging ground for anti-Israel action.
This led an aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to say that it was lucky Israel had never made a peace deal with Syria that involved a return of the Golan Heights, as the world has long urged, since it has served as a buffer to the violence in the past year.
Military planners are also concerned that Mr. Assad might preemptively attack Israel to produce a response and cause Arab nations to back off pressuring the Syrian government, though there has been no evidence such a move was being contemplated.
One issue that has created debate in Israel is how public a stand its officials should take against Mr. Assad. Mr. Barak and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman have publicly called for his fall and condemned the civilian massacres, but Mr. Netanyahu has said less. His aides say he believes condemnation from Israel would allow Mr. Assad to accuse his opponents of being Zionist conspirators.
Among politicians on the left, there is more support for speaking out. Isaac Herzog, a member of Parliament with the Labor Party, said he had been in touch with Syrian opposition leaders in France and the United States and believes that such discreet contact will prove useful and that Israel needs to be on record against the Assad government.
''Most Israelis see Syria as a binary choice -- Assad or nothing,'' he said in an interview. ''But there is a full revolution under way. I don't think Israel should give the opposition a bear hug, but it should be open to important changes there. As one opposition leader told me: 'We were brought up to believe that all evil comes from Israel. Now we see otherwise.' ''
Mr. Herzog said he hoped Israeli Arabs could serve as a bridge with the new Syrian leaders. But Hussein Sweiti, a journalist with the Israeli Arab newspaper Al Sinara, said that was unlikely.
''It is very difficult for the Arab community in Israel to stand against Assad, since his was the only regime that supported the Palestinian issue and stood against Israel,'' Mr. Sweiti, who has interviewed Syrian opponents for his newspaper, said by telephone.
Mr. Sweiti said that Al Qaeda, led by Ayman al-Zawahri, had entered Syria, adding: ''Our community is in a difficult situation. We cannot be in the same line with Zawahri, Netanyahu and Obama against Assad. And no matter who rules in Syria they will want the Golan back.''

CORRECTION-DATE: February 24, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A Memo From Jerusalem article on Wednesday, about the complexities of Israelis' views of the conflict in Syria, omitted part of a quotation by Hussein Sweiti, a journalist with an Israeli Arab newspaper, Al Sinara. When he commented on the forces arrayed against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, he included Ayman al-Zawahri, the leader of Al Qaeda. Mr. Sweiti said in full: ''Our community is in a difficult situation. We cannot be in the same line with Zawahri, Netanyahu and Obama against Assad. And no matter who rules in Syria they will want the Golan back.''

One of the biggest questions of the Arizona debate was how Rick Santorum was going to confront the questions about his commentary on social issues like birth control.
In the debate, he refused to back down or apologize for talking about those issues.
"The left gets all upset, 'Oh, look at him talking about all this,' " he said, mocking his opponents. "Just because I'm talking about this doesn't mean that I want a government program to fix it. That's what they do."
Mr. Santorum vowed to continue talking about social issues on the campaign trail. He said he would discuss the "dangers" of contraception as president.
"We have a problem in this country and the family is fracturing," Mr. Santorum said. "How can a country survive if children are being raised in homes where it's so much harder to succeed economically?"
He added that conservatives sometimes say everything will be O.K. if they just cut spending.
"No, everything's not going to be fine," he said. "There are bigger problems at stake in America."

HEADLINE: Another Agency Joins the Hot Field of Shopper Marketing

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Team Enterprises, which is based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., is starting Team TransActive with a pair of executives, Tom Dowdy and Ira Rosenkrantz, who are well known in shopper marketing, a field that focuses on consumers at the point of sale. 

 BODY:
One of the hottest fields in advertising is what is known as "shopper marketing," efforts to influence what consumers buy when they are in stores and in "an arm's reach of desire," to quote a longtime saying of executives at Coca-Cola.
Shopper marketing, which includes tactics at the point of sale like displays, coupons and free samples, is gaining favor as a complement to the efforts to reach consumers before they even enter the store, preshopping, so to speak, either online or through the use of apps on smartphones and tablets.
Joining the ranks of agencies that offer shopper marketing services is Team Enterprises, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which is owned by MDC Partners, the parent of agencies like Crispin Porter & Bogusky and Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal & Partners.
Team Enterprises is starting its shopper marketing division, to be called Team TransActive, with a pair of executives, Tom Dowdy and Ira Rosenkrantz, who are well known in the field. Mr. Dowdy will be chief executive of the division, and Mr. Rosenkrantz will be chief sales officer. The two worked together at a shopper marketing agency named National In-Store, now the CPM division of the Omnicom Group.
Steve Groth, a partner at Team Enterprises, said, "The game is being won or lost for clients at retail." He added: "We've had the nucleus of a shopper marketing group for some time, and we wanted to super-charge those capabilities."
Team TransActive will work for clients of Team Enterprises like Elizabeth Arden, Bacardi, Boar's Head cold cuts and MillerCoors.
The division has also signed clients in the candy and consumer electronics categories, Mr. Dowdy said, adding that he could not identify them at this time.
Four hundred full-time and part-time employees of Team Enterprises will be working for Team TransActive, Mr. Dowdy said, along with 6,500 contract workers.
The number of employees will grow, Mr. Groth said, as the division expands.

HEADLINE: A Reluctant C.E.O. Hires His First Sales Rep

BYLINE: PAMELA RYCKMAN


HIGHLIGHT: To help him develop a strategy, Mr. Woronka decided to retain a sales consultant who recommended that he hire a full-time sales rep immediately. But he went against the consultant's advice. 

 BODY:
Last week, we published a case study recounting a dilemma faced by Action Ambulance, a provider of ambulance and transportation services to hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities and special-education programs within school systems. The 260-employee company, which is based in Wilmington, Mass., 17 miles north of Boston, was facing increasing competition. Its chief executive, Mike Woronka, believed a more aggressive approach to sales might lure business from his seven direct competitors and also expand Action's territory.
But targeted sales, Mr. Woronka said, are unusual in his industry, where account managers generally push gently and gradually for new business. He needed to decide whether he could train his existing account managers to be more proactive or whether he would need to hire a full-time sales representative to pursue new accounts. He also considered hiring a sales manager to oversee the team.
To help him develop a strategy, Mr. Woronka decided to retain a sales consultant, Suzanne Paling, who recommended that Action hire a full-time sales rep immediately. But Mr. Woronka went against Ms. Paling's advice. He decided instead to see if his account managers had the skills and motivation to chase new clients, and he asked Ms. Paling to train them in sales. 
After eight months, it was clear that the strategy was not working. "We really struggled," Mr. Woronka said. "The account executives struggled with the system and didn't buy into the concepts, and they weren't incentivized to close deals on a straight salary. It got heated and confrontational, and people became frustrated."
Mr. Woronka let go of Ms. Paling, but he continued to be dissatisfied with his account managers' progress in sales. Two years later, he issued a mea culpa. He called Ms. Paling and asked if she would come back to help him recruit a professional sales rep.
"Because we're a small company, we were trying to manage sales in a cost-effective way," he said, "but we were putting square pegs into round holes. The whole system floundered because we didn't want to make personnel changes. Suzanne helped us to understand that an effective salesperson has to have a certain personality. Our account managers were great at their jobs, but they didn't have sales personalities."
In September 2010, Ms. Paling returned to write a job description for the professional sales representative Action needed. "Much of the work had been done," Ms. Paling said. "We'd just done it for the wrong people. Presidents or owners often assume a person with an outgoing demeanor will succeed in sales. But good salespeople are highly skilled professionals with perseverance, money motivation, the ability to prospect for new business, and the ability to close deals."
Mr. Woronka hired a sales rep with 10 years experience in pharmaceutical sales and adopted a compensation plan Ms. Paling suggested, which gave the sales rep a higher base salary for a specified training period and then switched to a lower base as she began to generate about 60 percent of her $100,000 compensation through commission. Ms. Paling stayed on for two months to ensure the new rep hit the ground running; she coached, role-played and accompanied the rep to client meetings.
As a result, Mr. Woronka said, the sales rep is thriving. "She has the right sales persona," he said. "When she's in a meeting, she's always trying to get someone to make a commitment, asking when we can come back for more. She's always looking for the close."
While Action's account managers were skeptical initially, the sales rep fit in well because responsibilities were clear up front. The rep lands accounts and immediately passes them on to the account managers, who nurture the relationships. Mr. Woronka said this proactive approach enabled Action Ambulance to prosper even in a recession. It helped increase annual revenue by at least $1.5 million (to $17 million), and last winter the company opened two new offices in Pittsfield, Mass., 143 miles from its headquarters. Mr. Woronka has been acting as the de facto sales manager, but he is now considering hiring another sales rep and a part-time sales manager.
Mr. Woronka recently discussed his decision and the results. A condensed version of the interview follows.
Q: 
Mr. Woronka: We still have one, but sadly, one passed away in December. So we've decided to hire another salesperson because I'm getting more value with the sales position than with the account management side of things.
Q: 
Mr. Woronka: We're having a tough time defining market share because our clients don't release that data. Not all the hospitals or nursing homes track the number of ambulance calls they make per month because it doesn't affect their cost structure or reimbursement. It's a vendor relationship, not a mission-critical function. But now my team is trying to define this stuff, getting to the why's behind everything instead of just going through the motions. They're thinking in terms of market share, number of beds, revenue and cost per trip. They're more engaged in asking better questions.
Q: 
Mr. Woronka: When we hired the salesperson, we had some targets we wanted to achieve in busing for special-needs kids. When she started, we were doing $4,000 of revenue per month and we've now grown that to $40,000 a month. Come September, her target is $80,000.
Q: 
Mr. Woronka: Eight or nine months ago, we got a call from one of our school districts who said a competitor had called to see if they could jump into the special-ed stuff there. The school district said they were happy with us. Now we know other people are following.
Q: 
Mr. Woronka: We're going to engage Suzanne again to hire another full-time salesperson and also a part- or quarter-time sales manager who can work with the sales force to hold them accountable, run the reports and keep them on top of building a pipeline. I don't have time as C.E.O. to do it. The salespeople and the account managers are now plugging their activities into C.R.M., so I'd envision the sales manager running the reports, viewing the activity, and meeting with them for progress updates. Because the sales force is mobile and on the road, there's no reason to have someone sitting in the office managing people who aren't there.
Q: 
Mr. Woronka: I thought that comment was interesting. It has been very difficult for us to define, but as health care evolves and changes, we're looking at new ways to differentiate ourselves. Hospitals are being forced to move patients out of their facilities with less notice than they had before. Five years ago, we knew almost 24 hours in advance that someone was going to move. Nowadays we receive 85 percent of our calls with 15 to 30 minutes notice about when patients are moving. Being in the metro-Boston area with traffic poses an interesting operational dilemma. How to get the service levels right? One thing we've done is to literally put a truck in the parking lot of hospitals we serve so we're ready to go at any time.

HEADLINE: New Poll Shows Tight Race in Michigan

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney receives an endorsement from The Detroit News. 

 BODY:
A new poll of Republican voters in Michigan depicts a neck-and-neck race between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum as Mr. Romney picks up the endorsement of one of the state's largest newspapers.
The NBC News/Marist survey shows Mr. Romney ahead with 37 percent and Mr. Santorum with 35 percent. The poll has a margin of sampling error of 4 percentage points.
The close race in the state where Mr. Romney was raised is forcing the campaign and its allies to spend millions of dollars to avoid what could be a devastating loss to Mr. Santorum on Tuesday.
Theendorsement by the Detroit News on Wednesday morning comes just as
both men are preparing to take the stage for a debate in Arizona, which also votes on Tuesday.
The newspaper said Mr. Romney was the best candidate to help the nation return to economic prosperity and had the best chance of any of the Republican hopefuls to beat President Obama in the fall.
"On leadership, the Michigan native and former Massachusetts governor has the strongest resume of the four remaining Republican candidates," the paper writes. "He has not only successfully run a state, but also has deep experience in turning around private companies. America today is the ultimate turnaround project."
Mr. Romney's opposition to the government bailout of the auto industry has been controversial in Michigan, and especially in Detroit. The newspaper criticized Mr. Romney, saying that the federal money was "absolutely essential to the survival" of the auto companies that are at the heart of the city's economy. But the paper noted that all of the Republican candidates opposed the bailout.
Instead, the newspaper focused on Mr. Romney's economic credentials and criticized Mr. Santorum's ability to deal with the country's problems.
"Nothing in his background suggests he has the skills to unify Americans behind his banner and become the leader of the free world," the paper wrote. "In addition, his fealty to the religious right will make him unappealing to the critical independent voters who will decide the election."
It's unclear whether the newspaper's endorsement will have a huge effect in the state's primary. Mr. Romney was already expected to perform well in the Detroit metropolitan area where the paper circulates. It is in the state's rural west where Mr. Romney is likely to struggle.
But the paper's nod will give Mr. Romney another talking point for the Arizona debate on Wednesday night.
In Arizona, another NBC News / Marist poll shows Mr. Romney with a double-digit lead over Mr. Santorum. That is different than a CNN/Time Magazine poll released on Tuesday which showed the race effectively tied in Arizona.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
The Supreme Court on Tuesday signaled that it might end affirmative action in public colleges and universities, Adam Liptak reports. All sides agree that such a decision would reduce the number of African-American and Latino students at nearly every selective college and graduate school in the country, with more Asian-American and white students gaining entrance instead.

        
About two dozen individuals, couples or corporations represent a new breed of super-donor in presidential politics, each giving a million dollars or more to Republican "super PACs" this year, Nicholas Confessore, Michael Luo and Mike McIntire report. Collectively, these political action committees have given more than $50 million so far, making them the most influential and powerful donors in politics today.

        
President Obama will ask Congress to scrub the corporate tax code of dozens of loopholes and subsidies to reduce the top rate to 28 percent, while giving preferences to manufacturers that would set their maximum effective rate at 25 percent, Jackie Calmes reports.

        
Several little-noticed provisions were tucked into a $140 billion bill extending emergency jobless benefits and a temporary cut to payroll taxes, Annie Lowrey reports. Intended to modernize the country's outdated unemployment insurance system, the changes promise to aid the long-term jobless and help hold down the unemployment rate in future recessions.

        
As Newt Gingrich prepares for what may be the last debate of the primary season, his campaign has a new saying born out of frustration with two earlier lackluster debates: "Let Newt be Newt." There is a consensus in his team that his big loss in Florida was mainly because of debates in which he strained to seem above the fray, Trip Gabriel writes.

        
Mitt Romney has found himself urgently pouring resources into his home state of Michigan as Rick Santorum mounts a serious challenge there. Mr. Romney won the state handily in the last Republican presidential primary, Monica Davey reports. His trouble with Republican voters there appears to stem from a shifting political landscape and a fading, and in some cases tattered, emotional bond to the Romney name.
Happenings in Washington

        
President Obama will deliver remarks at the construction site of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. Later, the president and first lady will host a reception in honor of the new museum's groundbreaking ceremony.

        
The National Archives will host free screenings of this year's Academy Award nominees in the Documentary Feature, Documentary Short Subject, Live Action Short Film and Animated Short Film categories. The screenings will take place in the William G. McGowan Theater and will run through Saturday.

HEADLINE: Is Romney Reading Krugman?

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney said on Tuesday that spending cuts slow the economy. 

 BODY:
At a campaign stop in Michigan on Tuesday, Mitt Romney made news by telling the truth about the economy. He said: "If you just cut, if all you're thinking about doing is cutting spending, as you cut spending you'll slow down the economy. So you have to, at the same time, create pro-growth tax policies."

The idea that spending reductions slow, rather than spur the economy is what Paul Krugman, The Times editorial board, and many liberal economists have been advancing since the downturn. (Simply put: You can't cut your way to growth.) It's also in keeping with the Obama administration's arguments. As Jack Lew, the White House chief of staff said recently on Meet the Press, "I think that there's pretty broad agreement that the time for austerity is not today Right now we have a recovery that's taking root and if we were to put in an austerity measures right now, it would take the economy in the wrong way."
Actually, there is no "broad agreement:" The Republican political establishment considers such ideas heresy. Andy Roth of the Club for Growth, called Mr. Romney's admission "hogwash." And within hours of the gaffe, campaign spokesman Ryan Williams stepped in to assure voters that Mr. Romney "believes that budget cuts-especially in the context of President Obama's unprecedented spending explosion-are a step in the right direction."
Mr. Romney's main pitch for the nomination is that he is a successful businessman who knows how to fix the economy. But when it comes to the Republican primaries, dissembling always takes precedence over expertise. If a candidate even briefly abandons ideology in favor of macroeconomic realities, he must expect attacks.

HEADLINE: Romney Details Tax Overhaul

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: MItt Romney wants to maintain six income tax rates but lower them across the board. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney, seeking to kick-start his presidential campaign among recalcitrant conservatives, on Wednesday proposed cutting the top income tax for individuals to 28 percent while holding out the prospect of limiting tax deductions.
Mr. Romney's earlier economic plan called only for preserving the current top tax rate of 35 percent, while holding out the promise of lower rates later in an overhaul of the tax code. But facing a major challenge from the upstart Republican rival Rick Santorum, he chose to outline such an overhaul in Arizona before critical primaries here and in Michigan next Tuesday - and before a televised debate Wednesday night in Mesa, Ariz.
At a rally in Chandler, Ariz., Mr. Romney promoted the benefits of his approach.
"In order to limit any impact on the deficit, because I do not want to add to the deficit, and also to make sure we continue to have progressivity in our tax code, I'm going to limit the deductions and exemptions, particularly for high-income folks," Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, said.
"And by the way, I want to make sure that you understand, for middle-income families, the deductibility of home mortgage interest and charitable contributions, those things will continue," he said. "For high-income folks, we are going to cut back on that, so we make sure that the top 1 percent keeps paying the current share they're paying or more. We want middle-income Americans to be the place we focus our help, because its middle-income Americans that have been hurt by this Obama economy."
Mr. Romney's top economic adviser, Glenn Hubbard, said the plan would cut all six current tax brackets - 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent, 35 percent, depending on a taxpayer's income - by the same proportion of 20 percent. That would produce this new set of tax brackets: 8 percent, 12 percent, 20 percent, 22.4 percent, 26.4 percent, and 28 percent. "It's a marginal rate cut for every American," Mr. Hubbard said.
But echoing the candidate, he added that Mr. Romney was committed to making his plan both "revenue neutral" - meaning it won't add to the budget deficit -- and "distributionally neutral" - meaning that it won't shift the tax burden from upper-income Americans to middle- and working-class Americans. Since the largest benefits from rate reduction would go to upper-income taxpayers, they will also bear the burdens of "base broadening" reductions in existing deductions needed to keep the government from hemorrhaging revenue, he explained.
Reducing large tax deductions, like the ones for home mortgage interest and state and local taxes, can be politically treacherous because of their popularity with voters and elected officials alike. For now, at least, Mr. Romney will dodge any potential backlash by avoiding such specifics.
Mr. Romney will pledge to work with Congress on "limiting them," Mr. Hubbard said, but "it is not his intention to take on any specific
deduction or exclusion and eliminate it."
Mr. Romney has praised the work of President Obama'sSimpson-Bowles deficit reduction commission, but criticized the president for ignoring its work. Mr. Romney, however, is also rejecting the commission's recommendation that tax overhaul produce increased government revenue to cut the deficit, while embracing its recommendation to cut the top tax rate to 29 percent or lower.
Mr. Hubbard contrasted Mr. Romney's "pro-growth" plan with Mr. Obama's proposal to raise taxes on individuals earning more than $200,000 and households earning more than $250,000. He argued that would hurt economic growth by crimping small businesses, many of which file under the individual tax code.
Mr. Hubbard, who was an economic adviser to President George W. Bush and is now dean of the business school at Columbia University, also cast the
Romney plan as superior to Mr. Santorum's. Mr. Santorum would also cut the top individual rate to 28 percent, the level it reached after Congress and the White House agreed on a tax overhaul plan during the Reagan presidency, while preserving only one more tax bracket of 10 percent. In the name of "national security," Mr. Santorum has also proposed a zero tax rate for manufacturing businesses as a means of preserving and expanding that economic sector.
The Santorum plan would significantly expand the budget deficit, Mr. Hubbard said, and the zero rate for manufacturing would result in "significant capital misallocation."
"Net-net, it's a job destroyer, not a job creator," Mr. Hubbard said.
Both Mr. Santorum and former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has proposed an optional "flat tax" system of 15 percent, have accused Mr. Romney of timidity. With his new proposal, Mr. Romney seeks to counter that charge in advance of Wednesday night's debate.
Mr. Romney's plan aims to balance two competing priorities of different Republican factions. By proposing to cut the top rate, he
is seeking support among supply-side conservatives who contend that lower marginal rates are the key ingredient for producing economic growth.
But by vowing to offset the loss of revenue by eliminating some deductions, he is addressing concerns among deficit hawks about expanding the tide of red ink that has the federal government spending an estimated $1.3 trillion more than it takes in this year.
And by insisting that those unspecified reductions will fall most heavily on the affluent, he is seeking to limit a line of attack that portrays him as a wealthy former financial industry executive who himself has paid taxes at only around the 15 percent rate because most of his income comes from capital gains. Mr. Romney would maintain the current 15 percent rate on dividends and capital gains.
Mr. Obama has proposed to tax the "carried interest" received by many hedge fund and private equity executives at higher ordinary income rates rather than as capital gains, arguing that current law gives them an undue advantage. Mr. Romney himself has benefited handsomely from that.
Mr. Hubbard said a President Romney would ask his treasury secretary to study the "devilishly hard question" of whether current law should change and tax some of that income at ordinary income rates.
Mr. Romney had proposed eliminating capital gains taxes on taxpayers earning less than $200,000, but that drew fire from some conservatives and campaign rivals like Mr. Gingrich on the grounds that it gave unwarranted preference to a specific group and would have small economic impact since those taxpayers receive relatively little in capital gains anyway.
Mr. Romney also proposes to eliminate both the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, while cutting the top corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent.
Mr. Hubbard said three different revenue streams would keep the plan from increasing the budget deficit: the "dynamic" effects of economic growth, the additional income that would be subject to taxation through "base broadening," and spending cuts Mr. Romney plans that would reach $500 billion per year by 2016. The campaign promised more specifics on those spending cuts within the next week.
 In advance of Mr. Romney's tax plan, Mr. Obama's Treasury Department on Wednesday proposed its own corporate tax overhaul plan cutting the top corporate rate to 28 percent by eliminating some existing corporate deductions. Part of the Obama plan includes a minimum tax on the overseas income of United States-based corporations. 
Mr. Hubbard, accusing the administration of a "full-throttle attack on multinationals", said Mr. Romney would propose shifting to a territorial system that would not tax corporate income earned overseas.

HEADLINE: Who Decided That This Election Should Be About Sex?

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins discuss the surprising role debates over contraception, abortion and unwed mothers have played so far in the campaign. 

 BODY:
Gail Collins: David, if you had asked me what the big topic of the presidential race was going to be, I'd certainly have said jobs, jobs, jobs. But lately, we seem to be talking about women, women, women.
David Brooks: With an opening like that I'm suddenly having flashbacks to the Clinton years.
Gail: In Washington they're fighting about whether it's a good plan to have all-male panels discussing women's right to get contraceptives under their health insurance. In Virginia they're debating abortion and Mississippi is thinking about bringing back the personhood amendment its voters defeated last year. In Indiana this week there was a dust-up in the State Legislature over the Girl Scouts, and whether they promote abortion and homosexuality.
And of course, the Republican presidential campaign is all over it. You'll have to explain to me whether you think Rick Santorum believes that talking about the evils of prenatal testing is good for his campaign or whether he just can't help himself.
David: Oh, that kind of women's issue. Less Paula Jones, more Bob Jones. I guess my reaction to all these issues is that they are getting more and more fringey. For a few decades we had knockdown, drag-out fights about how the sexual revolution was going to shake out, but now it's sort of a done deal.
We've reached a national consensus. People in the educated class talk like social progressives and behave like traditionalists. People in the less educated classes talk like social conservatives and behave like libertines. Nearly everybody is cool with things like contraception. Most people want to restrict abortion without making it impossible and we're kind of exhausted by the fight that never goes anywhere.
To me the thing that took the stuffing out of the culture wars is that the social fabric began to repair. Teenage pregnancy rates are down. Abortion rates are down. Crime is down. There are problems with the social fabric but they no longer have to do with the sexual revolution.
When Rick Santorum talks about this stuff in the way he does, it's theology, not sociology. And believe me, there are very few Americans who are strongly theological, even the ones who attend services every week.
Gail: I'm being driven crazy by people who are obsessed with limiting the scope of government, but feel perfectly free to demand that government get involved in women's most personal choices. How can they argue that the states have no right to meddle in , then cheer for the states to pass laws telling a doctor to perform a stupendously invasive procedure like a pelvic ultrasound on an unwilling patient who wants to get a first trimester abortion?
Okay, I'm done. Calming down and moving forward.
David: Moving forward? Please don't tell me you got a contract with MSNBC. Isn't that their slogan? Or is it Lean Forward? Why would MSNBC be content with leaning? Shouldn't they be marching forward? Leaning sounds so inebriated.
(Don't mind me, I'm just trying to change the subject from Santorum's position on prenatal testing.)
Gail: Whenever you bring up women's internal workings, guys want to change the subject. Unless, of course, they're trying to change the laws.
David: As to your larger point, I do think it's consistent to be economically libertarian and socially paternalistic. In fact I'd argue dynamic capitalism requires a stringent and coherent social order to help guard against its savageries - tight families to educate children, anti-materialist values to police rampant consumerism, a spiritual public square to mitigate the corrosive culture of greedy self-interest.
Free market beliefs and socially conservative beliefs require each other, so long as those socially conservative beliefs are traditional, not theological. I'm for traditional values, with government playing a small role to support them. I get worried when some politician begins trying to legislate his faith's version of Natural Law.
Gail: I'm not sure whether this obsessing about sex works for Santorum, but I suspect that it's really bad for the anti-abortion movement. Its leaders have been very canny in trying to present the debate as a fight over whether a doctor can dismember a fully developed fetus. And they were doing pretty well, politically.
Now the debate is about things like contraception, fertilization treatments and prenatal testing. A vast majority of Americans don't regard any of these things as immoral. And the fact that we're arguing about them highlights the critical fact that convictions about precisely exactly when a new life begins - fertilization? implantation? quickening? birth? - are both deeply personal and deeply theological.
David: I guess that's true but the anti-abortion movement seems pretty healthy. The way I read the polls young people are moving way left on same-sex marriage and slightly right on abortion. Of course most people like me are in the squishy middle.
Gail: But I know the woman-related news that most interests you is the new government data on the rise of unwed mothers. It seems likely that pretty soon most American children will be born to unmarried women. The big argument seems to be whether this is a result of the lack of good-paying blue collar jobs or a split in our society, in which the bottom third - or half or two-thirds - lead lives that are too chaotic for long-term relationships.
David: I've tried to argue that it's both. It's a spiral of economic and social influences that are impossible to untangle. As one social scientist put it, what nature hath joined together, multiple regression cannot put asunder.
Gail: There's a really good book on this subject called "Promises I Can Keep," by Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas. They concluded that low-income women saw marriage not as the beginning of their lives, but as the payoff. They intended to wait until they had put together enough resources to have a nice wedding, and then live in a good place of their own. They were also, of course, waiting to find a man who was settled and stable enough to be a good husband.
In some ways they weren't different from college-educated women, who tended to put off marriage until they'd gotten their careers off the ground. The difference was that the poorer women regarded marriage as a reward, but children as a necessity. They weren't prepared to defer motherhood the way their better educated peers were.
David: I'm so glad you mentioned that book. I've been hoping to plug it in a column. It is indeed really good. I do think that the life script that many low-income women envision is simply not correct, though. As you say, they see marriage as a culmination. They have kids, get a good job and make some money, and then they can afford the lovely wedding. That's backward. For most people getting married is not the payoff after an upward climb it's the tool to advance the upward climb.
Married people save money. Married people have more settled habits. Married men are much more stable. When people marry first they are more likely to make it later.
Gail: That presumes you can find a settled guy with a good job to marry. I doubt many single mothers have rejected a whole bunch of those prospects.
David: Agreed - this doesn't solve the other problem, which is what do we do to make it so that more men are worth marrying. But I do think Barack Obama should start a public information campaign that says that people should marry before they have kids, not after. This is one thing Rick Santorum gets right. People who marry before childbearing, graduate from high school and get a job, any job, do not live in poverty. That's what we need to encourage.
Gail: You may be right that the big issue for America now is class, not race or gender. But in this presidential campaign, gender rules. Really, sex rules. Who'd have thought?
David: Class is gender. Specifically men. The wage stagnation and inequality stories are largely stories about how badly men have been doing over the past few decades. Women's incomes have been up, up, up.
So let's return to our normal subject. Men, men, men. Let's go back and have a normal election: men talking about themselves. The love that won't shut up.

HIGHLIGHT: Your midweek news roundup. 

 BODY:
Bon Appetit Management Company, which I wrote about in May, has promised to phase out pork produced in gestation crates, do away with all eggs from confined hens and source at least 25 percent of its meat from farms that are third-party certified humane by 2015. This sets the bar for animal welfare for major food service providers in the United States. Bon Appetit is owned by The Compass Group, which should direct all of its subsidiaries to follow this lead.

In Tracie McMillan's (excellent) new book, "The American Way of Eating: Undercover at Walmart, Applebee's, Farm Fields and the Dinner Table,"the author goes undercover to work at the bottom of the American food chain. Here, here and here are excerpts. Meanwhile, in a survey of 30,000 workers in all fields, 42.3 percent of fast food workers said, "My job may make the world a worse place." (The next highest-ranked profession was "bartender," with only 5.8 percent.) McDonald's may be the world's largest fast food chain, but Ad Age reports that the behemoth usually ranks near the bottom in quality perception when compared with rivals. Speaking of burgers, it was bound to happen: a patron at the Heart Attack Grill in Las Vegas, which specializes in a 6,000 calorie "Triple Bypass Burger," had a heart attack while eating in the dining room.
And Congresswoman Louise Slaughter (D-NY) sent a letter to more than 60 of the leading fast food companies, meat producers and grocery stories asking them to release details on their antibiotic use policies.
The local food ordinance movement that began in a handful of small towns in Maine has found its way to California, where the El Dorado County Board of Supervisors have signaled support for a "Local Food and Community Self-Governance" ordinance.
Anthony DeBenedet at Time Ideas says the new national focus on preventing obesity may be creating eating disorders in young girls. Gotta fix that.
The U.S. and the European Union will soon treat each other's organic standards as equivalent. Organic food companies are cheering because their potential markets just doubled. On the flip side, Reuters reports that European farmers are likely to fall behind in the competitive world grain market as E.U. consumer hostility to GMOs drives away research and prevents cultivation of high-yield and pest-resistant crops.
A French court has declared Monsanto guilty of chemically poisoning a French grain grower who says he suffered memory loss, headaches and stammering after inhaling Monsanto's Lasso weedkiller in 2004.
President Obama is seeking a 17 percent bump for the F.D.A. budget for Fiscal Year 2013, and nearly all of that increase would come from upping industry fees. Here's one thing the F.D.A. could do with that money: Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) introduced a House bill that would require the F.D.A. to set safety standards for arsenic and lead in juices. It's called the "Arsenic Prevention and Protection from Lead Exposure in Juice Act of 2012": the APPLE Juice Act.
School meal news: An U.S.D.A. inspector performing nutrition checks on the lunches of a preschool class in North Carolina decided that a four-year-old's lunch-consisting of a turkey-and-cheese sandwich, a banana, potato chips and apple juice-wasn't nutritious enough, so the child was given three chicken nuggets instead.
PepsiCo has made a killing by selling orange juice diluted with water and calling it "Trop 50."
A vaccine against Salmonella may be one step closer, according to a research team led by a U.C. Davis immunologist.
Researchers may have found a link between memory loss and a high-calorie diet.

HEADLINE: Are Manufacturers Really Special?

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: The Obama administration's proposal for an overhaul of corporate tax rates includes new breaks aimed at promoting manufacturing jobs. Policy experts have long been divided as to whether manufacturing deserves such cultivation. 

 BODY:
The Obama administration is undertaking an athletic push to promote manufacturing employment in the United States: proposing giving manufacturers new tax breaks, closing loopholes that benefit companies that send manufacturing jobs offshore, expanding worker training programs and increasing trade enforcement, for instance.
The administration underscored manufacturing's first-among-equals status when announcing its proposed overhaul of the corporate tax code on Wednesday. "It's a framework that lowers the corporate tax rate and broadens the tax base in order to increase competitiveness for companies across the nation," President Obama said in a statement. "It cuts tax rates even further for manufacturers that are creating new products and manufacturing goods here in America."
But what's so special about manufacturing? Is there really a reason for the White House to champion that certain set of businesses? Why not services? Or another growing sector of the economy, like agriculture?
Policy experts have long been divided on these questions. Many economists argue that there's nothing special about manufacturing, and that Mr. Obama's proposals are simply an election-year sop. They note that plenty of nonmanufacturing businesses are highly innovative. Moreover, they argue that relatively high wages for American workers mean that manufacturing employment - though it has rebounded in the last two years - is never really coming back.
But others say the United States can create, retain and regain higher-end manufacturing jobs. They also argue that manufacturing has potent spillover effects that make it worthwhile for the government to promote.

A new paper by the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program lays out the case for manufacturing exceptionalism in detail. The report, by Susan Helper, Timothy Krueger and Howard Wial, puts forward four main arguments.
First, it argues that manufacturing "provides high-wage jobs, especially for workers who would otherwise earn the lowest wages." To show that, the study controls for workers' personal characteristics, like their level of education, to compare similar workers in different industries. The researchers find that wages tend to be higher for manufacturing workers than for nonmanufacturing workers, perhaps because manufacturers are willing to pay to retain higher-skilled employees. It is a point the administration echoes when it says that manufacturing will be an important source of middle-class jobs.
Second, the paper argues that manufacturing is important for innovation. Manufacturers tend to plow significant funds into research and development, much more so than other businesses in the private sector. Though manufacturing makes up about 11 percent of economic output, the paper says, manufacturing businesses account for 68 percent of the research and development spending by domestic business.
But why not keep research, development and innovation onshore while offshoring the hard work of putting garments or cars or rockets together? The paper cites studies showing that the "co-location" of research and production are important for improving business practices and generating innovation. It also argues that that manufacturers' innovation and research can spill over to other workers and firms.
"The interdependence between production and innovation is apparent in many industries, and policy makers ignore this fact at the peril of eroding America's competitive edge in both current and future industries and in services as well as manufacturing," the study says. 
Finally, the paper argues that manufacturing can help reduce the country's trade deficit, and that smart manufacturing can promote environmental sustainability.
On the other side, economists argue that such claims about manufacturing are overstated: that most manufacturing jobs will be low-wage and low-end and therefore will go overwhelmingly to workers overseas; that other businesses foster innovation as well; and that there are many more solidly middle-class jobs to be found in the service sector. 
One way or another, it is undeniable that manufacturing employment is growing, even if that is just a bounce back from the depths of the recession. The economy has added about 330,000 manufacturing jobs in the last two years.

HEADLINE: What to Watch for in Tonight's Debate

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: In all of the Republican debates over the past year, Rick Santorum has never been at center stage. That will change. 

 BODY:
In the numerous televised debates among Republican candidates during the past year, Rick Santorum has never been at center stage. That changes Wednesday night.
Mr. Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, is taking his turn as the principal opponent for Mitt Romney during a debate in Arizona hosted by CNN and moderated by John King, one of the network's anchors. The debate, which will also include Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich, starts at 8 p.m. Eastern time.
For Mr. Santorum, the debate will be his final opportunity to offer his message nationally in advance of next Tuesday's primaries in Arizona and Michigan. And it will offer the most risk that a stumble
or gaffe could put the brakes on his recent momentum in those states.
Aides to Mr. Santorum are aware of his need to avoid mistakes and project a broad appeal to voters who have reservations about choosing Mr. Romney as the standard-bearer of the party.
But they are also eager to see Mr. Santorum go after what they believe are Mr. Romney's vulnerabilities with conservative voters.
"The Tea Party and that movement exists because of four things: Obamacare, the big bank bailout, cap-and-tax legislation and immigration," Hogan Gidley, a top adviser to Mr. Santorum, said in an interview. "Mitt Romney joined with Barack Obama on all of those key issues."
Mr. Romney has been one of the most consistent performers during the debates, remaining cool for most of them and turning aggressive toward his rivals when his campaign was eager for him to show that he can fight back.
The pressure on Mr. Romney to win on Tuesday, especially in Michigan, the state in which he grew up, suggests that Mr. Romney could be more like the aggressive debater he was during the two debates before the Florida primary last month.
But there have also been moments when Mr. Romney got rattled, a fact that could encourage his rivals on the stage to attack repeatedly.
The other two candidates on the stage also have challenges. Newt Gingrich has managed to steal the show during previous debates by railing against the media and liberals. If he can do that again, he might re-enter the conversation.
Mr. Paul rarely varies from his policy script -- freedom, liberty, an end to the Federal Reserve, and the occasional complaint about not being asked enough questions. He's likely to continue that.
Here are some other things to look for during the debate:
TAXES: Mr. Romney's new tax proposals, unveiled Wednesday, for lower individual rates should prompt a discussion among the candidates about whose plan would benefit Americans the most. Mr. Santorum has argued for a zero corporate tax rate on manufacturing and Mr. Gingrich has advocated an optional 15 percent flat tax.
RELIGION AND BIRTH CONTROL: This will be the first debate since the controversy over President Obama's decision to require religious institutions to provide free access to birth control. The decision - since amended - has prompted a robust discussion on the campaign trail about the tradeoffs between religious liberty and the provision of health care. And it has sparked a renewed debate about cultural issues like abortion and contraception.
THE AUTO BAILOUT: With the race in Michigan apparently very close between Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum, questions about the government auto bailout are inevitable. All of the candidates on the stage opposed the auto bailout, but Mr. Romney has been under the most pressure for saying at the time that the companies should be allowed to enter a managed bankruptcy without a bailout.
HEALTH CARE: Mr. Santorum has been relentless in his pursuit of Mr. Romney on health care in previous debates. He accuses Mr. Romney of having been the inspiration for Mr. Obama's health care proposals, a charge that has gotten Mr. Romney angry and even flustered at times. Look for Mr. Santorum to try to repeat that effort.
IRAN AND ISRAEL: The heightened tension over Iran's pursuit of a nuclear program is almost sure to mean a discussion. It will also be one of the opportunities for the candidates on the stage to criticize Mr. Obama as much as they criticize each other. Most of the candidates (Mr. Paul being the exception) have urged a more aggressive posture against Iran.
GAS PRICES: Republicans have clearly decided to seize on rising oil and gas prices as a way to hammer Mr. Obama's economic policies. The debate should offer a platform for their arguments that the president has not done enough to expand domestic oil production in an effort to keep prices down. Mr. Gingrich, in particular, has made this a central theme in recent days and has even released a 30-minute video speech about gas prices that his campaign says he will pay to run in several markets in the coming weeks.
IMMIGRATION: The issue of illegal immigration has not come up in a big way recently on the campaign trail. But the debate is being held in Arizona, a border state where the issue is critical to many of the state's voters. Look for the candidates to seize the mantle of the man who is toughest on the issue.
INSIDER vs. OUTSIDER: All of the candidates are trying to stress that they would shake up Washington, a city that remains anathema to many conservative voters. Mr. Romney, in particular, has been trying to portray both Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Santorum as insiders because of their long careers in Congress. Look for him to continue that theme during the debate.

HEADLINE: Santorum Sees 'Evil Forces' Confronting America

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Santorum echoes his remarks about Satan going after the United States. 

 BODY:
TUCSON -- Rick Santorum gives the impression of a man on a roll; while he surges in the polls, his crowds swell and his speechifying becomes more expansive.
 He held a Tea Party crowd here rapt for an hour on Wednesday while he took inventory of multiple items in the conservative cabinet and derided President Obama at every turn.
 In fact, Mr. Santorum seems to have mentally skated past Mitt Romney and the other Republicans he must still defeat in the primary in order to win the presidential nomination and is already taking the fight to President Obama.
 The president, he said, was "making the world a much more dangerous place." Mr. Santorum, who was criticized earlier this week for having said in a 2008 speech that Satan had set his sights on the United States, took ownership of that concept Wednesday, asserting that there are indeed "evil forces" around the world.
 "And yet our president refuses to call evil evil, refuses to even name it, refuses to confront it, tries to appease and cajole it in an effort to reduce America's commitments around the world," he declared.
 He also accused the president of "systematically trying to crush the traditional Judeo-Christian principles in this country" and said Mr. Obama was trying to impose his moral values on the country with the enactment of his health care plan.
 Mr. Santorum hopes that his hardline stance on various issues will convince voters that he can present the sharpest contrast to Mr. Obama in the fall. If Mr. Santorum becomes the Republican nominee and he carries over the substance and tone of his recent speeches, Mr. Obama seems in for a fight far uglier than he encountered in 2008.
 Mr. Santorum's references to Mr. Romney, who still leads the Republican field in delegates, were fleeting. He asked the crowd at one point who they trusted, a "Johnny-come-lately" to the conservative cause (no names necessary), "or the guy on a high-wire line who tells you what's in his heart, what's in his gut?"
 He said that Mr. Romney's recently issued tax plan was a copy of his own. ("Welcome to the party, governor, he said. "Great to have you along.")
 Mr. Santorum distinguished himself from other Republicans by saying he favored supply-side economics but only if it works "for the working man as well as folks at the top of the scale." Mr. Obama's economic plan, he said, "is food stamps and more dependency."
 The president, he added, had a "radical environmental ideology" that opposes drilling for oil in Alaska. "In my administration, we will drill for oil in Alaska," he declared. High gas prices affect everyone, he said, even those "who the President says he cares about -- he cares about them enough to get them addicted on government programs so he can get their vote when election time comes."
 He also chastised the left for thinking that the pursuit of happiness, as described in the Declaration of Independence, meant that people could do whatever they wanted.
 "True happiness," he counseled, "comes from doing what you ought to do," referring to God's will.
 "This is what I know gets everybody on the secular left just bonkers about my campaign," he said. "They just go crazy, because I say that America is, at its heart, a moral enterprise."
 Here in the southern part of Arizona, not far from the Mexican border, immigration is a major issue. "There's no bigger issue of national security than securing the southern border of this country," Mr. Santorum said.
 "You have my pledge that we will secure this border, we will deal with the issue of the drug violence and the cartels, we will work with the Mexican government," he said, "so that people in Arizona can live in peace and prosperity just like every other state in the county."
 The event was held in a Shriners' hall here in the Congressional district that Gabrielle Giffords represented until she resigned a few weeks ago as she continues to recover from having been shot in the head last year. A heated race is now underway for her seat. Mr. Santorum did not mention her name.

10:33 P.M. | Santorum Defends Support for Specter 
Mitt Romney managed to bring before primary voters an issue that has been a sore subject for Rick Santorum with conservatives - his support in the 2004 Republican primary in Pennsylvania for Senator Arlen Specter, then a Republican, over Pat Toomey, his conservative challenger.
Mr. Specter beat Mr. Toomey and stayed in the Senate. In 2008 he switched to the Democratic Party and, as Mr. Romney pointed out, voted in favor of President Obama's health care plan. So, Mr. Romney was essentially making a bank shot from Mr. Santorum's support for Mr. Specter to the passage of what Republicans derisively call "Obamacare."
Mr. Santorum adamantly defended his decision to support Mr. Specter. He said Mr. Specter was going to be chairman of the Judiciary Committee and would oversee hearings for two or three Supreme Court nominees.
"And Arlen Specter, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we had a conversation," Mr. Santorum said tonight. "Now, he asked me to support him. I said, 'Will you support the president's nominees?' We had a 51-49 majority in the Senate. He said, 'I'll support the president's nominees as chairman.' "
He then added: "Every nominee Arlen Specter supported - from the time he took on Judge Bork and saved Justice Thomas - every nominee that he supported passed. Why? Because it gave Democrats cover to vote for it, and it gave Republican moderates cover to vote for it."
He said that Mr. Toomey, who replaced Mr. Specter in the Senate, would not have had the clout to "give the moderate Republicans and the conservative Democrats the leeway to then support that nominee, which is exactly what Arlen Specter did. He defended Roberts, defended Alito."
Mr. Santorum and Mr. Romney ended up bickering with each other and John King, the moderator, moved on.
- 
10:16 P.M. | Fact Check: Santorum Waffles on Title X
Rick Santorum may have had a "I voted for it before I voted against it" moment tonight.
In response to an assertion by Ron Paul that he had voted to fund Planned Parenthood, Mr. Santorum said: "As Congressman Paul knows, I opposed Title X funding. I've always opposed Title X funding." Title X is the major federal financing vehicle for family planning programs. 
"But," he quickly added, "it's included in a large appropriation bill that includes a whole host of other things." 
Here the audience started to boo.
Technically, Mr. Santorum was saying that he opposed it - not that he voted against it - but he was implying that he had voted against it. Then when he said it was included in a larger bill, the audience cried foul.
Title X was signed into law in 1970 by a Republican president, Richard Nixon, who declared, "Contraception for all." 
Mr. Santorum said that because Title X "was always pushed through," he countered by pushing for Title X to provide financing for abstinence programs, saying they "actually work in keeping children from being sexually active instead of facilitating children from being sexually active."
Finally, he got around to an admission: "Yes, I - I admit I voted for large appropriation bills and there were things in there I didn't like."
His bottom line, he said, is that as president, "I will defund Planned Parenthood; I will not sign any appropriation bill that funds Planned Parenthood."
Mr. Santorum's recent statements are likely to add to the confusion about his stance on the issue. Since 2006, he has cited his support for Title X to show that he is not opposed to funding for contraception. 
As recently as last week, on "CBS This Morning," Rick Santorum told the host, Charlie Rose, that he has no problems with federal funds for contraceptives, saying that he voted for Title X funds in the Senate.
- 
10:10 P.M. | The Candidates in One Word
- 
10:03 P.M. | A Negative Ad in the Making?
Mr. Santorum just offered up what may be the evening's most wince-inducing moment: he declared that he had voted for President George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind education law even though "it was my against my principles."
For a presidential candidate, it was a curious - and unusual - acknowledgement of politics trumping values.
Mr. Santorum suggested that he had backed the bill, despite his reservations, to assist a Republican president with a major policy initiative, referring to himself as a "team player."
The political advisers over at Mitt Romney's campaign headquarters must be salivating. Mr. Santorum may have just handed them footage for a potent attack advertisement.
- 
9:55 P.M. | Fact Check: Obama and Iran
Mitt Romney pressed his case that President Obama had practiced appeasement toward Iran, but he mischaracterized Mr. Obama's position on potential military action. The president has repeatedly said that military action against Tehran remains on the table.
It is also not true that Mr. Obama agreed to Russia's demand to give up missile defense facilities in Eastern Europe. He negotiated with Russia over the scale of the system, in an effort to win Moscow's agreement to the Start arms reduction treaty. In his discussion of national security, Mr. Romney also said the administration wanted to cut the Pentagon's budget by "roughly a trillion dollars," which is twice what Mr. Obama has suggested.
Mr. Santorum is correct in saying that in 2009, the Obama administration cut funding for a United States-based group that documented human rights abuses in Iran. But the State Department continues to finance other groups that seek to block censorship of the Internet in Iran. Mr. Santorum also slightly misstated Mr. Obama's decision to open an embassy in Syria. The United States withdrew its ambassador to Damascus under President George W. Bush; Mr. Obama decided to send an envoy back to Syria before withdrawing him recently because of the civil strife.
- 
9:53 P.M. | Audience Not Willing to Compromise
One thing is very clear - the audience at tonight's debate is resolutely against compromise and negotiation in Congress.
On several occasions, Rick Santorum has admitted that he ended up voting for measures he didn't agree with because that's what legislators do.
Every time, the audience has loudly booed him.
When asked about education reform, Mr. Santorum admitted that he voted for the No Child Left Behind bill because he was "taking one for the team."
Sometimes, he said, a lawmaker has to cast a vote for the leadership that's against his principles. That's what he did, he said.
The booing was immediate and loud, an indication that today's Republicans - or at least the ones in the debate hall - are unwilling to accept those kind of compromises.
What's unclear is whether voters in Arizona and Michigan, and beyond, will understand Mr. Santorum's explanation, or will blame him for going along to get along.
Ron Paul suggested that voters would reject that approach.
"That's what the problem is with Washington," Mr. Paul said. "That's what's been going on for so long."
- 
9:49 P.M. | Fact Check: Expanding E-Verify 
When Mitt Romney spoke of Arizona as a model for fighting illegal immigration, he was referring to one of several laws Arizona passed in recent years that requires employers to confirm that new hires are legally authorized to work through a federal system called E-Verify. 
The system, which is voluntary at the federal level, has been growing rapidly, with 288,000 employers now using it nationwide. It has proven to be a reasonably effective and efficient way for employers to avoid hiring illegal immigrants, and it discourages those immigrants from seeking jobs in companies known to use the system. There is bipartisan support in Congress for some kind of national system to verify the immigration status and work authorization of new hires.
However, there has been debate over proposals currently before Congress to expand the E-Verify system, making it mandatory for all employers nationwide. If that happened, all new hires - including Americans as well as immigrants - would have to provide documentation to verify their identity and eligibility to work. Some critics, including Republicans, have said that could become another costly and intrusive federal mandate. 
E-Verify currently relies on data from the Social Security system, which has been shown to have errors that could be costly and time-consuming for Americans and legal immigrants to correct.
Also, farmers across the country are strongly opposed to making E-Verify mandatory nationwide without a new guest worker program to provide legal migrant labor for agriculture. So while the general idea that Mr. Romney proposes has support in theory, putting it into practice nationally is not easy - particularly for Republicans.
That said, all four of the candidates avoided the hot-button issue: what to do about 11 million illegal immigrants already living in the country.
- 
9:48 P.M. | Fact Check: Gingrich and Earmarks
Earlier in the debate, three of the Republicans - Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney - jousted as they often do on the subject of earmarks, which are spending items that members of Congress insert in the annual appropriations bills to benefit a particular project or program backed by constituents or supporters. Mr. Romney has criticized both of his rivals for their use of earmarks when each was in Congress. As the moderator, CNN's John King, indicated, earmarked spending has always been a minuscule piece of federal spending - typically less than 1 percent.
Mr. King asked Mr. Gingrich to respond to Mr. Romney's criticism that Mr. Gingrich, as speaker of the House from 1995 through 1998, raised earmarking to an art form. Mr. Gingrich, rather than respond directly, recalled that the federal budget was balanced when he was speaker.
Mr. Gingrich, as speaker, did preside over a period in which the number and total cost of earmarks spiraled, and Republican leaders openly encouraged new members to seek earmarks to buttress their local standing. In 1992, when he was still in the minority, Representative Gingrich said, "I am committed to hunting down every appropriation ... that is some politician taking care of himself."
But in 1995, Mr. Gingrich's first year as speaker, the new Republican-led Congress approved a record 1,430 earmarked projects worth $10 billion, according to the conservative group Citizens Against Government Waste. The totals escalated annually. Mr. Gingrich was forced to resign his office in late 1998 after a fraud scandal and Republican election losses. But Republicans remained in control of the House through 2006, when there were 9,963 earmarks worth $29 billion. Disgust among conservative voters with the trend, and scandals surrounding the earmarks, was a factor that year in Republicans' election losses, which gave control of the House and Senate to Democrats.
Earmarks are still a part of the budget process, but Congress and the executive branch disclose them. And nonpartisan groups like Citizens Against Government Waste, with its annual "Pig Book," continue to report on the spending.
- 
9:46 P.M. | No Mention of Housing
The housing crash has hit Phoenix, and Arizona generally, with particular force.
Average home prices in Phoenix have fallen by more than 50 percent since the peak of the housing bubble in 2006, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index. The median price of a home was $267,000 in 2006; it's now about $120,000.
Almost half of the homeowners in Arizona owe more on their mortgages than the current value of their homes, according to real estate analytics firm CoreLogic. That makes it hard for them to refinance their mortgages or to sell their homes.
Construction, once a dominant business, has contracted dramatically. Arizona's economic output fell 3 percent between 2007 and 2010, primarily because of the downturn in construction, according to the Bureau of
Economic Analysis. A $20 billion industry in 2007 shrank to just $12 billion in 2010.
There are some signs that the housing industry has reached its nadir, but few signs of any strong rebound. Indeed, some economists believe that Arizona and other states that boomed during the early years of the century may lag behind in the current recovery, as many of their residents struggle to reduce their debts.
And yet, for all of that, CNN has just completed a two-hour debate in Arizona without asking the four Republican candidates a single question about housing.
- 
9:35 P.M. | Candidates Take a Pass on Gas Prices
Given the opportunity to seize on the anger among drivers about gas prices, the candidates declined.
In the course of a discussion about the Middle East, Mr. King asked Mr. Romney about the price of gas and what he would do about it as president.
Mr. Romney, though, dismissed the concerns about gas prices and steered the discussion to the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran.
"We simply cannot allow Iran to have nuclear weaponry," he said, saying that Mr. Obama has had lots of failures, but that "nothing in my view is as serious a failure as his failure to deal with Iran appropriately."
The rest of the candidates fell in line, talking about the issue of Iran and not coming back to the question of gas prices.
That's interesting, given the fact that the candidates - especially Mr. Gingrich - have been increasingly critical of Mr. Obama on gas prices.
- 
9:30 P.M. | Candidates Hammer Obama on Foreign Policy
As the debate turns to foreign policy, the Republican candidates are taking the opportunity to hammer Mr. Obama.
Mr. Gingrich called Mr. Obama "the most dangerous president, on national security grounds, in American history."
Mr. Romney also blasted the president, offering a litany of hot spots around the world and blaming Mr. Obama for making them worse.
There was no mention of the foreign policy successes that Mr. Obama has had, including the killing of Osama bin Laden.
- 
9:26 P.M. | Caucus Click: Outside the Debate
- 
9:20 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney and the Auto Bailout
Mitt Romney provided a more nuanced explanation of his opposition to the federal loan package that helped rescue the auto industry in 2008 and 2009, saying there was "no way" he would have let American car companies implode. But a bipartisan group of auto industry executives, government officials and financial experts have said that if General Motors and Chrysler had followed his advice at the time and gone into bankruptcy, implosion is exactly what would have happened.
The context is Mr. Romney's 2008 New York Times Op-Ed, in which he argued that Chrysler and General Motors should not receive federal aid. "Detroit needs a turnaround, not a check," he wrote.
But auto industry executives and people who were involved in the government-mandated reorganization of the auto companies have said that the managed bankruptcy was not an option at the time Mr. Romney wrote his article. Furthermore, they have said, following a path into bankruptcy then would have caused far more severe job losses and even liquidation.
Mike Jackson, a Romney supporter and chief executive of AutoNation, the largest auto retailer in the country, said recently that Mr. Romney's position on the auto bailout was a "circle that can't be squared."
To go through a managed bankruptcy, tens of billions of dollars in financing would have been necessary. Auto executives and government officials have said that the only entity at the time that could have provided that level of financing was the federal government. In late 2008 and early 2009, the credit markets seized up, making financing on that scale virtually impossible to come by.
Mr. Romney and others have argued that the markets would have provided that money if the government demurred. But even Mr. Romney's former firm, Bain Capital, declined to help General Motors when asked in 2009 to invest in the automaker's European division, said one person with direct knowledge of the conversations.
The most problematic comment on the auto bailout, however, was made not by Mr. Romney but by Newt Gingrich, who said foreign automakers like Toyota and Nissan were doing "just fine" at the time the federal government bailed out domestic carmakers. Mr. Gingrich made the remarks in an attempt to draw a connection between the American auto companies' high labor costs and their decline. But at that point, car manufacturers were doing poorly regardless of whether they were foreign or domestic.
In early 2009, Toyota reported its first loss in 70 years - $7.7 billion. Nissan was also in bad shape at that time, reporting $2.4 billion in losses. Honda, another Japanese automaker, also lost billions then.
- 
9:18 P.M. | Santorum Is Booed by Audience 
So far, Rick Santorum has gotten the worst of the audience.
When he tried to explain that his votes for Title X family planning funding were the result of voting for bigger appropriations bills, the audience booed as if to say: no excuses.
The booing seemed to rattle Mr. Santorum a bit, who clearly sensed that he had hit a nerve with the audience.
And Mr. Paul seized on it, saying that Mr. Santorum's answer was just more of the kind of excuses that people hate about Washington.
- 
9:17 P.M. | Santorum on Contraception 
Rick Santorum is having a hard time tonight explaining his stance on contraception because he has made numerous statements that appear to be in conflict. 
Did he clear it up tonight? Not really. "I have a personal moral objection" to contraception, he said, "but I've voted for bills that included it too." 
This drew a big boo from the audience.
Last year, Mr. Santorum told an evangelical blog, "One of the things I will talk about that no president has talked about before is, I think, the dangers of contraception in this country."
He added: "Many in the Christian faith have said, 'Well, that's O.K. Contraception's O.K.' It's not O.K. because it's a license to do things in the sexual realm that is counter to how things are supposed to be."
So, his position seems to be that while he personally opposes birth control, he would not ban it as president. But he did not spell it out clearly tonight. Then again, he successfully deflected Mr. Romney's attempt to press him on the issue by bringing up Mr. Romney's health care plan in Massachusetts.
- 
9:16 P.M. | Romney and Santorum Hold Nothing Back
If there was any question about whether Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum recognize the stakes in the current battle, the last exchange should put it to rest.
Mr. Romney unleashed against Mr. Santorum a litany of criticisms that were clearly planned.
He said Mr. Santorum had endorsed him for president four years ago, long after his health care plan as governor of Massachusetts was in place, even appearing on Laura Ingraham's radio show to say that Mr. Romney was a true conservative.
Mr. Romney then took on Mr. Santorum's support for Arlen Specter, a Republican senator from Pennsylvania who later became a Democrat.
"If we had said no to Arlen Specter," Mr. Romney said, Mr. Obama's health care plan would not have passed in the Senate. "So don't look at me, take a look in the mirror."
Mr. Santorum appeared rattled a bit about Mr. Romney's attacks on votes that included funding for Title X family planning programs, which prompted boos from the audience.
But he regained his composure by lashing out at Mr. Romney for using federal money to "underwrite" his health care plan in Massachusetts.
"You used federal dollars to fund a government takeover of health care in Massachusetts," Mr. Santorum said.
And Mr. Santorum chided Mr. Romney for repeatedly saying that he had balanced the state's budgets.
"Don't go around bragging about something you have to do," Mr. Santorum said. "Michael Dukakis balanced budgets for 10 years. Do you think that makes him qualified to be president? I don't think so."
As for his support of Mr. Specter, Mr. Santorum said he did so because Mr. Specter promised to support conservative nominees to the Supreme Court.
- 
9:11 P.M. | Romney on Birth Control and George Stephanopoulos
Mr. Romney just zeroed in on Mr. Gingrich's favorite target: the news media.
In the exchange, Mr. Romney seemed to revive a long-whispered claim that George Stephanopoulos, the ABC anchor, had discussed the issue of birth control with the White House before posing a question about it during a Republican presidential debate. (Mr. Stephanopoulos has vigorously denied this.)
"You recall back in the debate we had," Mr. Romney said to the moderator, John King, "George Stephanopoulos talking a lot about birth control. We wondered why in the world contraception - why is he going there? Well, we found out when Barack Obama continued his attack on religious conscience."
Mr. Romney was referring to Mr. Obama's recent announcement of a plan requiring that insurance companies, including those affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, cover birth control, which set off a firestorm of criticism from social conservatives. The president has since revised the plan to address concerns from religious groups.
- 
9:05 P.M. | Santorum Vows to Continue Discussing Social Issues
One of the biggest questions of the debate was how Mr. Santorum was going to confront the questions about his commentary on social issues like birth control.
In the debate, he refused to back down or apologize for talking about those issues.
"The left gets all upset, 'Oh, look at him talking about all this,' " he said, mocking his opponents. "Just because I'm talking about this doesn't mean that I want a government program to fix it. That's what they do."
Mr. Santorum vowed to continue talking about social issues on the campaign trail. He said he would discuss the "dangers" of contraception as president.
"We have a problem in this country and the family is fracturing," Mr. Santorum said. "How can a country survive if children are being raised in homes where it's so much harder to succeed economically?"
He added that conservatives sometimes say everything will be O.K. if they just cut spending.
"No, everything's not going to be fine," he said. "There are bigger problems at stake in America."
- 
9:02 P.M. | Fact Check: Controlling the Federal Debt
The Republican debate opened with a question from the audience that allowed each of the four remaining candidates to claim that they would bring the mounting federal debt under control. But nonpartisan analysts have concluded otherwise for the proposals to date from Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum.
Another group will weigh in on Thursday: the U.S. Budget Watch project of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a longstanding nonprofit group that includes former members of Congress, administration officials and budget experts of both major parties, will issue a report showing that all three Republicans would add to the projected debt. Each candidate has proposed deep spending cuts in coming years, but the reductions are exceeded by the additional tax cuts they propose.
- 
8:57 P.M. | Candidates Hunt for Zingers
In the hunt for the best one-liner, none of the candidates on the stage has yet scored a home run. But Mr. Romney is probably in the lead.
Mr. Romney whipped out the earmark attack: "When I was fighting to save the Olympics, you were fighting to save the 'Bridge to Nowhere.' "
He also had, "Nice try, but now let's look at the facts."
Mr. Santorum tried to get out, "You're entitled to your opinion, but not to your own facts," but Mr. Romney waved him away with, "I've heard that one before."
Mr. Romney offered: "I don't want to save any Wall Street banks. I just want to make sure we don't lose all banks."
Mr. Paul had this one: "If bailouts are bad, they are bad and we shouldn't be doing it."
- 
8:55 P.M. | Fact Check: Santorum and Romney's Earmarks
In recent weeks, Rick Santorum's rivals - and Mitt Romney in particular - have hammered him over his use of earmarks while in Congress. John King, tonight's debate moderator, asked Mr. Santorum about the topic directly. He asked if there were any earmarks Mr. Santorum regretted and, pointing out that Mr. Santorum has attacked Mr. Romney over earmarks he secured to help the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, he asked if Mr. Santorum thought the Olympics were an improper use of earmarks.
In his answer, Mr. Santorum first defended his use of earmarks, as he has in the past. In multiple interviews, he has said that some are necessary, adding that there are "good earmarks and bad earmarks."
Switching to the Salt Lake City Olympics, which Mr. Romney helped turn around, Mr. Santorum said that he no problem with the federal funding Mr. Romney secured - in fact, Mr. Santorum volunteered, he had even voted in favor of some of the earmarks - but that Mr. Romney was a hypocrite for attacking Mr. Santorum over earmarks after having used them to his own advantage. Mr. Romney, he added, asked for "tens of millions" in federal funds to help save the 2002 Olympics.
This is largely true. When Mr. Romney headed to Utah, he did so with the help of about $1.5 billion in federal funding, including $60 million for security. The Democratic National Committee has already made an issue of Mr. Romney's own use of earmarks, including releasing a video that attacks him over the Olympics funds. .
In his answer, Mr. Santorum mentioned his specific use of earmarks. During his time in Congress, Mr. Santorum did request a lot of earmarks - Taxpayers for Common Sense, a budget watchdog group, estimates that he requested more than $1 billion. In the defense appropriations bill for the 2006 fiscal year, for instance, the group says that Mr. Santorum helped secure 54 earmarks, costing $124 million in federal financing.
When it was Mr. Romney's turn to respond, he accused Mr. Santorum, as he has in the past, of supporting the "Bridge to Nowhere," a bridge in Alaska that cost almost $400 million and was intended to connect Ketchikan to a sparsely populated island with an airport. In 2005, Mr. Santorum did vote with the majority of the Senate in favor of a transportation bill that included the bridge, though the money for it (roughly $225 million) was a minuscule portion of the overall bill, which was nearly $300 billion.
Though earmarks are currently being demonized by both parties, there is nothing inherently wrong with a legislator requesting federal spending in his or her home district or state, or setting aside federal money for a state project.

8:51 P.M. | Fact Check: The Auto Bailout and the U.A.W.
Several Republican candidates, especially Newt Gingrich, charged that President Obama gave in to the autoworkers' unions when his administration rescued the auto industry in early 2009, and Mr. Gingrich went so far as to say that Mr. Obama turned the companies over to the United Auto Workers.
The auto rescue of General Motors and Chrysler was worked out between the unions and management, with both sides making concessions they never had before as a condition for their federal loans, conditions set by the Obama administration's team. 
In contrast, a smaller rescue package in late 2008 from the Bush administration had no such conditions. Mr. Gingrich also cited a number of auto companies with operations in the United States that did not need bailouts, but he the ones he named are foreign-owned, like Toyota. The only major American company that did not take federal assistance was Ford, but Ford supported the rescue program because if G.M. and Chrysler had failed, that would have threatened the entire auto-manufacturing supply chain in the United States, which in turn would be a threat to Ford.
- 
8:48 P.M. | Candidates Trade Attacks on Earmarks
The Republican candidates for president just ended of one of the most extended national debates on federal earmarks ever in a presidential debate.
Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum first traded accusations, with Mr. Romney accusing his rival of being a prolific earmarker - with a line he had clearly prepared in advance.
"When I was fighting to save the Olympics, you were fighting to save the 'Bridge to Nowhere,' " Mr. Romney said.
After a back-and-forth, Mr. Santorum, looking exasperated, said, "You don't know what you're talking about." 
Mr. Gingrich piped in to say that not all earmarks are bad.
"If you have Barack Obama as president, and you have a Republican House, you may want the House imposing things on Barack Obama," said Mr. Gingrich, a former House speaker.
And then Ron Paul - who had been accused by Mr. Santorum of being one of the most prolific earmarkers in Congress - agreed with Mr. Santorum.
"If the Congress doesn't say the way the money is spent, it goes to the executive branch," Mr. Paul said. "That should be with the people and with the Congress."
- 
8:45 P.M. | Candidates Point Fingers on Bailouts
Is a bailout a bailout?
The Republican candidates are trading barbs about who supported which bailout for what reason.
Here's a bit of a scorecard:
Mr. Romney: supported Troubled Asset Relief Program bank bailout, opposed the bailout of the auto industry, supported the bailout of the airline industry after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
Mr. Santorum: Opposed TARP and auto bailouts, but says the airline bailout was legitimate because the federal government shut down the industry after 9/11.
Mr. Paul: "If bailouts are bad, they are bad and we shouldn't be doing it."
- 
8:37 P.M. | Fact Check: Repealing Health Care Law
Rick Santorum said repealing the health care insurance law that President Obama signed in 2010 would reduce the deficit. His rival Mitt Romney has repeatedly made the same claim in debates and repeatedly .
Mitt Romney said repealing the law would save $95 billion a year. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that the health care law would reduce deficits by $210 billion in the first decade from fiscal year 2012 through 2021 given taxes, fees and health cost reductions mandated by the law. Similarly, the office reported that legislation passed last year by the House Republican majority to repeal the law would increase deficits by the same amount.
While the budget office has declined to put an exact figure on projected savings of the health care law beyond the first decade, given the uncertainty of such long-range projections, it concluded that the savings would be in the range of half a percentage point of the nation's gross domestic product, a substantial amount. The Obama administration has projected that the savings in the second decade will exceed $1 trillion.
In November, the nonpartisan fact-checking group PolitiFact said of Mr. Romney's claim: "We rate his statement false." 
- 
8:32 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney and Massachusetts Taxes
Rick Santorum, rebutting claims that he expanded government spending in Congress, just claimed that Mitt Romney "raised taxes and fees" by $750 million as governor of Massachusetts. 
There is truth to that claim - though there is debate about the terminology. As governor, Mr. Romney raised more than $700 million in revenue through two major measures: first, he increased fees on a variety of government services, like the price of a commercial driving license; second, he closed dozens of corporate tax loopholes, requiring corporations to pay bigger tax bills. 
Were those, technically, "tax" increases? Mr. Romney did not think so, perhaps unsurprisingly - he had run for governor on a "no new taxes" pledge. But many Massachusetts business leaders - and the prominent Washington anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform - said otherwise. They assailed the changes as tax increases by another name.
 "They changed the laws and the rules to significantly raise taxes," Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, has said of Mr. Romney's corporate tax loophole changes. "That is a tax increase."
- 
8:25 P.M. | The 'Severe' Conservative 
Finally, an answer to a question that's been bugging everyone: what did Mitt Romney mean at the Conservative Political Action Conference when he said he was a "severely conservative" governor?
"Severe, strict," Mr. Romney said, responding to a question from John King, the moderator.
- 
8:24 P.M. | Santorum and Romney Focus on Each Other
Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum wasted no time in going at each other in the debate, accusing each other of being part of the problem when it comes to federal spending.
Mr. Romney went first, saying that Mr. Santorum had voted to raise the debt ceiling five times and had voted for programs like Planned Parenthood. The attacks echoed those coming from his campaign and his allies on the airwaves in Michigan and Arizona.
Mr. Santorum responded quickly that Mr. Romney had supported the increase in the debt ceiling last year - a point that Mr. Romney disputed, saying that he opposed the increase unless cuts had been enacted.
The back-and-forth continued, with Mr. Santorum saying that Mr. Romney had voted to raise taxes as governor of Massachusetts and Mr. Romney countering that government had doubled while Mr. Santorum was in Congress.
Mr. Paul got the first laugh of the night when he was asked why a recent ad accused Mr. Santorum of being "fake" when he claims to be a fiscal conservative.
"Because he's fake," Mr. Paul said, laughing.
Mr. Santorum, seated next to Mr. Paul, also laughed, and said, "I'm real, Ron, I'm real," while he showed Mr. Paul his hands.
- 
8:21 P.M. | Fact Check: Gingrich and a Balanced Budget
Trip Gabriel previously looked at Mr. Gingrich's claim that he helped balance the budget four years in a row: 
Newt Gingrich has made a campaign theme out of how the economy improved when he was last in office, as speaker of the House in the 1990s. In his first answer, challenged about his conservative credentials, Mr. Gingrich said he was responsible for four consecutive balanced budgets and paid down $400 billion on the national debt.
But in only two years when he was speaker was the budget balanced, in fiscal 1998 and 1999. Although the government remained in the black for two more years, Mr. Gingrich left office in January 1999 and had no role in those later budgets. The total surplus when he was speaker was $194.9 billion, not $400 billion.
And it takes two to tango - Mr. Gingrich didn't mention that these years of government surpluses were the result of policies that fostered an economic boom, many worked out with President Bill Clinton. Mr. Gingrich opposed a 1993 tax increase widely credited with helping to begin reducing the deficit.
- 
8:09 P.M. | The Audience Effect
Will the audience be a factor tonight?
The reaction from the crowds at these debates has been as much a factor in past debates as the statements from candidates on the stage.
From the applause at the beginning of the debate, it looks as if it might be a pretty rowdy crowd. That could help Newt Gingrich, if he manages to whip the audience members into a frenzy, like he did in South Carolina.
But Mitt Romney has had his luck with the crowds, particularly in Florida. And Rick Santorum and Ron Paul get their share of hoots and hollers of approval, too.
- 
8:06 P.M. | Latest Polls Show Romney and Santorum in Tight Race
The race in Michigan between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum has been narrowing this week, with the latest polls released on Wednesday reinforcing how competitive the state has become for the two candidates. 
Asurvey conducted by Epic-MRA for The Detroit Free Press and WXYZ-TV shows Mr. Santorum with 37 percent to Mr. Romney's 34 percent, a difference that is within the margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.
About 12 percent were undecided, and nearly half said they could change their minds before the primary on Tuesday, according to the poll of 400 likely voters.
As he has in other states with early and absentee voters, Mr. Romney holds the lead by far among those who said they voted by absentee already in Michigan.
But the president of Epic MRA, Bernie Porn, told WXYZ-TV that Tuesday's turnout might be the key to a decisive victory. The Michigan primary is open, so independents could be influential, especially for Mr. Romney. 
Mr. Porn indicated that if turnout was lower, presumably made up of mostly dedicated Republican primary voters, Mr. Santorum might have the advantage. (A majority of those surveyed described themselves as Tea Party supporters, conservatives and anti-abortion, all of whom are among the party's base.)
But if the primary generated enthusiasm among independents as well, Mr. Porn suggested, Mr. Romney would do better. 
Earlier today, a poll released by NBC News/Marist also showed a very close race between the two leading candidates: Mr. Romney at 37 percent and Mr. Santorum at 35 percent, a slight edge for Mr. Romney that's within the survey's margin of sampling error.
For the first time in this season's polls, a gender gap surfaced, showing a lessening of support among women for Mr. Santorum in Arizona that some may attribute to comments he has made about women in combat roles and about his personal disapproval of contraception. 
But in Michigan, the gap was slight for Mr. Santorum in the NBC News/Marist poll. And in the Epic-MRA poll, the difference among female voters is still small, with Mr. Romney receiving 37 percent and Mr. Santorum 33 percent. But on the other side, Mr. Santorum is winning far more men than Mr. Romney, 41 percent to 29 percent, respectively.
- 
7:51 P.M. | Obama Signs Payroll Tax Extension into Law
Less than half an hour before the start of the Republican presidential debate, the White House has released a statement saying that President Obama has signed the payroll tax cut bill into law.
The statement from the White House, e-mailed to reporters at 7:37 p.m. Eastern time, said: "H.R. 3630, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 extends through Dec. 31, 2012: (1) a reduction in employment tax rates for employees and the self-employed; (2) an initial eligibility for emergency unemployment compensation and 100 percent federal funding for extended unemployment insurance benefits; and (3) a Medicare physician payment update delaying a rate reduction for physician services. Also extends assistance for needy families through Sept. 30, 2012."
The release also included a link to a photo of the president signing the bill into law. That can be seen here.
The White House had pushed for an extension of the cut in the payroll tax, arguing that to allow a tax increase would put the brakes on the economic recovery.
But it was also a politically important victory for the president, who wants to argue during the fall's presidential election that he is working on behalf of middle-class, working Americans.
Moments after the statement from the White House came an e-mail from David Plouffe, one of the president's senior advisers, trumpeting the signing.
"Extending the payroll tax cut was a critical step for middle-class families, but we still have a lot more work to do. So get ready," Mr. Plouffe wrote to the president's supporters.

7:36 P.M. | Video: Looking Back on the Debates

David Carr and Brian Stelter look back on 20 debates from the Republican primary season and assess the level of debate fatigue that has set in.
- 
7:17 P.M. | What to Watch for in Wednesday's Debate
In the numerous televised debates among Republican candidates during the past year, Rick Santorum has never been at center stage. That changes Wednesday night.
Mr. Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, is taking his turn as the principal opponent for Mitt Romney during a debate in Arizona hosted by CNN and moderated by John King, one of the network's anchors. The debate, which will also include Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich, starts at 8 p.m. Eastern time.
For Mr. Santorum, the debate will be his final opportunity to offer his message nationally in advance of next Tuesday's primaries in Arizona and Michigan. And it will offer the most risk that a stumble or gaffe could put the brakes on his recent momentum in those states.
Aides to Mr. Santorum are aware of his need to avoid mistakes and project a broad appeal to voters who have reservations about choosing Mr. Romney as the standard-bearer of the party.
But they are also eager to see Mr. Santorum go after what they believe are Mr. Romney's vulnerabilities with conservative voters.

HEADLINE: Arizona Republican Debate Fact Check

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Times reporters take a closer look at some of the statements made by the Republican presidential candidates in Wednesday night's debate. 

 BODY:
Romney and the Auto Bailout
Mitt Romney provided a more nuanced explanation of his opposition to the federal loan package that helped rescue the auto industry in 2008 and 2009, saying there was "no way" he would have let American car companies implode. But a bipartisan group of auto industry executives, government officials and financial experts have said that if General Motors and Chrysler had followed his advice at the time and gone into bankruptcy, implosion is exactly what would have happened.
The context is Mr. Romney's 2008 New York Times Op-Ed, in which he argued that Chrysler and General Motors should not receive federal aid. "Detroit needs a turnaround, not a check," he wrote.
But auto industry executives and people who were involved in the government-mandated reorganization of the auto companies have said that the managed bankruptcy was not an option at the time Mr. Romney wrote his article. Furthermore, they have said, following a path into bankruptcy then would have caused far more severe job losses and even liquidation.
Mike Jackson, a Romney supporter and chief executive of AutoNation, the largest auto retailer in the country, said recently that Mr. Romney's position on the auto bailout was a "circle that can't be squared."
To go through a managed bankruptcy, tens of billions of dollars in financing would have been necessary. Auto executives and government officials have said that the only entity at the time that could have provided that level of financing was the federal government. In late 2008 and early 2009, the credit markets seized up, making financing on that scale virtually impossible to come by.
Mr. Romney and others have argued that the markets would have provided that money if the government demurred. But even Mr. Romney's former firm, Bain Capital, declined to help General Motors when asked in 2009 to invest in the automaker's European division, said one person with direct knowledge of the conversations.
The most problematic comment on the auto bailout, however, was made not by Mr. Romney but by Newt Gingrich, who said foreign automakers like Toyota and Nissan were doing "just fine" at the time the federal government bailed out domestic carmakers. Mr. Gingrich made the remarks in an attempt to draw a connection between the American auto companies' high labor costs and their decline. But at that point, car manufacturers were doing poorly regardless of whether they were foreign or domestic.
In early 2009, Toyota reported its first loss in 70 years -- $7.7 billion. Nissan was also in bad shape at that time, reporting $2.4 billion in losses. Honda, another Japanese automaker, also lost billions then.

Santorum on Contraception 
Rick Santorum had a hard time explaining his stance on contraception because he has made numerous statements that appear to be in conflict. 
Did he clear it up Wednesday night? Not really. "I have a personal moral objection" to contraception, he said, "but I've voted for bills that included it too." 
This drew a big boo from the audience.
Last year, Mr. Santorum told an evangelical blog, "One of the things I will talk about that no president has talked about before is, I think, the dangers of contraception in this country."
He added: "Many in the Christian faith have said, 'Well, that's O.K. Contraception's O.K.' It's not O.K. because it's a license to do things in the sexual realm that is counter to how things are supposed to be."
So, his position seems to be that while he personally opposes birth control, he would not ban it as president. But he did not spell it out clearly tonight. Then again, he successfully deflected Mr. Romney's attempt to press him on the issue by bringing up Mr. Romney's health care plan in Massachusetts.
-- 
Santorum Waffles on Title X
Mr. Santorum may have had a "I voted for it before I voted against it" moment Wednesday night.
In response to an assertion by Mr. Paul that he had voted to fund Planned Parenthood, Mr. Santorum said: "As Congressman Paul knows, I opposed Title X funding. I've always opposed Title X funding." He quickly added, "But it's included in a large appropriation bill that includes a whole host of other things." Here the audience started to boo.
Technically, Mr. Santorum was saying that he opposed Title X funding -- not that he voted against it -- but he was implying that he had voted against it. Then when he said it was included in a larger bill, the audience cried foul.
Title X, by the way, is the major funding vehicle for family planning programs. It was signed into law in 1970 by a Republican president, Richard Nixon, who declared, "Contraception for all."
Mr. Santorum said that because Title X "was always pushed through," he countered by pushing for Title X to provide funding for abstinence programs, saying they "actually work in keeping children from being sexually active instead of facilitating children from being sexually active."
Finally, he got around to an admission: "Yes, I -- I admit I voted for large appropriation bills and there were things in there I didn't like."
His bottom line, he said, is that as president, "I will defund Planned Parenthood; I will not sign any appropriation bill that funds Planned Parenthood."
Mr. Santorum's recent statements are likely to add to the confusion about his stance on the issue. Since 2006, he has cited his support for Title X to show that he is not opposed to funding for contraception.
As recently as last week, on "CBS This Morning," Rick Santorum told the host, Charlie Rose, that he has no problems with federal funds for contraceptives, saying that he voted for Title X funds in the Senate.
-- 
Obama and Iran
Mr. Romney pressed his case that President Obama had practiced appeasement toward Iran, but he mischaracterized Mr. Obama's position on potential military action. The president has repeatedly said that military action against Tehran remains on the table.
It is also not true that Mr. Obama agreed to Russia's demand to give up missile defense facilities in Eastern Europe. He negotiated with Russia over the scale of the system, in an effort to win Moscow's agreement to the Start arms reduction treaty. In his discussion of national security, Mr. Romney also said the administration wanted to cut the Pentagon's budget by "roughly a trillion dollars," which is twice what Mr. Obama has suggested.
Mr. Santorum is correct in saying that in 2009, the Obama administration cut funding for a United States-based group that documented human rights abuses in Iran. But the State Department continues to finance other groups that seek to block censorship of the Internet in Iran. Mr. Santorum also slightly misstated Mr. Obama's decision to open an embassy in Syria. The United States withdrew its ambassador to Damascus under President George W. Bush; Mr. Obama decided to send an envoy back to Syria before withdrawing him recently because of the civil strife.
-- 
Expanding E-Verify 
When Mr. Romney spoke of Arizona as a model for fighting illegal immigration, he was referring to one of several laws Arizona passed in recent years that requires employers to confirm that new hires are legally authorized to work through a federal system called E-Verify. 
The system, which is voluntary at the federal level, has been growing rapidly, with 288,000 employers now using it nationwide. It has proven to be a reasonably effective and efficient way for employers to avoid hiring illegal immigrants, and it discourages those immigrants from seeking jobs in companies known to use the system. There is bipartisan support in Congress for some kind of national system to verify the immigration status and work authorization of new hires.
However, there has been debate over proposals currently before Congress to expand the E-Verify system, making it mandatory for all employers nationwide. If that happened, all new hires -- including Americans as well as immigrants -- would have to provide documentation to verify their identity and eligibility to work. Some critics, including Republicans, have said that could become another costly and intrusive federal mandate. 
E-Verify currently relies on data from the Social Security system, which has been shown to have errors that could be costly and time-consuming for Americans and legal immigrants to correct.
Also, farmers across the country are strongly opposed to making E-Verify mandatory nationwide without a new guest worker program to provide legal migrant labor for agriculture. So while the general idea that Mr. Romney proposes has support in theory, putting it into practice nationally is not easy -- particularly for Republicans.
That said, all four of the candidates avoided the hot-button issue: what to do about 11 million illegal immigrants already living in the country.
-- 
Gingrich and Earmarks
Earlier in the debate, three of the Republicans - Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Santorum and Mr. Romney -- jousted as they often do on the subject of earmarks, which are spending items that members of Congress insert in the annual appropriations bills to benefit a particular project or program backed by constituents or supporters. Mr. Romney has criticized both of his rivals for their use of earmarks when each was in Congress. As the moderator, CNN's John King, indicated, earmarked spending has always been a minuscule piece of federal spending - typically less than 1 percent.
Mr. King asked Mr. Gingrich to respond to Mr. Romney's criticism that Mr. Gingrich, as speaker of the House from 1995 through 1998, raised earmarking to an art form. Mr. Gingrich, rather than respond directly, recalled that the federal budget was balanced when he was speaker.
Mr. Gingrich, as speaker, did preside over a period in which the number and total cost of earmarks spiraled, and Republican leaders openly encouraged new members to seek earmarks to buttress their local standing. In 1992, when he was still in the minority, Representative Gingrich said, "I am committed to hunting down every appropriation ... that is some politician taking care of himself."
But in 1995, Mr. Gingrich's first year as speaker, the new Republican-led Congress approved a record 1,430 earmarked projects worth $10 billion, according to the conservative group Citizens Against Government Waste. The totals escalated annually. Mr. Gingrich was forced to resign his office in late 1998 after a fraud scandal and Republican election losses. But Republicans remained in control of the House through 2006, when there were 9,963 earmarks worth $29 billion. Disgust among conservative voters with the trend, and scandals surrounding the earmarks, was a factor that year in Republicans' election losses, which gave control of the House and Senate to Democrats.
Earmarks are still a part of the budget process, but Congress and the executive branch disclose them. And nonpartisan groups like Citizens Against Government Waste, with its annual "Pig Book," continue to report on the spending.
-- 
Controlling the Federal Debt
The Republican debate opened with a question from the audience that allowed each of the four remaining candidates to claim that they would bring the mounting federal debt under control. But nonpartisan analysts have concluded otherwise for the proposals to date from Mr. Romney, Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Santorum.
Another group will weigh in on Thursday: the U.S. Budget Watch project of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a longstanding nonprofit group that includes former members of Congress, administration officials and budget experts of both major parties, will issue a report showing that all three Republicans would add to the projected debt. Each candidate has proposed deep spending cuts in coming years, but the reductions are exceeded by the additional tax cuts they propose.
-- 
Santorum and Romney's Earmarks
In recent weeks, Mr. Santorum's rivals - and Mr. Romney in particular - have hammered him over his use of earmarks while in Congress. John King, tonight's debate moderator, asked Mr. Santorum about the topic directly. He asked if there were any earmarks Mr. Santorum regretted and, pointing out that Mr. Santorum has attacked Mr. Romney over earmarks he secured to help the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, he asked if Mr. Santorum thought the Olympics were an improper use of earmarks.
In his answer, Mr. Santorum first defended his use of earmarks, as he has in the past. In multiple interviews, he has said that some are necessary, adding that there are "good earmarks and bad earmarks."
Switching to the Salt Lake City Olympics, which Mr. Romney helped turn around, Mr. Santorum said that he no problem with the federal funding Mr. Romney secured - in fact, Mr. Santorum volunteered, he had even voted in favor of some of the earmarks - but that Mr. Romney was a hypocrite for attacking Mr. Santorum over earmarks after having used them to his own advantage. Mr. Romney, he added, asked for "tens of millions" in federal funds to help save the 2002 Olympics.
This is largely true. When Mr. Romney headed to Utah, he did so with the help of about $1.5 billion in federal funding, including $60 million for security. The Democratic National Committee has already made an issue of Mr. Romney's own use of earmarks, including releasing a video that attacks him over the Olympics funds. .
In his answer, Mr. Santorum mentioned his specific use of earmarks. During his time in Congress, Mr. Santorum did request a lot of earmarks - Taxpayers for Common Sense, a budget watchdog group, estimates that he requested more than $1 billion. In the defense appropriations bill for the 2006 fiscal year, for instance, the group says that Mr. Santorum helped secure 54 earmarks, costing $124 million in federal financing.
When it was Mr. Romney's turn to respond, he accused Mr. Santorum, as he has in the past, of supporting the "Bridge to Nowhere," a bridge in Alaska that cost almost $400 million and was intended to connect Ketchikan to a sparsely populated island with an airport. In 2005, Mr. Santorum did vote with the majority of the Senate in favor of a transportation bill that included the bridge, though the money for it (roughly $225 million) was a minuscule portion of the overall bill, which was nearly $300 billion.
Though earmarks are currently being demonized by both parties, there is nothing inherently wrong with a legislator requesting federal spending in his or her home district or state, or setting aside federal money for a state project.
-- 
The Auto Bailout and the U.A.W.
Several Republican candidates, especially Mr. Gingrich, charged that President Obama gave in to the autoworkers' unions when his administration rescued the auto industry in early 2009, and Mr. Gingrich went so far as to say that Mr. Obama turned the companies over to the United Auto Workers.
The auto rescue of General Motors and Chrysler was worked out between the unions and management, with both sides making concessions they never had before as a condition for their federal loans, conditions set by the Obama administration's team. 
In contrast, a smaller rescue package in late 2008 from the Bush administration had no such conditions. Mr. Gingrich also cited a number of auto companies with operations in the United States that did not need bailouts, but he the ones he named are foreign-owned, like Toyota. The only major American company that did not take federal assistance was Ford, but Ford supported the rescue program because if G.M. and Chrysler had failed, that would have threatened the entire auto-manufacturing supply chain in the United States, which in turn would be a threat to Ford.
-- 
Repealing Health Care Law
Mr. Santorum said repealing the health care insurance law that President Obama signed in 2010 would reduce the deficit. His rival Mr. Romney has repeatedly made the same claim in debates and repeatedly .
Mr. Romney said repealing the law would save $95 billion a year. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that the health care law would reduce deficits by $210 billion in the first decade from fiscal year 2012 through 2021 given taxes, fees and health cost reductions mandated by the law. Similarly, the office reported that legislation passed last year by the House Republican majority to repeal the law would increase deficits by the same amount.
While the budget office has declined to put an exact figure on projected savings of the health care law beyond the first decade, given the uncertainty of such long-range projections, it concluded that the savings would be in the range of half a percentage point of the nation's gross domestic product, a substantial amount. The Obama administration has projected that the savings in the second decade will exceed $1 trillion.
In November, the nonpartisan fact-checking group PolitiFact said of Mr. Romney's claim: "We rate his statement false." 
-- 
Romney and Massachusetts Taxes
Mr. Santorum, rebutting claims that he expanded government spending in Congress, just claimed that Mr. Romney "raised taxes and fees" by $750 million as governor of Massachusetts. 
There is truth to that claim -- though there is debate about the terminology. As governor, Mr. Romney raised more than $700 million in revenue through two major measures: first, he increased fees on a variety of government services, like the price of a commercial driving license; second, he closed dozens of corporate tax loopholes, requiring corporations to pay bigger tax bills. 
Were those, technically, "tax" increases? Mr. Romney did not think so, perhaps unsurprisingly -- he had run for governor on a "no new taxes" pledge. But many Massachusetts business leaders -- and the prominent Washington anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform -- said otherwise. They assailed the changes as tax increases by another name.
 "They changed the laws and the rules to significantly raise taxes," Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, has said of Mr. Romney's corporate tax loophole changes. "That is a tax increase."
-- 
Gingrich and a Balanced Budget
Trip Gabriel previously looked at Mr. Gingrich's claim that he helped balance the budget four years in a row: 
Mr. Gingrich has made a campaign theme out of how the economy improved when he was last in office, as speaker of the House in the 1990s. In his first answer, challenged about his conservative credentials, Mr. Gingrich said he was responsible for four consecutive balanced budgets and paid down $400 billion on the national debt.
But in only two years when he was speaker was the budget balanced, in fiscal 1998 and 1999. Although the government remained in the black for two more years, Mr. Gingrich left office in January 1999 and had no role in those later budgets. The total surplus when he was speaker was $194.9 billion, not $400 billion.
And it takes two to tango -- Mr. Gingrich didn't mention that these years of government surpluses were the result of policies that fostered an economic boom, many worked out with President Bill Clinton. Mr. Gingrich opposed a 1993 tax increase widely credited with helping to begin reducing the deficit.

HEADLINE: Tax Breaks: A Primer

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: An explanation of tax expenditures, the modern form of earmarking. 

 BODY:
On Wednesday the Obama administration released its proposalto revamp corporate taxes, partly by cutting "loopholes and subsidies" that enable so many savvy companies to pay so little. The proposal also happens to add its own new loopholes and subsidies, most prominently for manufacturing companies.
Such "loopholes and subsidies" are formally called tax expenditures. The name comes from the fact that they are arithmetically equivalent to spending government money.
Here's how: Charging a company one dollar less in taxes is effectively the same as giving a company one dollar; both leave the government with one dollar less, and the company with one dollar more. But politically, calling the subsidy a "tax break" sounds a lot better than calling it a "spending" gift.
Tax expenditures can come in many forms, including deferrals, special tax rates and tax credits, and inhabit both the personal and corporate income tax codes. (Tax expenditures actually cost the government a lot more money on the personal income tax side.) Some well-known examples include the mortgage interest deduction and exclusions for employer-sponsored health insurance.
Economists generally discourage the use of tax expenditures, for three basic reasons.
First, tax expenditures distort market behavior - which they're sometimes designed to do, and sometimes not.
Second, they junk up the tax code, causing taxpayers to spend more time and money just to comply with tax law, and to a large extent help people rich enough to hire sophisticated accounting firms.
Third, tax expenditures add up to a ton of money.
Every time Congress creates some sort of tax break for a pet cause, it deprives the federal government of some revenue from taxes that go unpaid. Individually, this may not seem so damaging. So what if the tiny arrow-making industry gets a special tax break? The problem is we now have so very many such tax breaks.
Altogether, tax expenditures reduced government revenues by around $700 billion to $1.2 trillion last year, depending on how broadly you define the term. To put this in context, the federal deficit was about $1.3 trillion last year.
The chart at the top of this post shows the total number of tax expenditure provisions in the tax law (pink dashed line) and the total amount of revenue lost because of those provisions, as a share of the size of the economy (teal solid line). The data were crunched by Leonard E. Burman, a public affairs professor at Syracuse University, and Marvin Phaup, a research scholar at George Washington University.
As you can see, the number of tax expenditures on the books plummeted after the 1986 tax code overhaul, when Congress decided the tax system needed a more or less clean slate because it was so complicated. But over time, the number of provisions has crept back up.
Many of the provisions affect relatively small amounts of money, so that the total amount of revenue on which the government misses out has increased relatively little. Tax expenditures have varied from a low of 5.8 percent of the economy in the 1990s to around 7 percent today. The higher number of provisions, of course, makes filing tax returns more complicated, even if the amount of money at stake is about the same.
Despite the fiscal downsides to tax expenditures, they are politically difficult to eliminate.
Each deduction or subsidy has a constituency, after all, that really wants it to stay. And just as earmarks used to serve as the bacon that members of Congress brought home to their constituents, tax expenditures are now an effective way for politicians to show their states or districts that someone is looking out for them.
Here's a chart, also from Professor Burman, showing the number of requests that Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation has received each legislative session to score proposals - to estimate how much a bill will affect revenues or spending. A vast majority are for revenue estimates:
As the chart implies, interest in passing new tax breaks shows no sign of abating, and getting everybody in Congress on board to wipe the slate clean again looks increasingly challenging.
Here is a list of the tax expenditures that subtract the most from federal revenues. They are all extremely popular, and extremely difficult to dismantle politically.

HEADLINE: Sales of Existing Homes Rise 4.3%

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Sales of previously occupied homes rose in January to the highest annual rate in nearly two years, a hopeful sign ahead of the spring-buying season.
The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that home sales increased 4.3 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.57 million. That is the highest level since May 2010. 
Home sales have risen nearly 13 percent over the last six months. While they are still well below the 6 million that economists equate with a healthy market, the gains have coincided with other changes in the market that suggest slow but steady improvement.
''The trend is clearly upward,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.
Single-family home sales rose 3.8 percent in January, also a positive sign. And the number of first-time buyers, who are critical to a housing recovery, increased slightly to make up 33 percent of all sales. That is still below 40 percent, which tends to signal a healthy market.
One concern is the market is still saturated with homes at risk of foreclosure, which lower broader home prices. Those increased to make up 35 percent of sales.
And prices continued to fall. But economists noted that the pace of the decline was slowing. The median sales price dropped in January to $154,700. That is down only 2 percent from the same month last year.
And the supply of homes on the market has plunged to 2.3 million, the lowest level in almost six years. At last month's sales pace, it would take more than six months to clear those homes, consistent with a healthy housing market. Fewer homes on the market could help bolster prices over time.
Most economists said the January report was encouraging, especially when viewed with other recent positive housing data.
''The rise in existing home sales in recent months adds to the indication from housing starts, building permits, and homebuilder sentiment that the sector has improved modestly since the middle of 2011,'' said John Ryding, an economist at RDQ economics.
Much of the optimism has come because hiring has picked up. More jobs are critical to a housing rebound. In January, employers added 243,000 net jobs -- the most in nine months -- and the unemployment rate fell to 8.3 percent, the lowest level in nearly three years.
Analysts caution that the damage from the housing bust is deep and the industry is years away from fully recovering. Since the bubble burst, sales have slumped under the weight of foreclosures, tighter credit and falling prices.
Sales rose across the country in January. They rose on a seasonal basis by nearly 9 percent in the West, 3.5 percent in the South, 3.4 percent in the Northeast and 1 percent in the Midwest.

HEADLINE: For 41 Years, Town Cheers Danny's Boys

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

 BODY:
KLAMATH FALLS, Ore. -- Danny Miles is a coach.
For four decades, he has coached here, mostly basketball, through the collapse of the logging industry and the Klamath Basin water crisis, for more wins than all but three coaches at any level in the history of college basketball. He turned down other jobs, at bigger schools, in larger towns. He was fired and rehired, divorced and remarried, thought he had prostate cancer and found out he did not. At the Oregon Institute of Technology, where they slashed his athletics budget so low at times he almost quit, they also named the basketball court after him.
So there Danny Miles stood in late December, pacing the sideline at Danny Miles Court. The night before, his players stumbled at home, losing there for the first time since 2008, ending the nation's longest home winning streak. This had produced an unintended casualty: Miles's voice.
His players, the Hustlin' Owls, known as Danny's Boys to the locals, strained to hear the instructions Miles whispered. They took their cues from the color of his bald head, which turns crimson when embarrassed, scarlet when angry and beet red when ready to explode. On this night, when his team topped Concordia University of Portland on the way to obtaining the No. 1 ranking for N.A.I.A. Division II colleges, Miles rarely reddened. 
Win No. 954 was in hand.
Most 66-year-olds collect social security. Miles, while technically retired, still collects basketball victories like stamps. Before this season, Oregon Tech totaled every game Miles ever coached, at different levels of basketball, softball and baseball. The count was 1,816 victories. The walls to his upstairs ''man cave'' contain letters from famous basketball coaches, among them Mike Krzyzewski, Dean Smith and Bobby Knight, and two presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. His bust resides in three halls of fame.
This season, his Owls, still Hustlin', have already qualified for their national tournament, held next month in Point Lookout, Mo. They did so despite the death of Nathan Maddox, a redshirt sophomore who committed suicide Feb. 12. Maddox left a four-page note, Miles said, and died with a Bible in his lap, turned to John 3:16. Miles called the past two weeks the toughest stretch of his career.
For years at the school he calls ''my Notre Dame,'' Miles drove the team van to away games, washed the sweat from uniforms and endured 13-hour bus rides up mountain passes and through storms. ''All the way home, I'm thinking, As soon as I get back, I'm turning in my resignation. This time, for sure, I'm going to retire,'' Miles said. ''And here I am.''
He shrugged.
''I'm a coach.''
Win No. 900: Of the victories Miles can remember, none meant more than this milestone, reached in February 2010. Oregon Tech trounced Southern Oregon, its biggest rival and Miles's alma mater, while wearing pink jerseys to raise awareness for breast cancer. (The institute's former president, Martha Anne Dow, died of breast cancer in 2007.)
In honor of 900, the school gave Miles his own parking spot. For weeks he left his cramped, windowless office and found the car parked one spot left, or two spots right, of his assigned space. He wondered if he had sustained too many concussions playing college football. He told his wife he needed to see a doctor. At that point his assistants told him the truth about the car.
They had been moving it.
The streets of downtown Klamath Falls, where the Umpqua Dairy serves its signature ice cream and the Daily Bagel names sandwiches after newspapers, feel transported from a simpler time, which, most definitely, this is not. For all of its charm, Main Street is pocked with empty storefronts, and organizers of Occupy Klamath Falls tied black ribbons on each in protest.
Todd Kellstrom grew up here, before he became mayor, back when young men would graduate high school, work in the mills and carve themselves a life. Back when unemployment was not 12.6 percent. Over breakfast at Klamath Falls Grill -- its special that morning: French toast and bacon for $5.99 -- Kellstrom delved into local history and how it related to Oregon Tech.
Klamath Falls saw logging and farming begin to decline in the 1970s, in large part, Kellstrom said, ''because the environmental stuff hit and just kicked the hell out of us.'' So the city started to redefine itself, with highways that run in every direction, with a nearby airport and railroad, with nature as the backdrop.
Manufacturing companies started to return. Unemployment dropped as low as 6.6 percent.
In 2001, the local economy fell again, below depressed. A drought hit in the summer. Wildlife protections, mandated by the federal government, kept irrigation water from the farmers who needed it, desperately, immediately, for potatoes and hay, some $200 million worth of crops.
Residents formed a bucket brigade, stood six or seven deep, passing buckets of water for miles from the irrigation canal down Main Street. The local college basketball coach stood among them. His team would win its first national championship in 2004, the stands dotted with farmers and environmentalists, loggers and businessmen, all walks galvanized by a single force.
''Oregon Tech is the cohesive element in our community,'' Kellstrom said. ''It gives us something to look forward to in rough times, and this is one of them.''
Win No. 1: In his first season as head basketball coach, Miles made $9,000 for coaching in three sports. His basketball team started 0-3. Then, on Dec. 7, 1971, Oregon Tech beat Northwest College for the first victory of his career.
A neighbor knocked on his door. ''Danny, you don't know me,'' the neighbor said. ''But I'm a real basketball fan. Congratulations. You're going to win a lot more of those.''
Before he became a coach, Miles lived with one. His father, Claude Miles, played professional baseball in the early 1900s, and when he settled with his wife and three boys in Medford, Ore., he built a baseball field in the cow pasture behind the family home, complete with a grass infield, a backstop and dugouts -- Field of Dreams without the corn. (One of Miles's brothers was murdered in Montana more than three decades ago.)
His son, Danny, known as Little General in the neighborhood, later played quarterback at Southern Oregon. In 1965 he set a record with a 77.9 percent completion percentage. He also led the nation in total offense.
When he turned 24, Oregon Tech called. Miles figured he would stop there for a year, maybe two, on the way to someplace else, someplace better. The school hired him to assist with three sports: basketball (1-21 the year before), football (0-9) and baseball (3-23). As the third-base coach, Miles remembered, ''The whole first year, I don't think I waved anybody home.'' In his second season, Miles became the head basketball and baseball coach.
In those days, Miles read Street & Smith's sports annuals, and he would write to dozens of players, even hundreds, who did not make the magazine's first-, second, or third-team all-American list. His path crossed with Tony Gwynn and Rickey Henderson and Dirk Nowitzki, none of whom ended up at Oregon Tech.
Other schools soon started calling. Southern Oregon, then Western Washington, then Hawaii-Hilo, then Southern Oregon again. The timing never felt right. Miles stopped updating his resume. He no longer has one.
In 1992, he and the rest of the athletic department gathered downstairs in the same conference room his team now uses to watch video. Without warning, every one of them was fired. The school dropped football. It rehired Miles and the softball coach, but both lost tenure.
Seven years ago, faced with another round of cuts, Miles ''retired'' but stayed on as basketball coach. In doing so, he saved two jobs. See, even in retirement, he never left. He still arrives at 8 a.m. each morning, still works deep into the night. He loves the city and loves the school, and now his grandson, a freshman guard, has joined the team.
Still, even Chris Maples, president of Oregon Tech, said, ''It's hard to explain why we've been able to hang on to him.''
Win No. 400: Miles can hardly remember Nos. 200 (1981 over Lewis & Clark) or 300 (1986 over La Verne), but his next milestone proved difficult to forget. It came Jan. 19, 1990, when Oregon Tech traveled to Redding, Calif. It was the longest game in school history, and it lasted more than five hours and unfolded in two gyms.
All because one of Miles's players shattered the backboard with a dunk.
Miles always found basketball a selfish game. He believed, even 40 years ago, in the value of players who took charges, blocked shots and dished out assists, as opposed to more visible stars content less with winning than with scoring.
In his office one afternoon, Miles poured those beliefs into a formula, his formula. He added points (one point), rebounds (one point), assists (two points) and recoveries (block, steal, charge taken, two points each) and divided by missed field goals (two points), missed free throws (one point), turnovers (two points) and fouls (two points).
Miles called his formula the Value Point System. He has used it ever since to determine playing time and his rotation. In fact, he dedicates the first 45 minutes of practice to drills that reinforce that system, that focus on fundamentals, motion, footwork, precision.
''He thought of this in 1970,'' said Mike Pisan, a longtime assistant. ''That's how he thinks. He's a percentage guy. He was 'Moneyball' before the book came out.''
Armed with four decades of data, Miles can usually calculate how his team will play based on its V.P.S. score in practice, which is about 0.15 higher than in games. In each of his previous two seasons, Miles expected his teams to struggle. Their V.P.S. scores indicated otherwise. They won 30 games each year.
With players, any individual score over 1.75 is considered superior and any player who rates 1.36 or better usually ends up starting. To underscore his point, Miles pointed to Josh Wetzler, an Australian who graduated in 2009 and ''couldn't shoot a lick,'' but accumulated a V.P.S. of 2.15, second highest ever in the program.
For further evidence, Miles calculated historical comparisons. Magic Johnson held a 2.08 V.P.S., John Stockton a 2.06. Michael Jordan came in at 1.52, but that also reflected the level of talent that surrounded him, with Scottie Pippen (1.58) and Dennis Rodman (1.70) also high scorers. Kobe Bryant, meanwhile, tallied a 1.34, Stephon Marbury a 1.18.
Miles never patented his formula, but he sells an instructional video online and travels overseas to conduct clinics. Teams use his system in Germany, Rwanda, Kenya and much closer to home. The Oregon Tech women's team recently switched to Miles's system.
So did one of his opposing coaches. John Van Dyke had never heard of Miles when he arrived at Northwest College. Now, he keeps a file in his office with questions he wants to ask Miles the minute he retires. Van Dyke saw that Miles's teams played up-tempo and shot more 3-pointers than most teams, yet often finished in the top five in the country in assist-to-turnover ratio.
''His guys play harder than 99 percent of the teams in the United States,'' Van Dyke said. ''But they play smarter, too. His system changed the culture of my team. I don't have to be the motivator to get guys to do what I want. It's all there in their V.P.S.''
Win No. 620: After Nos. 500 (when Owl Court became Danny Miles Court in 1995) and 600 (when Miles became the winningest coach in Oregon state history in 1998), Oregon Tech traveled to College of Idaho in February 2000. The Owls needed to win to advance to the national tournament.
They trailed, with 2.5 seconds remaining, when guard Greg Regan (career V.P.S. 2.16, highest ever for the program), caught the inbounds pass and launched what Miles called a 74-footer from the top of the opposite key. The buzzer sounded, game over, while the ball floated through the air, and Idaho fans applauded an apparent victory until they realized the shot went in and counted.
''Danny was jumping up and down, doing these little pirouettes,'' said Bob Kingzett, an Oregon Tech fan who heads the basketball fund-raising. ''He looked like a little ballerina.''
Most major-college basketball teams have a student section. Oregon Tech has a student section, a senior section and a special needs section. The senior section, nicknamed the Terrace, is across from the home bench on a diagonal. As ''We Will Rock You'' blared over the loudspeakers in December, occupants tapped their canes and walkers to the beat. (''We will, we will, rock you,'' tap, tap.) Miles estimated his crowd's median age at 55.
Behind the bench, the group known as Miles's Menagerie occupies the first few rows. Most of them are developmentally disabled. In 2010, they took turns as honorary captains. Each year they play Oregon Tech in a charity game. (Each year they win.)
None befriended Miles, though, quite the way Steven Arnholt, Oregon Tech's autistic superfan, did. Known to everyone as Stevie, he and Miles met in 1968. They used to run together. Stevie accompanied Miles on dates, went with Miles to church and often called at 4:30 a.m. to recap ''Scooby Doo'' episodes.
These days, Stevie arrives at the basketball offices most mornings, watches ''Perry Mason'' at 11 and ''Jeopardy!'' reruns after that. He performs spot-on impressions of Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne and Rodney Dangerfield. He also proofreads the game program and can recall statistics, with savant-like accuracy, from Oregon Tech victories 20 years ago.
Each year, Stevie must make 6 of 10 free throws in front of the team to accompany the Owls to Southern Oregon. If he fails, the team then votes, and Stevie stands there, peeking through the hands covering his eyes. Miles drives Stevie home after games, win or lose. After one defeat, he grabbed Miles's cheeks. ''Coach, the sun will come out tomorrow,'' he said.
Oregon Tech also employs Tony Hartley as its public-address announcer. He once worked in the same capacity for the Portland Trail Blazers, and Miles lauded his ''gift of voice.'' Hartley, though, is blind, legally in his right eye, totally in his left. He calls games -- ''Here come your Hustlin' OOWWLLSS!'' -- with information relayed from others on press row.
Miles, Hartley said, ''stuck with me.'' He added: ''That's the thing I like about him. He's not big time, not flamboyant. He's one of us.''
Win No. 700: As this milestone approached, Oregon Tech opened its season 22-0. The Oregonian sent a reporter here for a feature article. Oregon Tech lost one game, then two, then three, which almost never happens. Then, on Feb. 8, 2003, Miles and his Owls toppled -- who else? -- Southern Oregon.
Miles received a letter from Lute Olson, the longtime Arizona basketball coach. ''With such a great start, I believe 800 wins is right around the corner,'' he wrote.
Smart guy, that Olson.
The current crop of Danny's Boys includes a 32-year-old Native American forward (Scotty Riddle) who once fought fires and worked construction and ''partied too much'' and now plays basketball and raises three children; one player from Australia, another from New Zealand; a Mormon; and a former Mr. Basketball in Nevada, a freshman guard named Bobby Hunter, who could become the best player in Oregon Tech history.
For all of their differences -- the Australian, Josh Johnson, for instance, recently saw snow and shot a gun for the first time -- the players conform to the Miles way. This means no long hair, no facial hair and relatively few tattoos. Most redshirt.
All must attend class at a university as rigorous as any in the state. The school started in 1947 for military veterans to earn vocational degrees. The first three programs were auto mechanics, auto body repair and commercial cooking. Over the years, it transitioned into engineering, computer science and health sciences. It created the country's first renewable engineering program. At one point, its job placement rate reached 98 percent.
The school seized a central role in the community, anchored by the basketball program that won so many games. Kingzett, who runs the Jeld-Wen Foundation, part of the largest company in Klamath Falls and the largest door manufacturer in the world, started roughly 14 years ago raising the money necessary to send Oregon Tech to its national tournament, now in Missouri.
If the Owls advance halfway through the tournament, the bill runs roughly $30,000. By simply passing a hat, Kingzett & Co. can raise two-thirds of that in 48 to 72 hours. But the fund-raisers did not stop there. They paid for not one, but two video boards, with pixel counts similar to those in N.B.A. arenas, for about $175,000. ''It doesn't hurt that Danny is an icon,'' Kingzett said.
Fund-raisers also bought the new floor, the same one Kentucky won its N.C.A.A. regional on last season, for $170,000. It was sanded and repainted, shipped here and reassembled like a giant puzzle with help from the baseball team, coached in part by one of Miles's three sons. The first home loss since 2008, the one from late December, was the first game played on the new floor, which fans the next day wanted Miles to remove.
This is a place where when it snows heavily, the sheriff tells fans not to attend games and Oregon Tech sells out anyway. But Miles is sometimes mildly uncomfortable with the attention lavished on his program. He changed the schedule to eliminate most flights, trimmed the budgets and split $11,000 among three assistant coaches.
''I don't know if you can say, straight up, Danny Miles is the reason this town has stayed together,'' said Steve Matthies, the sports editor at the local Herald and News. ''But he's the one guy who could run for office here and wouldn't have to campaign.''
Win No. 950: Miles won this game this season but barely acknowledged it. He shook hands with Pisan, his assistant coach, accepted congratulations and went back to watching video.
Miles met his second wife, Judie, in 1987. His head turned purple, she said, ''redder than a beet,'' when they were introduced while both worked on a local play. He asked her out that night, and the next day they went to dinner. He sent her a dozen yellow, long-stemmed roses. In the play, he wore a pink tutu, a curly, blond wig and high-top sneakers. He still proposed a month later, then again, eight months after that.
She said yes, for many reasons. Among them:
''Danny has great legs,'' she said over coffee in December. ''Really, extremely muscular legs.''
They have been married since. Combined, they have 5 children and 19 grandchildren and a house with a sweeping view in a neighborhood so quaint Miles once counted 64 deer on his 10-mile drive to work.
When Judie looks at her husband now, she sees a man far different from the one she married. That man took losses so hard he could barely sleep. He freely admits that his obsession with coaching ended his first marriage. He kicked basketballs across gyms. In the game he still talks about more than any other -- old habits and all that -- his team led by 4 with four seconds left, was shooting a free throw and still lost.
Ten years ago Miles returned to church and committed himself to God. He has not received a technical foul in years. He admires Tim Tebow. His players said he yells half as much as he used to. One, the senior guard Kyle Gomez, said: ''I would almost say he's softened. But I don't want him to read that and come down on us.'' Another, the junior forward Alex Zerbach, whose father played for Miles, said Miles opened the recruitment with, ''Now, I'm a lot different than when I coached you.''
Faith now guides Miles where superstition once did -- during one playoff run he had Judie go to Burger King before games, pulling in and backing out the same way, ordering the same food; another time he left the gym during warm-ups because for weeks he had bought diet soda from the same pizza place and on that day he forgot. Where Miles once worried he would die when he quit coaching, he learned to let go.
Those close to Miles found an oddity there: the coach who won so many games cared less about winning the more victories he accumulated.
In recent years, Miles taught clinics in Africa and worked with U.S.A. Basketball's junior national team. Judie said she began to see his coaching as more of a calling, and this year she told Miles he could coach as long as he wanted. Maples, the school president, did ask Miles to give him a year's notice -- so Maples could retire first.
''Over the years, he's adjusted to all these issues, different decades, different players, changing times,'' Pisan said. ''But he's yet to relax on his principles. Sometimes he says something, and I go, oh, my God. But that's him. Everyone knows who he is -- this collage of a person.''
Miles owns part of a local wood-bat baseball team. A history buff, he devours autobiographies and books on the Kennedy assassination.
''Next time I drive to Medford with my blinker on, I'll know it's time to get out,'' he said.
Win No. 523: The most talked about of Miles's victories is not the national championship in 2004, or the second title in 2008. Instead, it took place in 1996, against Life University, an N.A.I.A Division I school that finished 37-1 that season. With seconds remaining, Miles turned to Jake Carr, a little-used reserve. Bobby Thompson, Oregon Tech's longtime radio announcer, said: ''He's got ice water in his veins. I'll let the crowd tell you.'' Carr made the first free throw to tie the score. The crowd roared. Life took a timeout. Carr prayed. When play resumed, Thompson said: ''Now, he gets another one. We'll tell you what the crowd says one more time.'' Carr made the second free throw. The crowd roared again. Oregon Tech won, 77-76.
Teammates lifted Carr, Oregon Tech's very own Rudy, off the ground and carried him into the locker room. Reached by telephone, Carr seemed amused that the team's fans still retell his tale. ''It's like the fish story,'' he said. ''I keep getting shorter and shorter. I'm not 5-7. I'm 5-11. But pretty soon I'll be 5 feet.''
Miles's legacy, what Kellstrom, the mayor, calls his ripple effect, his impact on thousands of players who affected thousands of others, became clear much later. A few years ago, Carr's wife and children left the house. He went for coffee. On his walk back he heard this ''huge boom'' from a neighbor's home. He believed the neighbor dealt ammunition. As he approached the house, he noticed it was on fire. He opened the door and saw heavy clouds of smoke. He heard the neighbor scream for help. He crawled on his hands and knees with bullets going off around him and dragged the neighbor to safety.
Why does one man coach in the same place for 41 years? For Stevie and Judie and Tony, for Klamath Falls, for Jake Carr and every player before and after. Miles and Carr still run into each other on occasion. Miles, Carr said, always talks about his team, the next practice, the next game, the next recruit. He never mentions all the wins.
And Carr still refers to Miles the same way. He calls him Coach.

HEADLINE: Reluctant Chief Hires Sales Rep

BYLINE: By PAMELA RYCKMAN

 BODY:
Last week, we published a case study recounting a dilemma faced by Action Ambulance, a provider of ambulance and transportation services to hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities and special-education programs within school systems. The 260-employee company, which is based in Wilmington, Mass., 17 miles north of Boston, was facing increasing competition. Its chief executive, Mike Woronka, believed a more aggressive approach to sales might lure business from his seven direct competitors and also expand Action's territory.
But targeted sales, Mr. Woronka said, are unusual in his industry, where account managers generally push gently and gradually for new business. He needed to decide whether he could train his existing account managers to be more proactive or whether he would need to hire a full-time sales representative to pursue new accounts. He also considered hiring a sales manager to oversee the team.
To help him develop a strategy, Mr. Woronka decided to retain a sales consultant, Suzanne Paling, who recommended that Action hire a full-time sales rep immediately. But Mr. Woronka went against Ms. Paling's advice. He decided instead to see if his account managers had the skills and motivation to chase new clients, and he asked Ms. Paling to train them in sales. 
After eight months, it was clear that the strategy was not working. ''We really struggled,'' Mr. Woronka said. ''The account executives struggled with the system and didn't buy into the concepts, and they weren't incentivized to close deals on a straight salary. It got heated and confrontational, and people became frustrated.''
Mr. Woronka let go of Ms. Paling, but he continued to be dissatisfied with his account managers' progress in sales. Two years later, he issued a mea culpa. He called Ms. Paling and asked if she would come back to help him recruit a professional sales rep.
''Because we're a small company, we were trying to manage sales in a cost-effective way,'' he said, ''but we were putting square pegs into round holes. The whole system floundered because we didn't want to make personnel changes. Suzanne helped us to understand that an effective salesperson has to have a certain personality. Our account managers were great at their jobs, but they didn't have sales personalities.''
In September 2010, Ms. Paling returned to write a job description for the professional sales representative Action needed. ''Much of the work had been done,'' Ms. Paling said. ''We'd just done it for the wrong people. Presidents or owners often assume a person with an outgoing demeanor will succeed in sales. But good salespeople are highly skilled professionals with perseverance, money motivation, the ability to prospect for new business, and the ability to close deals.''
Mr. Woronka hired a sales rep with 10 years experience in pharmaceutical sales and adopted a compensation plan Ms. Paling suggested, which gave the sales rep a higher base salary for a specified training period and then switched to a lower base as she began to generate about 60 percent of her $100,000 compensation through commission. Ms. Paling stayed on for two months to ensure the new rep hit the ground running; she coached, role-played and accompanied the rep to client meetings.
As a result, Mr. Woronka said, the sales rep is thriving. ''She has the right sales persona,'' he said. ''When she's in a meeting, she's always trying to get someone to make a commitment, asking when we can come back for more. She's always looking for the close.''
While Action's account managers were skeptical initially, the sales rep fit in well because responsibilities were clear up front. The rep lands accounts and immediately passes them on to the account managers, who nurture the relationships. Mr. Woronka said this proactive approach enabled Action Ambulance to prosper even in a recession. It helped increase annual revenue by at least $1.5 million (to $17 million), and last winter the company opened two new offices in Pittsfield, Mass., 143 miles from its headquarters. Mr. Woronka has been acting as the de facto sales manager, but he is now considering hiring another sales rep and a part-time sales manager.
Mr. Woronka recently discussed his decision and the results. A condensed version of the interview follows.
Q: Are the same two account managers still with the company?
Mr. Woronka: We still have one, but sadly, one passed away in December. So we've decided to hire another salesperson because I'm getting more value with the sales position than with the account management side of things.
Q: Has Action Ambulance succeeded in increasing its market share?
Mr. Woronka: We're having a tough time defining market share because our clients don't release that data. Not all the hospitals or nursing homes track the number of ambulance calls they make per month because it doesn't affect their cost structure or reimbursement. It's a vendor relationship, not a mission-critical function. But now my team is trying to define this stuff, getting to the why's behind everything instead of just going through the motions. They're thinking in terms of market share, number of beds, revenue and cost per trip. They're more engaged in asking better questions.
Q: Have you expanded any business lines?
Mr. Woronka: When we hired the salesperson, we had some targets we wanted to achieve in busing for special-needs kids. When she started, we were doing $4,000 of revenue per month and we've now grown that to $40,000 a month. Come September, her target is $80,000.
Q: Have your competitors become more aggressive about seeking new business?
Mr. Woronka: Eight or nine months ago, we got a call from one of our school districts who said a competitor had called to see if they could jump into the special-ed stuff there. The school district said they were happy with us. Now we know other people are following.
Q: How will you find a part-time sales manager? How will this person learn enough about the business and the people to manage the sales reps part-time? Does Ms. Paling endorse this plan?
Mr. Woronka: We're going to engage Suzanne again to hire another full-time salesperson and also a part- or quarter-time sales manager who can work with the sales force to hold them accountable, run the reports and keep them on top of building a pipeline. I don't have time as C.E.O. to do it. The salespeople and the account managers are now plugging their activities into C.R.M., so I'd envision the sales manager running the reports, viewing the activity, and meeting with them for progress updates. Because the sales force is mobile and on the road, there's no reason to have someone sitting in the office managing people who aren't there.
Q: On the blog, a commenter wrote that you need to ensure you have a compelling value proposition before hiring a sales rep or sales manager. What distinguishes Action from its peers?
Mr. Woronka: I thought that comment was interesting. It has been very difficult for us to define, but as health care evolves and changes, we're looking at new ways to differentiate ourselves. Hospitals are being forced to move patients out of their facilities with less notice than they had before. Five years ago, we knew almost 24 hours in advance that someone was going to move. Nowadays we receive 85 percent of our calls with 15 to 30 minutes notice about when patients are moving. Being in the metro-Boston area with traffic poses an interesting operational dilemma. How to get the service levels right? One thing we've done is to literally put a truck in the parking lot of hospitals we serve so we're ready to go at any time.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Tinseltown, Ghost Town

BYLINE: By HILARY DE VRIES. 
Hilary de Vries is an author and screenwriter.

 BODY:
Los Angeles
THE $26 billion foreclosure settlement deal announced this month arrived in the final throes of Hollywood's annual awards season. It also arrived too late for my neighbor, a screenwriter and director who moved out of her two-bedroom house the week before last, after her bank foreclosed on the property.
There had been no ''For Sale'' sign, no telltale rental tenant, no evidence of anything untoward in our canyon neighborhood, an enclave of writers, directors and actors. I saw nothing until the night I stood on my front steps, my heart in my mouth, and heard her sobbing scream -- ''I'm 47 years old, and I am going bankrupt!'' 
Now she is gone, another ''statistic,'' as she put it when I went next door to say goodbye as the movers loaded the last of her belongings. Her eviction follows that of our mutual neighbors, actors on a well-known soap opera forced out of their house in a foreclosure in a driving rainstorm four days before Christmas. Their dark, vacant houses, emblazoned with the public notices taped in the windows like shameful scarlet A's, are holes in the hidden, fraying social fabric of Hollywood, where a vast majority belong not to the 1 percent but to the 99.
Of the 11 million Americans under water on their homes and facing foreclosure, more than two million reside in California. None of the Hollywood guilds keep records of how many of their members are among them, but several unions and charitable performing arts foundations report an increase in members applying for emergency housing assistance. When two of my three immediate neighbors have been foreclosed on, there are undoubtedly untold screenwriters, actors, directors and others quietly, invisibly struggling to keep their homes.
Beyond the hype that culminates in the Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday, Hollywood is contracting, battered by the same economic forces reshaping the rest of the country. Moviegoing attendance hit a 16-year low last year. The industry is beset by rapidly changing business models: the free fall in DVD sales unmitigated by digital streaming, the independent film market that is a shadow of its former self. It all adds up to less. In Los Angeles, the number of television dramas produced last year dropped by 11.5 percent; reality shows were down 1.8 percent and sitcoms, 12.8 percent. On the feature side, the number of movies filmed here declined by an enormous 26.4 percent in the final quarter of last year.
What is less visible is the human toll of all that downsizing -- the working actors, directors, writers and others like my foreclosed neighbors, trying to maintain their guild memberships, their health insurance, their mortgages. In the industry's perverse social code, where appearances are everything, such private struggles are kept well hidden not only from public view but also within the industry itself. Failure is an affront to the accepted logic that, no matter what, Hollywood remains a lodestar of self-invention.
''People have no idea what's going on in Hollywood now,'' a prominent industry blogger told me recently when we met at what had been a favorite industry watering hole, empty that night. ''There's so little work, everyone is living off the money they made in the '90s,'' she added. ''But they're acting like nothing's changed.''
What I heard in my neighbor's screamed confession was the cracking of Hollywood's social code, which insists that no matter the private terrors, one is always ''great!'' We are in foreclosure, we are screaming in the night, but we are awesome in the light of day and on our Facebook pages.
I wasn't friends with my neighbor, but I have lived in Los Angeles long enough to know the accepted mores. When we said goodbye, I didn't tell her I had heard her that night. She told me she was worn out from two years of wrangling with her bank, one of those named in the settlement deal. She was moving on, she said, moving in with a friend in some other neighborhood. In her Twitter feed, there is no mention of her foreclosure or even her move.
But I am left feeling what I feel too often now in Los Angeles, an inchoate, uneasy impermanence, where it is possible to feel untethered from even the seasons. It's what I felt when I saw my other neighbors, the soap-opera actors, evicted with their crying child, their soaked belongings crammed into the back of a borrowed van, their dark, empty house with the holiday decorations still in the windows. It is their faces I see when I read about the foreclosure crisis and the multibillion-dollar settlement that will do nothing to restore my neighbors to their homes. Or to themselves.
They were all working professionals with many credits to their names. And they may be again. But their banks wouldn't bet on it. And I'm not sure the town does either. People still come to Hollywood with dreams of reinventing themselves. But the reality is much crueler and not so different from that in the rest of the country, where millions do not dream of reinvention but simply long to become who they used to be: people not forced from their homes in the driving rain or crying in the night that they are going bankrupt.
On Sunday, I will watch the Academy Awards with my absent neighbors in mind. I will remind myself it is winter. But tonight I will stand on my front steps, the air sweet with night-blooming mountain laurel, and I will not hear my neighbor scream.

HEADLINE: Shift in Virginia On Abortion Bill

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE; Erik Eckholm and Jennifer Preston contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia backed down on Wednesday on a bill requiring women to have a vaginal ultrasound before undergoing an abortion. It was a sudden change of position for a conservative governor who is viewed as having political ambitions on the national stage.
The bill had drawn intense national attention in recent days, with a large protest by women's health groups over the weekend and spoofs on left-leaning television shows. 
In a political year that was suppposed to be all about the economy, this was the second instance in a month in which a public outcry organized in part by women's health advocates through social media caused a reversal on the issue of abortion.
The governor's decision not to support the bill capped several days of brinkmanship in which opponents of the measure lobbied furiously against it, galvanizing opposition by drawing on the image of male lawmakers mandating a procedure that requires inserting a probe into the vagina. One Democrat was prompted to denounce it as a ''rape'' bill.
Opponents presented what they said were 33,000 signatures protesting the measure. At the same time, the mostly Republican supporters in the legislature kept putting off debate on the measure, raising suspicions that the governor might be balking.
Finally, on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. McDonnell, a rising star in the Republican Party who is often talked about as a candidate for vice president, told Republican delegates to make changes that softened the requirements in the legislation. Some political analysts speculated that the decision was made with an eye to a broader national audience that might not look favorably on the passage of such a conservative bill.
This month the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation yielded to pressure by affiliates and women's rights advocates and reversed its decision to largely end decades of partnership with Planned Parenthood.
In Virginia, in a written statement issued minutes before the House of Delegates was to debate the bill on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. McDonnell said that after discussion with doctors, lawyers and legislators, he had concluded that amendments were needed. He called for changes stipulating that the ultrasound be abdominal rather than vaginal. A doctor would be required to offer the next level of ultrasound, most often vaginal, but a woman would be free to reject it.
''Mandating an invasive procedure in order to give informed consent is not a proper role for the state,'' the governor said in the statement.
The Family Foundation, a strong backer of the ultrasound bill, made reference to the Komen decision in a note to supporters blasting Mr. McDonnell's reversal, saying that it was ''extremely disappointed in this outcome,'' particularly, it said, ''given the strong pro-life credentials of this governor.''
The change -- which passed the House in a vote of 65 to 32 -- softens the bill considerably, but did not abolish the requirement that women have an ultrasound. If it is signed into law, Virginia would become the 10th state to require such procedures, though the requirement has been stayed by court rulings in two states, Oklahoma and North Carolina.
Specifically, the bill's new wording would require a doctor to offer the woman a different type of ultrasound if the fetus is not viewable through an abdominal screening, but not require her to have one.
That opponents of the bill were successful in getting the language softened was a major success for them, particularly considering that vaginal ultrasounds are often administered before abortions anyway. A spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood said the group routinely includes ultrasounds ''as part of the thorough medical practice of abortion care,'' and gives the woman the option of viewing the image. But the group said a legal requirement that women undergo such a screening was politically motivated and ''is the very definition of government intrusion.''
Supporters of the bill hoped such a requirement would lead some women to change their minds about having abortions, as vaginal ultrasounds usually show detailed images. Many women's advocates called the bill an effort to shame women and said it intruded on their privacy.
Republicans, for their part, said the bill had been blown out of perspective by Democrats and liberal groups. State Senator Richard Black said that he participated in a call-in event on Wednesday morning with hundreds of constituents and that just one mentioned the ultrasound bill.
Abortion legislation was a ''tiny part'' of the larger body of hundreds of bills in play in the legislature, State Senator Steve Martin said. ''It's simply not a primary focus,'' he said. ''It only appears to be because people call me from New York newspapers acting as if it's some big deal.''
Democrats savored their victory, giving a news conference after the House debate, but said they were hoping the bill would still be killed.
''This is definitely a retreat for the governor,'' said State Senator Janet Howell, a Democrat from Northern Virginia. ''The national spotlight and ridicule has had an impact. The Republicans are scrambling for an out.''
But there was some concern among Democrats over a companion bill in the State Senate that has language identical to that in the old version. It is unlikely Senate Republicans would openly defy the governor and pass that bill, but Democrats said they were watching closely.
Besides, they said, the watered-down bill is still objectionable. ''It's still putting up a barrier to a woman trying to exercise her constitutional right,'' said Delegate Charniele Herring, a Democrat.
In yet another twist, the Republican sponsor of the Senate bill, Jill Vogel, said she would withdraw the legislation altogether, though it was not clear whether the rules would allow her to do so after its passage.
Delegate Bob Marshall, a Republican who had supported the bill, said the companion measure, which is due to be voted on as early as Thursday in a Senate committee, might not clear that hurdle, raising the specter of complete collapse of the ultrasound bill and giving Mr. McDonnell a way out of having to sign it.
''This is a high-stakes game,'' Mr. Marshall said. ''Everything is on a razor's edge.''
Most political analysts agreed that Mr. McDonnell was seeking to defuse an embarrassing and unmanageable situation -- especially at a moment when he seems to be shifting his gaze to a national, and more centrist, audience. .
''Pragmatism trumped ideology today,'' said Daniel Palazzolo, a professor or political science at the University of Richmond.

HEADLINE: How We Finance Political Campaigns

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''A Better Way to Buy Politicians,'' by Lindsay Mark Lewis (Op-Ed, Feb. 17):
Legalizing bribery cannot be the answer. 
Mr. Lewis argues that we should repeal the McCain-Feingold law and allow wealthy individual and corporate interests to give unlimited donations to political parties. I think he's wrong.
While the Supreme Court's lawless Citizens United decision created an entirely new road map for corruption by allowing wealthy individual and corporate interests to dominate our elections through the use of so-called super PACs, reviving the old soft money contributions to parties would only make matters worse.
Political memories are short -- the corrupt era of soft money was directly responsible for the enactment of some of the worst policies in generations: job-killing trade agreements heavily promoted by multinational corporate interests; tax cuts that disproportionately benefited the 1 percent while adding trillions to our long-term debt; and reckless Wall Street-promoted financial deregulation that paved the way for the shenanigans that set off the worst recession since the Great Depression.
We must take government off the auction block and put it back in the hands of the citizens, where a true democracy belongs. At a minimum, that means overturning the Citizens United decision and retaining the McCain-Feingold safeguards.
COLE LEYSTRA Madison, Wis., Feb. 17, 2012
The writer is executive director of Progressives United, founded by former Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin.
To the Editor:
Lindsay Mark Lewis's Op-Ed article argued that, with the advent of unlimited political donations to outside groups like super PACs, Congress should simply allow political parties to raise unlimited funds, too.
Mr. Lewis shows little concern for donor influence with statements like, ''This way, donors might have more direct leverage over candidates.''
The reality, of course, is that Americans don't want more unlimited contributions in politics. They want none. The best way to insulate candidates is to have them rely on everyday people for donations, not corporate funders -- on the great many, not the big money -- through a small donor public matching fund system.
DAVID DONNELLY Executive Director Public Campaign Action Fund Washington, Feb. 17, 2012
To the Editor:
''Some Saner Voices on 'Super PACs' '' (editorial, Feb. 9) highlighted the absurdity of our campaign finance system.
Super PACs have poured more than $45 million into this year's election, mostly spent on thousands of unaccountable attack ads into Americans' homes in early voting states.
Across the country, from Iowa to Florida to Colorado to New Mexico, we're inundated with intrusive commercials. It's unfortunate enough that they are on the air, but it's outrageous that the people we represent can't find out who made them.
The only sure fix is reform. Ultimately, we must pass the constitutional amendment we introduced letting the states and Congress regulate campaign finance. In the meantime, Congress should take the Supreme Court up on the one area it has left alone, disclosure requirements.
The Times is right to mention Congress's poor standing with the electorate. Perhaps Congress can begin to redeem itself by cleaning up our elections.
MICHAEL F. BENNET TOM UDALL Washington, Feb. 17, 2012
The writers are Democratic senators from Colorado and New Mexico, respectively.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Fights Google Over High Cost of Patents in Europe

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Microsoft filed a complaint Wednesday with European Union antitrust authorities accusing Google and Motorola Mobility, a smartphone company the Internet search giant plans to buy, of charging too much for use of its patents, marking a new stage in a long-running feud between Microsoft and Google.
''We have taken this step because Motorola is attempting to block sales of Windows PCs, our Xbox game console and other products,'' David A. Heiner, a senior Microsoft lawyer, wrote in a blog post Wednesday. 
The move ratchets up pressure on Google, which reached agreement last year to acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in its largest deal to date. Google already is under investigation by the E.U. authorities for possible abuses of a dominant position in online search and advertising, and Microsoft is among the complainants in that case, too.
But the move also reflects how the world of technology -- awash with new devices like smartphones and tablet computers from a range of manufacturers -- actually shares many so-called essential technologies.
Microsoft and Google, as well as Samsung, Apple and Motorola, are among the powerful companies furiously scrapping over how much to charge each other for using some of those key functions, like wireless communications.
Google reacted sharply to the move by Microsoft, suggesting that its archrival, which paid more than $2 billion in antitrust fines in Europe over the past decade, should bear much of the blame for the onset of the patent wars.
''We haven't seen Microsoft's complaint, but it's consistent with the way they use the regulatory process to attack competitors,'' said Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels. ''It's particularly ironic, given their track record in this area and collaboration with patent trolls,'' he said, using a derisory term for rivals or companies that amass patents for the purpose of collecting fees.
Experts said the move showed there would be no easing of tensions among the top rivals in the technology industry anytime soon.
''This patent war will continue to rage,'' said Michael A. Carrier, a professor at Rutgers Law School in New Jersey who specializes in antitrust law.
''If the parties cannot agree, it will be left to the competition-law agencies to grapple with the difficult issues of how patents are priced,'' said Mr. Carrier, who is the recipient of a Google Research Award but who does not consult for any of the companies involved.
Mr. Carrier said that a single smartphone was built using hundreds of patents, and that the owner of any single one of those patents could hold up the entire industry, helping fuel a vicious cycle in which technology companies were being ''forced to spend money to build an army of patents'' to fend off litigation.
A prominent commentator on the issue, Florian Mueller, who also advises companies including Microsoft on patent issues, said that Google and Motorola would probably need to defend themselves vigorously to avoid being sent formal charges in this case.
''Google should think hard about whether it wants to get a 100- or 150-page statement of objections at some point relating to standard-essential patents,'' said Mr. Mueller, referring to the document E.U. antitrust regulators often send to companies under formal investigation.
Mr. Mueller said that Motorola Mobility had shown ''aggressive litigation and enforcement activities in Germany'' and that if ''every owner of standard-essential patents behaved like Motorola, this industry would be in chaos, and grind to a halt.''
The U.S. and European authorities have cleared the Google-Motorola deal, but Google still is waiting on approvals from China and other parts of the world.
In his blog post, Mr. Heiner said Motorola was unfairly trying to block Microsoft and other companies from using technology that devices needed for functions like connecting wirelessly to the Internet and playing video. Mr. Heiner complained that Motorola had refused to make patents available at ''anything remotely close to a reasonable price'' and had demanded that Microsoft remove Internet and video functions, or take products off the market.
''Motorola is on a path to use standard essential patents to kill video on the Web, and Google as its new owner doesn't seem to be willing to change course,'' Mr. Heiner wrote.
Apple has filed a similar complaint to regulators over Motorola's licensing terms, and Joaquin Almunia, the E.U. competition commissioner, has already warned that he is treating any possible patent abuses by technology companies, including Google, as a matter of priority.
This month, after giving a green light to the tie-up between Google and Motorola, Mr. Almunia emphasized that he could take measures to address ''actions by Motorola in the past'' and ''future action by Google'' in the area of intellectual property.
Samsung, which makes smartphones and tablets that run on the Android operating system by Google, already is under formal investigation by Mr. Almunia for the way it has used standard essential patents and sought injunctions against its competitors in national courts.
Mr. Mueller suggested that Google, in order to overcome the latest challenge from Microsoft, might need to pledge not to seek bans on products when royalty disputes arise as a number of other prominent technology companies, including Apple, Microsoft and Cisco had already done.
Google should consider ''a public declaration of how they are going to use standard-essential patents,'' Mr. Mueller said.
Lawyers warned that regulators now risked becoming overwhelmed by the explosion of patent complaints and needed to take timely decisions clarifying the rules of the road for the sector.
''The competition authorities are going have to pick their battles carefully to maximize resources,'' said Rachel Bickler, a lawyer at the Brussels office of Nabarro. The authorities needed to ensure ''that antitrust investigations do not become a tool in the battles between commercial giants,'' she said.
But Mr. Carrier, at Rutgers, said Mr. Almunia was likely to come under more pressure because his office was regarded as ''more receptive than the U.S. to arguments about pricing of patents and competition-law violations for the high royalties charged for patents.'' By contrast, U.S. courts were ''more likely to allow the patent holder to price the patent at whatever level it wishes,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: 23 Nations Fight European Airline Emissions Law

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER; Nicola Clark in Paris and James Kanter in Brussels contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- The United States agreed on Wednesday with Russia, China and 20 other nations to coordinate potential retaliatory trade measures against the European Union in response to a new law that requires airlines to pay for their greenhouse gas emissions.
The law is the European Union's boldest initiative on climate protection in aviation to date. It is cheered by proponents of more stringent action to curb global warming in a business that, by its nature, falls outside national environmental laws. 
Opposing it are many airlines and national governments for a mix of concerns about cost and infringement on sovereignty because it would apply European environmental rules to the entire airborne emissions from flights to and from Europe -- even if the flight path was mostly over international waters or countries outside the region.
After a two-day meeting here led by Russia, 23 countries signed what they called the ''Moscow Joint Declaration.'' If not yet engaged in a trade war, the countries declared a readiness to start one in a way that could add to the cost of tickets to Europe. They agreed to coordinate any retaliatory action against European-based airlines that fly internationally, like Air France and British Airways, and listed nine possible ways to do so.
''We intend to get the E.U.'s carbon trading measures either canceled or postponed,'' Russia's deputy minister of transport, Valery Okulov, told journalists after the declaration's adoption. In addition to the United States and China, supporters included Cuba, India, Japan, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria.
Russia, Mr. Okulov said, might cease issuing permits for European airlines to fly over Siberia on routes from Europe to Asia. A threat to impose levies on European airlines when they fly over other countries' airspace was also in the joint statement.
The Obama administration supports global rules on greenhouse gas emissions by airplanes on international flights but opposes the European measure because of possible violations of existing aviation treaties and because it could delay work on a more sweeping worldwide agreement in the United Nations.
Countries that adopted the statement said they might pass national laws prohibiting their airlines from complying with the European law, an approach so far favored by China. The declaration also suggested that nations might review so-called open skies agreements on landing rights and market access.
The statement said a branch of the United Nations, the International Civil Aviation Organization, and not the European Union, should regulate airplane emissions on international flights.
But European proponents of the rule say that group has stalled for years, caught up in the unwieldy diplomacy of global-warming matters. They also play down the cost. The rule requires airlines to pay 15 percent of the cost of compensating for the carbon dioxide emitted during any flight that lands in or takes off from Europe. The other 85 percent would be waived.
Carriers like American Airlines and China Southern are furious because they could face big bills as the number of permits that they need to buy rises.
''We strongly support the outcome of the Moscow meeting where governments voiced their united opposition to the E.U.'s unilateral tax, even spelling out the concrete steps they can take to overturn this scheme,'' American Airlines said in a statement on Wednesday.
European Union authorities insisted that they would stand firm on the legislation and challenged opponents, as they have before, to come up with an alternative that would help curb greenhouse gas emissions by airlines.
The European Union would revise or withdraw that law only if a global system were put in place to curb emissions from aviation, said Isaac Valero-Ladron, a spokesman for the European Commission in Brussels.
The countries that adopted the Moscow declaration are seeking ''suspension of the only functioning system that exists to address aviation carbon emissions,'' and Europeans are still waiting for ''concrete, constructive alternatives for a global agreement,'' Mr. Valero-Ladron said at a news conference in Brussels.
If a trade war breaks out, he said, European officials would need to examine any measures that countries might eventually take against Europe's airlines and industries before contemplating countermeasures.
As soon as ''any country decides to introduce or enforce discriminatory measures that harm E.U. companies, well, in that case the commission will immediately assess the situation and might take appropriate actions provided for under E.U. legislation and international legislation,'' Mr. Valero-Ladron said.
If airlines do not comply with the European rule because they are prohibited from doing so by national legislation, he said, they may eventually be barred from European Union airports.

HEADLINE: State to Study Tappan Zee As a Walkway

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
It seemed quixotic at first, but maybe the idea of turning the Tappan Zee Bridge into a walkway after a new bridge is built is not so far fetched after all.
State officials said Wednesday that they were exploring the possibility of turning the three-mile-long bridge into a route for pedestrians and bicyclists along the lines of the High Line on the West Side of Manhattan, or the equally successful Walkway Over the Hudson linking Poughkeepsie and Highland.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and aides said at a cabinet meeting in Albany that it would cost $150 million to demolish the existing bridge, which carries the New York State Thruway, so turning it into a walkway connecting Rockland and Westchester Counties was worth exploring. 
''Could you leave it up, and what are the economics and the practicalities of that?'' Mr. Cuomo said at the meeting. ''It's an exciting option.''
After more than 10 years of study, building a new bridge finally seemed to reach critical mass last fall when it was one of 14 projects chosen by the Obama administration for expedited federal review and approval -- possibly allowing work on a new $5 billion bridge to begin as early as spring 2013. The bridge is 56 years old -- 6 years past its anticipated life span -- and needs $50 million in maintenance and repairs annually.
After the project was announced, the idea of preserving the old bridge was raised by Paul Feiner, the Greenburgh town supervisor, who proposed a walkway. The idea immediately gained support from biking and pedestrian groups. In January, the newly formed Tappan Bridge Park Alliance said that a walkway ''would generate economic and community development to the region by providing a world-class destination and a much needed open space in the congested Lower Hudson Valley.''
The initial reactions from public officials were cool, and some said the steep pitch of the Tappan Zee, compared, for example, with the flat Walkway Over the Hudson, could make a park plan impractical.
But on Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo and Thomas Madison, executive director of the State Thruway Authority, endorsed further study of the project. They indicated it might make more sense to create a walkway than to tear down the existing bridge.
''I'm so excited,'' Mr. Feiner said Wednesday in an e-mail. ''This could become a world-class destination point.''
Despite overall applause for the coming bridge replacement, there has also been criticism that the fast progress has come at the expense of the optimal project. Transit advocates are upset that the new bridge will not include rail lines or bus service.
The Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a nonprofit group advocating for alternatives to motor-vehicle use, recently began running radio and newspaper advertisements that criticized the absence of mass transit in the current design. Hearings on the project's environmental impact statement are scheduled for Feb. 28 in West Nyack and for March 1 in Tarrytown.
Mr. Madison and Mr. Cuomo said that the new bridge would provide areas for bikers and walkers, unlike the old one, and that it was being built to support mass transit, which can be added when more money is available.
''There has been criticism that we'll build a bridge that doesn't support rail,'' the governor said. ''That's not true. The bridge will support the rail. The question is the rest of the system that doesn't exist. We're actually building a bridge that is ahead of the existing system.''

HEADLINE: Shares Down Modestly, Ending a 4-Day Streak

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks closed lower Wednesday for the first time in four trading days.
Some investors worried about the details of a bailout deal reached for Greece on Tuesday. But analysts said investors were mostly in a holding pattern after seeing the market hit an important psychological mark. 
''The market is pausing for the next slew of good news,'' said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management. ''The real U.S. economy continues to march along while the attention is on Europe.''
The Dow has lost ground on just four of the last 11 trading days. It has been trading at or near four-year highs for three weeks and is up 6 percent this year. Strong corporate earnings have been an important factor, Mr. Cote said.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 27.02 points, or 0.21 percent, to finish at 12,938.67 Wednesday. On Tuesday, it briefly passed 13,000 for the first time since May 2008.
On Wednesday, the Dow traded in a range of just 63 points. Over the last year, it has had smaller trading ranges on only nine days. The average daily range over that time has been 181 points.
Financial stocks led the market lower. Investors worried that a $172 billion bailout for debt-laden Greece, announced Tuesday, would not be enough to keep it from eventually defaulting and possibly leaving the euro currency group.
In the United States, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 4.55 points, or 0.33 percent, to close at 1,357.66. The Nasdaq composite index declined 15.40 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,933.17. Volume was below average at 3.6 billion shares.
All three major averages are well ahead for the year. The Dow is up 5.9 percent, the S.& P. up 8 percent and the Nasdaq up 12.6 percent.
''The market has done well in the face of some pretty low expectations,'' said Todd Salamone of Schaeffer's Investment Research. ''Right now we're just seeing a few speed bumps.''
Mr. Salamone predicted investors would remain focused on negative news overseas despite better news on the domestic economy.
Last week, Congress extended a cut in the Social Securitypayroll tax, worth $1,000 for someone making $50,000 a year.
On Thursday, the government will give the latest reading on unemployment claims, which have been declining steadily and fell last week to 348,000, the lowest since March 2008.
European markets closed lower. In Asia, stocks mostly rose even after a fairly weak Chinese manufacturing survey. The dollar rose to a seven-month high against the Japanese yen.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 17/32, to 100 and the yield fell to 2.00 percent from 2.06 percent late Tuesday.
Among stocks making big moves, the computer maker Dell fell nearly 6 percent after reporting an 18 percent decline in first-quarter profit. Toll Brothers, the luxury-home builder, fell 5 percent after posting a quarterly loss. It did report more signed contracts and a bigger backlog, encouraging measures.
Garmin, which makes GPS systems, jumped more than 9 percent after its quarterly net income rose 25 percent as a result of higher prices and sales. The company's results and 2012 revenue forecast beat Wall Street's expectations.

HEADLINE: Florida Weighs Measure To Ease Way to Foreclosure

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Hoping to speed up and streamline Florida's lumbering foreclosure process, state lawmakers are considering legislation to make it easier to foreclose on abandoned properties and force lenders to move more quickly to complete foreclosures.
With one-fourth of the nation's foreclosures, Florida is still struggling to pull out of a housing crash that plunged it into recession. It continues to have one of the country's largest backlogs of foreclosure cases: 360,000. This is in large part because the process, which in Florida requires a judge's approval, is so slow-moving. RealtyTrac estimates that it takes nearly two years for lenders to repossess a foreclosed house in Florida, which is one of the longest time frames in the country.
With 14 percent of Florida home loans in foreclosure, abandoned houses are scattered across the state. More than one of every six houses is vacant, according to the Census Bureau, a blight that can depress property values and attract criminals. 
''We have a lot of property that needs to get back in the stream of commerce and borrowers who need to get on with their lives,'' said Representative Kathleen C. Passidomo, a Naples Republican and the bill's sponsor in the Florida House of Representatives.
Ms. Passidomo said she had revised the bill several times to address the concerns of homeowners, who fear they would be left with fewer safeguards against unscrupulous lenders, and banks, which are still reeling from the robo-signing scandals.
Housing advocates, who sent busloads of people to the capitol last week to protest the bill, said that Ms. Passidomo was listening to many of their concerns. ''I think the bill has improved a lot,'' said Alice Vickers, the consumer issues advocate for the Florida Consumer Action Network, adding that advocates still had concerns.
The bill's prospects for passage have improved in the last week. It cleared its final House committee on Thursday and now heads to the House floor. A similar measure is moving through committee in the Senate.
The legislation attempts to speed foreclosures in several ways, including by requiring lenders to move more quickly. Lenders have been overwhelmed by the number of cases and do not always want to assume ownership of a home that is worth less than its mortgage, foreclosure experts say.
The bill would allow any lien holder, not just the lender, to initiate the foreclosure process. This means that a condominium or homeowners' association -- which must often contend with unpaid fees by an owner who is behind on a mortgage -- would have the legal right to jump-start the process in court by asking for a hearing to let them take action. This could push lenders into quicker turnarounds.
The measure would also make it easier for lenders to foreclose on vacant homes once they completed a checklist to ensure that it had been abandoned. Often, these homes sit in the pipeline for extended periods.
In addition, the bill would require that all paperwork and necessary documents be filed right away after a foreclosure proceeding began, and not piece by piece as the process moved ahead.
Homeowners would find some relief in a provision that would shorten the amount of time, to one year from five years, in which lenders could seek a deficiency judgment, or the money they say they are owed on an underwater mortgage. If banks wanted to come after homeowners, they must do it in the first year, and not years later. Bankers dislike this provision.
''In four of five years, these people could have acquired a new job or new assets,'' Ms. Passidomo said, or worse, ''tried not to get a good job and acquire assets because they know bank can come after it for five years.''
Ms. Vickers said that she and other advocates still had concerns, including the need to give homeowners notice when a condominium association was moving to foreclose.
''I think we would all like to see the backlog go away and we would all like to see property values start to increase,'' Ms. Vickers said. ''But it's a balancing act to make sure that we don't erode homeowner protections in our zeal to move the housing market along.''

HEADLINE: As Others Isolate Syria, Chavez Ships Fuel to It

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela -- A day before the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to condemn President Bashar al-Assad of Syria this month for his bloody crackdown on the uprising in his country, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela was conducting a very different kind of diplomacy on his own.
A ship owned by the Venezuelan state oil company sailed into the Syrian port of Baniyas, its location captured by a satellite system that tracks ship movements. The ship, making its second trip to Baniyas since December, appeared to be carrying fuel to help prop up the embattled Mr. Assad. 
The Venezuelan shipment flies in the face of international efforts to isolate Mr. Assad and pressure him to step down, but Mr. Chavez is no stranger to such controversy. Last month, he played host to another Middle Eastern ally, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, ridiculing Western claims that Iran was seeking to be able to produce nuclear weapons.
Still, Mr. Chavez is at the start of what could prove to be a difficult re-election campaign overshadowed by his battle with cancer, and the political equation here may be shifting. While provocative moves like oil shipments to Syria play well among Mr. Chavez's staunchest backers, they may prove to be a liability among voters who resent his oil tanker diplomacy.
The Venezuelan ship, the Negra Hipolita, arrived in the Syrian port on Feb. 15, according to John H. Paskin, the chief executive of Commodity Flow, a company based in London that compiles satellite data and other information to track the movement of ships.
He said the ship left a Venezuelan refinery complex at Puerto La Cruz on Jan. 25. The Puerto La Cruz complex produces gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and fuel components, according to the Web site of the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, known as P.D.V.S.A.
Mr. Paskin said the tracking data showed that the ship made a previous trip to Syria last fall, leaving a Venezuelan refinery complex on the Paraguana Peninsula on Oct. 15 and arriving at Baniyas on Dec. 1.
The ship is named after a slave who was a wet nurse and nanny to Simon Bolivar, the national hero, whom Mr. Chavez idolizes. A Venezuelan shipping broker said the shipment, first reported by Reuters, probably carried diesel and possibly other types of fuel.
Asked about the shipments and whether the fuel delivered could be used by Syria's military, Mr. Chavez answered by referring to his country's oil shipments to the United States, Venezuela's largest customer.
''Have we by any chance asked the United States what it does with the fuel we sell to the United States?'' he said in an exchange with reporters at the presidential palace last week. ''Have we by any chance allowed anyone to impose conditions on our sale of petroleum to the United States?'' He said that the answer was no and added, ''We are a free country.''
William A. Ostick, a State Department spokesman, said that American or European sanctions did not prohibit shipments of fuel to Syria.
''We continue to work with the friends of the Syrian people to increase pressure on the Assad regime to get him to step down,'' Mr. Ostick said.
Venezuela has some of the world's largest oil reserves, and Mr. Chavez has benefited from the high price of oil as he uses petroleum revenues to finance social programs at home. He has also used oil aggressively to promote his interests abroad.
He has helped prop up the debilitated Cuban economy through shipments of oil in exchange for doctors to staff Venezuelan clinics and for other aid.
China has become a major buyer of Venezuelan oil, and loans and investments have followed.
Venezuela has backed isolated Middle Eastern governments before, sending a gasoline blending component to Iran in late 2010 and early 2011, action that drew a rebuke from the United States.
In supporting autocratic governments in the Middle East, Mr. Chavez has portrayed them as the victims of imperialist aggression. He sounds the same message at home, and it is carried daily on state media: Mr. Chavez as a champion standing up to the bullying of the United States.
Such views resonate with Mr. Chavez's followers.
''The United States wants to impose a new hegemony,'' said Pedro Correa, 56, an industrial draftsman from Santa Teresa del Tuy, a city about an hour's drive south of central Caracas, who supports Mr. Chavez.
But many Venezuelans who oppose Mr. Chavez are quick to voice resentment of his petro-diplomacy, especially the generous deal with Cuba.
''He gave our riches away to other countries,'' said Carlos Cedeno, 55, a driver for a concrete company in Maracay. He supports Mr. Chavez's opponent in the presidential election this year, Henrique Capriles Radonski.

HEADLINE: Reform and Corporate Taxes

 BODY:
The corporate tax system is a mess. The United States has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world, but too many businesses still don't contribute their fair share of revenue, in large part because of numerous loopholes, subsidies and other opportunities for tax avoidance. While some industries and companies pay little or no tax because they qualify for generous breaks or have really good lawyers, others are taxed heavily.
There is no doubt that a system that is more competitive, more efficient -- the current mind-numbing complexity makes planning far too difficult -- and more fair would be a plus for the economy. President Obama's framework for business tax reform, released on Wednesday, is a welcome start for a much-needed debate on comprehensive tax reform. But we already have two big concerns. 
While the administration insists that business tax reform should not add to the deficit, the country needs to raise more revenue to care for an aging population, rebuild infrastructure, improve education and tackle the deficit. Corporations, which benefit from all of those, should, as a matter of necessity and fairness, pay more.
Our other concern is that like all tax reform, the potential for gaming the process is ever present and unless it is vigilantly managed could actually reduce revenue and add to the deficit.
Take the framework's central reform: reducing the top corporate rate from 35 percent to 28 percent, while at the same time doing away with loopholes and subsidies. In theory, it is a sound approach, which would reduce complexity while bringing the rate in line with that of other advanced nations without busting the budget. But, even if they made it past the lobbyists, the specific loophole closers in Mr. Obama's new framework -- including ending subsidies for oil and gas exploration, corporate jets and private equity partners -- are far too small to make up for dropping the top rate.
As for the big money subsidies that would have to be cut or ended to pay for a lower rate -- including less generous depreciation and reduced deductibility of interest on corporate debt -- the White House merely presents them as part of a menu of options for ''consideration.''
The framework's call for a minimum corporate tax on the foreign earnings of American companies is a step in the right direction. Under current law, various tax provisions and tactics allow companies to reduce or defer taxes by shifting ever more production and profits overseas. But the idea is blunted by the framework's failure to say what the minimum tax rate should be.
Nor does the framework broach other reforms like taxing foreign profits when they are earned rather than when they are repatriated to the United States -- that could ultimately be more effective in getting multinationals to pay more.
Even with its shortcomings, Mr. Obama's proposal presents a needed contrast to the Republicans' approach to corporate taxes. Last year, Dave Camp, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed a top corporate rate of 25 percent without saying how he would pay for the tax cut. Mitt Romney has done somewhat better, calling for a 25 percent rate to be coupled with ''broadening'' the corporate tax base, which generally means closing loopholes. But he has yet to say which tax breaks he would end.
Serious reform requires specific proposals, tough trade-offs and hard numbers attached. Without all of those, this effort could too easily be hijacked by powerful corporations and their high-paid lobbyists.

HEADLINE: White House, Consumers in Mind, Offers Online Privacy Guidelines

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT; Tanzina Vega contributed reporting from New York and Nick Bilton and Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Wednesday outlined a set of online privacy principles that officials said would help consumers control the use of their personal data gleaned from Internet searches.
The framework for a new privacy code moves electronic commerce closer to a one-click, one-touch process by which users can tell Internet companies whether they want their online activity tracked.
Much remains to be done before consumers can click on a button in their Web browser to set their privacy standards. Congress will probably have to write legislation governing the collection and use of personal data, officials said, something that is unlikely to occur this year. And the companies that make browsers -- Google, Microsoft, Apple and others -- will have to agree to the new standards. 
But because those companies also are the largest competitors in the business of providing advertising to Web sites, and are part of a consortium participating in the development of the principles, administration officials said they expected the standards would give consumers privacy while also allowing electronic commerce to grow.
''American consumers can't wait any longer for clear rules of the road that ensure their personal information is safe online,'' President Obama said in a statement released Wednesday. ''By following this blueprint, companies, consumer advocates and policy makers can help protect consumers and ensure the Internet remains a platform for innovation and economic growth.''
Even before Congress approves privacy legislation, the Federal Trade Commission will have the ability to enforce compliance with a code of conduct to be developed by the Commerce Department or with advertising industry guidelines that companies would adopt voluntarily, Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the F.T.C., said during a call with reporters on Wednesday.
Companies responsible for the delivery of nearly 90 percent of online behavioral advertisements -- ads that appear on a user's screen based on browsing and buying habits -- have agreed to comply when consumers choose to control online tracking, the consortium said on Wednesday.
But even if a click of a mouse or a touch of a button can thwart Internet tracking devices, there is no guarantee that companies won't still manage to gather data on Web behavior. Compliance is voluntary on the part of consumers, Internet advertisers and commerce sites.
''The real question is how much influence companies like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Facebook will have in their inevitable attempt to water down the rules that are implemented and render them essentially meaningless,'' John M. Simpson, privacy project director for Consumer Watchdog, said in response to the administration's plan. ''A concern is that the administration's privacy effort is being run out of the Commerce Department.''
But Mr. Leibowitz noted that the F.T.C. had already been aggressively penalizing companies that did not adhere to their stated privacy programs. Last year it brought charges against both Google and Facebook.
''If you ask what makes businesses want to do this,'' Mr. Leibowitz said, the answer is, ''respecting consumer privacy and protecting data online encourages Internet commerce.''
The Digital Advertising Alliance, a group of marketing and advertising trade groups, said it had committed to following the instructions that consumers gave about their privacy choices by using Do Not Track technology already available in most Web browsers.
Stu Ingis, general counsel for the Digital Advertising Alliance, said the group hoped to reach agreement within about nine months with browser companies on standards for the use of a one-click notification of a consumer's privacy desires.
Hardly a day goes by without some development in the expansion of privacy standards or the punishment of privacy violations. On Wednesday, California's attorney general, Kamala D. Harris, said the state had reached an agreement with Amazon, Apple, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Research in Motion to strengthen privacy protections for smartphone owners who download mobile applications.
The agreement will force software developers to post conspicuous privacy policies detailing what personal information they plan to obtain and how they will use it. It also compels app store providers like Apple and Google to offer ways for users to report apps that do not comply.
The new privacy outline brings together several efforts to develop and enforce privacy standards that have been progressing for the last couple of years on parallel tracks, under the direction of advertisers, Internet commerce sites and software companies.
The next step will be for the Commerce Department to gather Internet companies and consumer advocates to develop enforceable codes of conduct aligned with a ''Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights'' released as part of the administration's plan on Wednesday.
The bill of rights sets standards for the use of personal data, including individual control, transparency, security, access, accuracy and accountability.

HEADLINE: Romney Proposes a Tax Overhaul, With Lower Rates but a Limit on Deductions

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD; Michael Barbaro contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mitt Romney, seeking to kick-start his presidential campaign among recalcitrant conservatives, on Wednesday proposed cutting the top income tax for individuals to 28 percent while holding out the prospect of limiting tax deductions.
Mr. Romney's earlier economic plan called only for preserving the current top tax rate of 35 percent, while holding out the promise of lower rates later in an overhaul of the tax code. But facing a major challenge from the upstart Republican rival Rick Santorum, he chose to outline such an overhaul in Arizona before critical primaries here and in Michigan next Tuesday - and before a televised debate Wednesday night in Mesa, Ariz.
At a rally in Chandler, Ariz., Mr. Romney promoted the benefits of his approach.
''In order to limit any impact on the deficit, because I do not want to add to the deficit, and also to make sure we continue to have progressivity in our tax code, I'm going to limit the deductions and exemptions, particularly for high-income folks,'' Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, said. 
''And by the way, I want to make sure that you understand, for middle-income families, the deductibility of home mortgage interest and charitable contributions, those things will continue,'' he said. ''For high-income folks, we are going to cut back on that, so we make sure that the top 1 percent keeps paying the current share they're paying or more. We want middle-income Americans to be the place we focus our help, because its middle-income Americans that have been hurt by this Obama economy.''
Mr. Romney's top economic adviser, Glenn Hubbard, said the plan would cut all six current tax brackets - 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent, 35 percent, depending on a taxpayer's income - by the same proportion of 20 percent. That would produce this new set of tax brackets: 8 percent, 12 percent, 20 percent, 22.4 percent, 26.4 percent, and 28 percent. ''It's a marginal rate cut for every American,'' Mr. Hubbard said.
But echoing the candidate, he added that Mr. Romney was committed to making his plan both ''revenue neutral'' - meaning it won't add to the budget deficit -- and ''distributionally neutral'' - meaning that it won't shift the tax burden from upper-income Americans to middle- and working-class Americans. Since the largest benefits from rate reduction would go to upper-income taxpayers, they will also bear the burdens of ''base broadening'' reductions in existing deductions needed to keep the government from hemorrhaging revenue, he explained.
Reducing large tax deductions, like the ones for home mortgage interest and state and local taxes, can be politically treacherous because of their popularity with voters and elected officials alike. For now, at least, Mr. Romney will dodge any potential backlash by avoiding such specifics.
Mr. Romney will pledge to work with Congress on ''limiting them,'' Mr. Hubbard said, but ''it is not his intention to take on any specific deduction or exclusion and eliminate it.''
Mr. Romney has praised the work of President Obama'sSimpson-Bowles deficit reduction commission, but criticized the president for ignoring its work. Mr. Romney, however, is also rejecting the commission's recommendation that tax overhaul produce increased government revenue to cut the deficit, while embracing its recommendation to cut the top tax rate to 29 percent or lower.
Mr. Hubbard contrasted Mr. Romney's ''pro-growth'' plan with Mr. Obama's proposal to raise taxes on individuals earning more than $200,000 and households earning more than $250,000. He argued that would hurt economic growth by crimping small businesses, many of which file under the individual tax code.
Mr. Hubbard, who was an economic adviser to President George W. Bush and is now dean of the business school at Columbia University, also cast the Romney plan as superior to Mr. Santorum's. Mr. Santorum would also cut the top individual rate to 28 percent, the level it reached after Congress and the White House agreed on a tax overhaul plan during the Reagan presidency, while preserving only one more tax bracket of 10 percent. In the name of ''national security,'' Mr. Santorum has also proposed a zero tax rate for manufacturing businesses as a means of preserving and expanding that economic sector.
The Santorum plan would significantly expand the budget deficit, Mr. Hubbard said, and the zero rate for manufacturing would result in ''significant capital misallocation.''
''Net-net, it's a job destroyer, not a job creator,'' Mr. Hubbard said.
Both Mr. Santorum and former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has proposed an optional ''flat tax'' system of 15 percent, have accused Mr. Romney of timidity. With his new proposal, Mr. Romney seeks to counter that charge in advance of Wednesday night's debate.
Mr. Romney's plan aims to balance two competing priorities of different Republican factions. By proposing to cut the top rate, he is seeking support among supply-side conservatives who contend that lower marginal rates are the key ingredient for producing economic growth.
But by vowing to offset the loss of revenue by eliminating some deductions, he is addressing concerns among deficit hawks about expanding the tide of red ink that has the federal government spending an estimated $1.3 trillion more than it takes in this year.
And by insisting that those unspecified reductions will fall most heavily on the affluent, he is seeking to limit a line of attack that portrays him as a wealthy former financial industry executive who himself has paid taxes at only around the 15 percent rate because most of his income comes from capital gains. Mr. Romney would maintain the current 15 percent rate on dividends and capital gains.
Mr. Obama has proposed to tax the ''carried interest'' received by many hedge fund and private equity executives at higher ordinary income rates rather than as capital gains, arguing that current law gives them an undue advantage. Mr. Romney himself has benefited handsomely from that.
Mr. Hubbard said a President Romney would ask his treasury secretary to study the ''devilishly hard question'' of whether current law should change and tax some of that income at ordinary income rates.
Mr. Romney had proposed eliminating capital gains taxes on taxpayers earning less than $200,000, but that drew fire from some conservatives and campaign rivals like Mr. Gingrich on the grounds that it gave unwarranted preference to a specific group and would have small economic impact since those taxpayers receive relatively little in capital gains anyway.
Mr. Romney also proposes to eliminate both the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, while cutting the top corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent.
Mr. Hubbard said three different revenue streams would keep the plan from increasing the budget deficit: the ''dynamic'' effects of economic growth, the additional income that would be subject to taxation through ''base broadening,'' and spending cuts Mr. Romney plans that would reach $500 billion per year by 2016. The campaign promised more specifics on those spending cuts within the next week.
In advance of Mr. Romney's tax plan, Mr. Obama's Treasury Department on Wednesday proposed its own corporate tax overhaul plan cutting the top corporate rate to 28 percent by eliminating some existing corporate deductions. Part of the Obama plan includes a minimum tax on the overseas income of United States-based corporations.
Mr. Hubbard, accusing the administration of a ''full-throttle attack on multinationals'', said Mr. Romney would propose shifting to a territorial system that would not tax corporate income earned overseas.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama Unveils Proposal to Cut Corporate Tax Rate

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.; John Harwood contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama asked Congress on Wednesday to scrub the corporate tax code of dozens of loopholes and subsidies to reduce the top rate to 28 percent, from 35 percent, while giving preferences to manufacturers that would set their maximum effective rate at 25 percent.
Mr. Obama's proposal, outlined by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner at a midday briefing, also would establish a minimum tax on multinational corporations' foreign earnings -- a feature that Republicans immediately denounced.. 
With this framework for changes, Mr. Obama opened a new front in a running election-year debate with Republicans in Congress and in the presidential race who seek even lower taxes for businesses, as well as lower individual tax rates than Mr. Obama has embraced.
On Wednesday, Mitt Romney, whom the Obama camp has long viewed as the likeliest Republican nominee, proposed cutting by one-fifth the marginal rates paid by taxpayers at every income level, meaning that even the highest-earning individuals would pay no more than 28 percent. Mr. Romney's plan would cut the corporate tax rate to 25 percent.
But any overhaul of the tax code, even one limited to corporate taxes, is unlikely this year, given that political backdrop and the complexity of an undertaking that would generate a lobbying frenzy as businesses vie to defend old tax breaks or win new ones.
Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, called Mr. Obama's proposal ''profoundly disappointing in its lack of detail,'' and said that tax reform must not be limited to corporate taxes alone. ''This so-called framework is murky, ill-defined and contradictory to the goal of reducing complexity and making our tax code more efficient,'' his statement said.
Representative Dave Camp, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, agreed. ''More than half of all business income is taxed at the individual rather than corporate tax rates, and a corporate-only proposal does not address the needs of those job creators, the vast majority of which are small businesses,'' said Mr. Camp, a Michigan Republican.
Mr. Geithner said that while the administration's plan was ''designed so that you could do it alone,'' he understood the desire among many to carry out a more comprehensive overhaul. ''And that may be the way this comes out,'' he said. ''But we think, regardless of which path we choose, it's worth starting the foundation-laying process now on the business income side.''
Whether on the corporate or the individual side, the same conundrum faces anyone who seeks to make the tax system both simpler and fairer while lowering tax rates, but without busting the budget: somebody must pay, and it is hard to avoid shifting the tax burden from one sector of society to another.
On the corporate side, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, different companies pay taxes at very different effective rates because the tax code has so many special breaks, loopholes, credits and allowances that some, but not all, can use. In a simpler system, ''those who are most disadvantaged will benefit the most, because they have nothing to lose,'' he said.
When it comes to individual income taxes, treating everyone the same can have perversely disproportionate effects.
For example, Mr. Williams said it would be hard for Mr. Romney to cut tax brackets across the board without tilting the advantage toward the richest few. Mr. Romney said today that he would limit deductions for the rich but not for the middle classes in an attempt to avoid that outcome. But his advisers were not spelling out the details, saying they would have to be negotiated with Congress in any event.
The administration plan to revamp a corporate code that is widely derided as inefficient and anticompetitive has been in the works at Treasury for two years, and is a priority of Mr. Geithner. Yet he has been preoccupied with crisis management, and is unlikely to see the project through since he plans to leave office after this year.
''The current tax code was written for a different economy in a different era,'' Mr. Geithner said, citing such changes as the Internet revolution, cellphones, the rise of China and other emerging markets and a global trend to lower corporate rates. ''It needs to be reformed and modernized.''
Republicans and business groups complain that the 35 percent corporate tax rate is among the highest in the world, leaving American companies at a competitive disadvantage. They typically seek a 25 percent rate, with many of them saying that the current tax breaks should be kept in place as well.
Earlier this year, Mr. Obama proposed to end tax breaks for companies that move jobs overseas and to create new breaks for those that bring jobs back.
Mr. Obama is proposing that the simplification of the corporate code should not add to the deficit, and that most or all revenue raised by closing tax breaks should be used to lower rates or offset the cost of new or existing tax breaks favoring manufacturing, clean energy, and research and development activities, according to administration officials.
For tax purposes, however, the administration would face a challenge in defining manufacturing to determine which companies would benefit from a lower rate.
While details were sketchy, an official said Mr. Obama's tax framework would ''refocus the manufacturing deduction and use the savings to reduce the effective rate on manufacturing to no more than 25 percent, while encouraging greater research and development and the production of clean energy.''
For multinational corporations, officials say the administration will oppose any shift to a territorial system of taxing offshore profits, which could exempt most of corporations' foreign earnings from American income taxes.
Representative Camp and Senator Hatch both sharply criticized the administration's position on this point.
Mr. Romney's top economic adviser, Glenn Hubbard, accused the administration of a ''full-throttle attack on multinationals,'' and said Mr. Romney too would propose shifting to a territorial system that would not tax corporate income earned overseas.
While the United States is virtually alone in taxing multinational companies' foreign earnings, it allows the companies to avoid taxes indefinitely by keeping profits overseas. But that encourages accounting schemes and offshore investments, critics say.

HEADLINE: Check Point: Santorum on Financing for Family Planning Programs

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
Times reporters take a closer look at some of the statements made by the Republican presidential candidates in Wednesday night's debate.
Romney and the Auto Bailout
Mitt Romney provided a more nuanced explanation of his opposition to the federal loan package that helped rescue the auto industry in 2008 and 2009, saying there was ''no way'' he would have let American car companies implode. But a bipartisan group of auto industry executives, government officials and financial experts have said that if General Motors and Chrysler had followed his advice at the time and gone into bankruptcy, implosion is exactly what would have happened.
The context is Mr. Romney's 2008 New York Times Op-Ed, in which he argued that Chrysler and General Motors should not receive federal aid. ''Detroit needs a turnaround, not a check,'' he wrote.
But auto industry executives and people who were involved in the government-mandated reorganization of the auto companies have said that the managed bankruptcy was not an option at the time Mr. Romney wrote his article. Furthermore, they have said, following a path into bankruptcy then would have caused far more severe job losses and even liquidation. 
Mike Jackson, a Romney supporter and chief executive of AutoNation, the largest auto retailer in the country, said recently that Mr. Romney's position on the auto bailout was a ''circle that can't be squared.''
To go through a managed bankruptcy, tens of billions of dollars in financing would have been necessary. Auto executives and government officials have said that the only entity at the time that could have provided that level of financing was the federal government. In late 2008 and early 2009, the credit markets seized up, making financing on that scale virtually impossible to come by.
Mr. Romney and others have argued that the markets would have provided that money if the government demurred. But even Mr. Romney's former firm, Bain Capital, declined to help General Motors when asked in 2009 to invest in the automaker's European division, said one person with direct knowledge of the conversations.
The most problematic comment on the auto bailout, however, was made not by Mr. Romney but by Newt Gingrich, who said foreign automakers like Toyota and Nissan were doing ''just fine'' at the time the federal government bailed out domestic carmakers. Mr. Gingrich made the remarks in an attempt to draw a connection between the American auto companies' high labor costs and their decline. But at that point, car manufacturers were doing poorly regardless of whether they were foreign or domestic.
In early 2009, Toyota reported its first loss in 70 years -- $7.7 billion. Nissan was also in bad shape at that time, reporting $2.4 billion in losses. Honda, another Japanese automaker, also lost billions then.
-- Jeremy W. Peters
Santorum on Contraception
Rick Santorum had a hard time explaining his stance on contraception because he has made numerous statements that appear to be in conflict.
Did he clear it up Wednesday night? Not really. ''I have a personal moral objection'' to contraception, he said, ''but I've voted for bills that included it too.''
This drew a big boo from the audience.
Last year, Mr. Santorum told an evangelical blog, ''One of the things I will talk about that no president has talked about before is, I think, the dangers of contraception in this country.''
He added: ''Many in the Christian faith have said, 'Well, that's O.K. Contraception's O.K.' It's not O.K. because it's a license to do things in the sexual realm that is counter to how things are supposed to be.''
So, his position seems to be that while he personally opposes birth control, he would not ban it as president. But he did not spell it out clearly tonight. Then again, he successfully deflected Mr. Romney's attempt to press him on the issue by bringing up Mr. Romney's health care plan in Massachusetts.
-- Katharine Q. Seelye
Santorum Waffles on Title X
Mr. Santorum may have had a ''I voted for it before I voted against it'' moment Wednesday night.
In response to an assertion by Mr. Paul that he had voted to fund Planned Parenthood, Mr. Santorum said: ''As Congressman Paul knows, I opposed Title X funding. I've always opposed Title X funding.'' He quickly added, ''But it's included in a large appropriation bill that includes a whole host of other things.'' Here the audience started to boo.
Technically, Mr. Santorum was saying that he opposed Title X funding -- not that he voted against it -- but he was implying that he had voted against it. Then when he said it was included in a larger bill, the audience cried foul.
Title X, by the way, is the major funding vehicle for family planning programs. It was signed into law in 1970 by a Republican president, Richard Nixon, who declared, ''Contraception for all.''
Mr. Santorum said that because Title X ''was always pushed through,'' he countered by pushing for Title XX to provide funding for abstinence programs, saying they ''actually work in keeping children from being sexually active instead of facilitating children from being sexually active.''
Finally, he got around to an admission: ''Yes, I -- I admit I voted for large appropriation bills and there were things in there I didn't like.''
His bottom line, he said, is that as president, ''I will defund Planned Parenthood; I will not sign any appropriation bill that funds Planned Parenthood.''
Mr. Santorum's recent statements are likely to add to the confusion about his stance on the issue. Since 2006, he has cited his support for Title X to show that he is not opposed to funding for contraception.
As recently as last week, on ''CBS This Morning,'' Rick Santorum told the host, Charlie Rose, that he has no problems with federal funds for contraceptives, saying that he voted for Title X funds in the Senate.

Obama and Iran
Mr. Romney pressed his case that President Obama had practiced appeasement toward Iran, but he mischaracterized Mr. Obama's position on potential military action. The president has repeatedly said that military action against Tehran remains on the table.
It is also not true that Mr. Obama agreed to Russia's demand to give up missile defense facilities in Eastern Europe. He negotiated with Russia over the scale of the system, in an effort to win Moscow's agreement to the Start arms reduction treaty. In his discussion of national security, Mr. Romney also said the administration wanted to cut the Pentagon's budget by ''roughly a trillion dollars,'' which is twice what Mr. Obama has suggested.
Mr. Santorum is correct in saying that in 2009, the Obama administration cut funding for a United States-based group that documented human rights abuses in Iran. But the State Department continues to finance other groups that seek to block censorship of the Internet in Iran. Mr. Santorum also slightly misstated Mr. Obama's decision to open an embassy in Syria. The United States withdrew its ambassador to Damascus under President George W. Bush; Mr. Obama decided to send an envoy back to Syria before withdrawing him recently because of the civil strife.
-- Mark Landler
Expanding E-Verify
When Mr. Romney spoke of Arizona as a model for fighting illegal immigration, he was referring to one of several laws Arizona passed in recent years that requires employers to confirm that new hires are legally authorized to work through a federal system called E-Verify.
The system, which is voluntary at the federal level, has been growing rapidly, with 288,000 employers now using it nationwide. It has proven to be a reasonably effective and efficient way for employers to avoid hiring illegal immigrants, and it discourages those immigrants from seeking jobs in companies known to use the system. There is bipartisan support in Congress for some kind of national system to verify the immigration status and work authorization of new hires.
However, there has been debate over proposals currently before Congress to expand the E-Verify system, making it mandatory for all employers nationwide. If that happened, all new hires -- including Americans as well as immigrants -- would have to provide documentation to verify their identity and eligibility to work. Some critics, including Republicans, have said that could become another costly and intrusive federal mandate.
E-Verify currently relies on data from the Social Security system, which has been shown to have errors that could be costly and time-consuming for Americans and legal immigrants to correct.
Also, farmers across the country are strongly opposed to making E-Verify mandatory nationwide without a new guest worker program to provide legal migrant labor for agriculture. So while the general idea that Mr. Romney proposes has support in theory, putting it into practice nationally is not easy -- particularly for Republicans.
That said, all four of the candidates avoided the hot-button issue: what to do about 11 million illegal immigrants already living in the country.

Gingrich and Earmarks
Earlier in the debate, three of the Republicans - Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Santorum and Mr. Romney -- jousted as they often do on the subject of earmarks, which are spending items that members of Congress insert in the annual appropriations bills to benefit a particular project or program backed by constituents or supporters. Mr. Romney has criticized both of his rivals for their use of earmarks when each was in Congress. As the moderator, CNN's John King, indicated, earmarked spending has always been a minuscule piece of federal spending - typically less than 1 percent.
Mr. King asked Mr. Gingrich to respond to Mr. Romney's criticism that Mr. Gingrich, as speaker of the House from 1995 through 1998, raised earmarking to an art form. Mr. Gingrich, rather than respond directly, recalled that the federal budget was balanced when he was speaker.
Mr. Gingrich, as speaker, did preside over a period in which the number and total cost of earmarks spiraled, and Republican leaders openly encouraged new members to seek earmarks to buttress their local standing. In 1992, when he was still in the minority, Representative Gingrich said, ''I am committed to hunting down every appropriation ... that is some politician taking care of himself.''
But in 1995, Mr. Gingrich's first year as speaker, the new Republican-led Congress approved a record 1,430 earmarked projects worth $10 billion, according to the conservative group Citizens Against Government Waste. The totals escalated annually. Mr. Gingrich was forced to resign his office in late 1998 after a fraud scandal and Republican election losses. But Republicans remained in control of the House through 2006, when there were 9,963 earmarks worth $29 billion. Disgust among conservative voters with the trend, and scandals surrounding the earmarks, was a factor that year in Republicans' election losses, which gave control of the House and Senate to Democrats.
Earmarks are still a part of the budget process, but Congress and the executive branch disclose them. And nonpartisan groups like Citizens Against Government Waste, with its annual ''Pig Book,'' continue to report on the spending.

Controlling the Federal Debt
The Republican debate opened with a question from the audience that allowed each of the four remaining candidates to claim that they would bring the mounting federal debt under control. But nonpartisan analysts have concluded otherwise for the proposals to date from Mr. Romney, Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Santorum.
Another group will weigh in on Thursday: the U.S. Budget Watch project of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a longstanding nonprofit group that includes former members of Congress, administration officials and budget experts of both major parties, will issue a report showing that all three Republicans would add to the projected debt. Each candidate has proposed deep spending cuts in coming years, but the reductions are exceeded by the additional tax cuts they propose.
-- Jackie Calmes
Santorum and Romney's Earmarks
In recent weeks, Mr. Santorum's rivals - and Mr. Romney in particular - have hammered him over his use of earmarks while in Congress. John King, tonight's debate moderator, asked Mr. Santorum about the topic directly. He asked if there were any earmarks Mr. Santorum regretted and, pointing out that Mr. Santorum has attacked Mr. Romney over earmarks he secured to help the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, he asked if Mr. Santorum thought the Olympics were an improper use of earmarks.
In his answer, Mr. Santorum first defended his use of earmarks, as he has in the past. In multiple interviews, he has said that some are necessary, adding that there are ''good earmarks and bad earmarks.''
Switching to the Salt Lake City Olympics, which Mr. Romney helped turn around, Mr. Santorum said that he no problem with the federal funding Mr. Romney secured - in fact, Mr. Santorum volunteered, he had even voted in favor of some of the earmarks - but that Mr. Romney was a hypocrite for attacking Mr. Santorum over earmarks after having used them to his own advantage. Mr. Romney, he added, asked for ''tens of millions'' in federal funds to help save the 2002 Olympics.
This is largely true. When Mr. Romney headed to Utah, he did so with the help of about $1.5 billion in federal funding, including $60 million for security. The Democratic National Committee has already made an issue of Mr. Romney's own use of earmarks, including releasing a video that attacks him over the Olympics funds. .
In his answer, Mr. Santorum mentioned his specific use of earmarks. During his time in Congress, Mr. Santorum did request a lot of earmarks - Taxpayers for Common Sense, a budget watchdog group, estimates that he requested more than $1 billion. In the defense appropriations bill for the 2006 fiscal year, for instance, the group says that Mr. Santorum helped secure 54 earmarks, costing $124 million in federal financing.
When it was Mr. Romney's turn to respond, he accused Mr. Santorum, as he has in the past, of supporting the ''Bridge to Nowhere,'' a bridge in Alaska that cost almost $400 million and was intended to connect Ketchikan to a sparsely populated island with an airport. In 2005, Mr. Santorum did vote with the majority of the Senate in favor of a transportation bill that included the bridge, though the money for it (roughly $225 million) was a minuscule portion of the overall bill, which was nearly $300 billion.
Though earmarks are currently being demonized by both parties, there is nothing inherently wrong with a legislator requesting federal spending in his or her home district or state, or setting aside federal money for a state project.

The Auto Bailout and the U.A.W.
Several Republican candidates, especially Mr. Gingrich, charged that President Obama gave in to the autoworkers' unions when his administration rescued the auto industry in early 2009, and Mr. Gingrich went so far as to say that Mr. Obama turned the companies over to the United Auto Workers.
The auto rescue of General Motors and Chrysler was worked out between the unions and management, with both sides making concessions they never had before as a condition for their federal loans, conditions set by the Obama administration's team.
In contrast, a smaller rescue package in late 2008 from the Bush administration had no such conditions. Mr. Gingrich also cited a number of auto companies with operations in the United States that did not need bailouts, but he the ones he named are foreign-owned, like Toyota. The only major American company that did not take federal assistance was Ford, but Ford supported the rescue program because if G.M. and Chrysler had failed, that would have threatened the entire auto-manufacturing supply chain in the United States, which in turn would be a threat to Ford.
-- Jackie Calmes
Repealing Health Care Law
Mr. Santorum said repealing the health care insurance law that President Obama signed in 2010 would reduce the deficit. His rival Mr. Romney has repeatedly made the same claim in debates and repeatedly been judged incorrect.
Mr. Romney said repealing the law would save $95 billion a year. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that the health care law would reduce deficits by $210 billion in the first decade from fiscal year 2012 through 2021 given taxes, fees and health cost reductions mandated by the law. Similarly, the office reported that legislation passed last year by the House Republican majority to repeal the law would increase deficits by the same amount.
While the budget office has declined to put an exact figure on projected savings of the health care law beyond the first decade, given the uncertainty of such long-range projections, it concluded that the savings would be in the range of half a percentage point of the nation's gross domestic product, a substantial amount. The Obama administration has projected that the savings in the second decade will exceed $1 trillion.
In November, the nonpartisan fact-checking group PolitiFact said of Mr. Romney's claim: ''We rate his statement false.''
-- Jackie Calmes
Romney and Massachusetts Taxes
Mr. Santorum, rebutting claims that he expanded government spending in Congress, just claimed that Mr. Romney ''raised taxes and fees'' by $750 million as governor of Massachusetts.
There is truth to that claim -- though there is debate about the terminology. As governor, Mr. Romney raised more than $700 million in revenue through two major measures: first, he increased fees on a variety of government services, like the price of a commercial driving license; second, he closed dozens of corporate tax loopholes, requiring corporations to pay bigger tax bills.
Were those, technically, ''tax'' increases? Mr. Romney did not think so, perhaps unsurprisingly -- he had run for governor on a ''no new taxes'' pledge. But many Massachusetts business leaders -- and the prominent Washington anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform -- said otherwise. They assailed the changes as tax increases by another name.
''They changed the laws and the rules to significantly raise taxes,'' Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, has said of Mr. Romney's corporate tax loophole changes. ''That is a tax increase.''
-- Michael Barbaro
Gingrich and a Balanced Budget
Trip Gabriel previously looked at Mr. Gingrich's claim that he helped balance the budget four years in a row:
Mr. Gingrich has made a campaign theme out of how the economy improved when he was last in office, as speaker of the House in the 1990s. In his first answer, challenged about his conservative credentials, Mr. Gingrich said he was responsible for four consecutive balanced budgets and paid down $400 billion on the national debt.
But in only two years when he was speaker was the budget balanced, in fiscal 1998 and 1999. Although the government remained in the black for two more years, Mr. Gingrich left office in January 1999 and had no role in those later budgets. The total surplus when he was speaker was $194.9 billion, not $400 billion.
And it takes two to tango -- Mr. Gingrich didn't mention that these years of government surpluses were the result of policies that fostered an economic boom, many worked out with President Bill Clinton. Mr. Gingrich opposed a 1993 tax increase widely credited with helping to begin reducing the deficit.

HEADLINE: Winners and Losers From a Tax Proposal

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration, seeking to promote domestic manufacturing without increasing the federal deficit, proposed Wednesday to offset new tax breaks for manufacturers by raising taxes on a wide range of other companies.
Some of the prospective losers are familiar targets, including oil and gas companies, private equity firms and companies that move jobs overseas.
The proposal would also roll back provisions that benefit a range of other companies, including Menards, the Midwestern home improvement chain; Brown-Forman, which distills Jack Daniel's; and Duke Energy, of North Carolina. 
Some manufacturing firms could face higher taxes, too, because they are major beneficiaries of those same provisions. Over all, the plan seeks to reduce the share of profits manufacturers pay in federal taxes from an average of 26 percent in 2007 and 2008 to a maximum of 25 percent.
The White House provided few details on Wednesday, and most concerned the proposed reductions rather than the offsetting increases, thwarting detailed analysis. The administration introduced its overhauls of financial regulation and health care in the same way. But the high-concept approach also reflects that Wednesday's announcement was a campaign event. There is little chance that a divided Congress, its attention focused on November, will overhaul the corporate tax code this year.
''It is time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement announcing the plan.
Republicans agreed with the goal, but not the particulars. ''Instead of a campaign document, and one that isn't a credible plan of action, American workers need and deserve leadership from the White House for a tax code that will encourage economic growth and job creation,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is the party's senior statesman on tax issues.
The headline goal of the proposal is to cut the highest official tax rate for all corporations to 28 percent from 35 percent -- without reducing federal revenue. A wide range of economists, and policy makers in both parties, say such a change would distribute the burden of taxation more fairly and reduce the warping influence of the tax code on investment decisions. The government estimates that companies spend $40 billion each year figuring out how much they owe in taxes, and considerably more figuring out how to reduce that number.
Among the options outlined by the White House in a 25-page paper: taxing large businesses that currently avoid paying any taxes by organizing as partnerships.
The government has long allowed businesses to organize as partnerships, which avoid corporate income taxes by ''passing through'' the profits to the partners. But what began as a shelter for small businesses, the so-called subchapter S partnerships, has increasingly attracted very large ones, including Menards, the mutual fund giant Fidelity and the huge engineering firm Bechtel. About 69 percent of domestic companies were organized as partnerships in 2008, according to the latest Internal Revenue Service data, and they distributed about $1 trillion in income to their partners.
Another big idea: changing a tax break widely used by oil companies, but also by car dealerships, supermarkets and distillers, including Brown-Forman. The provision lets firms calculate profits based on their current costs, rather than the prices they actually paid in the past. This is particularly valuable for companies that make things slowly.
The top corporate tax rate of 35 percent is a theoretical marker. Corporations actually paid an average of 26 percent of income in federal taxes in 2007 and 2008, according to the Treasury Department, thanks to a wide range of deductions, subsidies and loopholes. As a result, some large companies pay little or nothing while others pay much more.
The Treasury estimated that utilities paid 14 percent of income in taxes in 2007 and 2008, while construction firms paid 31 percent.
The administration's proposal is not aimed at shifting the overall average significantly; rather, the goal is to cluster companies closer to the midpoint.
''Because many of these subsidies flow to certain industries and not others, they are fundamentally unfair,'' the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said. ''Right now, companies in some industries pay two or three times the effective tax rates as companies in other industries.''
But there is a significant and countervailing exception: the White House wants to create several new loopholes and subsidies for manufacturing companies, with the explicit goal of ensuring they pay less in taxes than other kinds of companies.
The proposal would expand a tax deduction for manufacturers, and create a permanent tax credit for corporate spending on research and development. It also would create an even more tightly targeted tax credit for the production of renewable electricity.
''My guys are totally freaked out by manufacturing getting a different tax rate than we do,'' said Jade West, senior vice president for government relations at the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. ''They're not more important in the economy than retail or distribution or anything else.''
It's not even clear how many manufacturers would benefit. One crucial reason: The proposals benefit companies that make things in America, but penalize American companies that make things in other countries.
Also, a number of experts said the absence of details made it impossible to assess which companies would ultimately bear the cost of the plan.
That is regrettable but also perfectly understandable, said Martin A. Sullivan, a former Treasury economist now a contributing editor of Tax Analysts, a trade publication. ''Why get specific and get your head blown off,'' he said, referring to the inevitable objections by those companies, ''especially when it's not going to become law anyway?''

HEADLINE: Fast Growth for India's Outsourcing Industry, Despite Weak Global Economy

BYLINE: NEHA THIRANI


HIGHLIGHT: Revenues expected to cross $100 billion this year for the first time ever. 

 BODY:
India's internet technology industry continues to expand, despite weak economies in key markets in United States and Europe, thanks to domestic growth and a push into new regions like the Middle East and Africa.
Revenues for India's information technology and outsourcing industries are expected to cross $100 billion this financial year, a 14.8 percent increase from last year and double 2007, the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), India's technology industry association said in a recent report. The group, which has over 1,200 corporate members, predicts that revenues will reach $225 billion by 2020.
"There has been consistent growth in the domestic IT market," said Rajendra Pawar, chairman of NASSCOM, explaining the rise in a press conference on February 15, 2012. Total revenues in the sector will reach $101 billion in the year that ends March 31, 2012, the report said. Exports, or work done for clients outside India, will make up $69 billion of that figure. Growth in the domestic market is expected to be 16.5 percent, to $32 billion.
A rise in global technology spending is also a key factor behind the industry's increase, NASSCOM officials said. Information technology spending rose 4.5 percent in the current fiscal year, as companies realize they need to spend aggressively on adapting to new technologies, said Som Mittal, president of NASSCOM. "Companies are not being conservative on the transformation aspect of their spending; as shifts to mobile technology and so on take place, it becomes necessary to move quickly and adapt," he said.
Changing business models are also helping the industry grow in India -- India's share of global outsourcing was 58 percent this fiscal year, up three percent from last year.
The last decade has been turbulent, Mr. Pawar noted, but still the industry grew nine times, by revenues.
He credits "inner transformations in the industry such as hyper-specialization," where clients are seeking service providers who specialize in their field and can provide customized solutions. For instance, insurance companies prefer to work with companies who have gained knowledge and expertise in insurance related business processes. "In addition to the large companies of the sector, which frequently draw headlines, there are a lot of new young companies that are collectively contributing about two billion of the hundred billion."
Indian information technologies are spreading, geographically, and offering existing customers new services, NASSCOM said. While previously a majority of the industries revenues came from the United States and Britain, new business is coming from new geographies like Eastern Europe.
India's information technology and outsourcing industries continue to be one of the largest employers in the country. Over 230,000 jobs were added in the current fiscal year, bringing total direct employment to about 2.8 million people. The number of foreigners in the industry has grown significantly as well - as of this year, some 40,000 employees are not Indian.
Indian information technology companies are making acquisitions abroad and expand overseas, but they are also hiring foreigners because India's pool of experienced talent is running dry. In India, there is enough entry-level talent to support the industry's 16 to 20 percent annual growth, Mr. Mittal said. "But experienced personnel are not as easily available," he said.
The falling value of the rupee in recent times has had a slight, tangential, effect on the industry, NASSCOM officials said. Mr Pawar said there has as yet been no real pressure on the prices that information technology companies charge, because currency is too complex for companies to factor in as off now.
The industry has so far been sheltered from the effects of the Eurozone crisis as well, as Indian companies have not reported problems in payments and pricing coming from customers in Europe as off yet. "Cash problems as we know are mostly with governments, not companies," said Mr. Pawar. "However, the Euro zone problem is big enough that it will affect companies, who in turn will tighten their belts on spending. When it will go from being a cash problem in the government to a cash problem in companies is yet to be seen."
However, analysts believe that future instability in the value of the rupee and the global economy could affect the industry significantly. "Price wars could be on the agenda if the Rupee continues to remain weak and that the economic crisis in Europe means less growth for the Indian industry," said Fred Giron, principal analyst at Forrester Research.
NASSCOM's forecast of $225 billion in revenues for the industry by 2020 is heavily dependent on domestic spending. "There is great scope as we are currently under-invested in technology as a country," said Mr. Mittal. The industry group predicts about $50 billion of the $225 billion will come from Indian companies, particularly in the healthcare, utilities, media and entertainment industries.
Forrester's analysis is similar. "I believe that the domestic market is where most of the growth will be coming through 2015," said Mr. Giron. "Forrester estimates that the India domestic market in India will grow at 14% in 2012 and will be the fastest growing market in Asia."
However analysts say that a continued slump in global economic growth, potential protectionist moves against off-shoring activities in the United States, and a policy paralysis in India may hamper future prospects.
In order for the industry to reach its projected growth, NASSCOM officials say the Indian government needs clearer policy, and investments in skill development that focus on ensuring that more people are being equipped with the right kind of education background for the jobs available in the field. While most work is currently located in the top six cities of India, industry officials say they are promoting opening centers in the smaller cities in India. "We have to also look into improving the business environment to attract more foreign investment into the country," said Mr. Mittal. "We would like to make India an R&D hub."

HEADLINE: Regulators Adopt New Derivatives Rules

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Swaps dealers will be required to manage the risks posed by derivatives trading, prevent conflicts of interest and empower a chief compliance officer to prepare an annual report detailing internal controls. 

 BODY:
The big banks and traders that dominate the $600 trillion derivatives industry will face new oversight under a plan approved by regulators on Thursday. 
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission voted 3 to 2 on Thursday to adopt new rules for the biggest players in the derivatives world.
The final rules, originally proposed in late 2010, spell out numerous requirements to bolster internal business standards. Firms must, for example, manage the risks posed by derivatives trading, prevent conflicts of interest and empower a chief compliance officer to prepare an annual report detailing a firm's internal controls. 
"It will lower the risk that swap dealers pose to the rest of the economy," Gary Gensler, the agency's chairman, said at a meeting in Washington on Thursday. 
The rules apply to swap dealers - big banks, brokerages and large energy-trading firms that create derivatives contracts. The agency's plan also affects hedge funds and other traders that have large positions in swaps, the derivative contracts tied to the value of commodities, interest rates and mortgage securities.
But the agency has yet to define the exact universe of swaps dealers and so-called major swaps participants. The agency initially planned to put the finishing touches on the definitions on Thursday, but delayed the vote while other regulators finalized a similar rule. 
The flood of new derivatives rules stems from the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulatory overhaul passed in response to the financial crisis. The law mandated greater federal oversight of swaps trading, requiring the C.F.T.C. to adopt more than 50 new rules. 
Under the new rules, banks and traders must adopt new risk management policies to control for the danger and volatility that come with derivatives trading. Firms must also keep an eye on the size of their trading positions to comply with laws that cap the number of contracts a trader can hold. 
The rules take aim at another sore spot for Wall Street: conflicts of interest. The agency will now require firms to create firewalls that prevent, say, a derivatives trader from influencing the content of the firm's derivatives industry research. The rules also bar banks from offering favorable research to clients, or threatening negative reports, in exchange for potential business. 
Republican members of the commission voted against the rules, saying the agency was overreaching the mandate Congress laid out in Dodd-Frank. In a series of testy exchanges, Scott D. O'Malia, a Republican member of the commission, pressed agency staff members to justify what he called "duplicative" requirements. 
"I believe the commission has failed to carefully and precisely identify a clear baseline against which the commission measured costs and benefits and the range of alternatives under consideration in this rule," Mr. O'Malia said. 
Mr. Gensler recalled, however, that under the Clinton administration, the government exempted derivatives trading from new oversight, an initiative that allowed the industry to ratchet up risk in the lead up to the financial crisis. Mr. Gensler, who supported the lax oversight when he was an official at the Treasury Department in the 1990s, said the crisis cast doubt on the wisdom of light regulation. 
"That was a false assumption and I will even say I was part of that assumption," Mr. Gensler said. "That's why I'm so happy today to be able to support this rule, that this agency does have a role and Congress asked us to do it."

HEADLINE: In Brooklyn, a Man of Many Vans

BYLINE: RICHARD S. CHANG


HIGHLIGHT: Kevin Cyr has painted portraits and customized die-cast models of the dinged, rusted and graffiti-covered work vans of New York. 

 BODY:
Old work vans, covered in dents, rust and layers of graffiti, are as commonplace on New York streets as taxicabs and tourists looking for Times Square. 
"They are the workhorses of the city, but I've noticed that they are being replaced by Dodge Sprinters," said Kevin Cyr, a 35-year-old artist based in Brooklyn. 
Mr. Cyr keeps closer tabs on the city's van population than most. Over seven years, he has painted portraits of more than 30 vans, as well as customized die-cast miniatures of his favorites.
"They are mostly from Queens and Brooklyn," he said of his subjects during a visit to his studio. "It has to be the right vintage. I love it when it is covered in dents and dings and there's rust. It has to have the right amount of graffiti. The more character the van has, the more fun it is to paint."
Mr. Cyr, whose van paintings are to be displayed in a solo exhibition at Jonathan LeVine Gallery in New York in May, has a predilection for Chevrolets and Fords of the '70s. He photographs them in profile and then paints them onto wood panels, using many layers of oil paint, which imparts a luminescent quality to the works.
He has made three die-cast miniatures through a custom process involving model kits from the '70s, which he has tracked down on eBay. The models, he said, were an intermediate step before producing the prints.
"I wanted to see if I could get a 3-D object to look like a painting," he said.
The 1:24 scale models are strikingly realistic. To replicate peeling rust, Mr. Cyr scratched the vans' plastic surfaces with an X-Acto knife. He molded side mirrors and windshield wipers out of putty. The antennas were whiskers shed by his cat.
"It has the right amount of spring," he said of the whiskers. "Wire was too thick."
Mr. Cyr grew up in Madawaska, Me., and attended Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston, where he began painting the interesting old cars he saw on the street. 
"I was a bicycle messenger from 2000 to 2005," he said. "That was the time that S.U.V.'s were getting humongous. And I thought, 'Look at all these amazing cars that you're replacing with these giant S.U.V.'s.'"
The car paintings were an outgrowth of that observation.
When he moved to New York in 2005, Mr. Cyr turned his focus onto the cargo vans, which he said were "everywhere." 
He says he plans to continue the van series even after the exhibition in May, as he works on other projects including a series of custom camper sculptures. His good intentions, however, are contingent on his finding appropriate subjects - an increasingly difficult prospect, even in New York.
"I need the right combo of vintage, dings, wear and tear, and if the graffiti is interesting," he said. "And I'm running out of them."

HEADLINE: What Cameras Inside Foxconn Found

BYLINE: DAVID POGUE


HIGHLIGHT: ABC's "Nightline" was invited to visit Apple's production lines at Foxconn, giving Americans a chance to see how iPads and iPhones are made in China. A note from a man born in China gave another perspective on jobs in that country. 

 BODY:
I wrote about the Apple/China/Foxconn controversy in this space a couple of weeks ago, but there have been some developments, some progress and some new revelations.
The story so far: Last month, The New York Times published a front-page article highlighting working conditions at a factory in China owned by Foxconn Technology, where Apple's products are built. The problems included fatal accidents and employees injured while using a toxic chemical that can cause nerve damage. (Although Apple is the poster child for Foxconn, just about all of our electronics are made in the same Chinese factories, as the Times article noted. Foxconn also builds products for Sony, Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp, Asus, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Intel, I.B.M., Lenovo, Microsoft, Motorola, Netgear, Nintendo, Nokia and Vizio. The Xbox, the PlayStation and the Amazon Kindle are made here.) The article set off a firestorm of protest, petitions and demonstrations.
Apple responded by vowing to take Chinese worker safety and welfare even more seriously, and it hired the Fair Labor Association to survey 35,000 Foxconn employees about their working conditions. The results of the audit will be made public next month.
For its part, Foxconn responded by raising factory workers' salaries as much as 25 percent.
Anyway, for me, two new sources of light were trained on the Foxconn situation: a TV broadcast and an e-mail. ABC's "Nightline" was invited to visit Apple's production lines at Foxconn. Its correspondent, Bill Weir, was allowed to interview any worker, on camera or off, in the factory or outside.

On Tuesday night, ABC broadcast its report. You can watch it online.
To me, the salient paragraph in his script was this:
It didn't look like a sweatshop, frankly. The assembly-line work was certainly mind-numbingly repetitive - one woman files the burrs off the iPad's Apple-logo hole 6,000 times a day - but that's the nature of assembly-line work. Meanwhile, this factory was clean and modern.
More tellingly, the broadcast showed 3,000 young Chinese workers lining up at the gates for Foxconn's Monday morning recruiting session.
Now, these workers know about the 2010 Foxconn suicides. They know that the starting salary is $2 an hour (plus benefits, and no payroll taxes). They know they'll have 12-hour shifts, with two hourlong breaks. They know that workers sleep in a tiny dorm (six or eight to a room) for $17 a month.
And yet here they are, lining up to work! Apparently, even those conditions, so abhorrent to us, are actually better than these workers' alternatives: backbreaking rural farm work that doesn't prepare them to move up the work force food chain.
Many observers are shocked at the child labor reported at Foxconn. Not only do these Chinese factories employ a lot of young people - the legal working age is 16 - but from what we saw on the ABC broadcast, all of these employees are young.
That's also what a former Apple executive told me this week: that Foxconn is not a career. You don't see 30- and 40-year-old heads of households on the assembly lines. The young Chinese see it as "something like a first summer job," he told me - a way to make some bucks for a few months before heading home, or to get some work experience before moving up.
The second enlightening twist, for me, was a note sent to me from a young man, born in China and now attending an American university.
Circumstances of birth are unfortunately random, and she was born in a very rural region. Most jobs were agricultural and family owned, and most of the jobs were held by men. Women and young girls, because of lack of educational and economic opportunities, had to find other "employment."
The idea of working in a "sweat shop" compared to that old lifestyle is an improvement, in my opinion. I know that my aunt would rather be "exploited" by an evil capitalist boss for a couple of dollars than have her body be exploited by several men for pennies.
That is why I am upset by many Americans' thinking. We do not have the same opportunities as the West. Our governmental infrastructure is different. The country is different.
Yes, factory is hard labor. Could it be better? Yes, but only when you compare such to American jobs.
If Americans truly care about Asian welfare, they would know that shutting down "sweat shops" would force many of us to return to rural regions and return to truly despicable "jobs." And I fear that forcing factories to pay higher wages would mean they hire FEWER workers, not more.
Anyway, now my aunt has been living in New York for one year after saving up money for a plane ticket and visa, and she is wonderfully happy to have escaped Asia and reunited with our family. None of this would be possible if it wasn't for that "sweat shop."
Of course, not all Chinese feel that way. The Times had its article translated into Chinese and published on a Chinese news site. Many comments from Chinese citizens posted to that article were critical of the dangerous working conditions at Foxconn factories. Some said that Apple was ultimately responsible and should be held accountable, the position that labor rights groups take.
Plenty of Westerners remain unconvinced, too, even by ABC's report and Apple's investigation. "Frontline," for example, is a production of ABC News, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company; its chief executive serves on the Apple board, and the Steve Jobs Trust is Disney's largest shareholder. (To its credit, ABC mentioned that potential conflict of interest in the broadcast.)
Similarly, Apple is paying the Fair Labor Association six figures to conduct the audit. If the company being exonerated is also writing the checks, you have to be suspicious.
And as the ABC broadcast also pointed out, Foxconn knew in advance that the Fair Labor Association's inspectors were coming, and it had plenty of opportunity to put on a good show for them (and for ABC's cameras).
But the program also included interviews with the workers' impoverished families in rural villages, who spoke of the improvements Foxconn's presence had brought to their lives. And it's hard to forget those 3,000 people lining up for Foxconn jobs every Monday.
In other words, the lessons of this controversy have more to do with China than with Apple. This is only marginally a technology story - I imagine we could find low-wage, tiring jobs at every factory in China, making everything that China makes. Every toy, every houseware, every garment. You could do a year's worth of exposes.
Still, we should be happy that in this corner of the Chinese landscape, things are getting better. On ABC's show, a Fair Labor Association inspector, Ines Kaempfer, called the last month a "Nike moment" for Apple. In the 1990s, Nike's sweatshops weren't the worst in the business, but they're the ones that got the negative publicity. In response, it cleaned up its act, and thereby lifted the bar for the entire industry.
Clearly, the recent spotlight on conditions at Foxconn has performed a similar service for the electronics industry. Better wages are good. More careful monitoring is good. Transparency - like letting TV cameras into your assembly lines - is good.

HEADLINE: Chronicle of an Election Foretold

BYLINE: DANIEL POLITI


HIGHLIGHT: Can Yemen's new president keep his country from becoming a failed state? 

 BODY:
Following more than a year of antigovernment protests, Yemenis went to the polls on Tuesday to mark the end of Ali Abdullah Saleh's 33 years of autocratic rule. But with only one candidate on the ballot - Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi - the election's importance was largely symbolic.
Turning the page seemed most important. "The vote for al-Hadi wasless a vote for the consensus candidate al-Hadi than a vote to move on after the fall of Ali Abdullah," writes Daniel Martin Varisco in Tabsir, a blog about Islam and the Middle East.

After months "at a standstill," notes the Dubai-based Gulf News, and despite many challenges ahead, at least now the dangerous political vacuum can start to be filled. "The recent election is a first step on which the future is to be built."
But can Hadi face up to Yemen's unique problems? He "is known for enjoying a professional experience, not for being a political leader," writes Abdullah Iskandar in the London-based Dar Al Hayat. He's going to need all the help he can get. "Yemen will not be able to elude the fate of a failed state without the political and financial efforts of the sponsors of the settlement that ended his rule," claims Iskandar.
Ghassan Charbel agrees that outside powers will matter, arguing in a column for Dar Al Hayat (republished in Al Arabiya News) that "The forces that called for the president [Saleh] to step down must today demonstrate their seriousness and reveal their program." For Varisco, those forces could do much harm. Yemen "is not Somalia, nor Afghanistan, unless foreign powers, including the United States, strive to make it that kind of failed state."
Others are worried. "Beset by political instability for decades, Yemen today appears increasingly chaotic," contends an editorial in Lebanon's Daily Star. Terrorism, sectarianism, unemployment and corruption all "point toward the creation of a failed state."

HEADLINE: Study Tests Claims of Republican Candidates' Debt Plans

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: A centrist budget-watchdog group, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, is punching trillion-dollar holes in the claims of Republican presidential candidates that they would rein in the mounting federal debt if elected, according to an analysis to be released on Thursday. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - A centrist budget-watchdog group is punching trillion-dollar holes in the claims of Republican presidential candidates that they would rein in the mounting federal debt if elected, according to an analysis to be released on Thursday.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group of former members of Congress, former administration officials, budget experts and business leaders of both parties, analyzed each candidate's agenda under three scenarios - most optimistic, intermediate and most pessimistic, depending on the specificity of the candidates' proposals. It found that all four men remaining in the Republican race would increase annual budget deficits beyond what is currently projected, under at least one of the scenarios studied.
Over a two-term presidency, Newt Gingrich would increase deficits beyond current projections under all three scenarios, as much as $9.7 trillion, while Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum would increase deficits under two of the three forecasts by trillions of dollars. Ron Paul, with his libertarian small-government agenda, would decrease deficits under two of three scenarios. 
The budget group produced a dry, numbers-heavy and non-judgmental assessment in keeping with its nonprofit and nonpartisan status. Still, the findings challenge a central rationale of each Republican's candidacy - that he would be a better steward of the nation's fiscal health than President Obama. The Committee will issue its analysis of the president's agenda later.
Its analysts examined the Republicans' policy platforms for their impact on the national debt from 2013 through fiscal year 2021, the period covering a two-term administration. 
The finding that all four candidates might be expected to add to projected annual deficits reflects the fact that all of them propose additional deep tax cuts for individuals and corporations on top of an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, which otherwise expire Dec. 31. They also would end estate taxes. 
And the tax cuts in most scenarios exceed the deep spending cuts each Republican proposes. All four would repeal the 2010 health care law, which would not save much money since the law includes spending cuts and tax increases to offset expanded insurance coverage. All would shrink federal workforce costs. And they would cut and cap spending for Medicaid and other safety-net programs and turn those programs into block grants to the states. 
Following is a summary of the findings for the candidates, in order of highest deficits to lowest.
NEWT GINGRICH: The policies so far espoused by Mr. Gingrich, the former House speaker, would increase deficits by $7 trillion over two terms, under the intermediate projection; that would raise the federal debt - measured against the size of the economy - to a level equivalent to 114 percent of G.D.P. Under the more optimistic forecast, deficits would increase $2.8 trillion (for a debt equal to 97 percent of G.D.P.) and the more pessimistic projection would mean $9.7 trillion in additional deficits (for debt equal to 126 percent of G.D.P.). 
Mr. Gingrich would eliminate capital gains and estate taxes, create a flat 15 percent income tax and reduce corporate income taxes. On spending, he would cut most education money and reduce by half more than 100 means-tested programs - among them food stamps, housing assistance and child-care services - and send that money to states as block grants. Mr. Gingrich also would create private retirement accounts from Social Security. 
Because the debt would be larger in a Gingrich administration, the government's interest payments would increase by at least $350 billion and as much as $1.2 trillion. 
RICK SANTORUM: A President Santorum would add $4.5 trillion to deficits over two terms, under the intermediate projection, leaving a debt equal to 104 percent of G.D.P. Under the more optimistic projection he would reduce deficits by $2.6 trillion (for a debt of 74 percent of G.D.P.); under the pessimistic scenario, Mr. Santorum would increase deficits by $5.3 trillion (for a debt of 107 percent of G.D.P.).
Additional tax cuts of more than $6 trillion through 2021 would significantly exceed spending cuts under two of the three projections (under the third, more optimistic scenario, Mr. Santorum is given credit for trillions of dollars in spending cuts that he does not specify). Mr. Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, would make Medicare a voucher system, reduce Social Security benefits and freeze military spending.
Interest payments on the debt would be $360 billion lower under the optimistic scenario, $740 billion higher under the pessimistic one.
MITT ROMNEY: Mr. Romney would increase deficits by $250 billion through 2021, resulting in debt equivalent to 86 percent of G.D.P., under the intermediate projections. The more optimistic projection would have a two-term President Romney reducing deficits by $2.2 trillion (for debt of 75 percent of G.D.P.) or, under the pessimistic projection, increasing them by $2.2 trillion (for debt of 94 percent of G.D.P.).
The group amended its report late on Wednesday to reflect the additional reductions in individuals' income taxes that Mr. Romney had proposed earlier in the day. Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, said the tax cuts would not add to deficits because he would slash existing tax breaks to offset the cost of lower rates. He did not say how he would do that; the tax breaks are popular ones for mortgage interest, charitable giving, state and local tax payments and employer-provided health insurance. Without offsetting savings, Mr. Romney's new tax cut proposals would add $2.6 trillion to the debt over a two-term presidency, the group said.
Mr. Romney previously has called for cutting the corporate tax to 25 percent from 35 percent. He would overhaul Medicare and Social Security for savings. Interest on the debt would be $270 billion less under the optimistic scenario, or $270 billion more under the pessimistic projection.
RON PAUL: Mr. Paul would reduce deficits either by $2.2 trillion, under the intermediate scenario, for a debt equivalent to 76 percent of G.D.P., or by $4.3 trillion (bringing the debt to 67 percent of G.D.P., about where it is now) under the optimistic low-debt scenario.
But under the third, more pessimistic scenario, Mr. Paul, too, would produce higher deficits than currently are projected - nearly $2 trillion higher, for a total debt equal to 93 percent of G.D.P.
Mr. Paul would eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends, estates and Social Security benefits and end the alternative minimum tax intended for affluent and wealthy taxpayers. He would expand various tax breaks for individuals and businesses. On spending, he would shrink the military, and seek to end the federal government's role in highways, the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration. He also would end the Federal Reserve System. 
Interest payments on the debt would be either $300 billion or $700 billion lower under the two scenarios producing lower deficits, and $260 billon higher under the pessimistic scenario.

HEADLINE: Opening Up the Fed

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: While Ben Bernanke has made Federal Reserve decision-making more transparent, too much still takes place behind closed doors, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve has great power in modern American society, including the ability to move the economy and, at least indirectly, to create or destroy fortunes. Its powers operate in two ways: through control over monetary policy, meaning interest rates and credit conditions more broadly, and through its influence over how the financial system is regulated generally and how specific large banks are treated.
The secrecy of our central bank has long been a source of controversy. In line with changes at central banks in other countries over recent decades, the Fed's chairman, Ben Bernanke, has pushed for more transparency regarding how individual members of the Federal Open Market Committee view the economy - and thus how they are thinking about the future course of interest rates (and the Fed keeps us posted). This is a commendable change, helping people throughout the economy understand what the Fed is trying to do and why.
Under pressure from both left and right - consider the unlikely alliance of Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Representative Ron Paul of Texas - the Fed has also, after the fact, disclosed more of its actions during the recent financial crisis.
But in terms of its process for determining financial-sector regulation, the Federal Reserve - at least at the level of the Board of Governors in Washington - is moving in the wrong direction.
Fed officials do testify frequently before Congress - 11 times last year on regulatory and supervisory matters, by the Fed's count. But the Fed's decision-making process is nowhere near as open and transparent as that of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (about which I wrote recently). 
The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that during the 1980s the Fed's board held 20 to 30 public meetings a year, but these dwindled during the Greenspan years to fewer than five a year in the 2000s and "only two public meetings since July 2010." At the same time, "the Fed has taken on a much larger regulatory role than at any time in history" - including "47 separate votes on financial regulations" since July 2010, The Journal said.
This high level of secrecy is a concern. It is particularly alarming when combined with the disproportionate access afforded to industry participants in the arguments about what constitutes sensible financial reform. 
Just on the Volcker Rule - the provision in Dodd-Frank to limit proprietary trading and other high-risk activities by megabanks - Fed board members and staff members apparently met with JPMorgan Chase 16 times, Bank of America 10 times, Goldman Sachs nine times, Barclays seven times and Morgan Stanley seven times (as depicted in a chart that accompanies the Wall Street Journal article).
How many meetings does a single company need on one specific issue? How many would you get?
For example, Americans for Financial Reform, an organization that describes itself as "fighting for a banking and financial system based on accountability, fairness and security," met with senior Federal Reserve officials only three times on the Volcker Rule. (Disclosure: I have appeared at public events organized by Americans for Financial Reform, but they have never paid me any money. I agree with many of its policy positions, but I have not been involved in any of their meetings with regulators.)
Americans for Financial Reform works hard for its cause, and it produced a strong letter on the Volcker Rule - as did others, including Better Markets and Anat Admati's group based at Stanford University. 
Based on what is in the public domain on the Fed's Web site, my assessment is that people opposed to sensible financial reform - including but not limited to the Volcker Rule - have had much more access to top Federal Reserve officials than people who support such reforms. More generally, it looks to me as though, even by the most generous (to the Fed) account, meetings with opponents of reform outnumber meetings with supporters of reform about 10 to 1.
According to those records, for example, the Admati group has not yet managed to obtain a single meeting with top Fed officials on any issue, despite the fact that the group's members are top experts whose input is welcomed at other leading central banks. To my definite knowledge, they have tried hard to engage with people throughout the Federal Reserve System; some regional Feds are receptive, but the board has not been - either at the governor or staff level.
When I asked the Fed about this lack of engagement with the most prominent research team advocating higher capital requirements, a representative sent this response: 
We are meeting with a variety of groups and individuals with diverse perspectives and are carefully considering both what we hear in the meetings and what we read in the tens of thousands of comment letters we are receiving as we work with other regulators to implement the Dodd-Frank Act.
I do not understand the Fed's attitude and policies -- if it is serious about pushing for financial reform. No doubt they are all busy people, but how is it possible they have time to meet with JPMorgan Chase 16 times (just on the Volcker Rule) and no time to meet Anat Admati - not even for a single substantive exchange of views?

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
Between the lines of detail in the tax cuts proposed on Wednesday by Mitt Romney is his effort to shore up support for his campaign among conservatives after being edged out of front-runner status in polls by Rick Santorum, John Harwood writes.
Looking at who gets what from President Obama's corporate tax plan, Jackie Calmes writes that new details seem to show that manufacturers rank high among the winners, though Congress is unlikely to act on any of the president's proposals.
The four remaining Republican presidential candidates sparred over taxes, spending and contraception on Wednesday night in their last debate before voters in Arizona and Michigan cast their votes in the states' presidential primaries on Feb. 28. Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg evaluate the candidates' performances and the implications for the campaign going forward, while Times reporters check the facts.
A federal judge in San Francisco became the latest judge to rule against the federal Defense of Marriage Act, agreeing with arguments that the law violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution, Adam Nagourney reports. He says the Supreme Court is likely to take up a challenge to the law.
Around the Web:
Mr. Santorum's insistence that Mr. Obama has some kind of "phony theology" echoes a theme of his campaign, which asserts that Democrats and Obama have a secular worldview that they intend to impose on Christians and nonbelievers alike, according to The Washington Post.
Happening in Washington:
Economic data expected today includes weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. and, at 10, thequarterly federal home price index and weekly mortgage rates.
At noon, demonstrators plan to rally outside the Supreme Court to demand that the justices reconsider their 2010 decision in Citizens United.
Bradley Manning, the Army private accused of leaking classified documents to WikiLeaks, is due to face arraignment at 1 p.m. at the Fort Meade military base in Maryland.
General James E. Cartwright, the former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and The Times's David E. Sanger are among the speakers at a conference this evening focused the United States' policy options with Iran.

HEADLINE: Obama Goes After Republicans in New Michigan Ad

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama is highlighting his support for the federal assistance plan that helped rescue Detroit automakers in a new television commercial that accuses Republican presidential candidates of abandoning the industry in its darkest hour. 

 BODY:
DETROIT - President Obama is highlighting his support for the federal assistance plan that helped rescue Detroit automakers in a new television commercial that accuses Republican presidential candidates of abandoning the industry in its darkest hour.
The 30-second commercial, called "Made in America," also mentions Mitt Romney's now well-known opinion article that carried the headline "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt."
Over images of factory employees hard at work and smiling families, an announcer says, "when a million jobs were on the line, every Republican candidate turned their back, even said, 'Let Detroit go Bankrupt.'"
Then the commercial pivots to the president. "Not him," says the announcer as a sound bite of the president plays. "Don't bet against the American auto industry," Mr. Obama is shown saying.
The ad is certain to draw even more of a focus on the sensitive and complex politics of the auto industry bailout, which all the Republican candidates have said they opposed. Mr. Obama and Democrats have sought to draw attention to that opposition now that Detroit car makers are adding jobs and the economy in Michigan is showing signs of progress.
In a Detroit Free Press poll released today, there were signs that Mr. Romney's opposition to the bailout were complicating his prospects here in his home state. Asked what they disliked most about Mr. Romney, 12 percent of likely Republican primary voters cited his opposition to the rescue plan.

HEADLINE: Detroit Free Press Endorses Romney

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney picks up an important newspaper endorsement in Michigan. 

 BODY:
The Detroit Free Press on Thursday endorsedMitt Romney, bit did so while chiding him for his opposition to granting federal aid to automakers during the financial crisis:
"Romney was also dead wrong when he opposed government bailouts for the auto industry (Michigan's most vital economic engine) in late 2008. And he has since adopted a recalcitrant and, at times, revisionist defense of his position in the face of overwhelming evidence that the bailouts he opposed were necessary." 
In endorsing him five days before the Michigan primary, the Free Press said, "His record and history - his term as governor of Massachusetts, his rescue of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, even his time as a venture capitalist and management consultant - make him far more qualified to represent the Republican Party in the 2012 presidential race than the other candidates."

HEADLINE: For FreshDirect, an Old-Fashioned Handout

BYLINE: MICHAEL POWELL


HIGHLIGHT: FreshDirect parlayed its threat to decamp for New Jersey into what looks like a lucrative deal with no consequences should it fail to generate jobs in the Bronx. 

 BODY:
FreshDirect, the groceries-to-your-doorstep delivery service, enjoyed a quite profitable week recently. 
 As I noted in my Gotham column Tuesday, the company, which forever has "iconic" pasted to its name in press releases, toyed briefly with relocating to New Jersey. Development officials there batted their eyes and whispered of a golden subsidy and a handsome nest in Secaucus.
New York City and state officials reacted like class nerds about to get tossed over and began showering cash on the modestly profitable grocery service. When the city and state reached $127.8 million in tax subsidies and cash, FreshDirect's owners smiled gracefully, agreed to create about 1,000 jobs in the next 10 years and accepted the deal. 
The city's Industrial Development Agency held a public hearing last Tuesday and voted to approve it. The vote lacked drama as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had announced their approval of the deal a week earlier. 
 No one has examined the sweetness of the FreshDirect deal in more fine-grained detail than Bettina Damiani, project director of the nonprofit group Good Jobs New York. She takes a dim view, and her analysis is here, along with relevant city and state documents.
 "It's not only an awful lot of money, it's an awful process," she says. 
 Her disappointment is that much greater because Mr. Bloomberg, despite a profligate slip here or there, has taken a tougher line than his predecessors on corporate welfare. He has refused to toss cash at any corporate chieftain who decides to have lunch with a New Jersey economic development official.
And the city's Economic Development Agency, thanks to a City Council law, has become markedly more open. 
 "New York City," Ms. Damiani said, "is on an upswing with regards to subsidy transparency." 
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani snarled like a polecat but purred when CEOs came calling, giving away hundreds of millions of dollars to Fortune 500 companies. He rarely, if ever, checked to see if they'd filched the city's wallet.
Mr. Bloomberg's appointees, by contrast, have since 2003 recovered $85 million from companies that failed to produce promised jobs. 
The FreshDirect deal, in this sense, is an unfortunate throwback. Its owner, Jason Ackerman, is a former investment banker, and he played the political-financial angles expertly. FreshDirect pays $48,000 each year to a politically connected lobbyist, Evan Stavisky's Parkside Group. With the big money on the table, FreshDirect reloaded, adding Steve Polivy of Akerman Seterfitt. Mr. Polivy represented the ill-fated Yankee Stadium parking garage. FreshDirect gave him $17,825 (and counting) to lobby the mayor, the Bronx borough president and the Economic Development Corporation. 
This was inarguably money well spent. The deal puts the welfare in corporate - the company faces few penalties if it fails to keep its side of the bargain. The Industrial Development Authority does not have contract language that would allow it to claw back tax subsidies should FreshDirect fail to deliver on the thousand jobs.
City officials agree this is a problem, but they say the state can recapture money. And it's true that the state has from time to time recaptured money from corporations that failed to produce promised jobs. 
The Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation is another matter. This public agency gave $3.5 million in loans and grants to FreshDirect. 
 The agency's president, Marlene Cintron, insisted she would seek to recapture money if FreshDirect reneged. 
"Would I use that power in a second? Definitely," she said. 
Excellent. As the Bronx agency has done lots of lending over the years. I asked how often her agency has demanded money back for broken corporate promises. Never, she said. 
Not once?
"No," she replied. "Do I put a company under pressure because they failed to reach a goal, or do I keep working with them?" 
Give Ms. Cintron credit for asking a good question.
The Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., meanwhile, heralded his toughness in wrangling a memorandum of understanding out of FreshDirect, also available on the Good Jobs web site. This agreement comes not so much with teeth as with dentures.
 FreshDirect, the memorandum states, will agree to seek out "qualified persons" in the Bronx. And it will "makes it best effort" to ensure that 30 percent of the new jobs go to Bronx residents. 
 And FreshDirect agreed to meet at least once a year with Ms. Cintron, or her successor, to discuss its progress, or lack thereof.
 There is too the question of FreshDirect and its distinctly low wage scale.
 As it stands, the city will pour about $130 million into a modestly profitable company over a decade without requiring that it pay more than $9 an hour to workers who labor in frigid warehouses hauling 50-pound boxes. The workers get less than two weeks off a year, and that includes sick, personal and vacation days.
Local 805 of the Teamsters has twice tried to organize the workers, and the company has fought back vigorously.
This, of course, is the company's right. But it brings us to a peculiar bit of mathematics: 
 A FreshDirect warehouse worker working full time for a year makes a touch under $20,000. Thanks to city, state, and Bronx subsidies, FreshDirect will be paid about $130,000 per job to create 1,000 more of these jobs.
Great work if you can get it. 
Comptroller John C. Liu's office offered a different comparison: "For the cost of this benefits package the city could give 4,385 students full, four-year scholarships to C.U.N.Y. or hire 1,458 new teachers or pay for 350,000 GED test-prep programs or launch a micro-lending program for minority and women entrepreneurs."
Sandy Pope, the Teamsters local president, argues this "just means that this business model can't survive without subsidy."
That may or may not be true. FreshDirect argues that it's earning a profit now. But reader Gerhard Holt, a doctor with a background in economics, wrote to respond to my Tuesday column. He posed the question a different way:
What if the city let FreshDirect disappear into the Lincoln Tunnel and took the $100 million in subsidies and seeded a New York City-based competing online grocer and delivery service instead?
Perhaps there are entrepreneurs, who in a fierce and public competition would come up with a plan that is more environmentally friendly (as attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo sued FreshDirect some years ago for letting its trucks idle too long, and exacted a significant fine) and offers better wages?
 The city knows how to do this. As Mr. Holt notes, it recently ran a world-class and fierce competition to build a high-tech campus on Roosevelt Island. "Perhaps," he said, "such a process would result in a better deal for New York and its residents."

HEADLINE: 3 Big European Banks Post Losses

BYLINE: JACK EWING and JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: Exposure to Greek debt and other damaged assets resulted in quarterly losses at Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Agricole and Dexia. 

 BODY:
FRANKFURT - Several of Europe's largest banks provided a reminder Thursday of how much work remains to overcome the effects of the financial crisis that began in 2008 and the sovereign debt crisis that quickly followed.
Burdened by their exposure to Greek government debt and other damaged assets, Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Agricole in France and Dexia, a French-Belgian bank, all reported quarterly losses.
Commerzbank in Germany returned to profit in the fourth quarter of 2011 after a loss the previous quarter, but still served as a case study in the difficulties for banks in regaining the trust of investors. Commerzbank shares plunged more than 6 percent to close at 1.93 euros. Thursday after it announced a plan to exchange debt obligations issued by the bank for shares.
 "We all knew it was going to be a tough quarter, and it was a tough quarter," said Matthew Czepliewicz, a banking analyst at Collins Stewart. "Most banks have been sacrificing a bit of their earnings for the sake of strength of their balance sheet."
"The sector has made a lot of progress," he added. "Having said that, the economic backdrop remains pretty fragile, and the question is going to be where is revenue growth going to come from."
Nearly four years after the financial crisis began in the United States and two years after Greece's debt problems became a threat to the integrity of the euro, many of the region's financial institutions remain dependent on the European Central Bank for the cash they need to stay in business, and several continue to receive government support.
Royal Bank of Scotland and Commerzbank, in Frankfurt, are still partly owned by their respective governments, while Dexia is receiving its second government bailout.
The effect of the sovereign debt crisis was particularly visible Thursday as banks booked losses from their Greek bond holdings. Greece and its creditors reached an agreement early this week that will cut the face value of its debt by more than half. The deal may help Greece avoid a chaotic default, but it forces banks to recognize the losses if they have not done so already.
"It just highlights the major headwinds all banks are facing at the moment," said Chintan Joshi, an analyst at Nomura in London. "It's not just earnings but also asset quality. The trend is going to be challenging until we get out of this slow-growth environment."
Royal Bank of Scotland said Thursday that its loss in 2011 widened to 2 billion pounds, or $3.2 billion, from 1.1 billion pounds a year earlier because of large losses on the Greek holdings, and because the bank had to compensate some customers who had wrongly been sold insurance.
Credit Agricole, one of France's largest banks, reported a fourth-quarter loss of 3.1 billion euros ($4.1 billion) as it wrote off more than 2.5 billion euros in soured investments, including an additional 221 million euros on its Greek debt holdings. Commerzbank booked a loss from its holdings of Greek government bonds in the quarter of about 700 million euros.
Dexia, the lender that ended up in the hands of the French and Belgian governments last October after it lost the faith of investors, posted a 2011 loss of 11.6 billion euros, one of the largest in French corporate history. A year earlier, the bank reported a profit of 723 million euros. Dexia said the loss included 3.4 billion euros from the markdown of its Greek exposure.
As they move to clean up their books and increase profits, banks are trying to respond to demands from regulators that they increase the amount of capital they keep to protect against losses. Doing so is complicated because investors are wary of putting more money into banks and the European economy is weak.
Commerzbank surprised and disappointed investors with a plan to raise an additional 1 billion euros in capital by converting so-called hybrid instruments, a form of debt, into shares. The transaction will help the bank meet regulatory requirements. But by increasing total outstanding shares, the bank will tend to dilute the value of existing stock.
The European Banking Authority said last year that Commerzbank needed 5.3 billion euros in additional capital, one of the highest amounts of any bank in Europe. Commerzbank said Thursday it had reduced its capital shortfall to 1.8 billion euros by disposing of risky assets and other measures.
Martin Blessing, the Commerzbank chief executive, insisted that it would not need additional aid from taxpayers. The German government holds 25 percent of Commerzbank after a bailout in 2009.
George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain, said Thursday that Royal Bank of Scotland's results showed that management was "cleaning up the mess after the biggest bank bailout in history." The government owns 80 percent of the bank.
But investors are not convinced. "Given that there is no return to a dividend in sight and there are other more attractive banking investment opportunities with a lack of government interference out there, they still have a long way to go," said Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers in London.
"That's not to deny that R.B.S. made considerable progress in its results," he added
Stephen Hester, the chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, embarked on a turnaround plan in 2009 that reduced the bank's riskier assets, cut thousands of jobs and scaled back its investment banking operation by closing some business units. He is also seeking to reduce the bank's reliance on financing from the financial markets and government loans.
The earnings reports Thursday contained a few bright spots. Commerzbank, which focuses on lending to midsize companies in Germany, benefited from the success of the country's powerful export sector, which has continued to thrive by selling products in fast-growing countries like China.
Commerzbank also profited from its unit in Poland, which has one of the strongest economies in the European Union. Healthy growth in those two markets allowed Commerzbank to reduce the amount of money it set aside to cover possible bad loans.
Mr. Blessing forecast that the bank will report an operating profit in 2012.
But like many banking leaders, he added a caveat, "The high degree of uncertainty associated with the European sovereign debt crisis will, however, continue to pose challenges for us."

HEADLINE: Holder Defends Efforts to Fight Financial Fraud

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The remarks by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. were among his first since President Obama announced his administration's redoubled commitment to combat financial fraud. 

 BODY:
Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. defended the Justice Department's record on financial fraud Thursday evening, asserting that the administration's "record of success has been nothing less than historic."
In a speech at Columbia University, Mr. Holder said, "From securities, bank and investment fraud to mortgage, consumer and health care fraud - we've found that these schemes are as diverse as the imaginations of those who perpetrate them, and as sophisticated as modern technology will permit."
Mr. Holder's remarks were among his first public comments since President Obama, during last month's State of the Union address, announced the administration's redoubled commitment to combat financial fraud.
Critics have faulted the Justice Department for not pursuing criminal cases against the banking executives whose conduct helped bring about the 2008 global financial crisis and subsequent deep recession.
Mr. Holder, who spoke to about 400 Columbia students and faculty, addressed those criticisms on Thursday.
"We found that much of the conduct that led to the financial crisis was unethical and irresponsible," said Mr. Holder, who earned his undergraduate and law degrees at Columbia. "But we have also discovered that some of this behavior - while morally reprehensible - may not necessarily have been criminal."
"Believe me, I understand - and I often hear about - the public desire to, as one pundit put it, 'see the handcuffs come to Wall Street,' " he said. "So let me assure you: whenever and wherever we do uncover evidence of criminal wrongdoing, we will not hesitate to bring prosecutions."
Mr. Holder said that in the last two years the department had indicted more than 2,100 people for mortgage fraud."
But the Justice Department has recently experienced some setbacks in white-collar prosecutions that went unmentioned on Thursday.
This week, the government dropped its biggest prosecution of individuals accused of foreign bribery after failing to secure convictions of 10 of the 22 people charged. The two-year-old case, brought under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, was the result of an undercover sting carried out by the F.B.I. in which agents posed as African officials to solicit bribes from United States arms industry executives.
Last week, a federal appeals court overturned the criminal conviction of a former Goldman Sachs computer programmer on charges that he stole trade secrets from the bank when he downloaded source code from Goldman's computers. The ruling was a setback for the Justice Department, which has made the prosecution of high-tech crime and intellectual property theft a priority.
That case was brought by Preet S. Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. Mr. Bharara attended Mr. Holder's speech on Thursday, along with the United States attorneys from Connecticut, New Jersey and the Eastern District of New York.
Mr. Holder teased Mr. Bharara, who has led the government's prosecution of insider-trading crimes on Wall Street, about his becoming a media darling.
"Many of you know Preet from his appearance on the cover of Time magazine and his being called 'the man who is busting Wall Street,' " Mr. Holder said, holding up a copy of the recent issue for the audience.
"He will be signing copies in the back."
Mr. Holder used the speech to trumpet the newly formed law enforcement group that is investigating financial fraud related to the housing boom and its subsequent collapse. He cited the task force's issuance of civil subpoenas to 11 financial companies seeking information related to residential mortgage-backed securities.
"And, although I can't go into detail about ongoing investigations, I can tell you that we expect more to follow," Mr. Holder said.
In a question-and-answer session after the speech, Lee C. Bollinger, the president of Columbia and a legal scholar, changed the subject to affirmative action. Mr. Bollinger, as the president of University of Michigan, was at the center of two Supreme Court cases regarding the use of affirmative action in college admissions.
Mr. Bollinger asked Mr. Holder to comment on the Supreme Court's decision this week to revisit affirmative action by agreeing to hear a case involving race-conscious admissions policies at the University of Texas.
"I'm not sure what's changed since Grutter," Mr. Holder said, referring to a 2003 case in which Mr. Bollinger, as Michigan's president, was the named defendant and the court ruled that the university's affirmative action policies were constitutional.
Legal experts think that the court, whose makeup has changed since 2003, could do away with racial preferences in college admissions.
Mr. Holder noted that Mr. Bollinger had called the court's decision to hear the case "ominous."
"I don't think that's an inappropriate description," he said.
Mr. Holder said he hoped that promoting diverse student bodies remained a factor in university admissions. "I can't imagine a time where the need for diversity will ever cease," he said.

HEADLINE: Tax Gain Lifts A.I.G. Profit to $19.8 Billion

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
American International Group, the insurance company that the government bailed out in 2008, reported a $19.8 billion profit in the fourth quarter of last year, nearly all of it because of a tax-related accounting gain. 
Excluding the accounting adjustment, A.I.G. had operating earnings of $1.6 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with an operating loss of $2.2 billion, or $15.99 a share, a year earlier.
The company also earned $17.8 billion for 2011, its second straight annual profit. A.I.G. teetered near collapse in 2008 before a federal takeover. The government still owns about 76 percent of the company.
Despite the two years of profitability, A.I.G.'s recent results have been inconsistent. In that period, it has posted a profit in only half of its quarterly reports.
A.I.G.'s chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche, is trying to refocus the company on property-casualty and life insurance while reducing investments in riskier areas like those that got it in trouble in the financial crisis. He is also trying to free A.I.G. from government ownership.
The tax benefit occurred as the company released deferred tax assets -- losses that companies carry on their books to reduce future tax payments.
Interest expense fell, aided by payments on debt to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Across A.I.G., claims and claims adjustment expenses fell nearly 38 percent. Its Chartis insurance unit swung to a profit despite catastrophe losses related to flooding in Thailand, helped by a rise in consumer insurance premiums. A.I.G. credited ''expense discipline'' and ''risk selection.''
The Mortgage Guaranty insurance unit fell to a loss. Shares of A.I.G., which is based in New York, rose more than 8 percent in after-hours trading to $30.39.

HEADLINE: Austerity in Europe Puts Pressure on Drug Prices

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE NOVAK

 BODY:
PARIS --Profits at pharmaceutical companies have been declining or showing little growth for the last year as austerity measures across Europe lead to cuts in health care spending. Some analysts say this trend could continue until at least 2014.
Budget cuts mean that many European governments are not willing to pay as much for pills. But new laws in some countries are also putting pressure on companies to prove their drugs are effective or risk having them dropped from the coverage list, or covered at a lower rate. 
And price reductions in Europe can have a ripple effect. Profits from sales in emerging markets may also fall, because governments in emerging markets refer to the prices set in Europe to determine their own.
That would particularly hurt European pharmaceutical companies, which have been quite successful in emerging markets in the last five years. American companies, by contrast, do not rely as much on overseas revenue because of their large domestic market.
Before the recent wave of austerity measures, drug companies faced relatively low resistance from European governments when they set prices and introduced products. Countries with strong industrial bases, like Germany, France and Britain, allowed companies the most flexibility in setting prices.
''The euro crisis is forcing governments to restructure how they think about medications,'' said Richard Bergstrom, director general of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations.
Because the prices governments are willing to pay are falling, drug companies are recalibrating their strategies and considering economic factors earlier in the process of developing medicines. They are also reducing the number of new drugs in which they invest research money.
On average, West European countries spend 8 to 12 percent of their gross domestic product on health care -- a proportion that has remained stable despite the crisis, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The pharmaceutical sector, though, is being hit disproportionately hard because cutting prices for pills is a quick way to reduce spending, compared with alternatives like cutting money for hospitals or restructuring health care systems.
In the last year, pharmaceutical sales to pharmacies and hospitals declined 2.2 percent in France, 3.1 percent in Italy and nearly 9 percent in Spain, according to Business Monitor International, a company in London that follows the pharmaceutical industry.
Analysts say that it is difficult to predict how badly profits will be affected in the next fiscal year. Other factors, including expiring patents, mean that each company's profit will be affected differently.
Still, ''the austerity measures themselves are going to affect everyone,'' Mr. Bergstrom said.
And the numbers are not encouraging.
Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, posted a 7 percent decline in net income for 2011 despite a 16 percent increase in sales. AstraZeneca, based in Britain, posted full-year revenue for 2011 of $1.34 billion, down 2 percent from 2010. In 2011, net profit for the company's West European market was down 11 percent from the previous year.
Kaushal Shah, an analyst with Business Monitor International, said the clearest way to see the effects of the euro crisis on pharmaceutical companies was in job cuts. AstraZeneca plans to cut more than 7,000 jobs in Europe, in addition to the 21,600 positions it has eliminated since 2007. Novartis, a largely European company, will cut nearly 2,000 jobs in the United States this year. Pfizer cut 6,000 jobs last May. In times of hardship, pharmaceutical companies usually lay off sales representatives and protect research and development departments, which lead drug creation. In this crisis, even research and development positions face cuts as companies strive to make these departments more efficient so as to reduce costs while maintaining a pipeline of new products.
''2011 is the first year recorded where R.& D. is down in the industry as a whole,'' Mr. Bergstrom said.
As euro zone countries lower the prices they pay for pills, the European market will also feel the effects of cross-referencing by governments, looking to pill prices in other countries to help determine what they will pay.
Portugal, which cross-references by taking an average of the five cheapest prices of a drug in other countries, is one of many nations that do this. Italy, Germany and Spain are among other countries that cross-reference.
Adding to the challenge for companies is the need to show newly cost-conscious governments that their drugs are cost effective.
Germany, Europe's largest pharmaceutical market, has required drug companies since January 2011 to prove the added benefit of a new medication by producing documentation comparing it with other treatments on the market.
The German government will now pay higher prices only for drugs that clearly demonstrate a unique benefit in relation to other medicines and therapies already available, making Germany the first country in the euro zone to enact such measures as a major part of changes to health care policy. Partly as a result of these changes, the German government reported saving 1.9 billion euros on drugs in 2011, three times the savings in 2010, Business Monitor International said.
Drug companies worry that actions in Germany could hurt sales in other European markets.
''What the industry is seeing now is that process is not so automatic; payers are not always willing to reimburse at a higher rate for a newer, better treatment if there is already a treatment available for patients that costs significantly less,'' said Matthew Cabrey, senior director of corporate communications for Shire Pharmaceuticals.
Shire, based in Dublin, is the maker of Adderall, a blockbuster drug for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or A.D.H.D. Five years ago, Shire began studies that compared its drugs with others on the market, analyzing its amphetamine-based A.D.H.D. medications against competing treatments widely prescribed in Europe.
''Financial conditions have highlighted and accelerated the need to demonstrate value for medicines,'' Mr. Cabrey said.
He said that while conducting the extra tests had not directly increased Shire's cost of doing business, it had significantly affected planning. Shire now considers the economics of pharmaceuticals much earlier in the development process. That can lead to certain medicines not being developed if it seems unlikely that the market will recognize their value.

HEADLINE: Graying And Gay, And Finding A Home

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.; sjames@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Ellen Webster and Shirlee Bromley, both 73 and currently living in the East Bay, are looking forward to spending their golden years in the wine country of Sonoma County.
''We thought it would be a safe place for us,'' Ms. Bromley said.
''You don't have to explain yourself,'' Ms. Webster added. 
No explanation is required because this lesbian couple, former Christian missionaries, plan to move into Fountaingrove Lodge in Santa Rosa, a retirement community being built primarily for gay men and lesbians.
The next phase of construction on the $50 million, 10-acre project starts this spring, and up to 140 residents are expected to move into 70 apartments and bungalows next year. Because of its combination of independent living and continuing care, including assistance for those with failing memories, it is being promoted as the first of its kind in the nation for gay men and lesbians.
The project is a sign of the graying of gay America; the first generations to live openly as homosexuals are now older. But gay rights advocates say the project is also a response to a troubling situation: the elderly gay population has struggled to secure stable housing.
Communities like Fountaingrove are sorely needed, according to Services and Advocacy for G.L.B.T Elders, a group based in New York known as SAGE.
''L.G.B.T. elders often face discrimination when buying or renting a home and may be denied housing, including residency in mainstream retirement communities,'' the group said in a November 2011 report.
A spokeswoman for SAGE pointed to several studies that have shown that elderly gays, lesbians and transgendered people are routinely denied housing and treated differently when applying -- many even pose as heterosexual to lease or buy. It is common for same-sex couples to be separated when admitted to care facilities, as if they are not related.
It is an issue that has caused public outcry in Sonoma County. In June 2008, after allegations of domestic violence that ultimately were unproved, Clay Greene and Harold Scull, partners for 25 years, were removed from their Sebastopol home, placed in separate care facilities and never allowed to see each other again. Their belongings were confiscated and sold by county workers.
Mr. Scull died, and gay rights advocates sued on behalf of Mr. Greene, who was left impoverished and emotionally scarred by the ordeal.
The county denied discriminating against the men, but in 2010, facing a trial and public scorn, settled the matter for $600,000.
Senator Mark Leno, who is gay and represents the area, said cases of discrimination were common nationwide.
Older gay men and lesbians ''have lived a lifetime of inequality in America under the law,'' Mr. Leno said.
Bill and Cindy Gallaher, Fountaingrove's developers, said area gay rights advocates came to them several years ago to suggest a specialized complex. Although the Gallahers are straight, the idea resonated with them for personal as well as economic reasons. Three of their five children were adopted from foreign countries.
''We are really sensitive to the fact that people outside of the mainstream have a very different experience,'' Ms. Gallaher said.
The land was bought in 2005, but there was opposition. Local news accounts reported homophobic resistance based on the comments of a few residents, although city officials said the objections were mainly a result of the project's scope.
''The environmental impact report took two and a half years,'' Mr. Gallaher said. After changes were made, to blend better with the rural setting, construction was approved.
Other gay retirement communities -- there are about a dozen nationwide, according to SAGE -- have faced difficulties. Highly publicized projects like RainbowVision in New Mexico have gone bankrupt during the recession, with critics pointing out that some communities were driven more by activism than sound economics.
Fountaingrove hopes to fare better. The Gallahers have a strong track record in the retirement industry, having built more than 30 communities for the elderly since 1986. Also, this development caters to an upscale crowd, making it particularly well financed. Initial fees to acquire homes run from $295,500 to $925,500, refundable upon leaving, and monthly charges are as high as $7,000 for a couple, covering meals and other services.
Indeed, the completed model home is reminiscent of a lavish hotel suite, with high ceilings, stainless-steel gourmet kitchens and extra-wide doorways to accommodate wheelchairs.
This opulent style, and its location on bucolic former farmland, attracted Martin Devlin, 69, a retired business owner, to reserve a home here. ''I'm gay, but that's not the only reason I find this appealing,'' he said. ''I love the feeling of nature. I love the property.''

HEADLINE: A Fraud Undetected, But Easy To Spot

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Without a rule of law, investing is an extraordinarily hazardous undertaking.
The latest charges of fraud in a Chinese company traded in the United States were filed this week by the Securities and Exchange Commission against two former executives of a Chinese coal company who the commission says stole and sold the company's assets before they raised more than $100 million from public investors in the United States.
In some ways, the theft was not the most audacious part of the strange case of Puda Coal, which traded on the NYSE Amex stock exchange in New York. The attempted cover-up, involving a forged letter from a Chinese state-owned entity and a fake takeover offer, were even more brazen.
But what is most amazing is how easy it turned out to be to discover the fraud. It was basically spelled out in documents that were publicly available in China months before American and Canadian investment banks, advised by major law firms, raised the money from investors. But it appears no one bothered to look -- not the underwriters and not the auditors. 
''They charge a lot for due diligence,'' says the man who uncovered the fraud, Dan David, a 43-year-old money manager from Skippack, Pa. ''But they don't do it.''
At the same time Americans were investing money in the company, Citic Trust, a Chinese state-owned company, was selling investments in the same asset to Chinese investors, saying -- evidently correctly -- that it controlled the asset.
What the documents showed was laid out this week by the S.E.C. as it filed charges of civil fraud against Ming Zhao, Puda's chairman, and Liping Zhu, the company's former chief executive. Puda's principal asset was a coal mining company, Shanxi Puda Coal. But in 2009, the chairman transferred that interest from Puda to himself. The next year, he sold a controlling interest in it to Citic.
Puda, which had gone public in the United States through a merger with a shell company in 2005, did not disclose those crucial facts when, in February 2010, it raised $12.8 million selling stock to American investors, in an offering underwritten by Brean Murray, Carret & Company of New York and Newbridge Securities of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. In December 2010 , a $100 million share sale was underwritten by Macquarie Capital, a Canadian firm, and Brean Murray. Investors in that offering paid $12 a share for stock that now trades for about 25 cents.
All told, the underwriters collected fees of $6.5 million, but they seem not to have acquired the documents that Mr. David said cost him $500. A spokeswoman for Macquarie declined this week to comment, and officials of the other firms did not respond to inquiries.
The fraud blew up last spring. On Friday, April 8, Mr. David posted his analysis on his Web site, GeoInvesting, and a similar analysis was posted on the Web site of Alfred Little, a firm that had a reputation for spotting Chinese frauds. That analysis was unsigned, but it was written by Andrew Wong, the head of the IFRA Group, a Hong Kong research firm.
''In contrast to most of the other Chinese frauds, where the business was not real, this was a profitable company that the chairman just stole,'' Mr. Wong said in an interview this week. He said he had looked into the company after Mr. David asked him to review his own research.
''Incredibly,'' Mr. Wong wrote in his report, ''Puda's auditor, Moore Stephens, failed to catch this theft of an entire company that is clearly documented in government ownership filings that any lawyer can obtain directly from the source.''
The stock plunged to $6 by the time the New York Stock Exchange suspended its trading on the following Monday. It would not trade again until it traded over the counter for two days in August, after it was delisted from the N.Y.S.E. The S.E.C. suspended it again. It trades now on the over-the-counter market.
The company's audit committee investigated the allegations, and eventually concluded they were accurate. But there was excitement along the way. In April, Mr. Zhao produced a letter, ostensibly from Citic, saying that it had not purchased the company, and sought to reassure investors by saying he was considering taking the company private at $12 a share. Eventually, Citic said the letter was false, and the company said Mr. Zhao had admitted forging it.
In July, Moore Stephens quit as the company's auditor and said its previous audits could not be relied on. It did not respond to requests for comment for this column.
In most Chinese fraud cases, the allegations are made by short-sellers, who have bet that the stock will decline. Mr. David, however, is a manager who owned Chinese companies and believed in them. He set out to prove the shorts were wrong.
''We hired our own Chinese team to discredit the short-sellers, because I did not believe what they were saying,'' Mr. David told me. ''What came back to me was that the short-sellers were right.'' He asked the investigators to look at companies in which he had invested or was considering buying. Puda was one of the latter.
The readily available documents were filed with China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce, known as S.A.I.C., showing transactions affecting the filing companies. Chinese companies must publish lists of all their subsidiaries, and it is necessary to check filings by all the subsidiaries. The forms are in Chinese, of course, but for the money that investment banks charge, you would think they could afford a few translators.
The two men charged by the S.E.C. are evidently in China and have no intention of coming to the United States to face the allegations. There is probably nothing the commission can do.
The Chinese authorities appear thus far to have shown no interest in bringing charges against the men named by the S.E.C., but that does not mean the government has ignored what is happening.
Mr. David said the Chinese government was restricting access to some S.A.I.C. filings and asking why people were interested in a certain company. He said the government was telling companies who was asking questions, a fact that has scared some investigators, who fear reprisals.
A basic requirement of investment markets is for investors to have a reasonable confidence that they are not being defrauded, and -- if it turns out they are -- that the government will seek to punish those responsible. Those who invest in Chinese companies today have reason to worry.
You might be surprised to learn that you are one of those people. I know I was. Through an employee plan, I own shares in a number of Vanguard mutual funds. It turns out that Vanguard bought more than a half-million shares in Puda, some of them for a fund in which I have an investment. Vanguard sold those shares after the scandal broke, no doubt at a loss.

HEADLINE: Bank Of America Breaks With Fannie Mae

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Bank of America said Thursday that it would no longer sell new mortgages to Fannie Mae, underscoring tensions in a fight between giants of the home loan market over billions in losses in the housing bubble.
The latest move represents a major escalation in a protracted legal battle over how many defaulted mortgages Bank of America will have to buy back from Fannie because the original loans had not conformed to proper underwriting standards, market experts said.
''In mortgage circles, it's pretty big,'' said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication. ''It would be fairly extreme for a small or midsized lender to do this, but for a major lender, it's very extreme.'' 
As one of the large government-sponsored mortgage finance enterprises, Fannie Mae takes mortgage loans from banks and packages them into securities that can be sold to investors or held on their own balance sheet. Fannie Mae backs about 40 percent of all mortgages in the United States.
Bank of America was Fannie's third-largest provider last year, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. The bank originated $156.1 billion in mortgages last year, of which $37.7 billion were sold to Fannie, the trade publication said.
Bank of America insisted its customers would not be hurt by the decision, and said it can make up for the loss of Fannie as a backer by turning to Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, other government-sponsored mortgage buyers; the private sector; and by deploying its huge balance sheet.
''This decision will not affect the credit available to our customers, and we will rely on other sources of liquidity to continue to ensure we are lending to our customers and supporting the housing market recovery,'' said Lawrence Di Rita, a spokesman for Bank of America. He added that the bank would continue to participate in assisting homeowners, including through the federal government's loan modification program.
Bank of America agreed in January 2011 to buy back $2.5 billion in soured mortgages from Fannie and Freddie, but that deal left the door open to future claims from Fannie. Bank of America also reached an $8.5 billion deal with private investors to cover repurchase claims last June, but that accord is the subject of another legal fight.
Bank of America does not break out how much it has faced in claims from each company, but it has recorded losses on $9.2 billion worth of loans made from 2004 to 2008 that were later acquired by Fannie and Freddie.
Mr. Cecala said that while consumers should not feel the effects of the move in terms of access to credit, the absence of Fannie Mae as a backer could make Bank of America's mortgage terms and rates less competitive in the future. A spokesman for Fannie Mae declined to comment.
Bank of America revealed the decision in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. The direct cause was the dispute over the repurchases, but it comes as Bank of America is reducing its overall size and streamlining its business, and shrinking its mortgage business in particular.
Meanwhile, Fannie and Freddie face questions over what role they will play in the housing market, as policy makers in Washington prepare to overhaul the government's relationship with the mortgage industry.
Bank of America ranked as the nation's second-largest originator of home loans for all of 2011, with an 11.6 percent market share, but by the fourth quarter it had slipped into fourth place behind Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Wells, in particular, has been an aggressive competitor, picking up much of the slack in the market and now accounting for one out of every four mortgage originations.
Bank of America, once the nation's largest bank by assets, has been steadily shrinking its balance sheet, and now ranks second to JPMorgan Chase. Many of its problems stem from the disastrous 2008 decision to buy Countrywide Financial, a subprime mortgage lender that caused Bank of America to record more than $30 billion in losses.
Investors are concerned that Fannie and Freddie, along with private investors, will force Bank of America and other giant mortgage lenders to repurchase tens of billions in mortgages that later defaulted, arguing they were not made with adequate documentation or proof of income, or otherwise failed to conform to proper underwriting standards.
Bank of America and its competitors have argued that many homeowners defaulted because of unemployment, the weak economy and other factors, not errors in the origination process.
Still, repurchase fears weighed on Bank of America shares in particular last year, and at one point Bank of America's stock fell below $5 a share. Its shares closed at $8.02 on Thursday, up 7 cents.

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley Neighbors, Facing Vastly Different Tax Rates

BYLINE: By AARON GLANTZ. 
aglantz@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Some of the most valuable commercial real estate in Silicon Valley is just off the Amphitheater Parkway exit of Highway 101 in Mountain View, including Google's sprawling campus and a suburban business park that is home to Intuit, the software company known for QuickBooks and TurboTax.
But even though one 12.5-acre piece of Google's property was assessed last year for $65.5 million, much of the neighboring land is still taxed on values virtually unchanged from what they were three decades ago, when a nearby golf course and Shoreline Amphitheater had yet to be built and the area still served as San Francisco's garbage dump.
While that portion of Google's land is taxed at a rate of approximately 35 cents per square foot, the land under Intuit's corporate campus, which is just around the corner, has an estimated property tax burden of 3 cents per square foot. Meantime, tax rates on land under recently purchased neighboring single-family homes ranged from $1 to $1.25 per square foot, according to a Bay Citizen examination of assessments on 2010 home sales in Mountain View. 
This is because in 1978 California voters passed Proposition 13, a ballot initiative that allows state and county government to increase the tax rate on commercial and residential properties based on the value of new buildings constructed, but forbids government to reassess a property's underlying land to full market value without a change of ownership.
''You could not devise a more unfair property tax system if you tried,'' said Larry Stone, the Santa Clara County assessor.
The result is that in a time of deep cuts to education, health care and other state services, valuations on commercial property are inconsistent and sometimes strikingly low.
For example, according to county records, the assessed value of one 13.7-acre tract underlying part of Google's headquarters is $789,635, producing an estimated tax rate of 1.3 cents a square foot, far less than most neighboring properties.
In interviews, commercial real estate experts said that both Google and the property's owner, Richard Peery, a septuagenarian Palo Alto real estate developer and billionaire, were saving hundreds of thousands of dollars. Commercial landowners often pass the cost of property tax on to their tenants.
''It's a huge boon to both of them,'' said Philip A. Mahoney, executive vice president of the firm Cornish & Carey Commercial Newmark Knight Frank.
Mr. Mahoney estimated the value of ''just the dirt under the buildings'' of the Google parcel at $41 million, meaning a savings of about $400,000 in unbilled property taxes every year.
The land, which Mr. Peery has owned for decades, has not been assessed at full market value since Proposition 13 passed 34 years ago, said David Ginsborg, a spokesman for Mr. Stone. The Peery family paid about $460,000 in property tax on the parcel last year, reflecting primarily the value of the buildings, which were assessed at $38 million.
County records show that Mr. Peery transferred ownership of the land to a family trust in 1978 and then entered into a 100-year ground lease with a company called Charleston Properties. Over the years, Charleston Properties has subleased the land to a series of technology companies, including Sun Microsystems and, most recently, Google.
This complicated legal arrangement will enable the property to avoid a fully valued property tax assessment until 2043, Mr. Ginsborg said, under the terms of state legislation that prohibits land values from being reassessed if a property is covered by a lease that runs at least 35 additional years.
By then, Mr. Peery, whose fortune is estimated by Forbes to be $1.9 billion, would be more than 100 years old. Multiple messages left at Mr. Peery's firm, Peery-Arrillaga, went unanswered. A spokesman for Google declined to comment for this article.
''What you're looking at is a total windfall to landowners without any benefit to anybody,'' said Lenny Goldberg, executive director of the California Tax Reform Association, a nonprofit advocacy group that has been studying commercial property tax assessments in Silicon Valley.
Mr. Peery's land is just one of many valuable Silicon Valley properties where land is assessed at a fraction of market value for tax purposes.
For example, a 38-acre tract that includes the Santa Clara headquarters of Intel is assessed at $7.5 million, producing an estimated tax rate of 5 cents a square foot, while 70 acres occupied by Hewlett-Packard at the Stanford Research Park in Palo Alto are assessed at $53.4 million, producing an estimated tax rate of 15 cents a square foot.
In South San Jose, a tract of more than 200 acres owned for decades by I.B.M. is assessed at $4 million, or less than half a cent a square foot.
In contrast, the land under the buildings recently bought by Apple in Cupertino and Yahoo in Santa Clara has been assessed at levels that produce a tax rate of more than $1 a square foot. Neither Apple nor Yahoo responded to requests for comment.
In interviews, representatives of the technology companies with low property tax rates said they saw no problem with the rates.
''Stability is always good no matter who you are,'' said Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Intel. ''Ownership will change and property assessments will change over time,'' he said.
Tiffany Griego, a director at the Stanford Research Park, which houses Hewlett-Packard, said, ''To the extent that companies can manage their property taxes to be predictable, it helps them justify them continuing to locate in high-rent districts.''
But some public-interest groups said such stability came at a cost, especially during lean budget years. Last year, California lawmakers closed a $26.6 billion budget deficit entirely with spending cuts. This year, the state faces an additional $9.2 billion shortfall, which Gov. Jerry Brown has proposed closing with more cuts combined with a sales tax increase and income tax increases on people making more than $250,000 a year.
The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office reported last month that bringing commercial property assessments up to market rates would raise about $4.5 billion for state and local governments, including $2 billion for public education.
''We have to say either we are going to dramatically cut back services that we have become accustomed to, to the level that will be sustainable, or we are going to have to rethink our whole system,'' said Emmett Carson, the chief executive of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which along with another nonprofit group, Joint Venture Silicon Valley, released a report this month calling for major revisions to Proposition 13.
But polls have consistently shown Proposition 13 remains popular. Last September the nonpartisan Field Poll found that 63 percent of registered voters said they would vote for it if it were on the ballot today, while 41 percent said they thought it should be changed to allow business and commercial property owners to be taxed at a higher rate than owners of residential property.
''When the economy is in the doldrums, the public is really not that supportive of socking it to business,'' said Mark DiCamillo, the poll's director.
Mr. Carson said he understood that support for the initiative remained strong. ''We have to at least start the discussion,'' he added, ''because the system now is not working.''

HEADLINE: America Is Europe

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
We Americans cherish our myths. One myth is that there is more social mobility in the United States than in Europe. That's false. Another myth is that the government is smaller here than in Europe. That's largely false, too.
The U.S. does not have a significantly smaller welfare state than the European nations. We're just better at hiding it. The Europeans provide welfare provisions through direct government payments. We do it through the back door via tax breaks. 
For example, in Europe, governments offer health care directly. In the U.S., we give employers a gigantic tax exemption to do the same thing. European governments offer public childcare. In the U.S., we have child tax credits. In Europe, governments subsidize favored industries. We do the same thing by providing special tax deductions and exemptions for everybody from ethanol producers to Nascar track owners.
These tax expenditures are hidden but huge. Budget experts Donald Marron and Eric Toder added up all the spending-like tax preferences and found that, in 2007, they amounted to $600 billion. If you had included those preferences as government spending, then the federal government would have actually been one-fifth larger than it appeared.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recently calculated how much each affluent country spends on social programs. When you include both direct spending and tax expenditures, the U.S. has one of the biggest welfare states in the world. We rank behind Sweden and ahead of Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland and Canada. Social spending in the U.S. is far above the organization's average.
You might say that a tax break isn't the same as a spending program. You would be wrong.
David Bradford, a Princeton economist, has the best illustration of how the system works. Suppose the Pentagon wanted to buy a new fighter plane. But instead of writing a $10 billion check to the manufacturer, the government just issued a $10 billion ''weapons supply tax credit.'' The plane would still get made. The company would get its money through the tax credit. And politicians would get to brag that they had cut taxes and reduced the size of government!
This is essentially what's been happening in sphere after sphere. Government controls more and more of the economy. It just does it by getting people to do what it wants by manipulating the tax code. Politicians get to take credit for addressing problem after problem, but none of their efforts show up as unpopular spending.
Many of these individual tax expenditures are good for the country, like the charitable deduction and the earned income tax credit. But, as the economist Bruce Bartlett demonstrates in his impeccably fair-minded book, ''The Benefit and the Burden,'' the cumulative effect of these tax breaks is terrible. Like overgrown weeds, the tangle of tax breaks distorts behavior, clogs the economy and deprives the government of revenue.
And because they are hidden, many of the tax expenditures go to those who need them least, the well connected and established over the vulnerable and the entrepreneurial.
The good news is that change might finally be coming. The Obama administration has always theoretically supported a simpler tax code even while operationally it has often muddied it up. Nonetheless, this week, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner unveiled a modest but sensible plan to simplify the corporate tax code. The plan is not perfect. The Obama technocrats love tinkering and complexity. But Geithner's plan moves us a small step in the right direction and provides a sensible foundation for the big tax negotiations to come.
Mitt Romney has a bigger proposal, which reduces individual rates across the board and closes some loopholes. It's more comprehensive than the Geithner approach, but it suffers from two weaknesses. First, it's politics as usual. Romney is specific about the candy -- lower tax rates -- but vague about the vegetables -- what loopholes would have to be closed to pay for them.
Moreover, it's unimaginative. Republicans are perpetually trying to do what Ronald Reagan did. But top tax rates today aren't as onerous as they were in 1980, so lowering them won't produce as many benefits. Imagine if Reagan ran for office promising to recreate the glory days of Thomas Dewey and you get a sense of how much G.O.P. thinking is stuck in the past.
Still, let's take our good news where we can get it. Attention is shifting to tax expenditures and not just direct spending. It's becoming clear how gargantuan, opaque and inefficient the U.S. government has become. Maybe before long our political leaders will actually summon the political will to take on the special interests that defend these tax breaks.
This should be the top priority: A tax reform effort that simplifies government frees the economy and focuses social support on those who actually need it. A left-right tax reform alliance to do that would break the political logjam as well as the economic one.

HEADLINE: Taxing Medical Marijuana

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Struggling Cities Turn to a Crop for Cash'' (news article, Feb. 12) doesn't mention a major issue of concern that has to be considered before claims of attractive financial benefits from taxing medical marijuana can be made. 
In the states mentioned -- California, Colorado, Maine and Oregon -- 3.2 million people are not receiving the treatment services they need for drug abuse and dependence. California alone accounts for 2.3 million people with untreated substance abuse disorders.
Before hard-pressed municipalities, in these and other states around the country, look at medical marijuana as a new source of tax revenue to finance essential services, taxpayers should be given the opportunity to consider allocating some of this money to under-supported treatment and prevention programs.
This will not mitigate the effects of untreated substance abuse, but it will help send a clear message to young people that marijuana, prescribed or not, has addictive potential that too often requires intensive treatment.
PETER PROVET President and Chief Executive Odyssey House New York, Feb. 13, 2012
To the Editor:
California cities' meager tax payments are a tiny fraction of the costs of their misguided ''medical marijuana'' initiatives.
The taxes imposed on medical marijuana place it in a category with alcohol and tobacco, two legal drugs that demonstrate the same appalling disparity between tax revenues and societal costs. The state and federal alcohol revenue of $14 billion and the $25 billion collected in tobacco taxes in the United States are overshadowed by the $235 billion and $200 billion in social costs they produce, respectively.
Among all Americans 12 and older who abuse or are dependent on an illegal drug, 60 percent abuse or are dependent on marijuana. Nationally, admissions for primary marijuana use to state-financed treatment have increased by 31 percent from 1998 to 2008 (the most recent year for which data are available).
California and other states that have legalized medical marijuana face the disturbing reality of the drug's true costs in long-term health care, increased treatment admissions, loss of productivity at work and at school, and increased risk of motor vehicle crashes.
In addition to the disproportion of small tax revenue compared with large societal costs, medical marijuana sharply increases marijuana use and dependency. With 60 percent more cancer-causing chemicals than cigarettes and four times more tar, making marijuana more available is bad economic policy and bad health care policy.
PETER B. BENSINGER ROBERT L. DuPONT Chicago, Feb. 14, 2012
The writers are, respectively, former administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, 1976-81; and a psychiatrist and founding director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 1973-78.

HEADLINE: Good Vibrations for All; Clothing Is Optional

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
Poking fun at the beard-wearing, meat-abstaining neo-hippie hordes is, as the director David Wain shows in his mostly funny comedy ''Wanderlust,'' about as hard as shooting tofu in a barrel. Actually, that seems a bit tricky, which may be why for every few jokes that hit in this story about a recession-battered New York couple finding themselves on a Georgia commune, one sputters and dies. There are, after all, only so many laughs to be had from the image of the naked actor Joe Lo Truglio letting his prosthesis hang, and sometimes flop, out.
A deadpan Mr. Lo Truglio, otherwise wearing only fur, glasses, boots and an occasional sanitary satchel (think of it as a hairnet, worn lower), plays Wayne Davidson, a writer and winemaker who belongs to an ''intentional community'' called Elysium. Tucked off a rural road, Elysium was established decades earlier (Alan Alda wheelchairs in and out as one of the founders) and now is home to a group of men, women and children, many strumming guitars constantly. There's a teepee in front, along with a kaleidoscopic bus evoking the one Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters took across the country back in the flower-power day. 
One night, when the road-weary Linda (a fine Jennifer Aniston) and George (a better Paul Rudd) stumble on Elysium, they think that they're tucking into another bed-and-breakfast. They go to sleep in 2012 or thereabouts only to wake in an idyll that time and information technology forgot -- or so Mr. Wain and his co-writer, Ken Marino, insist, as they wring as many jokes as possible out of the idea that organically grown blackberries and Blackberries are mutually exclusive. Good vibrations and sunlight fill the air, and everyone wears a smile, especially while wreathed in smoke. Initially leery, Linda and George soon succumb to the commune's charms and, after an alienating detour at his brother's McMansion, decide to go back to nature, Elysium-style.
As in Mr. Wain's 2001 cult favorite ''Wet Hot American Summer,'' about kids and counselors at a 1980s camp, ''Wanderlust'' hinges on the dynamics of a group effectively isolated in a country setting. The commune dwellers are willingly secluded, having dropped out from the mainstream to follow their bliss or some such. Part of what gives this movie unexpected resonance is that Linda and George have joined only somewhat voluntarily. Back in New York, where she was a would-be documentary filmmaker and he did something that required wearing a suit, they struggled, living in an apartment (a ''microloft'') as big as a coffin and in which they're nearly buried when he loses his job, the real-estate market tanks and they end up broke.
The movie's opening stretch, which breezily tracks Linda and George's fall from Manhattan grace -- from her comically bad pitch meeting at HBO to their packing up and hitting the road -- is a pocketsize cautionary tale. Working with the editors David Moritz and Robert Nassau, Mr. Wain gives this passage the kind of snap that brings to mind screwball films of the Depression era. The Great Recession, it's evident, has started to inspire its own comedies, so it's too bad that Linda and George arrive at Elysium as quickly as they do. For all the raillery Mr. Wain and Mr. Marino squeeze out of the commune and its members, including Justin Theroux as Seth, a touchy-feely-creepy Lothario, there's something super-straight, at times even fusty, about how they see this world.
Linda and George don't burn with the yearning to travel that the title suggests, yet like other Americans seeking simplicity and maybe a chicken coop out back, they want off the road, at least for a while. There's something touching about this desire, though Mr. Wain doesn't let Linda and George fly their freak flags for long. This seems less of a fear of a vegan planet and more a question of boys being boys.
When it comes down to it, the filmmakers prefer penis jokes and, with Mr. Lo Truglio and Mr. Rudd's help, they provide plenty. Ms. Aniston and the other women (including Michalea Watkins as a desperate housewife) try to keep up, but ''Bridesmaids'' notwithstanding, the women's liberation movement in comedy has yet to arrive on the big screen.
''Wanderlust'' is rated R. (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) Male nudity, expletives and hallucinogens.

Museums
- American Folk Art Museum: 'Jubilation Rumination: Life, Real and Imagined' (through Sept. 2) Having escaped the ugly, West 53rd Street tomb of a building it inhabited from 2001 to 2011, the American Folk Art Museum has reoccupied its old space on Lincoln Square. This wonderful show of about 100 works from the permanent collection samples all the varieties of artistic expression under the museum's purview, from portraits and quilts by anonymous craftspeople to otherworldly fantasies envisioned by so-called Outsiders like Henry Darger and Martin Ramirez. The revival of this irreplaceable institution is cause of rejoicing. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue, at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
Asia Society and Museum: 'Sarah Sze: Infinite Line' (through March 25) Promising a new angle on Sarah Sze's mesmerizing, minutely detailed installations, this midcareer solo reveals that Ms. Sze, who is Chinese-American, has been profoundly influenced by many forms of Asian art. It also includes some of her rarely exhibited drawings and encourages you to see her three-dimensional artworks as drawings in space. Implicitly, it de-emphasizes the prosaic nature of her art materials: the cotton swabs, toothpicks, bottle caps and other throwaway objects that she fashions, with gee-whiz structural ingenuity, into rambling landscapes and galactic spirals. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
- The Cloisters: 'The Game of Kings: Medieval Ivory Chessmen From the Isle of Lewis' (through April 22) In 1831, a farmer on the Isle of Lewis, the largest island of the Outer Hebrides, discovered a lost cache of medieval chess pieces. Today, thanks to ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' in which Harry and Ron play with magically animated replicas of them, the Lewis Chessmen are world famous. On tour from the British Museum, these adorable, bug-eyed little kings, queens, bishops, knights and warders, each beautifully carved from walrus ivory, are wonderful to examine up close. You don't have to be a chess player or a Harry Potter fan to love them. 99 Margaret Corbin Drive, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 923-3700, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Frick Collection: 'Renoir, Impressionism and Full-Length Painting' (through May 13) Impressionism, like fashion, is dedicated to the fleeting sensation: this moment's light, this season's dress. Yet the works in this exhibition, which transforms the Frick's mohair-upholstered East Gallery into a runway for Renoir's soigne Parisians, don't at first register as Impressionist. With their traditional portrait format and imposing scale, they seem at odds with the modest plein-air paintings that define the movement. Central among them is the Frick's own Renoir, ''La Promenade'' (1875-6), in which a stylish young woman guides two equally well-dressed little girls along a public garden path. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
Frick Collection: 'White Gold: Highlights From the Arnhold Collection of Meissen Porcelain' (through April 29) Porcelain lovers will not want to miss this show of domestic ware made in Germany in the early 1700s, but the big news is the new wing, the Portico Gallery, that it inaugurates. The Frick has transformed an outdoor colonnade into an indoor exhibition space. Floor to ceiling windows enclose a long, narrow space that feels bigger and airier than its actual 850 square feet. In the small rotunda at one end, a life-size, nude Diana by Jean-Antoine Houdon looks out over the traffic on Fifth Avenue with divine indifference. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)
International Center of Photography: 'The Loving Story: Photographs by Grey Villet' (through May 6) Richard and Mildred Loving, an interracial couple from Virginia whose marriage prompted a benchmark 1967 Supreme Court ruling overturning state miscegenation laws, are portrayed not as political activists, but as political heroes who fell into history by accident. The story began on July 11, 1958, when a Virginia county sheriff and two deputies entered the Lovings' bedroom at 2 a.m. and arrested them, saying they had violated the Racial Integrity Act. Mr. Villet's images represent the heyday of social documentary, but also the midcentury photo-essay format. Ms. Loving later became a conscious activist when, on the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling, she made a statement supporting the right to marry, whether ''black or white, young or old, gay or straight.'' 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Martha Schwendener)
- International Center of Photography: 'Weegee: Murder Is My Business' (through Sept. 2) From the home of Weegee's voluminous archive, the latest exhibition about this great documentary photographer (1899-1968) revisits his frenetic, formative first decade of work, starting in 1935, when his often sensational images of murder and mayhem appeared in the New York daily newspapers. His penchant for self-promotion; the work of his competitors and peers; the evolution of tabloid journalism; and the great city that was both his subject and his audience are emphasized, with fresh curatorial precision and deftly used touch screens. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Roberta Smith)
- Jewish Museum: 'The Radical Camera: New York's Photo League, 1936-1951' (through March 25) One of many artistic casualties of the McCarthy-era blacklists was the Photo League, a New York school and salon for amateur and professional photographers. Its members -- among them Weegee, Lisette Model and Aaron Siskind -- are now reunited in this stirring show, which traces the group's history through some 145 vintage photographs. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Art in an Age of Revolution: Fu Baoshi (1904-1965)' (through April 15) Serene on the surface but less so underneath, the museum's first full-dress retrospective of a 20th-century Chinese painter is as much about history as art history. It focuses on an artist, teacher and art historian who helped preserve the ancient tradition of ink painting and then struggled to make it relevant under the Communists, bending it toward propaganda, introducing a new degree of realism and making frequent use of the color red. While fascinating, the show leaves you wondering what he might have accomplished under less encumbered circumstances. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Infinite Jest: Caricature and Satire From Leonardo to Levine' (through March 4) It is not nice to make fun of other people, but it is hard to resist. This fascinating and often amusing show presents about 160 drawings and prints from six centuries in which men and women appear ugly, weird, venal and foolish. The show shies away from troublemaking work by contemporary artists, but examples of exceptional draftsmanship and satiric imagination from the past abound. Watercolors by the great British cartoonists James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson alone make a visit rewarding. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Renaissance Portrait From Donatello to Bellini' (through March 18) This magisterial, intensely thought-provoking show presents about 160 works by the most celebrated masters of 15th-century Italian painting and sculpture. It was a time when ancient Greek and Roman precedents inspired artists to create extraordinarily lively images of people in two and three dimensions. The dialogue between painting and sculpture is especially intriguing. Desiderio da Settignano's marble bust of a lovely young woman with a strikingly expressive, coquettish expression creates an illusion of fleeting real life that painters could only envy. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Spies in the House of Art: Photography, Film, and Video' (through Aug. 26) This exhibition of 17 contemporary works inspired by museums doesn't mention Theodor Adorno by name, but it nods toward his ideas in a wall text, which jokes that artists often see museums as ''mausoleums, places where art goes to die.'' Andrea Fraser's video ''Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk'' (1989) leans toward the anti-museum view, while a 16mm film by Nashashibi/Skaer, the duo of British artists Rosalind Nashashibi and Lucy Skaer, made by gliding through the Met in the dark with a camera and a flash strobe, treats the museum like a darkened crypt. Lutz Bacher's video offers another museum tour, while the museum appears in poetically distorted form in photographs by John Pilson, Tim Davis and Lothar Baumgarten. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Storytelling in Japanese Art' (through May 6) An uncannily contemporary sense of fluidity, action and emotion courses throughout this captivating exhibition, which traces the Japanese penchant for narrative through hand scrolls, hanging scrolls and books, on to the expanded field of folding screens. The sublime 13th-century ''Illustrated Legends of the Kitano Tenjin Shrine'' alone is a must-see: its five hand scrolls constitute one of the Met's greatest paintings and have never before been shown together. Return visits are merited. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- MoMA PS1: 'Henry Taylor' (through April 9) Mr. Taylor, who lives in Los Angeles, paints fast, loose and sensuously on canvases great and small. Portraiture is his work's center of gravity, African-American life his subject. With exuberant generosity, he portrays friends, relatives, acquaintances from the art world and off the street and heroes of sports and politics. Along the way, he takes in downbeat cityscapes patrolled by cop cars and envisions allegories of spiritual trauma in the Land of the Free. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'Rembrandt's World: Dutch Drawings From the Clement C. Moore Collection' (through April 29) You won't see much of Rembrandt in this exhibition of about 90 works on paper, which includes just four drawings attributed to that master. What the show lacks in star power, though, it makes up for with a keen, all-encompassing look at life in the Dutch Republic during its Golden Age (which corresponds, roughly, to the 17th century). Seascapes assert naval dominance; genre scenes show bustling markets and tipsy taverngoers; botanical illustrations tell cautionary tales about economic speculation. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- El Museo del Barrio: 'Testimonios: 100 Years of Popular Expression' (through May 6) The city's premier museum of Latin culture explores its holdings in urban folk art, so-called handicraft and other forms of vernacular expression and comes up with visual gold. Among the kaleidoscopic displays are Puerto Rican santos and the winsome cellophane animals, birds and insects of Gregorio Marzan (1906-97). Splendid textiles include Haitian voodoo banners; densely appliqued molas and the patchwork scenes called arpilleras, with which Chilean women kept hope alive for disappeared relatives during the regime of Augusto Pinochet. An intoxicating, if sometimes bittersweet, vitality is revealed. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Sanja Ivekovic: Sweet Violence' (through March 26) This timely and resonant survey familiarizes American audiences with the spare, selfless achievement of this pioneering Croatian artist, born in Zagreb in 1949. Conceptual in style, photo- and performance-based in approach, political in motivation, ardently and precisely feminist, her work makes use of materials at hand -- personal photographs, women's magazines, state-sponsored television, even government surveillance -- to dissect different forms of power and illuminate the plight of the powerless, while also presaging familiar developments in appropriation art and relational aesthetics to a startling degree. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Print/Out' and 'Printin'' ' (through May 14) ''Print/Out'' presents printed works by 40 artists and artist groups from the museum's permanent collection. Produced over the past two decades, most involve public modes of address borrowed from the worlds of advertizing and design and concepts promoting critical suspicion of mainstream media, culture and society. ''Printin','' a related print-focused exhibition, is full of surprises addressing multiple aspects of human experience. With fearless eclecticism, it ranges from a Krazy Kat cartoon by George Herriman to Puritan stocks cut from cardboard by Cady Noland. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Diego Rivera: Murals for the Museum of Modern Art' (through May 14) This show reunites five of the eight free-standing frescoes that Rivera made for a 1931-2 exhibition at MoMA. Some of these paintings seem ripped from current headlines. In ''The Uprising,'' protesting laborers are brutally suppressed by uniformed soldiers; the stratified New York cityscape of ''Frozen Assets'' tops a bank vault with a crowded homeless shelter. Timely as they are, they lack the multitudinous energy and narrative sweep of Rivera's permanently sited murals. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of the City of New York: 'Cecil Beaton: The New York Years' (through April 22) A British dandy in the Wildean mold, Beaton photographed fashion for Vogue and Vanity Fair; made photographic portraits of rich, famous and glamorous people; drew and painted cartoons, caricatures, fashion illustrations and theatrical sets with a deft hand; published six volumes of his diaries; and won two Oscars for his costume and set designs, for the Hollywood movies ''Gigi'' and ''My Fair Lady.'' He spent much time in New York, and this entertaining exhibition surveys what he did here during his five-decade career. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Johnson)
Neue Galerie: 'The Ronald S. Lauder Collection: Selections From the 3rd Century B.C. to the 20th Century/Germany, Austria and France' (through April 2) Since it opened 10 years ago, the Neue Galerie has stayed true to its narrowly focused mission: to showcase German and Austrian art and design of the early 20th century. But its anniversary exhibition of the collection of the co-founder Ronald S. Lauder covers much more territory. In the dark-wood-paneled gallery on the second floor, for instance, six paintings by Cezanne preside over an imposing installation of arms and armor and 15th- and 16th-century German and Netherlandish portraiture. And a third-floor gallery of Picasso, Matisse and Brancusi amounts to a mini-Museum of Modern Art improbably wedged into a Carrere-and-Hastings town house. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
New Museum: 'The Ungovernables: 2012 New Museum Triennial' (through April 22) The second edition of this survey of young talent, organized by Eungie Joo, is more international than the last one, with artists from Asia and South America and collectives from Africa and the Middle East. Much of the work is made up of small, light formal gestures, unemphatic in tone and socially engaged, though in an unperturbed way that accommodates friendliness and wit. There is also a schedule of performances on- and off-site. An Israeli collective, Public Movement, will stage topical debates around town. Yet another collective, House of Natural Fiber, from Indonesia, plans to demonstrate technology for producing alcoholic beverages and electronic music simultaneously. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
Noguchi Museum: 'Civic Action: A Vision for Long Island City' (through April 22) Several artists suggest their visions for the future of Long Island City, ranging from site-specific to silly. Natalie Jeremijenko's ''feral robots'' sniff out pollutants in contaminated soil, and she suggests hula hoops filled with wildflower seeds. Rirkrit Tiravanija proposes growing ''drivable'' grass along a section of Broadway, and Mary Miss focuses on four giant smokestacks that tower over the area and imagines them as an eco-feedback center registering environmental changes visible to the community. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Schwendener)
- Studio Museum in Harlem: 'The Bearden Project' (through March 11) Of the many New York City events celebrating the Romare Bearden centennial year, the Studio Museum has come up with the best in this sparkling cross-generational shout-out to the artist. In addition to a small handful of superb works by Bearden himself, the show is made up of tributes by a hundred contemporary artists, old and young, who together extend Bearden's cosmopolitan, griot-to-the-global-village spirit into the future. 144 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
Galleries: Uptown
'Hats: An Anthology by Stephen Jones' (through April 15) This wide-ranging survey was assembled by one of the leading milliners in Britain and draws heavily on the incomparable collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. It includes fascinating historical material; a survey of 20th- and 21st-century headgear at its most creative (and often most frivolous); and rather too many efforts by the show's organizer. But what's good is great: for example, a platterlike feather number from 18th-century London. Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
- Catherine Yass: 'Lighthouse' (through March 17) Five miles off the English coast rises from the sea the Royal Sovereign lighthouse. Its boxy white cabin seems precariously balanced on a single concrete pillar. The light tower tops out at 90 feet above sea level. This is the subject of ''Lighthouse,'' a spectacular, 12-minute movie by Ms. Yass, a British specialist in the sublime. We explore the edifice as if through a disembodied eye from near and far and above and below. It is a kinetically and poetically thrilling ride. Galerie Lelong, 528 West 26th Street, (212) 315-0470, galerielelong.com. (Johnson)
Galleries: Other
'Gran Fury: Ready My Lips' (through March 17) A collective that grew out of Act Up and took its name from a New York City police car, Gran Fury existed from the end of 1989 until the mid-'90s. The political climate of that period informs the show, as well as downtown Manhattan's landscape of graffiti, posters and stickers. ''Kissing Doesn't Kill'' (1990), a series of posters displayed on buses, defied contemporary claims that AIDS could be spread by kissing, while ''Read My Lips'' turned George H. W. Bush's famous campaign line into a homoerotic provocation. The haircuts and clothes in the works are dated, but the sentiments overlap powerfully with current activism and the Occupy movement. 80WSE, New York University, 80 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-5747, steinhardt.nyu.edu/80wse. (Schwendener)
'Soto: Paris and Beyond: 1950-1970' (through March 31) Once a figure of international renown, Jesus Soto is now mostly remembered as a minor Modernist who worked in the overlap among hard-edge abstraction, kinetic art and Op Art. This show will not precipitate a run to revive his reputation, but it does open an intriguing window on the mid-20th-century philosophical landscape of modern art. Still perceptually arresting are constructions from the '50s, in which you view abstract compositions through similarly painted plexiglass panels. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)
Out of Town
Neuberger Museum of Art: 'American Vanguards: Graham, Davis, Gorky, de Kooning, and Their Circle, 1927-1942' (through April 29) This exhibition, organized by the Addison Gallery of American Art in Andover, Mass., reunites the Four Musketeers of New York painting: John Graham, Arshile Gorky, Stuart Davis and Willem de Kooning. For a time -- the 1930s, give or take a few years -- these artists linked arms to defend modern American art against the dreariness and insularity of the Depression. One might see this show as an expansion of the first few galleries of the Museum of Modern Art's recent de Kooning retrospective, with their eerie still lifes and fidgety figure paintings that seemed to collapse abstraction and representation. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100, neuberger.org. (Rosenberg)
Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts: 'Henry Ossawa Tanner: Modern Spirit' (through April 15) Henry Ossawa Tanner (1859-1937) was the first African-American artist to achieve international fame in modern times. After permanently expatriating to France in 1891, he found success as a painter of luminous pictures of biblical subjects. In this informative survey of his career, one piece stands out: an Annunciation in which the angel Gabriel appears to Mary as a burst of yellow light. It is a painting of amazing grace. 118 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, (215) 972-7600, pafa.org. (Johnson)
- Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Zoe Strauss: Ten Years' (through April 22) In 2001 the artist Zoe Strauss came up with an unusual idea for an exhibition. It would take place under an elevated section of Interstate 95, in her home city, Philadelphia, and would consist of photographs mounted on the columns that supported the highway. It would be a recurring event, appearing yearly over a decade, and would be free and accessible to the public. That series, ''I-95,'' is at the core of ''Zoe Strauss: Ten Years,'' an engaging, parameter-expanding exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and on billboards around the city. In it, the highway links sweeping literary ambition and local interest, lyrical and documentary photography, portraiture and the urban landscape. Benjamin Franklin Parkway and 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Van Gogh Up Close' (through May 6) Nature both inspired van Gogh's extraordinary art and calmed his perpetually jangled nerves, and this modest yet groundbreaking show of 45 often small, unfamiliar canvases -- devoted almost entirely to landscapes -- examines his crucial connection to its bounty. The selection cuts a narrow, well-organized path through his art, examining the terrains he painted, the often close-up viewpoints he used and the shifting topographies of his paint textures, leading us to the fullness of his achievement along a fresh and eye-opening route. Benjamin Franklin Parkway and 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Smith)
Last Chance
Bryan Drury: 'Portraits' (closes on Saturday) Mr. Drury's six finely painted, intensely realistic panel paintings appear to be conventionally old-fashioned portraits of middle-aged rich folks. But the closer you look, the weirder they seem. There is a reptilian feeling about them. They might be extraterrestrial beings who have donned human disguises in their mission to take over Earth. Dean Project, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 229-2017, deanproject.com. (Johnson)
Rashid Johnson: 'Rumble' (closes on Saturday) As this putative star's career accelerates, his work becomes slicker and emptier, a pastiche of styles and strategies past and present. The main effect of pieces involving red-oak flooring branded with motifs resembling a rifle's cross hairs, or mosaic mirrors and bronze reliefs defaced with viscous spews of black, is of glamorous baubles with just the right amount of titillating shock value. Only the unsettling, subtly charged, ultimately poignant combination of swagger and self-mockery of the video ''The New Black Yoga'' feels genuine. Hauser & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 794-4970, hauserwirth.com. (Smith)
- 'Marble Sculpture From 350 B.C. to Last Week' and 'Portraits/Self-Portraits From the 16th to the 21st Century' (closes on Saturday) Filling nearly four floors of pristine gallery space, these two exhibitions romp in lively, even wicked ways through a succession of periods and styles, with continuity provided by what's called the ''ideal'' sculptural material in one case and the human visage in the other. The result is a deliciously nonacademic exercise in looking and a robust reminder that, wherever we may think we are in terms of art, the past is rarely far behind, nor irrelevant. Sperone Westwater, 257 Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 999-7337, speronewestwater.com. (Smith)
- Natasza Niedziolka: 'White Shadow' (closes on Saturday) In a New York solo debut that is just cause for optimism, this Polish-born, Berlin-based pictorial artist mixes together art and craft, folk traditions and early Modernism to devise spare, colorful still lifes that sometimes involve paint but more often make extensive use of knitting, embroidery, sewing machines and dangling thread. The history of painting and textiles entwine; a raw, witty beauty ensues, along with a sense of an artist proceeding by her own lights. Precedents include Hannah Hoch's angular collages, Anni Albers's textiles and Rosemarie Trockel's knit paintings. Horton Gallery, 504 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-2663, hortongallery.com. (Smith)
- Joyce Pensato: 'Batman Returns' (closes on Saturday In her latest show of perky cartoon characters gone over to the dark side, the painter Joyce Pensato embraces installation art with the deranged determination of a supervillain -- surrounding her canvases with heaps of plush toys and assorted props from the studio. Although the exhibition is titled ''Batman Returns,'' perhaps in homage to the 1992 Tim Burton film, Ms. Pensato's vision of the caped crusader is all her own. Her drippy enamel-on-linen paintings of the hero's mask strip away his trust fund and cave full of bat-gizmos, making him into a mythic, messy presence. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 537 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9467, petzel.com. (Rosenberg)
- Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook: 'Two Planets/Village and Elsewhere' (closes on Saturday) Ms. Rasdjarmrearnsook, who lives and works in Thailand, is best known for a series of serene works in which she reads, sings and lectures to cadavers on the subjects of life and death. The more recent videos in her New York solo debut are lighter in tone, as she invited villagers in northern Thailand to comment on famous European paintings. The audience comments -- on farming details in Millet's ''Gleaners'' and body types in Manet's ''Dejeuner sur L'Herbe'' -- are practical and hilariously critical in ways that art history could never be. Tyler Rollins Fine Art, 529 West 20th Street, 10th floor, Chelsea, (212) 229-9100, trfineart.com. (Cotter)
- Swiss Institute Contemporary Art: 'Jean-Frederic Schnyder' (closes on Sunday) The first New York show of this lapsed Swiss Conceptualist, who was born in 1945 and represented his country at the 1993 Venice Biennale, is a characteristic mix of benign and barbed, as well as of painting, sculpture and video. The 35 small, delectable paintings of ''Landscape'' bivouac at the border of art and kitsch, tackling themes of hearth and home, taste and cliche, while a video parade of bottles of schnapps implicates the tourist industry. It's deceptively tidy, deeply Swiss satire. 18 Wooster Street, near Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035, swissinstitute.net. (Smith)
- '20th Anniversary Exhibition' (closes on Saturday) Two decades ago, when Skoto Aghahowa and his wife, Alix du Serech, opened a storefront gallery in SoHo devoted mostly to contemporary art from Africa, their enterprise looked like a long shot. The gallery was way east on Prince Street. SoHo was itching for a mass move to Chelsea. Almost no one knew that Africa even had something called contemporary culture. But that long shot has held steady for two decades, And the gallery, now in Chelsea, is celebrating with a modest survey of some the wonderful artists it has brought us during those years.

Marianne Vitale (closes on Saturday) The performance-driven sculptures in Ms. Vitale's first solo at Feuer, rustic-looking wooden constructions that have been shot at or set on fire, suggest a strong presence in search of the right vehicle. (You may remember the blunt exhortations of Ms. Vitale's video manifesto, ''Patron,'' from the 2010 Whitney Biennial.) The centerpiece, ''Burned Bridge,'' turns a dead metaphor and a pile of reclaimed lumber into a haunted, commanding artwork.

Weegee: 'Naked City' / Vivian Maier (closes on Saturday) Two careers in street photography -- markedly different in sensibility and visibility -- are contrasted in side-by-side shows. The raw, exuberant tabloid art of the famous Weegee (1899-1968) is manifest in a display of 125 images from throughout his career. Meanwhile, the secretive, recently discovered photographer Vivian Maier (1926-2009) took pictures ceaselessly, pursuing a style as unobtrusive as Weegee's is loud and in your face, but no less assured.

- Doug Wheeler (closes on Saturday) Stepping through the fourth wall into Mr. Wheeler's luminous, futuristically titled installation ''SA MI 75 DZ NY 12'' (2012) is like entering a giant marshmallow. Because all surfaces are snowy white, corners seamlessly coved and the whole brightly lighted, it seems as if you are in a space of possibly infinite extent. It might be a preview of the universal divine light into which each of us will merge, according to some mystics, when we die.

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'THE BEARDEN PROJECT': (through March 11) Of the many events celebrating the Romare Bearden centennial, the Studio Museum has the best in this sparkling, cross-generational shout-out to the artist. In addition to a small handful of superb works by Bearden himself -- like ''Prelude to Farewell,'' 1981, above -- the show has tributes by a hundred contemporary artists, old and young, who together extend Bearden's cosmopolitan, griot-to-the-global-village spirit into the future. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org.

HEADLINE: Holder Defends Efforts to Combat Financial Fraud

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. defended the Justice Department's record on financial fraud Thursday evening, asserting that the administration's ''record of success has been nothing less than historic.''
In a speech at Columbia University, Mr. Holder said, ''From securities, bank and investment fraud to mortgage, consumer and health care fraud - we've found that these schemes are as diverse as the imaginations of those who perpetrate them, and as sophisticated as modern technology will permit.''
Mr. Holder's remarks were among his first public comments since President Obama, during last month's State of the Union address, announced the administration's redoubled commitment to combat financial fraud. 
Critics have faulted the Justice Department for not pursuing criminal cases against the banking executives whose conduct helped bring about the 2008 global financial crisis and subsequent deep recession.
Mr. Holder, who spoke to about 400 Columbia students and faculty, addressed those criticisms on Thursday.
''We found that much of the conduct that led to the financial crisis was unethical and irresponsible,'' said Mr. Holder, who earned his undergraduate and law degrees at Columbia. ''But we have also discovered that some of this behavior - while morally reprehensible - may not necessarily have been criminal.''
''Believe me, I understand - and I often hear about - the public desire to, as one pundit put it, 'see the handcuffs come to Wall Street,' '' he said. ''So let me assure you: whenever and wherever we do uncover evidence of criminal wrongdoing, we will not hesitate to bring prosecutions.''
Mr. Holder said that in the last two years the department had indicted more than 2,100 people for mortgage fraud.''
But the Justice Department has recently experienced some setbacks in white-collar prosecutions that went unmentioned on Thursday.
This week, the government dropped its biggest prosecution of individuals accused of foreign bribery after failing to secure convictions of 10 of the 22 people charged. The two-year-old case, brought under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, was the result of an undercover sting carried out by the F.B.I. in which agents posed as African officials to solicit bribes from United States arms industry executives.
Last week, a federal appeals court overturned the criminal conviction of a former Goldman Sachs computer programmer on charges that he stole trade secrets from the bank when he downloaded source code from Goldman's computers. The ruling was a setback for the Justice Department, which has made the prosecution of high-tech crime and intellectual property theft a priority.
That case was brought by Preet S. Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. Mr. Bharara attended Mr. Holder's speech on Thursday, along with the United States attorneys from Connecticut, New Jersey and the Eastern District of New York.
Mr. Holder teased Mr. Bharara, who has led the government's prosecution of insider-trading crimes on Wall Street, about his becoming a media darling.
''Many of you know Preet from his appearance on the cover of Time magazine and his being called 'the man who is busting Wall Street,' '' Mr. Holder said, holding up a copy of the recent issue for the audience.
''He will be signing copies in the back.''
Mr. Holder used the speech to trumpet the newly formed law enforcement group that is investigating financial fraud related to the housing boom and its subsequent collapse. He cited the task force's issuance of civil subpoenas to 11 financial companies seeking information related to residential mortgage-backed securities.
''And, although I can't go into detail about ongoing investigations, I can tell you that we expect more to follow,'' Mr. Holder said.
In a question-and-answer session after the speech, Lee C. Bollinger, the president of Columbia and a legal scholar, changed the subject to affirmative action. Mr. Bollinger, as the president of University of Michigan, was at the center of two Supreme Court cases regarding the use of affirmative action in college admissions.
Mr. Bollinger asked Mr. Holder to comment on the Supreme Court's decision this week to revisit affirmative action by agreeing to hear a case involving race-conscious admissions policies at the University of Texas.
''I'm not sure what's changed since Grutter,'' Mr. Holder said, referring to a 2003 case in which Mr. Bollinger, as Michigan's president, was the named defendant and the court ruled that the university's affirmative action policies were constitutional.
Legal experts think that the court, whose makeup has changed since 2003, could do away with racial preferences in college admissions.
Mr. Holder noted that Mr. Bollinger had called the court's decision to hear the case ''ominous.''
''I don't think that's an inappropriate description,'' he said.
Mr. Holder said he hoped that promoting diverse student bodies remained a factor in university admissions. ''I can't imagine a time where the need for diversity will ever cease,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

We'll defer that answer to the actors, writers, singers and comedians who make light of politics in the show ''Political Subversities,'' playing Saturdays at 9:30 p.m. through May at the People's Improv Theater. The show, which was conceived by the playwright and composer Elizabeth Swados, features music, skits and monologues drawn from the political news of the day, performed by a troupe of 11 -- many of whom studied with Ms. Swados. People's Improv Theater, 123 East 24th Street, Manhattan, (212) 563-7488, thepit-nyc.com; $15.
Roosevelt Island Photography Show (through March 18) On display at the Octagon Gallery is the work of Dannielle Hayes, a photographer who documented the abandoned hospital buildings of Welfare Island (as Roosevelt Island was formerly called) in 1968. The exhibition, ''Windows on Welfare Island,'' which consists of 19 color-infused photographs of the architectural remains, will be on view daily from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Octagon Gallery, 888 Main Street, Roosevelt Island, (212) 688-4836, rihs.us; free.
'Will to Create, Will to Live: The Culture of Terezin' (Monday) During the Holocaust, the ghetto of Terezin was known as a holding point for Czech Jews bound for death camps, but it was also the site of much artistic creation.

HEADLINE: Federal Housing Grants Are Being Cut to the Bone in South Florida

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
MIAMI -- In a recession-racked county where dour economic news abounds, the situation keeps getting grimmer.
Four cities in Miami-Dade County are bearing some of the deepest cuts in the country in federal housing money designated for nonprofit groups that serve the poor, the elderly and the developmentally disabled. Several of the groups' directors said they had no choice but to turn more poor people away, at a time when services are in greater demand. Layoffs are also likely, they said.
And Miami-Dade officials, including Miami's mayor, blame the federal government, whose financing formula, they say, undercounts the poor, a charge the government denies. 
Hialeah, northwest of Miami, is the country's top loser of money from the government's community development block grant program. It had a 47.3 percent cut in financing compared with last year. Miami Beach lost 42 percent, and the City of Miami lost 33.8 percent. North Miami and unincorporated parts of Miami-Dade County were also hit hard.
''We had 100 children in our day care center 10 years ago,'' said Madelyn Rodriguez Llanes, program administrator for a center run by Centro Mater, a nonprofit group that tends to Miami's poor in Little Havana. ''Now we have 50. Soon it will have to drop to 10. The families that we see are people with real needs. They don't have cars. They have already been cut from other services. They can't pay for child care.''
At a news conference on Thursday, Mayor Tomas P. Regalado of Miami and city commissioners challenged the accuracy of the formula that is used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in allocating money this year. They said they found it incomprehensible that Miami, a poor city that has grown poorer, would see federal block grant money drop in one year to $4.9 million from $7.5 million.
The city has been fighting cuts for the last two years but stepped up its battle in January, when it was told that it would receive even less than it had expected. Congress has cut more than $1 billion from the program during that same time.
''These are huge cuts that are impeding the funds of many agencies,'' said Mr. Regalado, who added that he wanted the housing agency to revisit the numbers it used in its calculations. ''We are going to put up a fight, and hopefully Washington will listen.''
He added: ''Poverty is all over the City of Miami. We have more poverty here than in 2000.''
Nearly 1,000 communities across the country faced a second year of cuts -- some of them steeper than ever -- in the block grant money handed out by the federal housing agency. More than 200 received more money.
But Housing and Urban Development Department officials said the sharp drop to cities in South Florida had nothing to do with the formula used. That formula, they said, remained unchanged.
What did change was the data, specifically the number of overcrowded units in Miami and other cities, according to census figures. This is the first year that the housing agency is using figures from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, which will take five-year, rather than 10-year, snapshots of the makeup of communities. The survey replaces the census long form traditionally used.
According to the five-year survey, Miami and the other cities that were hit by sharp cuts have fewer overcrowded units, which is one indication of poverty, than they did 10 years ago, officials say. That is one criterion of several that the housing agency uses to award grants.
Mr. Regalado and city commissioners say the data was skewed by the construction boom that took place in Miami before 2007, when new houses and condominium towers were being built at a rapid pace. The poor, they say, do not live in those places.
But housing agency officials disagreed. The figures are accurate, they said, because census takers count actual overcrowded units. Miami's share of money got smaller for this reason. There is also less money to go around.
''It's belt-tightening time for everyone,'' said Jerry Brown, a spokesman for Housing and Urban Development. ''Out of all the entitlement communities, most of them are going to see a decline in their community development block grant dollars. There is no change in the formula. It is solely data driven.''
Last year, the City of Miami challenged the census figures, arguing that, among other factors, illegal immigrants were underreported.
Hoping to shake dollars loose in a different way, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Miami Republican, is sponsoring a bill that would give the city more flexibility in how it uses the money. At the moment, 15 percent of block grant money can be used for social services. The bill would increase that to 25 percent.
The bill is not likely to move any time soon. The city, which was hit hard by the recession, said it was looking for ways to replenish some of the money, but there is little it can do.
''We need relief immediately,'' said Miami's city commissioner, Francis Suarez. ''We don't have the resources to make up the funds.''
Private donations are likely to help, but with financing from all quarters continuing to shrink, some nonprofits say it is getting tougher and tougher to stay open.
''A 34 percent cut -- that almost closes our doors,'' said Lavern Scott, the executive director of Curley's House, a food bank based in Miami that serves people in some of the poorest neighborhoods. ''We help people who have less than $600 a month in income. How can you pay your rent and eat? How you pay your rent and afford your medication? It hurts us and every other agency.''

HEADLINE: Weekly Jobless Claims Remain at Four-Year Low

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment insurance payments last week stayed at a four-year low, the Labor Department said Thursday, providing more evidence the labor market was improving. 
Applications for jobless benefits were unchanged for the week that ended Feb. 18 at 351,000, the fewest since March 2008, the department said. The median projection in a Bloomberg News survey called for 355,000 claims, making it the fourth consecutive week that the figures have been better than forecast. The number of people on unemployment benefit rolls dropped to the lowest level since August 2008.
The figures show companies may be growing more optimistic about the economic outlook. The recent drop in jobless claims sets the stage for bigger gains in hiring, which could bolster consumer confidence and drive spending.
''The strength we've had in the last few months is continuing,'' said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Conn. ''Barring any surprises, February looks like another good month for payroll growth.''
Estimates for first-time claims ranged from 330,000 to 370,000 in the Bloomberg News survey of 47 economists. The Labor Department initially reported the prior week's applications at 348,000.
The four-week moving average, a less-volatile measure, declined to 359,000 from 366,000, also the lowest since March 2008.
The number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits dropped by 52,000 in the week ended Feb. 11, to 3.39 million. The continuing claims figure does not include the number of workers receiving extended benefits under federal programs.

HEADLINE: Reacting to Its Stalled Popularity, Nascar Checked Under the Hood

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- When the royalty of Nascar gathered last June in a hotel in Charlotte, N.C., the meeting had the feel of an urgent summit. Once a seemingly unstoppable juggernaut, Nascar suffered during the recession as attendance and television ratings fell and sponsors, who once flocked to the sport, held back.
Brian France, Nascar's chairman, flanked by his top lieutenants, came armed with more than a year's worth of research on what ailed Nascar and shared it with Roger Penske, Jack Roush and other race team executives. Drivers, the lifeblood of the sport, were too predictable; race teams and Nascar were slow to embrace social media; track owners were not doing enough to make attending races easier; not enough was being done to attract Hispanics and urban youths to offset the decline in older fans.
''Our success covered up or accelerated good and bad things going on,'' France said recently. ''It's better to be on the offensive and put a tail wind behind it.'' 
France's message was based on the first comprehensive study of Nascar, ordered in 2010 to come up with a five-year plan for fixing the sport. The Nascar Sprint Cup Series opens its 2012 season Sunday with the Daytona 500 after the corporate soul-searching resulted in a set of measures, compiled late last year, aimed at revitalizing the way the sport does business.
After the recession slowed years of meteoric growth, Nascar's leadership, from France on down, realized that the build-it-and-they-will-come model that propelled it through the 1990s and the first half of the last decade was no longer a solid business strategy. More than most sports, Nascar relies on older, white male fans. The study found that those fans were, because of the recession and their advancing age, going to fewer races and spending less at the races they did attend. According to the research, the growth in the number of single-parent families had also made it harder for fathers and mothers to take their children to races.
Because fans flocked to races for years, Nascar did not have to work hard to find newcomers. Now, younger fans are more likely to learn about a sport online than from a father or uncle, and Nascar feels it has to speak more directly to them.
The car culture that nourished Nascar has also been changing. Fewer Americans are tinkering under the hood, which makes them less likely to appreciate stock cars. Brand loyalty to automobile manufacturers has eroded, undermining another cornerstone of the Nascar fan experience: rooting for a Chevy, a Dodge, a Ford or a Toyota. (The latest racecar design, introduced in 2007 to criticism from drivers and fans alike, did not help. The four manufacturers are designing cars that look more like the models they represent, and they will be on the track next year.)
''There was a lack of understanding about what Nascar was trying to accomplish,'' said Steve Phelps, Nascar's chief marketing officer, who hired Taylor, a communications firm, to conduct the study. ''Like any business, you have to take stock of where you are.''
To review how the sport communicates with fans new and old, Nascar interviewed nearly 40 of its executives and 151 industry stakeholders, including drivers, race teams and sponsors. More than 1,000 casual and avid fans completed online surveys. News media coverage of Nascar during the past decade was analyzed to see how it could be improved.
It was a no-holds-barred look at the sport done at breakneck speed. The results were ''a real eye-opener,'' said Mike Helton, Nascar's president. The findings showed what many in the sport sensed, but were unable to correct: Nascar spoke in many voices, often at once. Drivers said one thing, race teams said another. Nascar promoted the sport as the organizing body, and the broadcasters and sponsors pumped the races in their own way. Track operators across the country had their own interests to pursue.
''The media landscape has changed so much and we were slow to change to it,'' Phelps said. ''We need to have a bonfire instead of 10 campfires'' if Nascar wants to speak effectively to attract new fans.
After spending more than $5 million on the research, Nascar spent millions more buying back its digital rights in 2013 from Turner, which had paid Nascar a fee to run its Web site. This will help resolve conflicts that have hampered Nascar's exposure. For instance, a television station currently can shoot video at a track and broadcast it, but it has not been allowed to post the video on its Web site because it competes with Turner's Web site. That will change next year.
Nascar also hired nine new staff members, in part to help market to Hispanic, urban and young fans. Drivers were also encouraged to use Twitter and Facebook to communicate because, the research showed, fans are more likely to get hooked on the sport if they can root for a specific driver. Sponsors that provide the financial fuel for race teams also want more for their advertising dollars.
''I was fighting against social media because am I going to walk down the street to get a burger and tweet that?'' said Jeff Gordon, the four-time Cup Series champion who now has 129,000 followers on Twitter. ''But when I met with sponsors, they asked me about my social media. It really got me to look at it more.''
To attract new fans, Phelps commissioned an ethnographic study that gauged how fans navigate racetracks. This included 64 hours with focus groups. At nine tracks, 650 fans were interviewed and 55 hours of video footage shot. More than 70 first-time fans were given tickets and spending money to attend one Nascar race, one other sporting event and one nonsporting event like a concert or circus, and asked to record everything they did.
The video revealed a wealth of details. Some new fans discovered that many things required cash. Few tracks offered services for children. While most tracks did a good job of ushering cars into their parking lots, few of them directed traffic after races ended. Tracks sold tickets in a variety of formats.
''We all fell into a rut because we assumed all fans were professionals,'' said Joie Chitwood, the president of Daytona International Speedway. ''We didn't assume there would be some rookies.''
But first and foremost, fans want to follow tight races and fresh faces, two things they got last year. After Jimmie Johnson won five consecutive championships, Tony Stewart edged Carl Edwards for the title in the final race of the season. Not surprisingly, television ratings rose.
''I don't think it's good for one driver to win five championships in a row,'' said R. Jon Ackley, who teaches a class on the business of Nascar at Virginia Commonwealth University. ''That's why Nascar saw a resurgence last season.''
If nothing else, the research was so comprehensive that executives in the sport who normally talk to one another about cars and track conditions are now swapping ideas on how to work together to better reach fans and sponsors.
''It would be difficult to envision a day when I was happy about someone else's success on the racetrack,'' said Marshall Carlson, the president of Hendrick Motorsports. ''There was a real shift in that we started to use the word 'we' a lot more.''

HEADLINE: Everything Is Illuminated

BYLINE: By KAREN ROSENBERG

 BODY:
The artist Dan Flavin (1933-1996) is so closely identified with his signature medium, the fluorescent light sculpture, that a show of his drawings is bound to surprise. And it's particularly exciting to find in ''Dan Flavin: Drawing,'' at the Morgan Library & Museum, that Flavin was not only a devoted draftsman but also a freewheeling polymath on paper.
Drawing was ''my holy compulsion,'' he said, and he drew constantly throughout his career, filling six-ring notebooks with sketches of people and landscapes and studies for sculptures and installations. He made more ''finished'' drawings, too, including early Abstract Expressionist watercolors and later documents of his light installations. 
The Morgan's show has a little bit of everything, including a revealing glimpse of drawings from Flavin's personal collection, which encompasses Hokusai, Mondrian and the Hudson River School. It will completely change the way you see his art -- an effect that can be measured by putting the exhibition's two light installations, ''Untitled (to the Real Dan Hill)'' and ''Untitled (in Honor of Harold Joachim),'' to the before-and-after test.
The idea of a Minimalist with a regular drawing practice isn't, in itself, news. But Flavin's jumpy, impassioned mark-making has little in common with the grids and serial notations of an Agnes Martin or a Sol LeWitt. And the connection between his drawings and sculptures is much less obvious than it is in, say, Richard Serra's oeuvre (as seen in a recent survey of Mr. Serra's thick smears of oil stick on paper).
Organized by Isabelle Dervaux, the Morgan's curator of modern and contemporary drawings, ''Dan Flavin: Drawing'' emphasizes the many different, sometimes contradictory, uses to which Flavin put pencil and paper. His drawings could be rambling, confessional diaries or coolheaded inventories, trial runs or elegant summations.
The earliest works here, mainly Abstract Expressionist watercolors sometimes annotated with snippets of poetry, display a youthful romanticism that verges on the embarrassing. But they reveal some formative influences, besides the obvious de Kooning: Cezanne and Brancusi, who appear in quick, muscular pencil portraits, and James Joyce, whose poetry collection ''Chamber Music'' is the subject of a pen-and-ink and watercolor series.
Here, too, is a hallmark of Flavin's mature work: the formal dedication. In ''To Those Who Suffer in the Congo'' (1961), he addresses victims of political upheaval; in ''Apollinaire Wounded (to Ward Jackson)'' he name-checks both a French Surrealist poet and a contemporary acquaintance.
These are, mostly, finished works. But the show's next section finds Flavin in brainstorming mode, fine-tuning his first set of light sculptures (the ''Icons''). Inspired by Malevich, who called his own art ''the icon of my time,'' these pieces consist of painted wooden squares with attached lamps. The related sketches show Flavin thinking through every detail, from construction to installation.
Especially fascinating are the many ideas from this period (1961-63) that, for one reason or another, were never realized; some promising, like an architectural piece dedicated to the filmmaker Antonioni, others laughable (a rocking chair outfitted with a seatbelt). By 1963 he had hit on the light installations, made from commercially available fluorescent tubes, that would come to define his career. And his drawings evolved to suit the stark simplicity of these works, with simple lines of colored pencil on black or gray paper standing in for the electrified tubes.
In notebook pages from 1967, some of Flavin's best-known works, the ''Monuments for V. Tatlin,'' appear as cuneiformlike clusters of parallel marks. Other famous pieces, dedicated to Alexander Calder and Donald Judd, turn up in meticulous drawings on graph paper. (Flavin called these ''final finished diagrams,'' and outsourced the actual drafting to his wife, son and assistants.)
Here it's tempting to assume that Flavin abandoned traditional drawing for more conceptual processes. But that simply wasn't the case, as a group of landscape and portrait sketches from the 1960s through the 1990s reveals. All along, he continued to draw from life -- ''for intense leisure, for refreshing returns to observation and reorientation in form,'' he wrote.
In a confident and impetuous hand, he captured Hudson River traffic and Hamptons beachcombers, often working in series and with an eye to changing weather conditions. (''You are an Impressionist a hundred years too late,'' the art critic Bruce Glaser told him.)
A group of astonishingly responsive pencil drawings from 1960 place a small tugboat at the center of a pinwheeling cloud mass. Later charcoal-and-pastel works, from the 1980s, are animated by the strong diagonal of a heeling sailboat. (These also recall one of Flavin's earliest light installations, a single tube set at a 45-degree angle from the floor.)
It's clear from some of these works that Flavin felt a kinship with the artists of the Hudson River School. And as can be seen in the show's final gallery, he collected their drawings in depth. They featured prominently in his never-realized plan for a Dan Flavin Art Institute in Garrison, N.Y., where drawings by Aaron Draper Shattuck, John Frederick Kensett and others were to have been displayed close to his light installations.
He also admired the lively but economical lines of Hokusai and Hiroshige, to judge from the selections on view. And he seems to have identified with Mondrian's habit of mapping out paintings on cigarette wrappers, purchasing a couple of these slight sketches.
There's as much of Flavin's hand, so to speak, in his collection as there is in his own drawings. And in everything, there is a deeply satisfying commitment to the ritual of working on paper. In 1962, recording an afternoon of drawing near his studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, he wrote: ''With a dashing pencil I have such a rousing sense of freedom. The drawing grows out rapidly and I follow it to the final touch. I know that this work requires much feeling and knowing all at once but I am not conscious of it. I know that I am on top of my pencil -- (probably all I need to know).''

HEADLINE: 3 Big European Banks Post Quarterly Losses

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
FRANKFURT - Several of Europe's largest banks provided a reminder Thursday of how much work remains to overcome the effects of the financial crisis that began in 2008 and the sovereign debt crisis that quickly followed.
Burdened by their exposure to Greek government debt and other damaged assets, Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Agricole in France and Dexia, a French-Belgian bank, all reported quarterly losses.
Commerzbank in Germany returned to profit in the fourth quarter of 2011 after a loss the previous quarter, but still served as a case study in the difficulties for banks in regaining the trust of investors. Commerzbank shares plunged more than 6 percent to close at 1.93 euros. Thursday after it announced a plan to exchange debt obligations issued by the bank for shares. 
''We all knew it was going to be a tough quarter, and it was a tough quarter,'' said Matthew Czepliewicz, a banking analyst at Collins Stewart. ''Most banks have been sacrificing a bit of their earnings for the sake of strength of their balance sheet.''
''The sector has made a lot of progress,'' he added. ''Having said that, the economic backdrop remains pretty fragile, and the question is going to be where is revenue growth going to come from.''
Nearly four years after the financial crisis began in the United States and two years after Greece's debt problems became a threat to the integrity of the euro, many of the region's financial institutions remain dependent on the European Central Bank for the cash they need to stay in business, and several continue to receive government support.
Royal Bank of Scotland and Commerzbank, in Frankfurt, are still partly owned by their respective governments, while Dexia is receiving its second government bailout.
The effect of the sovereign debt crisis was particularly visible Thursday as banks booked losses from their Greek bond holdings. Greece and its creditors reached an agreement early this week that will cut the face value of its debt by more than half. The deal may help Greece avoid a chaotic default, but it forces banks to recognize the losses if they have not done so already.
''It just highlights the major headwinds all banks are facing at the moment,'' said Chintan Joshi, an analyst at Nomura in London. ''It's not just earnings but also asset quality. The trend is going to be challenging until we get out of this slow-growth environment.''
Royal Bank of Scotland said Thursday that its loss in 2011 widened to 2 billion pounds, or $3.2 billion, from 1.1 billion pounds a year earlier because of large losses on the Greek holdings, and because the bank had to compensate some customers who had wrongly been sold insurance.
Credit Agricole, one of France's largest banks, reported a fourth-quarter loss of 3.1 billion euros ($4.1 billion) as it wrote off more than 2.5 billion euros in soured investments, including an additional 221 million euros on its Greek debt holdings. Commerzbank booked a loss from its holdings of Greek government bonds in the quarter of about 700 million euros.
Dexia, the lender that ended up in the hands of the French and Belgian governments last October after it lost the faith of investors, posted a 2011 loss of 11.6 billion euros, one of the largest in French corporate history. A year earlier, the bank reported a profit of 723 million euros. Dexia said the loss included 3.4 billion euros from the markdown of its Greek exposure.
As they move to clean up their books and increase profits, banks are trying to respond to demands from regulators that they increase the amount of capital they keep to protect against losses. Doing so is complicated because investors are wary of putting more money into banks and the European economy is weak.
Commerzbank surprised and disappointed investors with a plan to raise an additional 1 billion euros in capital by converting so-called hybrid instruments, a form of debt, into shares. The transaction will help the bank meet regulatory requirements. But by increasing total outstanding shares, the bank will tend to dilute the value of existing stock.
The European Banking Authority said last year that Commerzbank needed 5.3 billion euros in additional capital, one of the highest amounts of any bank in Europe. Commerzbank said Thursday it had reduced its capital shortfall to 1.8 billion euros by disposing of risky assets and other measures.
Martin Blessing, the Commerzbank chief executive, insisted that it would not need additional aid from taxpayers. The German government holds 25 percent of Commerzbank after a bailout in 2009.
George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain, said Thursday that Royal Bank of Scotland's results showed that management was ''cleaning up the mess after the biggest bank bailout in history.'' The government owns 80 percent of the bank.
But investors are not convinced. ''Given that there is no return to a dividend in sight and there are other more attractive banking investment opportunities with a lack of government interference out there, they still have a long way to go,'' said Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers in London.
''That's not to deny that R.B.S. made considerable progress in its results,'' he added
Stephen Hester, the chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, embarked on a turnaround plan in 2009 that reduced the bank's riskier assets, cut thousands of jobs and scaled back its investment banking operation by closing some business units. He is also seeking to reduce the bank's reliance on financing from the financial markets and government loans.
The earnings reports Thursday contained a few bright spots. Commerzbank, which focuses on lending to midsize companies in Germany, benefited from the success of the country's powerful export sector, which has continued to thrive by selling products in fast-growing countries like China.
Commerzbank also profited from its unit in Poland, which has one of the strongest economies in the European Union. Healthy growth in those two markets allowed Commerzbank to reduce the amount of money it set aside to cover possible bad loans.
Mr. Blessing forecast that the bank will report an operating profit in 2012.
But like many banking leaders, he added a caveat, ''The high degree of uncertainty associated with the European sovereign debt crisis will, however, continue to pose challenges for us.''
Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, and Julia Werdigier from London. David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Big Cheesy, a Grilled Cheese Sandwich Challenge

BYLINE: By RACHEL LEE HARRIS

 BODY:
One of the first things I learned as a young Miser was how to make a grilled cheese sandwich: one slice of good old American cheese on one thin piece of white bread, baked open-faced on the top rack of the oven until little brown and black blisters formed on the top (my favorite part).
As a child, Brian Keyser, proprietor of Casellula Cheese & Wine Cafe, used Kraft slices or, on special occasions, factory-made cheddar or jack. ''Not that there is anything wrong with that,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ''O.K., there is. I would be disappointed, to say the least, to have to eat that now.'' 
That's because at Casellula he serves a variety of international cheeses with complex flavors. Like a good sommelier, he freely shares his passion for, and knowledge of, the subject. ''Cheeses, which are alive, are filled with living organisms that add flavor and change it over time,'' he said. ''In these hard economic times cheese is an affordable way to indulge. Eating handmade cheese is a great way to support small farms. I could go on and discuss its nutritional value and its many proven aphrodisiac qualities, but I don't want to bore you.''
Bore me? Bring on the fondue!
And Mr. Keyser will, this Saturday and Sunday, when he presents his fondue grilled cheese, accompanied by pickled-pepper relish, at the Big Cheesy, a grilled cheese sandwich competition to find the best in the city, sponsored by Openhouse Gallery, a pop-up event-planning organization. The $25 ticket allows fromage heads to vote for their favorite of seven varieties of grilled cheese from shops all over New York, including the popular Murray's Cheese in the West Village. You can wash them down with a beer from Sixpoint Craft Ales and soft drinks provided by Bella Lula.
''We focus on pairing cheese with other ingredients that will bring out its flavor,'' Adam Schneider, a co-owner of Little Muenster on the Lower East Side, wrote. His partner, Vanessa Palazio, grew up on the Nicaraguan repocheta: two tortillas with queso fresco. This weekend they plan to present a three-cheese melt with butternut squash puree and sage brown butter.
The Melt Shop's managing partner, Spencer Rubin, used to make his grills on French bread turned inside-out, with salted butter, pressed down with a white plate on the stove top. ''I'm salivating just thinking about it,'' he wrote. His offering for this weekend is still in the experimental phase, and he's keeping the recipe on lockdown until it's perfected. ''I have been working with this great cranberry pepper jelly.''
As for Mr. Keyser, he plans to win using Scharfer Max, a slightly stinky, washed-rind Alpine cheese that has a distinct oniony note to it. ''Our worthy competition are welcome to see the recipe and tremble in fear,'' he said.
(The Big Cheesy, 1 to 7 p.m., 201 Mulberry Street, between Spring and Delancey Streets, Little Italy; advance purchase is recommended (Saturday is sold out; a few tickets are available for Sunday); 212-334-0288, openhousegallery.org.)
FIELD TRIPS FOR YOUNG FOODIES
Children who'd like to devise their own specialty sandwiches one day should persuade their teachers to sign up for a field trip to the Brooklyn Kitchen. Every other Thursday the Kitchen hosts a tour of its site, a butchery demonstration at the Meat Hook butcher shop, a lecture on where food comes from and a cooking class. Any New York City school is eligible with a $5 donation from each child. (Waivers are available on request.)

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Weekend Miser column on Friday, about a competition to find the best grilled cheese sandwich in New York, misstated part of the name of the cheese that Brian Keyser, proprietor of Casellula Cheese & Wine Cafe in Manhattan, said he would use in his entry. It is Scharfer Max, not Shafer Max.

HEADLINE: A Fund-Raiser Faces Inquiries Into His Races

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Last year, House Republican leaders tapped an up-and-coming Florida lawmaker, Representative Vern Buchanan, to lead the party's fund-raising for candidates nationwide, a crucial part of their efforts to keep control of the House in November.
The drive has already paid dividends in surging donations. Now, however, Mr. Buchanan's golden touch in raising money could prove as much a hindrance as an asset, as a thicket of questions surrounding his own Florida campaigns is threatening to distract from the Republicans' national finance operation.
Federal inquiries surrounding Mr. Buchanan appear to be widening, as investigators examine allegations that his companies improperly reimbursed contributors to his campaigns and claimed improper tax deductions and that he failed to include all his varied financial interests in his Congressional disclosure reports.
The Federal Election Commission has already completed one investigation that produced a settlement this week with a former partner of Mr. Buchanan's who used their car dealership to reimburse employees for contributing to the congressman's campaigns, in violation of federal law. 
The commission dropped its case against Mr. Buchanan himself over the reimbursements, despite testimony that he took part in the scheme. But agents for the F.B.I. and the Internal Revenue Service recently contacted former employees alleging financial improprieties by Mr. Buchanan, who owns a number of auto dealerships thoughout Florida and elsewhere and is one of the richest members of Congress.
A federal grand jury in Tampa is hearing evidence in the case as well, according to several people with knowledge of the inquiries.
The House Ethics Committee, meanwhile, is examining his failure in Congressional filings to disclose numerous financial interests and management positions -- 17 in all -- in another car dealership, a Florida development company, his own family foundation and other organizations. He also failed to report $11,000 in income from at least one of these companies.
Blaming accounting oversights, Mr. Buchanan filed four years' worth of new House disclosure statements last September, belatedly acknowledging these financial interests. But a review of campaign finance reports shows a deep link between his newly disclosed corporate interests and his own fund-raising operations, with donors affiliated with these groups donating more than $136,000 to his campaigns.
The congressman's lawyers predicted he would be exonerated and said the allegations against him were driven by disgruntled former employees and opponents.
''His political enemies are growing increasingly desperate and making all these accusations against him,'' said William J. McGinley, a Washington lawyer representing the congressman. ''It's a political witch hunt.''
One important question is whether high-pressure solicitations for donations from Mr. Buchanan's business partners and employees crossed the line into duress.
While some employees said in interviews that they had given donations freely, others said they contributed after aggressive solicitations by Mr. Buchanan.
Christopher Narvaez, who was chief financial officer at one of Mr. Buchanan's auto dealerships in the mid-2000s, said in an interview that before Mr. Buchanan announced his Congressional candidacy in 2005, he strongly encouraged company executives to contribute.
Mr. Narvaez said that at one meeting with partners and executives, Mr. Buchanan said: ''I really need you to give the maximum allowance to get the campaign off to a good start.''
Afterward, Mr. Narvaez said, Mr. Buchanan approached him in the hallway several times and asked, ''Have you made your contribution yet?'' (He eventually did, but not the maximum.)
Questions about Mr. Buchanan's finances have percolated in the Florida news media and political circles there for three years. But they have received little attention nationally, despite his rising profile as both chairman of the finance team for the National Republican Congressional Committee and a member of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee.
That could change, however, as inquiries by the Ethics Committee and others press on.
''In terms of perception, the Republicans have to be concerned,'' said Daniel A. Smith, a University of Florida political science professor who has followed the Buchanan case closely. ''This certainly may not be the face that you want raising money for the Republican Party.''
No evidence of impropriety has surfaced in what has been a hugely successful national fund-raising operation for the House Republicans.
With President Obama's economic record as a main target, the House Republican committee raised $54.1 million last year in the effort to defend their House majority -- a spike of 49 percent over the same point before the 2010 elections, data show.
''Congressman Buchanan has been a valuable part of our success in raising the resources we need to combat the hundreds of millions of dollars that Democrat special interests are investing to return Nancy Pelosi to the speaker's chair,'' said Paul Lindsay, spokesman for the Republican committee. ''This committee has always maintained a strict legal compliance with the letter and the spirit of the law.''
Mr. Buchanan's office, based in Sarasota, did not respond to requests for an interview.
His supporters say that as a self-made businessman, Mr. Buchanan brings a built-in credibility with prospective donors about creating jobs and lowering taxes, and his influence is particularly important in the Florida battleground.
Steve Hiteman, who worked as chief financial officer for a Buchanan auto company, described him as a ''charismatic'' leader inspiring loyalty.
''You don't want to let him down,'' Mr. Hiteman, who along with his wife has given at least $17,000 to Mr. Buchanan's campaigns, said in an interview. He added quickly: ''I was never coerced or strong-armed in any way -- no deals, no nothing.''
Others tell a different story.
The election commission's investigation established that three of Mr. Buchanan's Florida dealerships used corporate money to reimburse employees for tens of thousands of dollars in contributions to his 2006 and 2008 campaigns.
Some executives and employees, who donated thousands of dollars each after rarely, if ever, making a contribution before, said they were reimbursed through cash ''bonuses,'' or offered trips on Mr. Buchanan's corporate jet and to his Colorado home, according the commission's investigation.
Commission investigators also found that the reimbursed contributions were part of an ''extensive and ongoing scheme'' by the Hyundai of North Jacksonville dealership to hide the source of the donations, in violation of federal law. Initially, the commission's general counsel tied the fund-raising methods directly to Mr. Buchanan, finding he ''knowingly and willfully'' accepted the improper contributions, according to internal investigative reports that the commission made public just last month.
One former Buchanan executive, Salvatore Rosa, told investigators that reimbursements began as far back as 2003. He said Mr. Buchanan pressured employees to attend a $1,000-a-person fund-raiser for President George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign and instructed Mr. Rosa to reimburse them.
When he objected to the reimbursements as illegal, Mr. Rosa said Mr. Buchanan told him to ''finesse it,'' according to his statement to commission investigators.
In a separate civil deposition last month, Mr. Rosa also said that the congressman took part in a ''conspiracy to evade U.S. income taxes'' through improper business deductions and accounting methods, and Mr. Rosa has brought a complaint with the I.R.S. that would award him part of any money recovered. The agency declined to comment.
Beyond Mr. Rosa, other former partners and employees also maintain that Mr. Buchanan personally directed the reimbursements at different dealerships.
But Mr. Buchanan's lawyers have attacked the credibility of his accusers, describing them as bitter former employees, and they said Mr. Buchanan knew nothing of the improper payments.
Despite its initial findings against Mr. Buchanan, the election commission ultimately back-tracked and decided last February to drop the case against him, notifying his lawyers they were closing the file.
The commission reached a small monetary settlement this week with one of Mr. Buchanan's former partners, Sam Kazran, finding that he used money from the Jacksonville Hyundai dealership they owned to contribute nearly $68,000 to Mr. Buchanan's campaigns.
The congressman's lawyer, Mr. McGinley, said the election commission agreement should put an end to ''false allegations'' that Mr. Buchanan directed or knew of the improper reimbursements.
But critics remain unconvinced.
Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonpartisan group that brought an ethics complaint against Mr. Buchanan and represents a former employee, said the flurry of recent activity surrounding the case left her hopeful that the Justice Department or the House Ethics Committee might move against him.
''There's so much evidence in this case,'' she said. ''It's not just one or two things; there's a lot of smoke, and a lot of his employees are talking about him. You don't have to believe us.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Feb. 24 about investigations into the campaign finances of Representative Vern Buchanan, Republican of Florida, referred incorrectly to the context of a quotation from the Federal Election Commission on improper contributions. While F.E.C. investigators found illegal campaign contributions were laundered to Mr. Buchanan's campaigns from three dealerships he owned, the agency's reference to an ''extensive and ongoing scheme'' applied to only dealership -- Hyundai of North Jacksonville.

HEADLINE: Romney's Economic Closet

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
According to Michael Kinsley, a gaffe is when a politician accidently tells the truth. That's certainly what happened to Mitt Romney on Tuesday, when in a rare moment of candor -- and, in his case, such moments are really, really rare -- he gave away the game.
Speaking in Michigan, Mr. Romney was asked about deficit reduction, and he absent-mindedly said something completely reasonable: ''If you just cut, if all you're thinking about doing is cutting spending, as you cut spending you'll slow down the economy.'' A-ha. So he believes that cutting government spending hurts growth, other things equal. 
The right's ideology police were, predictably, aghast; the Club for Growth quickly denounced the statement as showing that Mr. Romney is ''not a limited-government conservative.'' On the contrary, insisted the club, ''If we balanced the budget tomorrow on spending cuts alone, it would be fantastic for the economy.'' And a Romney spokesman tried to walk back the remark, claiming, ''The governor's point was that simply slashing the budget, with no affirmative pro-growth policies, is insufficient to get the economy turned around.''
But that's not what the candidate said, and it's very unlikely that it's what he meant. Almost surely, he is, in fact, a closet Keynesian.
How do we know this? Well, for one thing, Mr. Romney is not a stupid man. And while his grasp of world affairs does sometimes seem shaky, he has to be aware of the havoc austerity policies are wreaking in Greece, Ireland and elsewhere.
Beyond that, we know who he turns to for economic advice; heading the list are Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University and N. Gregory Mankiw of Harvard. While both men are loyal Republican spear-carriers -- each served for a time as chairman of George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers -- both also have long track records as professional economists. And what these track records suggest is that neither of them believes any of the propositions that have become litmus tests for would-be G.O.P. presidential candidates.
Consider Mr. Mankiw, in particular. Modern Republicans detest Keynes; Mr. Mankiw is the editor of a collection of papers titled ''New Keynesian Economics.'' In an early edition of his best-selling textbook, he dismissed supply-side economics -- the doctrine embraced by the sainted Ronald Reagan -- as the creation of ''charlatans and cranks.'' And, in 2009, he called for higher inflation as a solution to the economic crisis, a position anathema to Republicans like Representative Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, who warn ominously about the evil of ''debasing'' our currency.
Given his advisers, then, it seems safe to assume that what Mr. Romney blurted out Tuesday reflected his real economic beliefs -- as opposed to the nonsense he pretends to believe, because it's what the Republican base wants to hear.
And therein lies the reason Mr. Romney acts the way he does, why he is running a campaign of almost pathological dishonesty.
For he is. Every one of the Romney campaign's major themes, from the attacks on President Obama for going around the world apologizing for America (he didn't), to the insistence that Romneycare and Obamacare are very different (they're virtually identical), to the claim that Mr. Obama has lost millions of jobs (which is only true if you count the first few months of his administration, before any of his policies had taken effect), is either an outright falsehood or deeply deceptive. Why the nonstop mendacity?
As I see it, it comes down to the cynicism underlying the whole enterprise. Once you've decided to hide your beliefs and say whatever you think will get you the nomination, to pretend to agree with people you privately believe are fools, why worry at all about truth?
What this diagnosis implies, of course, is that the many people on the right who don't trust Mr. Romney, who don't believe that he's truly committed to their political faith, are correct in their suspicions. He's playing a role, and it's anyone's guess what lies beneath the mask.
So should those who don't share the right's faith be comforted by the evidence that Mr. Romney doesn't believe anything he's saying? Should we, in particular, assume that, once elected, he would actually follow sensible economic policies? Alas, no.
For the cynicism and lack of moral courage that have been so evident in the campaign wouldn't suddenly vanish once Mr. Romney entered the Oval Office. If he doesn't dare disagree with economic nonsense now, why imagine that he would become willing to challenge that nonsense later? And bear in mind that if elected, he would be watched like a hawk for signs of apostasy by the very people he's trying so desperately to appease right now.
The truth is that Mr. Romney is so deeply committed to insincerity that neither side can trust him to do what it considers to be the right thing.

HEADLINE: Delusions About the Detroit Bailout

BYLINE: By STEVEN RATTNER. 
Steven Rattner, a longtime Wall Street executive and a contributing writer for Op-Ed, was the lead adviser on the Obama administration's auto task force in 2009.

 BODY:
WHEN Mitt Romney takes the podium at Ford Field in Detroit today, he's likely to include yet another sharp denunciation of the government's rescue of General Motors and Chrysler.
That Mr. Romney would traverse Michigan trashing a program that saved tens of thousands of jobs at the Detroit-based automakers doesn't necessarily mean he's politically tone-deaf.
After all, an NBC/Marist poll recently found that 50 percent of Michigan Republicans who were likely to vote opposed the government's actions (only 42 percent supported them). 
Mr. Romney may have the primary politics right -- though with a majority of Michigan voters supporting the rescue, he may want to pivot deftly before the general election in November. But on the substance he's dead wrong.
As a presidential aspirant, Mr. Romney evidently hasn't felt a need to be consistent or specific as to what should have been done to address the collapse of the auto industry starting in late 2008. But the gist is that the government should have stayed on the sidelines and allowed the companies to go through what he calls ''managed bankruptcies,'' financed by private capital.
That sounds like a wonderfully sensible approach -- except that it's utter fantasy. In late 2008 and early 2009, when G.M. and Chrysler had exhausted their liquidity, every scrap of private capital had fled to the sidelines.
I know this because the administration's auto task force, for which I was the lead adviser, spoke diligently to all conceivable providers of funds, and not one had the slightest interest in financing those companies on any terms. If Mr. Romney disagrees, he should come forward with specific names of willing investors in place of empty rhetoric. I predict that he won't be able to, because there aren't any.
Without government financing -- initiated by President George W. Bush in December 2008 -- the two companies would not have been able to pursue Chapter 11 reorganization. Instead they would have been forced to cease production, close their doors and lay off virtually all workers once their coffers ran dry.
Those shutdowns would have reverberated through the entire auto sector, causing innumerable suppliers almost immediately to stop operating too.
Despite the relative health of its balance sheet, even Ford would have been forced to close temporarily, because critical parts would have become unavailable. And service providers -- trucking companies, restaurants and more -- would have been severely affected.
More than a million jobs would have been lost, at least for a time. Michigan and the entire industrial Midwest would have been devastated.
I consider myself an ardent capitalist, and well recognize the risks of government intervention, particularly the ''moral hazard'' of rewarding failure and the scary prospect of politics' entering private sector decision-making.
But when markets fail, as they did for both autos and banks in 2008, government should have the ability -- in fact, the obligation -- to step in.
Interestingly, Mr. Romney's current principal Republican opponent, Rick Santorum, has opposed not only the auto rescue but also the help given to the banks, which Mr. Romney supported.
Yet Mr. Romney has become the lightning rod on autos because of the full-throated roar with which he has delivered his views, including an Op-Ed essay in The New York Times in November 2008 and another essay in The Detroit News 10 days ago.
Among Mr. Romney's grievances -- and to be fair, those of other opponents of the auto rescue -- is that the auto task force trampled on bankruptcy precedents and even the law to effect President Obama's plan of ''shared sacrifice'' by all stakeholders.
What he conveniently ignores is that the president's plan was litigated throughout the federal court system -- all the way to the Supreme Court, in the case of Chrysler -- without so much as a nod to the opponents from a single judge.
In retrospect, I recognize the emotions surrounding the decision to give members of the United Auto Workers company stock in exchange for resolving their health care claims. But the courts were emphatic that what we did was legal, because we remained true to a core principle of bankruptcy reorganization: every stakeholder received more from our plan than if the companies had been left to go bankrupt on their own.
Now, less than three years later, G.M. and Chrysler have markedly exceeded our expectations. Just a few days ago, G.M. reported an annual profit of $7.6 billion, and Chrysler is in the black as well. Both companies have increased their sales sharply, in part by making appealing new models.
And they are hiring new workers for the first time in many years. Michigan's unemployment rate has dropped far faster than the national average, though it is still painfully high.
All of this was accomplished at relatively low cost; taxpayers will receive back the vast preponderance of the $82 billion that was invested.
''I'd do it again,'' Mr. Bush said of the rescue in a recent speech. ''Sometimes circumstances get in the way of philosophy.'' Good thing he and Mr. Obama didn't take Mr. Romney's advice.

HEADLINE: Familiar Candidate Rallies His Supporters in Moscow

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY; Anastasia Sadovskaya and Glenn Kates contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin rallied his supporters on Thursday in a rare campaign appearance before a packed outdoor stadium, evoking Russia's historic battles against foreign invaders and telling the crowd that victory ''is in our genes, in our genetic code.''
Mr. Putin strode out in a ski parka and delivered a ferocious stem-winder, timed to an annual holiday on Thursday that honors the ''defenders of the fatherland'' and less than two weeks before the presidential election on March 4, which he is almost certain to win. 
''We will never allow anyone to interfere in our internal affairs,'' he said. ''We will not allow someone to impose their will on us, because we have our own will! It has helped us to conquer! We are a victorious people! It is in our genes, in our genetic code!''
The event, financed by Mr. Putin's campaign, at times appeared to pose an answer to a burgeoning antigovernment protest movement, which he has cast as an American-backed effort to undermine him. One placard read, ''I will not sell my conscience to the ambassador, I will give my vote to Putin'' -- probably a reference to the American ambassador, Michael A. McFaul, who has been accused on state-controlled television of trying to foment revolution.
''We call on everyone to unite around our country,'' Mr. Putin said. ''And we ask everyone not to look overseas, not to run to the left or to the side, and not to betray your homeland, but to be with us, work for Russia and love her as we do -- with our whole hearts.''
Thursday's event had a boisterous, holiday mood, with detachments of older women dressed as sunflowers and dancing to piped-in folk tunes. Organizers bolstered attendance by mobilizing state-linked organizations and workplaces; some participants said their bosses had told them to attend, and large groups had been bused in from outside Moscow. The police reported that 130,000 people were present at Luzhniki Stadium.
Support for Mr. Putin, which dipped to record lows in the aftermath of contested parliamentary elections in December, has steadily increased over the past two months.
Many who attended Thursday's event said they came because they feared that Russia would be drawn back into political and economic upheaval without Mr. Putin.
''We are afraid of rebellions,'' said Maria Lyulkova, 46. ''We are afraid of bloodshed because we all have children. We have near and dear whom we worry about. We want stability.''
Others said they would vote for him because there was no one better; in this election Mr. Putin faces three shopworn figures he has defeated in the past, and a newcomer, Mikhail D. Prokhorov, who poses no real threat.
Of 16 participants approached by a reporter on Thursday morning, 11 said their bosses had told them to attend -- though few expressed any resentment over this. Volunteers circulated through the crowd handing out sugary cups of tea and blini.
''You could say I am working at the Luzhniki demonstration, since my supervisors told me to come here,'' Vyacheslav Radnev said. ''But in principle, I support Putin -- around 70 percent. Do you remember how beautifully and skillfully he started out?''
But a young man who would give only his first name, Ramon, and who runs a department at a weapons factory, said he was so disillusioned by the political system that he would not vote at all on March 4. He came because he had received a series of promotions at the factory, and feared there would be repercussions if he did not attend.
''They told me to go, so I went,'' said Ramon, 23.
Most in the crowd, however, said they planned to vote for Mr. Putin, who has already served as Russia's paramount leader for 12 years -- as president and then prime minister -- and some were passionate. Oleg Filippov, 36, said Mr. Putin freed Russians from the painful economic and political turmoil of the 1990s. Mr. Filippov said that his father, a trained engineer, was forced to take a job loading freight but that since Mr. Putin came to power ''our life has seriously improved.'' Mr. Filippov said that he would vote for Mr. Putin now, and that in 2018, when his term ends, he would vote for whomever Mr. Putin endorsed.
''If he selects a successor, I will vote for his successor,'' he said. ''But these six years, they are clearly Putin's. There is no alternative.''

Previews and Openings
'Assistance' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) Occupy the stage! This satire by Leslye Headland (the 2010 critical hit ''Bachelorette'') sets employees against a boss from hell. Directed by Trip Cullman, with Bobby Steggert, Michael Esper and Sue Jean Kim. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org. (David DeWitt)
'Beyond the Horizon' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Ciaran O'Reilly, who directed the Irish Rep revivals of ''The Emperor Jones'' and ''The Hairy Ape,'' returns to Eugene O'Neill with this staging of the playwright's first full-length work, a story of two brothers in love with the same woman. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1920. Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, irishrep.org. (David Rooney) 
'The Big Meal' (previews start on Thursday; opens on March 21) In what sounds like a modern-day take on Thornton Wilder, this new play traverses 80 years and five generations in the life of a typical suburban family. The director, Sam Gold, has found plenty of poetry in Annie Baker's forays into suburbia; let's see if he'll do the same for Dan LeFranc (''Sixty Miles to Silver Lake''). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org. (Eric Grode)
'Carrie' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Will it be another bloodbath or a fresh prom-night corsage this time around for the infamous musical adapted from the Stephen King novel? One of Broadway's most legendary flops in its 1988 debut, the show has been revised for this MCC Theater production by its original team, Michael Gore (composer), Dean Pitchford (lyricist) and Lawrence D. Cohen (author of the book and also screenwriter of the 1976 Brian De Palma film). Stafford Arima directs a cast that includes Molly Ranson as the telekinetic high school misfit and Marin Mazzie as her hellfire-preaching mother. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Rooney)
'Death of a Salesman' (in previews; opens on March 15) Following in the footsteps of Brian Dennehy, Dustin Hoffman, George C. Scott and Lee J. Cobb, just to name his Broadway predecessors in the role, Philip Seymour Hoffman slips on the careworn persona of Willy Loman in this revival of the Arthur Miller classic. Directed by Mike Nichols, the ensemble also features Linda Emond as Linda, Andrew Garfield (due on screen this summer in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'') as Biff, Bill Camp as Charley and John Glover as Ben. Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Edward Albee's The Lady From Dubuque' (in previews; opens on March 5) As part of Signature's inaugural season in its new Frank Gehry-designed home, the company tackles one of Mr. Albee's more challenging plays with this rare revival of the 1980 work inspired by his reading of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross's ''On Death and Dying.'' David Esbjornson directs a cast led by Jane Alexander as the enigmatic title figure. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Rooney)
'Eternal Equinox' (previews start on Thursday; opens on March 7) He famously (and perhaps apocryphally) replied ''Because it's there'' when asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest, but what were George Mallory's reasons for dropping in at the summer home of the Bloomsbury Group painters Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant right before his third Everest attempt? Joyce Hokins Sachs's play, based on actual events and set on a fall day in 1923, looks to find out. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Grode)
'Hot Lunch Apostles' (previews start on Thursday; opens on March 8) The long and fruitful collaboration between La MaMa and the Obie Award-winning company the Talking Band continues with a revival of Sidney Goldfarb's bawdy 1983 play about a troupe of carnival strippers who end up performing Bible stories. The folk-music veteran Loudon Wainwright III is on board as a performer, though presumably not as a stripper. Ellen Stewart Theater at La MaMa, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org. (Grode)
'Hurt Village' (in previews; opens on Monday) Katori Hall (the Martin Luther King drama ''The Mountaintop'') is back in Memphis for this premiere, a tale of a teenage rapper, her family, their home in a housing project -- and the return of her father, an Iraq war veteran. With Ron Cephas Jones and Tonya Pinkins. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (DeWitt)
'I Alice I' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on March 4) Fresh from the Abbey, Ireland's national theater, comes this story by the young Dublin-based company HotForTheater of two opinionated Irish woman (both named Alice) and the romance that has kept them afloat for more than a half-century. Amy Conroy, HotForTheater's artistic director, co-stars with Clare Barrett; Ms. Conroy also wrote and directed the piece. Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, irishartscenter.org. (Grode)
'An Iliad' (in previews; opens on March 6 and 7) The Tony-winning actors Denis O'Hare and Stephen Spinella play alternate performances of this new version of Homer's epic poem. Written by Mr. O'Hare and Lisa Peterson, who also directs, the production considers humanity's appetite for violence and destruction, contemplating how little has changed since the Trojan War. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com, nytw.org. (Rooney)
'Jesus Christ Superstar' (previews start on Thursday; opens on March 22) Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's mildly revisionist rock gloss on the Gospels began life as a concept album, a format that the director Des McAnuff knows something about. (He won a Tony for guiding the Who's ''Tommy'' to the stage.) This production earned its share of hosanna hey-sannas at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Canada, where Mr. McAnuff is artistic director. Most of the Stratford cast has remained for the Broadway production, including Josh Young as Judas and Paul Nolan as the title character. Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Grode)
'Make Mine Manhattan' (previews start on Thursday; opens on March 4) Have the last 64 years been kind to this musical, which ran for more than a year in 1948? (Featuring a 20-something Sid Caesar in the cast undoubtedly helped.) UnsungMusicals aims to find out as it puts its theatrical defibrillators to this Big Apple-themed revue, which promises ''struggling actors, disgruntled theater critics and hapless out-of-towners.'' Are there any other kinds? Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Grode)
'Marrying George Clooney: Confessions From a Midlife Crisis' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Thursday) Adapted from Amy Ferris's 2010 memoir of the same name, this three-character play drops in on three menopausal women at 3 a.m. In lieu of sleeping (with or without Mr. Clooney), the women Google old boyfriends, swap prescription drugs online and gripe about their mothers. CAP21 Black Box Theater, 18 West 18th Street, Flatiron district, (866) 811-4111, cap21.org. (Grode)
'Painting Churches' (in previews; opens on March 6) Carl Forsman stages the first New York revival of Tina Howe's 1983 comedy about parent-child relationships and the intersection of life and art. The Keen Company production stars Kathleen Chalfant and John Cunningham as the aging couple preparing to move to a Cape Cod beach house, and Kate Turnbull as the artist daughter who arrives to help them pack and paint their portrait. Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Once' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on March 18) Off Broadway transfers to Broadway are nothing new, and neither are musicals based on successful films, but this is a rare case of both of those phenomena happening at the same time. The scruffy 2006 romance about an Irish busker and a Czech immigrant bonding over music in Dublin has become a musical with the help of its original stars, Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova (who wrote the music and lyrics), as well as John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (the director and the choreographer of ''Black Watch''). Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti star in the central roles. Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Rated P for Parenthood' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) The Bugaboo set gets its own breezy four-actor musical, a la ''Menopause: The Musical'' and ''I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change'' (a long-running hit in this same theater). Child rearing, from the arrival of the stork to the suddenly empty nest, is the topic this time. Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Rutherford & Son' (in previews; opens on Monday) The solid Mint Theater first staged this 1912 family-business drama at a soon-to-be historic time -- September 2001 -- and now gives the play another chance, with some cast members from that production of more than a decade ago. Richard Corley directs the Githa Sowerby play. Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (DeWitt)
'The Total Bent' (opens on Friday) Stew and Heidi Rodewald, the team behind ''Passing Strange,'' are back with this Public Lab presentation of a new musical about what press materials call ''the complicated space between the sacred and the profane,'' explored via the encounter between a black gospel prodigy from the American South and a white music producer from South London. Joanna Settle directs a cast that includes David Cale, William Jackson Harper and Vondie Curtis-Hall. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Rooney)
'Tribes' (in previews; opens on March 4) Acclaimed in its 2010 premiere at the Royal Court Theater in London, Nina Raine's play brings David Cromer back to the same address where he staged his penetrating dissection of ''Our Town.'' His latest project is a provocative comedy about a young man born deaf into a family whose articulacy compounds his isolation. Things change when he begins a relationship with a woman also losing her hearing. The six-member cast features Mare Winningham. Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Rooney)
Broadway
- 'Anything Goes' Kathleen Marshall's zesty revival of Cole Porter's hit-packed musical embodies the essence of escapist entertainment in the 1930s, when hard times called for bold smiles, tough wisecracks and flashy fantasies. Sutton Foster is sensational as the nightclub evangelist Reno Sweeney (2:30). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
- 'The Book of Mormon' This delightful collaboration between the creators of ''South Park'' (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) and the composer of ''Avenue Q'' (Robert Lopez) is blasphemous, scurrilous and as pure-hearted as a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. No musical has so successfully had it both ways since ''The Producers.'' Casey Nicholaw is the witty co-director (with Mr. Parker) and choreographer (2:15). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess' As the fatally conflicted Bess, the extraordinary Audra McDonald is a gale force of emotion in Diane Paulus's slimmed-down musical adaptation of the landmark 1935 opera. Otherwise, despite a likable performance from Norm Lewis as Porgy, this production feels cloudy and mild, only rarely acquiring the majesty of the opera that inspired it (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Godspell' Oh, dear Lord: the beloved 1971 musical that turned biblical parables into teachable moments has been stuffed fruitcake-full of jokey contemporary allusions. Performed by a peppy young cast, the show is like being stuck in a rec room with kids who have been too reckless with the Red Bull (2:30). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying' Nick Jonas plays the amoral hero of Frank Loesser's 1961 musical about corporate ladder-climbing. Rob Ashford directed this largely charm-free revival (2:40). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Other Desert Cities' Jon Robin Baitz's family drama is so good that you may not even realize how good it is while you're watching it. Joe Mantello directs a sublime cast that expertly elicits the pain and the comfort of blood ties: Stockard Channing, Rachel Griffiths, Stacy Keach, Judith Light and Justin Kirk (2:15). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' The 1994 movie about Australian drag queens in the outback becomes a hyperactively splashy karaoke musical so desperate to show the audience a gaudy good time that the results are mostly enervating. Tony Sheldon brings some warmth as the transsexual Bernadette, but the show is mostly a riot of spangles, sequins and silly costumes (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'The Road to Mecca' A quiet, slow and ultimately powerful revival of Athol Fugard's three-character play about the inevitable and necessary apartness of artists. Rosemary Harris is wonderful, a study in subliminal radiance, as an aging South African sculptor under siege from the forces of conventionalism. Jim Dale and Carla Gugino provide strong support in Gordon Edelstein's production (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)
'Seminar' Alan Rickman is a virtuoso of disdain in Theresa Rebeck's shiny, facile comedy about an ego-shredding writing teacher. Full of efficiently mapped reversals, the play feels as if it were written according to the literary equivalent of a GPS device. Sam Gold directs a bright cast that includes Lily Rabe and Hamish Linklater (1:40). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Shatner's World: We Just Live in It ...' William Shatner -- the original Captain Kirk of ''Star Trek,'' later pitchman for Priceline.com -- reflects on his life and career in this often funny, sometimes rambling evening of anecdotes personal and professional. Strictly for Trekkies (1:35). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Sister Act' When the good sisters of the Church of Philly Soul are rocking to raise the Gothic rafters, led by the radiant Patina Miller, all is right with this stage adaptation of the hit movie about a club singer hiding out as a nun. Otherwise, this story of a bad girl teaching some good ones how to get down is innocuous but generic musical theater (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' This retooled mega-expensive musical is no longer an ungodly, indecipherable mess. It's just a bore. Recommended for less-than-precocious children with a hundred dollars to burn (2:45). Foxwoods Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (800) 745-3000, spidermanonbroadway.marvel.com. (Brantley)
- 'Venus in Fur' The incandescent Nina Arianda recreates her dazzling turn as an actress auditioning for the role of a 19th-century dominatrix in David Ives's seriously funny sex comedy about power games at an audition. Hugh Dancy holds his own as the writer-director who may be discovering more than he wants to know about the destabilizing nature of desire (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'War Horse' This imported British weepie, adapted from Michael Morpurgo's children's book about a cavalry horse in World War I, has the most charismatic matinee idol seen in ages: that's Joey, the title character, a puppet brought to life-size life with ineffably theatrical magic (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Wit' Cynthia Nixon gives a large, lucid and delicate performance in this immaculately staged (and inevitably moving) revival of Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama from 1998 about a terminally ill English professor. Lynne Meadow's smart and sensitive production magnifies the play's innate theatricality without compromising the hard emotional truth at its center (1:40). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
Off Broadway
- 'The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs' The accomplished monologuist Mike Daisey weaves the story of the Apple co-founder's life and vision into a darker exploration of the troubling economic disparities that underlie our technology-obsessed age. Smart, engaging and funny, but be warned that you might have second thoughts about purchasing that next shiny gadget (1:50). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Isherwood)
- 'And God Created Great Whales' Rinde Eckert's deeply sentimental, affecting and often funny portrait of an artist -- an opera composer -- in search of his own, rapidly deteriorating memory. Directed by David Schweizer and also starring Nora Cole, this revival of Mr. Eckert's 2000 performance piece uses music, flashcards and ''Moby-Dick'' in a fight against eroding time (1:20). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, cultureproject.org. (Brantley)
'The Berenstain Bears Live! In Family Matters, the Musical' The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are onstage in this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children's book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it's rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday and Sunday only (:55). Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 5 West 63rd Street, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com. (Laurel Graeber)
'Blood Knot' Scott Shepherd (''Gatz'') and Colman Domingo (''The Scottsboro Boys'') play brothers united by blood but divided by skin color in Athol Fugard's play about the brutalities of apartheid and, more universally, the way pernicious social forces can warp identity. Directed by the playwright himself, this first production in the Signature's season devoted to his work is more intellectually stimulating than emotionally engaging (2:30). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'The Broken Heart' Selina Cartmell's gloom-shrouded production of this rarely staged tragedy by John Ford features a fine cast, but the air of woe foretold is so thick that it's hard to engage with the twisted tale of love and retribution (2:45). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, new42.org. (Isherwood)
'Chekhovek' This dramatization of nine Chekhov short stories is proficiently acted and directed, yet often more intriguing in theory than in execution (2:00). ArcLight Theater, 152 West 71st Street, (866) 811-4111, chekhovek.com. (Ken Jaworowski)
'CQ/CX' The playwright Gabe McKinley, a former news assistant at The New York Times, turns the newspaper's 2003 Jayson Blair scandal into a cautionary take of deceit, ambition and hubris. The play, briskly staged by David Leveaux for Atlantic Theater Company, has some insider details, but the work doesn't go much beyond the compelling narrative of a major journalistic fraud (2:15). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Frank Rizzo)
'The Devil's Music: The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith' Miche Braden plays the bawdy-talking, hooch-swilling Bessie Smith in this show that mixes Smith's songs with talk about her life, loves and career. That format seems a bit tired, but Ms. Braden gives it her all (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'Early Plays' The weary sameness of life at sea, according to the young Eugene O'Neill, interpreted in a steady monotone by the avant-garde auteur Richard Maxwell. This willfully flat collaboration between Mr. Maxwell's New York City Players and the Wooster Group has occasional moments of melodrama-subverting clarity and more than occasional longueurs (1:30). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Brantley)
- 'How I Learned to Drive' A first-rate revival of Paula Vogel's Pulitzer Prize winner. With Norbert Leo Butz and Elizabeth Reaser playing a predatory uncle and his precocious niece, one of the most discomfiting love stories in the American theater returns after 15 years with its power to rattle and stir undiluted. Kate Whoriskey directs (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Brantley)
- 'The Inexplicable Redemption of Agent G' The pop-culture-drunk artists of Vampire Cowboys deliver an Asian exploitation drama that manages to be serious without sacrificing any silliness (1:30). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)
'Look Back in Anger' Sam Gold's stylized staging of John Osborne's 1956 drama about a working-class lad with the weight of a stifling social system on his shoulders wins points for ingenuity -- the stage is about three feet deep -- but in the crucial central role, Matthew Rhys (television's ''Brothers and Sisters'') never locates the genuine pain beneath the surface rage (2:10). Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 352-3101, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Poetic License' The vengeful young man in Jack Canfora's disturbing new drama makes Neil LaBute's manipulative misogynists look like sweethearts. This one-act play can be abrupt and not totally credible at times, but it is thought-provoking (1:20). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Anita Gates)
'Rent' Maybe they should call it ''Sublet.'' The young cast members who inhabit this premature revival of Jonathan Larson's watershed rock opera from 1996, directed by Michael Greif, never seem to feel truly at home. It is as if they're reluctant to make this show their own (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Richard III' Kevin Spacey entertainingly out-acts everybody onstage in Sam Mendes's valedictory production for the Anglo-American Bridge Project. Say what you will about Mr. Spacey's histrionic excesses, he provides a sustained (and intelligent) interpretation as Shakespeare's murderous crookback. The same cannot be said of Mr. Mendes's staging, a grab bag of postmodern gimmicks (3:00). Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Brantley)
'Russian Transport' Janeane Garofalo plays it straight, more or less, in Erika Sheffer's dark drama about the corrupting influence of a new Russian immigrant (the excellent Morgan Spector) on a Brooklyn family (2:10). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
- 'Rx' Kate Fodor's play about an affair between a work-weary editor (Marin Hinkle) and a pharmaceutical researcher (Stephen Kunken) is an engaging blend of gentle satire on our overprescribed culture and classic romantic comedy. Ethan McSweeny's sprightly production features fun supporting turns from Marylouise Burke and Elizabeth Rich (1:40). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (Isherwood)
'Silence! The Musical' A silly, coarse musical spin on ''The Silence of the Lambs'' as pitched to obsessive fans (1:30). 9th Space Theater at Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, silencethemusical.com. (Zinoman)
'Sistas: The Musical' The script is obvious, covering virtually every issue that might touch the lives of black women, but Dorothy Marcic's good-natured, low-budget musical is all about the songs. From ''Ain't Nobody's Business if I Do'' to ''Single Ladies,'' you could do a lot worse (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Gates)
'Sleep No More' Punchdrunk, a British site-specific theater company, has taken over three abandoned warehouses to enact the sorry sights of the murderous Macbeths' career as a movable orgy. The result suggests what might have happened if Stanley Kubrick (of ''The Shining'') had designed the Haunted Mansion at Disney World (2:00). The McKittrick Hotel, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, sleepnomorenyc.com. (Brantley)
'Traces' An energizing evening of acrobatics from the Montreal troupe Seven Fingers. Think of it as cirque du cabaret, in which a group of distinctive talents gets to show off the physical equivalents of individual song stylings (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Voca People' This show features space aliens, but it's really all about a cappella music. The visitors have crash-landed on Earth in a ship powered by music, and lots of singing must be done to refuel their ship. The eight singers sound pretty good, but most of the show consists of fragments of songs, which becomes annoying; only when the cast is allowed to cut loose and deliver an entire song -- the Doors' ''People Are Strange'' is a highlight -- do things reach their full potential (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Yosemite' Daniel Talbot's stormy dysfunctional family drama never entirely coheres persuasively (1:20). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Zinoman)
Off Off Broadway
- 'Bad Kid' It's the characters that stand out in this endearing solo show about growing up gay and goth in Texas (1:10). Axis Theater, 1 Sheridan Square, near Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com. (Zinoman)
'Growing Up Gonzales' This one-man play about a Nuyorican family in the 1970s is part stand-up, part melodrama and part cultural tourism. Andres Chulisi Rodriguez alternates between playing two brothers: Cisco, the sweet-natured, slow younger brother, who we learn at the outset has recently died; and Johnny, the thuggish older sibling, who has discovered Cisco's journals after his brother's death. Quiet Cisco, it turns out, was quite the storyteller and has colorfully recreated the tragedies and farces of their fatherless childhood, including ridiculous stories about shoplifting raw chickens and imitating Bruce Lee (1:30). Jan Hus Playhouse, 351 East 74th Street, (212) 811-4111, growingupgonzales.com. (Catherine Rampell)
'I Killed My Mother' Andras Visky's bleak and insightful drama explores the hard-shelled, protective fantasies of Romanian orphans brought up in state institutions. Karin Coonrod's stark, poetic production is performed with feral fierceness by Andrew Hampton Livingston and the uncanny Melissa Lorraine Hawkins (1:30). La MaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org. (Brantley)
'Mama, I Want to Sing' A largely new cast (seeded from the Gospel for Teens program in Harlem) gives full-throated life to this long-running gospel musical. Quibbles about the thin plot and questionable acting go out the window with each and every tune -- and there are plenty of them. Saturday only (2:00). The Dempsey Theater, 127 West 127th Street, Harlem, (212) 868-4444, mamafoundation.org. (Grode)
'That Ain't No Lady' The doyenne of New York's now-defunct annual outdoor drag festival, Wigstock, Lady Bunny purveys bawdy stand-up and pornographic pop song parodies in her first new cabaret act in 10 years. Looking like Dusty Springfield on steroids and introduced ''direct from the Port Authority men's room,'' the Lady and her show are definitely not for the prudish. But anyone feeling nostalgic for the seedy old days before Times Square became a tourist-friendly theme park will get a kick out of this evening of big hair and bad manners. Tuesday only (1:30). La Escuelita Cabaret Theater, 301 West 39th Street, (212) 631-0588, brownpapertickets.com. (Rooney)
- 'These Seven Sicknesses' Over the course of this ambitious adaptation of Sophocles' seven surviving plays, blood erupts from just about every orifice, onto just about every article of clothing and just about every square inch of the narrow stage. Sophocles purists may not be happy with some of the changes, but in the end this gory five-hour production -- which includes breaks for a pan-Asian dinner and dessert -- remains vibrant, entertaining and fresh. That's no small feat considering its marathon length and 2,400-year-old roots (5:00). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-2407, theflea.org. (Rampell)

Last Chance
'Botanica' (closes on Saturday) Georgia O'Keeffe would take one look at the randy flora in this oddball drama and faint. There's plenty to look at in Jim Findlay and Jeff Jackson's absurdly lush juxtaposition of scientific jargon with botanical make-out sessions, but Mr. Findlay's rigorous direction nearly makes sense of the whole crackpot scenario (1:30). 3LD Art & Technology Center, 80 Greenwich Street, at Rector Street, Lower Manhattan, (800) 838-3006, 3ldnyc.org, thisisbotanica.com. (Grode)
- 'Disaster!' (closes on Sunday) This delightful jukebox musical, a mash-up of disaster-movie cliches from the 1970s and that decade's cheesiest pop hits (and there were so many), could have been D.J.'d by Irwin Allen. If you belong to its target demographic -- that is, you spent the '70s at the drive-in and listening to Casey Kasem's ''American Top 40'' -- it's irresistible. Sunday only (2:00). The Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 362-2590, disastermusical.com. (Andy Webster)
'The History of the World' (closes on Saturday) Judith Malina, 85 and still the unsinkable life force behind the venerable downtown avant-garde troupe the Living Theater, instigates another rebellion with this exuberant, dizzying flight through the course of Western civilization, peppered with political observations. It's never dull, but the audience participation may deter some viewers. Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-0255, livingtheatre.org. (Webster)
'Ionescopade' (closes on Sunday) A broad revival of this 1974 comic revue, which sets Ionesco's absurdist plays to music, is a sampling menu for his fans (2:00). York Theater at St. Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820, yorktheatre.org. (Zinoman)
'Leave the Balcony Open' (closes on Sunday) The playwright Maya Macdonald and the director Jessica Bauman delve into the aftermath of loss in this hopelessly self-conscious, turgid production. And they remind us: as petty traumas go, there are few things worse than bad theater (1:35). 3LD Art & Technology Center, 80 Greenwich Street, at Rector Street, Lower Manhattan, (866) 811-4111, 3ldnyc.org. (Claudia La Rocco)
'Lost on the Natchez Trace' (closes on Sunday) A play about a wounded slave auctioneer whose life suddenly rests in the hands of the slave he just sold should crackle and flare with fury, passion, vengeance, despair. But this production never reaches its flash point, instead meandering for about an hour before finally mustering up a little bit of energy. Even the characters, despite their high-stakes situation, seem kind of bored with Jan Buttram's bloated script and Kate Bushmann's forced direction (1:30). Dorothy Strelsin Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-2055, abingdontheatre.org. (Rampell)

'Myths and Hymns' (closes on Sunday) Elizabeth Lucas's luminous staging of Adam Guettel's elegiac song cycle turns Mr. Guettel's richly melodic songs of yearning and transcendence into reflections on the loves and losses of a New England family. Well sung by a cast of six, led by Linda Balgord as the matriarch beset by ghosts from the past (1:20). West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101, prospecttheater.org. (Isherwood)
'Psycho Therapy' (closes on Saturday) This farce by Frank Strausser about couples counseling for a Los Angeles woman and her two lovers shows sparks on occasion, especially when Angelica Page as Lily and Jeffrey Carlson as her younger, rich ex-boyfriend, go at each other, either fighting or making up. But even a farce requires more than stereotypes, and beyond its uneven pacing and contrived outcome, the play never truly cares about any of its characters (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, cherrylanetheatre.org. (Daniel M. Gold)
'Stick Fly' (closes on Sunday) Lydia R. Diamond's overstuffed but lively comedy-drama feels like a Tyler Perry melodrama (sans Madea) as revised by an academic specializing in issues of class in African-American culture. Condola Rashad gives the standout performance in the director Kenny Leon's uneven production, playing a young woman who embodies the problems of racial and class divisions that the other characters theorize about (2:15). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'The Ugly One' (closes on Sunday) Marius von Mayenburg's absurdist comedy bluntly satirizes the superficiality of contemporary culture and the slipperiness of identity. When an engineer deficient in looks (Alfredo Narciso) is transformed into a super-hunk by plastic surgery, he begins to lose his grip on his sense of self, especially when he starts meeting his own face on every other street corner (1:00). Soho Rep, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (866) 811-4111, sohorep.org. (Isherwood)

HEADLINE: The Methanol Alternative to Gasoline

BYLINE: By TOM RIDGE and MARY E. PETERS. 
Tom Ridge, a former governor of Pennsylvania, was secretary of homeland security from 2003 to 2005. Mary E. Peters was secretary of transportation from 2006 to 2009. They are members of the United States Energy Security Council.

 BODY:
PRESIDENT Obama recently called the United States the ''Saudi Arabia of natural gas'' and asserted that it was time for our oil-dominated transportation fuel market to open the door to natural gas. He's right. It would be cheaper for consumers and reduce the strategic importance of oil. But first we need cars that can run on methanol, a high-octane fuel made from converted natural gas.
We're producing more natural gas these days than we can use, thanks to new techniques to extract gas from shale. A recent report from the M.I.T. Energy Initiative, ''The Future of Natural Gas,'' called methanol ''the liquid fuel that is most efficiently and inexpensively produced from natural gas.'' China has already taken notice. Automakers there, like Chery, Geely and Shanghai Maple, have all introduced vehicles capable of running on methanol. Indeed, methanol is so much less costly per mile than gasoline that illegal fuel blending is rampant in China. 
Unfortunately, most cars sold in the United States offer consumers no choice beyond gasoline. The so-called flex fuel vehicles that are now on the market are warranted to operate only on gasoline and ethanol. If Congress were to enact an open fuel standard that required new cars to be warranted to run on all-alcohol fuels, including methanol, natural gas could compete with oil in the liquid fuels market. Producing these cars would cost about $100 more. And these fuels could be distributed through the current refueling infrastructure with only slight retrofits.
The current global spot price for methanol made from natural gas is $1.13 per gallon, without any subsidy. Methanol produces about half the energy per gallon as gasoline, so you need to burn twice as much to go just as far. But it is still cheaper than gas. It would cost approximately $3 today, including taxes, distribution and retail markup, to travel the same distance on methanol as on a gallon of gasoline, according to calculations by the Methanol Institute, a cost that is well below the current national average for gasoline. If the economics of natural gas change, a flex fuel vehicle could still run on methanol made from coal, biomass and possibly recycled carbon dioxide, if that technology proves economical.
Natural gas can also play other roles in the transportation sector. It can be used to generate electricity to charge the plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles that have entered the market. And it natural gas prices were to spike, there is always coal, nuclear or renewable power to rely upon for power generation. (Today, only 1 percent of the electricity in the United States is generated from oil.) Still, mass-market penetration of plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles will take some time, because of the high cost of automotive batteries.
Another way to run cars on natural gas is by using compressed natural gas, or C.N.G. These vehicles require a dedicated fuel line and a large gas canister in the trunk. However, the cost of converting a light-duty vehicle to C.N.G. is over $10,000. Such an upfront cost would be reasonable in high mileage users (over 35,000 miles per year) like taxis, buses and garbage trucks, but is too high for a typical car owner, and the return on investment would take many years, even with current low natural gas prices.
America is rich in natural gas and coal, but this is meaningless in terms of energy and economic security as long as our cars are unable to run on fuels made from these domestic commodities. Consumers should have a choice in the cost and type of fuel their vehicles require.

HEADLINE: On Hollywood's Night to Shine, Red Carpet Time For Ads, Too

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THIS is one of those years when the public may be more familiar with the brands sponsoring the Academy Awards than the movies vying for best picture. Still, Madison Avenue is in a hooray-for-Hollywood mood, offering several reasons buying commercial time makes sense, despite an absence of huge hits among the nominees that suggests the ratings on Sunday could be lower than when blockbusters like ''Avatar'' or ''Titanic'' were contenders.
In fact, one sponsor, Diet Coke, will run a spot, by Wieden & Kennedy, that uses a version of the song ''Hooray for Hollywood'' on the soundtrack. In the spot, which is scheduled to be shown twice, Diet Coke is celebrated as the fuel for those behind the scenes who make movies, among them scriptwriters, stunt performers and sound effects artists. 
''The Oscars remains one of the very few high-impact programs when people are watching live,'' said William White, group brand director for Diet Coke and Coke Zero at Coca-Cola North America, part of the Coca-Cola Company.
''It's still appointment television,'' he added. ''We want to be there.''
Amplifying the impact is what is being called the second-screen phenomenon, whereby people watching live TV events are simultaneously interacting with friends and family on blogs, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
For instance, ''Diet Coke will be tweeting from the show,'' Mr. White said, to those who follow the brand's Twitter feed.
Beth Hirschhorn, chief marketing officer for another sponsor, MetLife, echoed Mr. White.
''Programming like this isn't just about volume,'' said Ms. Hirschhorn, referring to total viewership. ''It's about how deeply engaged consumers are while watching.''
''Many viewers tune in and watch from start to finish,'' she added, and when that happens, ''research tells us that message recall and comprehension are stronger.''
MetLife will run a commercial, by the MDC Partners agency Crispin Porter & Bogusky, that carries the theme ''MetLife. I can do this.'' It is part of a campaign that MetLife introduced during Super Bowl XLVI on NBC on Feb. 5 and continued during the Grammy Awards on CBS on Feb. 12.
Among the other blue-chip sponsors of the 84th Academy Awards, to be broadcast by ABC, are American Express, Anheuser-Busch InBev, AT&T, Walt Disney, Hyundai Motor America, Johnson & Johnson, Kraft Foods, McDonald's, Paramount Pictures, J.C. Penney, Procter & Gamble, Samsung and Sprint.
Samsung seems to believe the Oscars are so nice that it will be there twice, in the form of Samsung Electronics (Smart TV) and Samsung Telecommunications (Samsung Galaxy Note).
Another reason marketers like the Academy Awards is that ''it makes a statement'' to advertise ''in a show of that kind of stature,'' said Andy Goeler, vice president for imports, crafts and specialties at the Anheuser-Busch division of Anheuser-Busch InBev, which plans to run a new commercial for Stella Artois beer by the Mother agency.
''Our consumer base is sophisticated,'' Mr. Goeler said of Stella Artois, ''and a platform like the Academy Awards aligns perfectly with that audience, a sophisticated, upscale audience.''
Hyundai Motor America intends to devote four of the seven commercials it is to run during the show -- all of them by the Innocean Worldwide Americas agency -- to a luxury model, the 2012 Azera sedan, that with a sticker price of around $32,000 is aimed at the affluent viewers of the Oscars. Two Azera spots were directed by an Oscar nominee, the movie director Wes Anderson, and all seven spots are narrated by an Oscar winner, the actor Jeff Bridges.
The types of people who watch the Academy Awards also make the show appealing to marketers that want to burnish their images with an audience that includes many so-called influencers, whose perceptions are important in shaping brand image.
For example, of the two commercials that McDonald's will run, both by the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, one is part of a series that salutes the farmers who supply the company with ingredients like lettuce.
''Customers more and more are interested in the food they eat,'' said Neil Golden, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at McDonald's, and ''we want to make sure we tell the story of the care and attention we take in every step'' of making menu items.
''The Academy Awards audience is a fabulous audience,'' Mr. Golden said. ''There is an opportunity with high-profile programming to better engage consumers with the brand.''
The other McDonald's commercial, which is new, offers a twist on the old game of ''He loves me, he loves me not,'' courtesy of a couple of boxes of the chain's French fries.
''The movies are about storytelling,'' said Marlena Peleo-Lazar, chief creative officer at McDonald's, ''and the advertising we do tells a story.''
Social media make ''our ability to engage in a conversation'' about those stories easier, she added.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences seeks to ensure that the atmosphere of the show will appeal to the kinds of viewers the sponsors seek. The academy limits the number of commercials and network promotions that ABC can run each hour of the show.
And the academy reviews the contents of each spot for acceptability, separate from the scrutiny of the standards and practices department at ABC.
As a result, the types of racy commercials that raised eyebrows during the Super Bowl, for advertisers like Go Daddy and Teleflora, are about as likely to appear during the Oscars as a little-known nominee like ''The Tree of Life'' is to win best picture.

HEADLINE: Sound Rule, With a Serious Flaw

 BODY:
A year ago, we praised the Obama Treasury Department for championing a new rule to protect vulnerable Americans from rapacious creditors. Before the rule is finalized, the administration must fix a provision that could still cause severe hardships. 
The law bars creditors from seizing Social Security payments and other federal benefits for veterans, the poor, the aged and the disabled. But banks often said they could not determine the source of customers' deposits and allowed creditors to garnish accounts containing federal funds. The new rule adds electronic tags to automatically deposited government payments and requires banks to protect tagged deposits made in the prior two months.
Here's the issue: The new rule will still allow seizure of all funds in an account if a state is trying to collect unpaid child support. That may seem to be a good way to get tough on deadbeat dads, but it will cause undue harm.
In a letter to the commissioner of Social Security, the National Consumer Law Center and 72 other advocacy groups pointed out that 70 percent of uncollected child support is owed by people who live below the poverty line and much of the debt arose because support obligations were not revised when the debtor became disabled, unemployed or incarcerated. Since the debts are often old, the amounts have been inflated by interest and penalties.
To both collect the debts and avoid driving these debtors into complete destitution, the law allows Social Security to withhold up to 65 percent of a benefit to cover unpaid child support -- and to pay the recipient the rest. Recipients of reduced benefits have been able to shield the remainder by receiving their payment via paper check and simply cashing it. Starting next year, all government benefits will be automatically deposited. If the rule is not amended, the full amount will be subject to seizure.
The way to fix the problem is to rework the garnishment rule so that it treats child support debts the same way it treats other debts. Fixing the rule would not excuse nonpayment of child support. Rather, it would achieve what the law intended by ensuring that no one is impoverished by ruthless debt collection.

HEADLINE: In a Gamble For Cash, Sears Plans To Sell Stores

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
Sears Holdings moved on Thursday to allay fears that it could run low on cash this year, announcing plans to sell stores in transactions that the company says could raise nearly $800 million.
But the deals also highlight the major challenges that Sears faces as it tries to stop a multiyear slump in its operations, analysts said.
Sears may be giving up its most profitable stores in exchange for a quick cash infusion today. In one of the transactions, Sears also expects current shareholders to foot the bill, potentially leaving them more exposed to the troubled retailer. 
''As a matter of fact, spinoffs like these could leave Sears with a very unprofitable core Sears U.S. business,'' said Mary Ross Gilbert, an analyst with Imperial Capital, a brokerage firm.
These moves come as the company's largest investor, its chairman, Edward S. Lampert, has been increasing his personal stake in the company. Mr. Lampert engineered the merger of Kmart and Sears, Roebuck, in a $11 billion deal in late 2004, and his hedge funds now own 61 percent of the stock.
The price of Sears shares jumped 18.7 percent on Thursday, to $61.80, even as the company reported weak financial results.
For the year, Sears reported a loss of $3.14 billion, a number that included $2.7 billion of charges, compared with a profit of $133 million for 2010. The fourth quarter had a $2.44 billion loss, compared with a profit of $382 million the previous year.
The company also reported an annual decline in revenue, its fifth in a row. Such trends are a stark reminder that Sears's problems have deepened since it came under Mr. Lampert's control.
Critics say that under Mr. Lampert the company has not spent enough to update its stores and that now, in the face of intense competition, Sears is in danger of permanently falling out of shoppers' favor.
In a letter to shareholders, Mr. Lampert said: ''We made it through the financial crisis and the housing crisis. Now we intend to make it through our current challenges and restore confidence in the company.''
As Sears's problems have persisted, all eyes are on its cash flows as investors weigh its chances of survival. The company tacitly acknowledged the attention on its cash on Thursday.
It does not normally hold conference calls to discuss financial results, but Lou D'Ambrosio, Sears's chief executive, said one of the reasons it did so after the latest earnings release was ''to make our funding strategy clear.''
Sears's operations were most likely a drain on cash last year, said Ms. Ross Gilbert.
Sears said it had $277 million of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. But Ms. Ross Gilbert said that excluded $383 million of cash contributions to its pensions. Including that would put Ebitda deep in negative territory. And if Sears's top line continues to decline, the loss could be even deeper this year.
Analysts are also keeping an eye on Sears's suppliers, as well as the companies, called factors, that make cash advances to the suppliers based on the goods they sell to Sears. If vendors and factors become wary of Sears's creditworthiness, the retailer may have to pay suppliers cash upfront for goods, which could be a huge drain on liquidity.
''The focus of the call was for the vendors, and steps taken were all focused on near-term cash generation,'' said Gary Balter, a retail analyst with Credit Suisse.
But Sears also has sizable cash sources. It had about $2.5 billion available on two credit lines at the end of January, though the company may draw much of that this fall as it spends large amounts stocking its stores ahead of the holidays.
This is where the property sales announced Thursday become important. If they all occur, and Sears succeeds in cutting costs and slashing inventory, the company could have a sizable cash cushion in the fall. That would bolster confidence and perhaps persuade suppliers not to demand upfront cash payments for their goods.
One of the asset sales appears to be in the bag. General Growth Properties, a mall operator, has agreed to buy 11 Sears properties, which will raise $270 million.
However, the other deal - which aims to raise as much as $500 million and is slated for later this year - is less straightforward. In effect, Sears aims to sell its smaller Hometown and Outlet stores to any interested Sears shareholders. The company said Mr. Lampert's hedge funds expected to participate and exercise their rights in full.
But the danger is that Sears may be selling some of its best properties, which could mean even worse operating results in the future. On the conference call on Thursday, a Sears executive declined to say what proportion of its stores was profitable.
The outgoing Hometown and Outlet stores were profitable last year, producing as much as $80 million of Ebitda, Sears said.
The big question now is how many more of these types of sales Sears could do. More than 120 properties cannot be sold because they are effectively locked in an insurance subsidiary. Others may be harder to sell because they are in less attractive malls.
Furthermore, agreements with Sears's creditors may contain restrictions on assets sales. A Sears spokeswoman said, ''The domestic credit agreement contains customary limitations on asset sales.'' But she added, ''We do not believe our debt agreements place material restrictions on us that would prevent us from taking value-adding actions, such as those announced today.''
At any rate, Ms. Ross Gilbert expects the cash-raising measures to alleviate the concerns of Sears's suppliers for now. But she added, ''They basically buy Sears another year.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Nod to Gas Prices, Obama Talks About Energy

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
MIAMI -- President Obama, confronted by the political perils of surging gas prices in an election year, on Thursday defended his efforts to wean the United States off imported oil, even as he conceded there was little he could do in the short run to ease the pain at the pump.
Speaking to students at the University of Miami, in a swing state where gas averages $3.69 a gallon, Mr. Obama said: ''Just like last year, gas prices are climbing across the country; this time, it's happening even earlier. And when gas prices go up, it hurts everybody.'' 
The president offered what he called an ''all-of-the-above'' response, based on more domestic oil production, development of alternative energy sources and stricter fuel-efficiency standards.
Drawing a sharp contrast with Republicans and anticipating potential attacks on the campaign trail, Mr. Obama ridiculed his opponents for recycling a ''three-point plan for $2 gas.''
''Step one is to drill, and step two is to drill, and then step three is to keep drilling,'' he said.
This was the president's first major effort to tackle an issue that has surfaced in the last few weeks as oil prices have been driven up by tensions in the Middle East, where Iran has threatened to retaliate against the West because of sanctions over its nuclear program.
Mr. Obama seemed keenly aware of the risk posed by oil prices. A previous cycle of price increases played briefly to the benefit of Senator John McCain during the 2008 campaign, when his running mate, Sarah Palin, revved up crowds with the chant, ''drill, baby, drill.''
The president said that the United States is producing more oil now than at any time during the last eight years, with a record number of rigs pumping. The White House, he said, was prepared to open new areas in the Arctic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico to exploration.
But Mr. Obama warned that no amount of domestic production could offset the broader forces driving up gas prices, chief among them Middle East instability and the ravenous energy appetite of China, which he said added 10 million cars in 2010.
''Anybody who tells you we can drill our way out of this problem doesn't know what they're talking about, or just isn't telling you the truth,'' he said to whoops from the crowd of nearly 1,500.
Mr. Obama's remarks, tinged with humor and sarcasm, were bluntly political, on a trip that included fund-raising events in Miami and Orlando. But his message was sober: neither he nor anyone else can do much about oil prices, which he said were likely to keep rising.
The White House contends that the public has grown accustomed to these periodic spikes and will credit him for speaking honestly about the underlying economic realities rather than offering ''gimmicky'' fixes -- something he eschewed in 2008.
Still, with gasoline prices nationally about 12 percent higher than a year ago, Democratic political analysts believe Mr. Obama needs to get ahead of the issue quickly. Newt Gingrich, for example promised this week to bring gas down to $2.50 a gallon.
''Four dollars per gallon has typically been the tipping point when people go from complacency to exasperation,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, who notes that people have begun mentioning gas prices with increasing urgency in his focus groups.
Gas prices did not figure prominently in the Republican debate on Wednesday in Arizona, where the candidates trained most of their fire on one another. But Republicans in Congress criticized Mr. Obama for not opening more federal land to exploration, and for not approving the Keystone XL pipeline.
''The president would like everyone to forget that gas prices have doubled over the past three years while he consistently blocked and slowed the production of American-made energy,'' a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner, Brendan Buck, said in a statement.
Even Mr. Obama, they noted, once referred to his ''all-of-the-above'' policy as a ''hodgepodge.''
Among Mr. Obama's proposals are opening 75 percent of the nation's offshore oil and natural gas resources by 2017; fuel-economy and emissions standards for trucks, vans and buses; and an administration effort to prevent bottlenecks in the oil market.
Michael Levi, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said, ''Any effective energy policy is almost inevitably going to be a hodgepodge.'' He credited the president with stimulating production, though he said the rejection of Keystone sent a weak signal.
The American Petroleum Institute, the industry's lobbying group, said Mr. Obama had restricted opportunities to produce more oil by shortening leases and slowing permit approvals.
The president fired back, repeating his demand that Congress end subsidies for the oil and gas industries.
''It's outrageous,'' he said. ''Every politician who's been fighting to keep these subsidies in place should explain to the American people why the oil industry needs more of their money.''
None of Mr. Obama's proposals were new, and some were aspirational. He said gasoline and diesel produced from algae could replace up to 17 percent of imported oil. But experts say such fuel is a long way from being commercially viable on that scale.
Joking that he once bought a car for $500, Mr. Obama said that because of new fuel-economy standards, new cars will average nearly 55 miles per gallon by the middle of the next decade.
Mr. Obama struck his own inadvertent blow for fuel economy, by flying to Florida on a Boeing 757 rather than a 747. The bigger 747, which usually serves as Air Force One, was in the shop.

HEADLINE: Resolute Putin Faces a Russia That's Changed

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- A guest hovering around the doorway of an elegant restaurant last fall glimpsed a ritual worthy of a czar.
Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin stopped in his tracks, eyes ahead, arms hovering at his sides. An aide materialized, silently whisked away Mr. Putin's parka, and vanished. A second aide appeared with a sport jacket and slipped it over his shoulders. Then Mr. Putin resumed walking without a word or a look, ''almost as if he had never stopped,'' noted the guest, Clifford G. Gaddy, an American scholar.
Mr. Putin, who grew up in a hardscrabble Soviet housing block, has spent more than a decade in a byzantine world of petitioners and servants. Now, in the year he turns 60, he will face his biggest challenge: coming to grips with a society that has greatly changed under his watch, while he has remained essentially the same.
Mr. Putin now seems assured of a convincing victory in the first round of the presidential election on March 4, making a runoff unnecessary. The emerging threat to his rule has slid beneath the surface. But it will follow him across the six years of his third presidential term, as he will be forced to respond to a populace beginning to demand more of a stake in the governing of Russia. 
With his once phenomenal popularity gradually waning, Mr. Putin will have to find other ways to guarantee his legitimacy.
Olga V. Kryshtanovskaya, a member of Mr. Putin's United Russia party who is assisting his campaign, said Mr. Putin risked upheaval in the coming years if he did not return as a more democratic leader. His reflexes, she said, are authoritarian; if he chooses a liberal path, it will be ''with his intellect, and not with his heart, and under pressure, because he is afraid.''
''In the end he will decide alone and that's it,'' she said. ''Alone. And we are all waiting.''
On Thursday, Mr. Putin made a surprise appearance at a campaign rally. According to police estimates, 130,000 people jammed into Luzhniki Stadium, waving signs with messages like ''Putin, the path to the future'' and ''We don't want revolution'' and ''There is no alternative.'' When Mr. Putin stepped onto the stage -- a small figure in a black parka -- the atmosphere in the stadium seemed to twitch, and he was met with a sustained roar of approval.
The pomp cannot obscure the fact that Mr. Putin, who served eight years as president and four as prime minister, is embarking on his final act as Russia's leader. A banker close to Mr. Putin advised him in a recent article not to extend his rule after this six-year term, commenting that ''in the opinion of many people, it is not simply a very long time, it is too long.'' In 2008, the Constitution was amended to lengthen the presidential term to six years from four.
New tasks are at hand, like searching for a trusted person to whom Mr. Putin can eventually transfer his authority, just as Boris N. Yeltsin did with Mr. Putin 12 years ago.
''He understands that if he can make it through now -- to become president in the first round -- that it will be an event, a feat,'' said Andrei Kolesnikov, who covers Mr. Putin for the newspaper Kommersant. ''And that he cannot repeat this feat in six years. As far as politics are concerned, those six years will be spent on his project of creating a second party and in a search for a new successor.''
Others say openly that Mr. Putin may not be able to hold on to power for the full six years. Among them is the television host Kseniya Sobchak, who has had a warm relationship with Mr. Putin since she was 11 and he worked for her father, then the mayor of St. Petersburg.
''My forecast is the following: The regime we have now cannot last six years,'' said Ms. Sobchak, who has joined the protest movement. If Mr. Putin ignores complaints from the opposition, she said, ''this movement will pick up force and eventually it may lead to quite tragic events, like revolution or a coup.''
''I want you to understand that I don't want it to happen,'' she added. ''I just realize that this Titanic will hit an iceberg if it doesn't change course.''
It is difficult, now, to recall Mr. Putin as he was in 1999 -- a 47-year-old former K.G.B. officer so unremarkable that journalists sent to interview his old friends in St. Petersburg returned with notebooks full of adjectives like ''reserved'' and ''polite.'' He could barely muster a smile when the news broke that Mr. Yeltsin had chosen him as his successor, murmuring in a television interview that ''it would be impolite to disagree if the president said this.''
The Yeltsin team was facing a political train wreck: ''Czar Boris'' was miserably unpopular, his approval ratings had been in single digits for a year and he feared he would face corruption charges when he stepped down. Exhausted and sick, Mr. Yeltsin, 68, left office six months early, hoping to give his protege a leg up ahead of the election.
What happened then was a kind of magic. Mr. Putin dislikes political campaigns -- he recently described them as a ''very disgusting process'' -- but he had an uncanny ability to channel the thoughts of ordinary Russians, beaten down by economic stagnation and a grinding, bloody standoff with separatists in Chechnya. Natalia Gevorkyan, who interviewed him at that time for the book ''First Person,'' said he could ''take on the form of the person he is speaking to,'' perhaps a legacy from his days as a K.G.B. officer trained to recruit informants.
Mr. Putin, who grew up brawling with bullies in postwar Leningrad, came across as tough and crude and efficient, vowing that his forces would chase down the Chechen rebels and ''wipe them out in the outhouse.'' His approval rating rose to 27 percent from 2 percent in a single month, with 70 percent of Russians saying they trusted him.
Mr. Putin says he sees those months as the time that made him the common people's leader. Meeting with ironworkers last summer, he shared a rare expression of regret, saying he was initially ashamed of using gutter language. But then a friend passed on the approval of an anonymous taxi driver -- a kind of Russian Joe Six-pack -- and that approval, Mr. Putin said, meant more to him than the gasps of globe-trotting elites.
''What I blurted out was probably wrong in form, but in essence it was right,'' he said. ''And I think we should act on this basis -- on the basis of decency, above all.''
In 2010, Mr. Putin's approval ratings were hovering around 80 percent, and Kremlin insiders began to see his popularity as the ballast of the entire political system. Mr. Putin's public persona -- salty language, tiger-stalking, shirtless fly-fishing -- was his own creation, said his press spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, in a recent interview, adding that Mr. Putin's ''instincts are much stronger than any possible advice from any adviser.''
Gleb O. Pavlovsky, a political consultant who lost his government contract in a dispute with the Kremlin last year, said advisers had become afraid to warn Mr. Putin away from missteps.
''There are many things you cannot even speak to Putin about these days,'' Mr. Pavlovsky said. ''These are absurd things they would have discussed, and advised him not to do, and now clearly no one can talk that way.''
The mistakes accumulated, underlining the gap that had opened between the leader and his country's growing urban middle class.
There was his dismissal of online political activism in 2010 -- just as Russia was overtaking Germany as Europe's largest Internet market -- on the grounds that the Internet was ''50 percent pornographic material.'' There was a staged retrieval of ancient amphorae from six feet of water, which met with widespread ridicule. The September announcement of his intention to return to the presidency, now held by his ally Dmitri A. Medvedev, backfired, and after huge crowds protested parliamentary election violations in December, chanting, ''Putin, go away,'' there was his odd, derisive remark that the white ribbons demonstrators wore looked like limp condoms.
Aleksandr Baunov, in a recent essay for the magazine Slon, said even Mr. Putin's extraordinary public speaking -- he called him the ''Cicero of the people'' -- had lost the power to make Russians listen.
''He polemicizes well, but silently avoids the main point: why he seized the rostrum and considered it his own,'' he wrote. ''The seizure of the rostrum may be interesting, from a historical point of view, but certainly not the speech itself. It is not interesting to listen to an orator who has seized the rostrum.''
At Thursday's rally, Mr. Putin held the crowd in thrall one more time, enunciating the words of a lyric poem with such ferocity that they bounced off the bleachers a football field away. He walked off the stage, head bowed, between columns of shouting admirers. Mr. Peskov, his press secretary, said that Mr. Putin was confident that he had ''overwhelming support'' in Russia, and had come to terms with the rise in dissent among ''the city bourgeoisie.''
''I wouldn't say he was surprised,'' Mr. Peskov said. ''He's the one who feels the country, he's the one who knows the country from inside. He is the one who knows, let's say, different parts of the society. He knows the problems of those who are poor. He knows the rich. He knows the middle class. And he was interested from the beginning to get it clear.''
Mr. Peskov said Mr. Putin was seeking to understand the rumbles of dissatisfaction, largely through contact with the ordinary Russians he meets on his official travels. But he added that much of what Mr. Putin found out there was full-throated support.
''Regularly he looks at people, he listens, he watches,'' he said. ''The problem is when people are shouting, 'Return our voices' -- we have never stolen their voices. When they cry, 'Putin, go away,' he feels the support of millions of people in this country who shout, 'Putin, stay! Putin, help! Putin, be with us!' ''
As Mr. Putin tries to understand what has changed, old instincts are at work. He reaches out to Russians who have drifted to the opposition but cannot help casting them as dumb instruments of a shadowy foe. He accepts the need for political competition but resists giving up his power. And he is surrounding himself with unquestioningly loyal aides, as if building a defensive wall against some advancing army.
A decade ago, Mr. Putin seemed to sense that this moment was coming, telling a German biographer that he would be the man to break Russia's thousand-year autocratic tradition.
''Putin asked me to come and see him then,'' the biographer, Alexander Rahr, recently told the newspaper Argumenty Nedeli. ''It was then and there that he told me the following phrase: 'Presidents of Russia are like czars of old. The Byzantine traditions are quite strong, and it is up to me to do everything to make the presidency a democratic institution. That's why I'll be gone when my term of office expires. You tell it to everyone over there in the West.' ''

HEADLINE: Centenarian in Need Receives Overdue Aid

BYLINE: PETER C. BJARKMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Conrado Marrero, blind and infirm, is the oldest former major leaguer at 100. He returned to his native Cuba after pitching for five seasons with the Washington Senators in the 1950s. 

 BODY:
Conrado Marrero, who returned to his native Cuba after pitching for five seasons with the Washington Senators in the 1950s, is finally receiving overdue compensation from the Major League Baseball Players Association.
Marrero, the oldest former major leaguer at 100, is blind and confined to the modest third-floor apartment in Havana that he shares with the family of his grandson and caretaker, Rogelio. Marrero broke his hip in a recent fall, putting additional strain on his $125-a-month government stipend.
He was among a group of needy pre-1980 players who were awarded settlements although they did not qualify for standard pensions. In 2010, the players association approved a $20,000 payment in two annual installments to Marrero, but the money was held up by the United States Treasury Department because of the economic embargo on Cuba.
The first $10,000 was released this week by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets in Washington, said Kit Krieger, who befriended the Marrero family a decade ago. Krieger waged a campaign to help Marrero through the Baseball Assistance Team, which helps former major leaguers in need. The players association is seeking permission to override the $10,000 calendar-year limit on money transfers on the basis that this week's payment was actually for 2011.
Marrero's greatest achievements came in the late-1930s and early '40s in Cuban amateur leagues. He made his debut with the Senators in 1950, four days before his 39th birthday. Known as Connie in the United States, Marrero made the 1951 All-Star team, but he owed his unremarkable 39-40 career record to his age and Washington's hapless lineup.
His decision to remain in Cuba after Fidel Castro seized power in 1959 had dire consequences, yet he is an icon of baseball culture there, having helped to develop young players well into his 80s.

HEADLINE: Paul Singer Calls for New Global Leadership

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: The latest investor letter of the hedge fund Elliott Management is largely a caustic diatribe against the world's largest economies and a call for new leadership to right the ship. 

 BODY:
Paul E. Singer, the conservative founder of the hedge fund Elliott Management, has quietly donated about a million dollars to Republican causes so far this election cycle.
To what end? A casual read of his year-end letter to investors offers some clarity.
The investor letter -- in which Mr. Singer spends only a fifth of the pages talking about portfolio management -- is largely a caustic diatribe against the world's largest economies and a call for new leadership to right the ship. In the text of the letter, Mr. Singer proposes a reformed tax code, better financial regulation, an energy development and efficiency plan and fixes to long-term entitlement programs as steps in the right direction.
 "In all of these areas, strong leadership is an absolute necessity," he writes. "A great deal of stupidity has chipped away at the massive advantages of Western civilization, which could terminally decline if it remains on the current path. But these problems can be solved -- and swiftly -- if the right leaders emerge."
Such vociferous language is typical for Mr. Singer, who runs a $19 billion hedge fund that made investors about 4 percent in returns last year, beating most industry competitors. Mr. Singer is generous with his ire, directing it at the United States, the European Union and Japan, and offering a critical assessment of the sorry state of affairs in the world marketplace.
Here is a current snapshot of the U.S., Europe and Japan: the financial sector is overleveraged and opaque. Fiscal, tax, and regulatory policies are unsound and not oriented toward growth and efficiency. On a long-term balance sheet basis, these countries are insolvent, with no hope of paying presently promised benefits regardless of the level of growth achieved or tax rates charges. Monetary policy is extreme and experimental. None of these assertions is refutable.
The long-term bonds of these countries, he notes, are little more than "highly risky assets which are disguised as safe havens." Strong stuff, but Mr. Singer is apparently putting his money where his pen is.
"We are short such bonds in a variety of structures and versions, and we are looking to keep shaping and upsizing these positions," he writes.
He goes a step further, too, arguing that "the epoch of investor confidence in money backed by nothing is coming to an end."
As he often has in recent letters, Mr. Singer spends pages railing against the Federal Reserve for buying bonds, printing cash and keeping interest rates at or near zero percent.
"This policy is arrant idiocy and is likely to ultimately lead to serious inflation, a risk that governments continue to ignore at their peril," he writes.
The peril he spells out for Europe, meanwhile, is much more immediate. He points out the circle of codependency between the nations and their banks: the nations support the banks to keep them from falling prey to markets, but the banks support the nations, too, by buying their debt.
"In the next global trading crisis, characterized (as it may well be) by the cascading transmission of losses from one opaque, overleveraged institution to another, the survival of any given commercial or investment bank (or group of such institutions) is likely to depend more on the perception of the creditworthiness of the sovereigns which stand behind them (and the sovereigns' willingness to actually do so) than on any analysis of the fundamentals of the afflicted institutions."
In trying to save the common currency, the region is headed for disaster, he argues. Weak nations are being battered by austerity measures, which are certain to damp growth, dispirit the people and do little to bring them up to the performance profile of Germany, Mr. Singer writes.
"Saving the euro 'as is' would be a Pyrrhic victory, where the cost of success is so high as to effectively amount to defeat," he writes. "The bottom line is that the euro is a failed experiment."
Back home, a bevy of regulation in the wake of the financial crisis has done little to shelter the system from risk, address leverage or puncture the veil of secrecy at large financial institutions, he writes. The argument is context to his real point, however, about impending regulation of hedge funds: "It is worse than pointless."
Mr. Singer goes on to say that no hedge fund has posed systemic risk over the last 35 years, with the exception of Long Term Capital Management. The financial crisis was brought on by commercial and investment banks and leveraged financial companies like American International Group, as well as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
"We wonder if the Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulatory body tasked with policing hedge funds in the U.S., has the sophistication and resources to sniff out issues related to the myriad of complicated trades, strategies and securities that these firms manage," he writes, before throwing some salt on a particularly sensitive wound at the agency. "Hopefully this new crop of regulators will be more astute than those who ignored a 15-page detailed analysis of the Madoff fraud that was handed to them on a platter years before his unmasking."
But his real beef seems to be with the leadership of the the United States and Europe, whom he blames for the state of play in the financial worlds his firm plays in.
"In America, the current leadership seems to be determined to prioritize redistribution of wealth over growth, while Europe's leadership is engaged in a Titanic struggle (pun intended) to preserve the absurd currency union, and is crushing growth as part of the program."

HEADLINE: All (Restaurant) Politics Is Local

BYLINE: BRUCE BUSCHEL


HIGHLIGHT: Comfort trumps cuisine at the regular hang. Who cares if the beer hails from Colorado and the beef from Florida, the tomatoes from Mexico and the cheese from a chemical plant? Price point is paramount. 

 BODY:
"Your food will never fly," said our high-priced P.R. lady on our very first night. " don't want duck fat popcorn or chicken liver pate with microgreens. want simple fare."
She threw around as if the North and South Forks of Long Island were populated by a monolithic family of cloned clam diggers. Like politicians who know what "the American people" want, most everyone in the Hamptons knows what the locals want. Except me. I don't even know who the locals are or if their status is based on geography or longevity or profession or birthright or appetite.
What I do know is the locals built our restaurant, constitute much of our staff and remain our lifeline to produce and all things piscine. The locals exist in the penumbra of New York City, the best restaurant town in the world, not to mention epicenter of arts, finance, fashion, communications and a few other human activities. The locals, whomever they are, are far from oblivious to the American culinary revolution of the last 20 years; to the contrary, they may have had a hand (or two) in supporting it, digging the earth and pitching in the oysters. 
Moreover, when we opened Southfork Kitchen, we wanted to the locals, not define them -- whether their families arrived on the Mayflower or Aeromexico, with blue blood or blue tattoos or clinical blues, whether they lived on trust funds or distrusted next week's funds, whether they farmed the land or formed sculptures out of old tractor parts. The locals, I figured, would know more about the joys and benefits, not to mention cost and labor, of the local bounty than weekenders and Euro-trippers. When the cast of Royal Pains would be in sunny climes or climbing Boerum Hill brownstones, the locals would be here. When the winter winds would blow or the kitchen would catch fire, the locals would be here. So instead of trying to define them, I listened to them describe themselves when greeted at the restaurant.
 meant the guest rented a house within 10 minutes of the restaurant and was suggesting he or she might be a regular if treated properly.
 meant someone owned a house and came out on weekends and could afford to become a regular if treated properly.
" meant the couple lived in Sagaponack, the next village over, but spent winter elsewhere. They probably met in a group house some years ago.
" meant just that. No explication necessary.
" was the show-stopper. These are the descendants of Bonackers -- the baymen, fishermen and farmers of the 1800s. To bubs, everyone else is a Johnny-come-lately; no natives enjoy the invasion of their territory.
Turns out, this pluralistic, ageless, genderless group known as the locals didn't care much, or very often, about local farmers and local suppliers (even if they the local farmers and local suppliers). On long February nights, if the mug is frosted and the fries are crispy, if ESPN illuminates the flat screen and the bartender hands out drinks like samples at Stew Leonard's, that's quite enough. Who cares if the beer hails from Colorado and the beef from Florida, the tomatoes from Mexico and the cheese from a chemical plant? Price point is paramount. Comfort trumps cuisine at the regular hang. Cheers.
Not that locals have any obligation to dine at locavore establishments; a satisfying meal is not guaranteed by the origins of its ingredients. One may be looking for the exact opposite -- foreign bits, something authentically alien, a meal highlighted by strange fruit and animals you can't find at the green market, maybe Pad Thai or Australian finger lime.
After long, hard days, the locals had neither the time nor inclination to languish at a fancy joint unless there was a fine reason, a birthday or anniversary -- or checking up on Jimmy, their busboy grandson. The Halseys celebrated at the same table Lou Reed had the previous night. (It was Lou Reed, not the Halseys, who complained about the music.) Expense accounts don't grow on farms. They grow on penthouse balconies. If eating out a few times a week is a city practice, imbibing is something else; there isn't much to do in the Hamptons in the winter that beats drinking. It is a local hazard. No cheers.
When autumn arrives, when leaves change color, the locals expect a change in pricing and in attitude too; they want to feel like co-conspirators, not celebrity seekers, like insiders, not interlopers. They may have been dispassionate about our $68 prix fixe in the summer, when they too were busy hustling, but in the off-season means a bargain -- it better not exceed thirty bucks and it best include a free glass of wine. Let's drop the pretense, is the message, and serve up some down-home chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and chuck the tautog with celery root routine.
Restaurants respond. They bend over backward to be affordable, even at their peril. Fannies in the seats and alcohol on the checks is what they need. Breaking even is better than breaking bad. Even in the off-season, they want to keep their mojo, as well as their key personnel, cooking. Some restaurants in the Hamptons stay open year round to curry favor, if not hard cash; some shutter up come Labor Daywe chose the middle path our first year, closing for three months after New Year's; this year, cowered by the economy and still searching for the right rhythm, we bowed out Nov. 1 and will reopen in May.
Hotels and airlines vary their prices -- and deliver the same food and service -- according to seasonal demands. Southfork Kitchen is neither that supple nor that clever. Our costs remain constant, our steps of service in double digits, and our philosophy unaltered. How do you untrain a staff or go from organic to industrial? Changing from haute cuisine to comfort food at the click of a calendar would set off profound gustatory schizophrenia. Yes, we have no cheeseburgers. Even our signature clam chowder is wrong, garden-fresh vegetables with a ham-and-clam veloute poured tableside. Poured tableside? That can make uncomfortable - the converse of comfort.
Don't get me wrong. We would like to be as limber as a yogi, serve crab cakes at the bar and give away mescal (with the worm) to early birds. We tried Lobster Sundays. A la carte Wednesdays. Half-price wine on Thursdays and a $40 prix fixe in winter. In trying to respond to the will of the people, we succeeded in confusing them and in tying ourselves into noose knots. Some nights, we had five menus and a discombobulated staff. I could almost hear Gordon Ramsay cursing in the kitchen.
In our defense -- and I am defensive -- nothing we did is particularly strange in the Hamptons, where restaurants offer more deals than eBay. There are three seasons -- summer, winter and the shoulder months -- and each season has two divisions, weekdays and weekends, and each division has two meals a day and a Sunday brunch. Keeping track is a job. The shape-shifting felt forced and fraudulent. The last thing the Hamptons needed was another Hamptons restaurant. Sleep is no sounder for the apostate. Perfidy is punishable by success. This stance was not a flagrant disregard for finances, just the notion that remaining true to a singular identity would prove easier to digest and more successful in the long run.
We are swimming upstream. And we aren't salmon. We don't even serve salmon. , the more vocal locals, have had serious issues with our policy and our price point, and they have expressed their displeasure in blogs and letters to local editors. We were not playing the game correctly, they wrote, discounting the fact that we were still trying to find our sustainable sea legs and have yet to hit our terrible 2's.
Underlying much of the friction has been the blog you are reading. consider it boastful and gauche, an unwarranted intrusion, an unearned platform. How did this verbose upstart get a blog? They don't appreciate the exposure, don't care for the observations, don't like The New York Times. It has been a mixed blessing from the start, precisely as had warned me, at least the New York Post portion of them.
Still, we are finding our way. We are never unmindful of even if we don't know exactly who they are. The best I can figure, they show up on winter weekdays and they can't wait for Memorial Day to arrive, and it when it does arrive, they can't wait for Labor Day.
And so it goes.*
* Kurt Vonnegut was a local. I miss seeing him smoking outside the general store in Sagaponack.

HEADLINE: Mercedes-Benz SLK55 AMG and Audi TT RS: Two Ways to Skin a Set of Tires

BYLINE: LAWRENCE ULRICH


HIGHLIGHT: The limited-edition compact sports cars take divergent paths to delivering outsize performance. 

 BODY:
With addictive doses of power and handling, the Mercedes-Benz SLK55 AMG and Audi TT RS have become legitimate contenders to the supremacy of sports cars like the Chevrolet Corvette and Porsche Boxster S.
But these special-edition German rockets, roughly co-equals, take wildly divergent routes to producing sound and fury, as I recently learned during back-to-back drives with the pair. And the car chosen says a lot about the performance values of the buyer.
The Mercedes is pure malevolence beneath its extroverted skin. Naturally, the Benz selects a skull-crushing V-8 from the weapons rack, a hand-built 5.5-liter unit, the only naturally aspirated motor in the bi-turbo-obsessed AMG line-up. The result is 415 free-breathing horsepower enlisted to move a pretty little two-seater. This is the kind of ridiculous cognitive dissonance that AMG favors (count me in), along with a savage exhaust note whose volume is permanently dialed to 11. Prod the gas and the Mercedes slobbers and howls like the Tasmanian Devil as it tornadoes to 60 miles per hour in a manufacturer-estimated 4.5 seconds, and to an uncapped 174 m.p.h. top speed when equipped with the optional AMG handling package. (Unequipped, top speed is limited to 155 m.p.h.)
Optional black alloy AMG wheels against a white body, along with carbon fiber trim, made clear that my test model was no boulevardier. And the brand's overtures toward fuel efficiency are more than just obliging nods, with a Formula One-derived engine stop-start system that reportedly bolsters fuel economy by nearly 30 percent over the last-generation SLK55, to an estimated 19 miles per gallon in city driving and 28 m.p.g. in highway driving, despite a gain of 60 horsepower.
In repose, the Audi is as subtle as the Mercedes is flashy. It's just another bubble-canopied TT coupe, albeit with fat 19-inch wheels and a rear spoiler. On paper or at the curb, the Audi looks like it wouldn't stand a chance against the SLK55.
Ah, but this is a rare TT, one of very few cars Audi has exported to America to wear an RS badge, denoting the top rank of Audi performance. Audi's own claim to craziness is the 360 horsepower wrung from a mere five cylinders and 2.5 liters of displacement.
To accomplish this, Audi turbocharges the engine to within a square inch of its life, with a huge 17.4 p.s.i. of turbo boost. With its welcome 6-speed manual shifter and Quattro all-wheel-drive powering four wheels, the TT RS scampered to 60 m.p.h. in 4 seconds flat in a test by Car and Driver. For some perspective, that's faster than Audi's $100,000-plus R8.
With less than half the displacement of the SLK55 and three fewer cylinders, the Audi emits a throbbing techno soundtrack to the Mercedes' Marshall-stack thunder. The Audi's song is spiky and synthetic, yet compelling: a digitally sampled fighter jet filtered through the titanium sport exhaust.
The Audi, at $57,725 to start, also costs nearly $11,000 less than the SLK55, at $68,375.
As for class benchmarks like the Boxster S and Boxster Spyder, those models still offer the purest connection between car and driver. But on public roads, purity isn't everything, and the Audi or Mercedes would slap the Porsches silly, with equal grip in corners but far more urge at any point in the power band. Whether those impressions would hold against the 2013 Boxster remains to be seen.
For Audi and Mercedes, whose previous efforts to engineer brawn into these models often got them dismissed as luxury poseurs, the equally lusty sound effects produced by these revitalized machines should be music to the ears of enthusiasts everywhere.

HEADLINE: Driving the Fisker Karma

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Weighed down by its batteries, electric motor and gas generator, the Fisker Karma offers more flash than dash. But the plug-in hybrid still makes a good first impression. 

 BODY:
In Sunday's Automobiles section, Jerry Garrett takes a first drive in the Karma sedan, the first vehicle from Fisker Automotive, a start-up company founded by Henrik Fisker, a former designer for Aston Martin, BMW and Ford.
The road to market for the Karma, a luxury plug-in hybrid, has not been without its bumps and detours, as Mr. Garrett writes. A $20,000 increase over the company's initial price projection, a rather dismal fuel-economy rating from the Environmental Protection Agency and an embarrassing recall preceded Mr. Garrett's drive of his $116,000 test car. Such setbacks, however, did not mar his experience with the 5,000-pound sedan:
Though not necessarily nimble or light on its feet, the Karma has very responsive steering and solid grip. The turning radius is rather large, but the car carves a smart line through sinuous twists and turns.
Mr. Garrett had only a few hours with the Karma on his unsupervised drive, and he reserved final judgment until he could wring out the best, and worst, of the car in its Stealth and Sport driving modes. But in various traffic conditions in and around Los Angeles, he wrote, the Karma "performed competently, and it looked good all the while."
