HEADLINE: Britain's Private Equity Firms Try to Make the Case for Their Low Taxes

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON, June 20 

 BODY:
Executives from four large private equity firms went to Parliament on Tuesday and defended the low British tax rate imposed on their profits.
 The House of Commons Treasury Committee continued a second round of hearings on private equity taxation on Wednesday as politicians and union representatives pushed for a change in the law that allows private equity firms to pay as little as 10 percent tax on some of their profit, compared with the country's top 40 percent income tax.
 Britain's discussion on whether to increase the tax on profits of equity firms comes as a similar effort is under way in the United States. A bill introduced last week would tax as corporations all publicly traded partnerships, which could effectively double their tax rates. 
 The hearing was intended to shed more light on the private equity industry and whether certain laws, like tax rules or financial disclosure requirements, need to be reviewed. Gordon Brown, who is set to take over as prime minister from Tony Blair on June 27, had said earlier that he would scrutinize tax laws that favor private equity firms.
 Speaking before the British committee on Tuesday, Damon Buffini, the managing partner at Permira, said that a tax relief for some private equity investments had benefited the country's economy by encouraging growth of the private equity industry. 
 Dominic Murphy, a partner at another firm, Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts, agreed, saying that the tax advantage had been very successful in aiding the economy.
 Yet even within the private equity firms, opinions seem to vary. 
 Nicholas Ferguson, chairman of SVG Capital, an investor in Permira's funds, called earlier this month for a review of the laws because private equity partners now ''pay less tax than a cleaning lady.''
 Ronald Cohen, the founder of Apax Partners who now runs a venture capital firm focusing on social development projects, was quoted last week saying the partners at megafunds should pay more tax but that growth funds and venture capitalists like himself should be spared for the good of the economy.
 And Guy Hands, who runs Terra Firma, the private equity firm, last week defended the current tax structure and warned that critics should ''think through the long-term consequences of any proposals they make.''
 On Wednesday, John McFall, chairman of the Treasury Committee that had invited the private equity representatives to the hearing, said ''the industry needs to get itself sorted out'' and speak with a ''unified voice.''
 Equity firms and their members have been the target of an active campaign run by the GMB trade union for ''hostile acts including massive layoffs, dumping insolvent company pension funds, and poor industrial relations.'' 
 As part of its campaign, the union pointed to thousand of job cuts at the AA Automobile Association and NCP, a manager of parking lots, following private equity takeovers and plans to display large posters of top private equity executives to ask visitors at this weekend's Glastonbury Festival, Britain's biggest rock festival, to vote on the ''No. 1 private equity rogue''.
 Mr. Buffini in February had offered to meet with a trade union and a handful of buyout firms and establish a working group to draw up a code of conduct for the industry.
 While Parliament's discussions continue, executives at the buyout firms realize that they need to take the concerns seriously -- their success in raising money and buying firms depends in large part on the support of politicians, investors and employees, bankers and lawyers have said. 
 The British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association this year admitted that it had done a poor job informing the public about the advantages of private equity and that the industry had helped the British economy grow by creating rather than eliminating jobs and made money for their investors, including pension funds. 
 Last week, Peter Linthwaite resigned as chief executive of the British private equity association after failing to win over members of Parliament during a committee hearing about private equity.
 The British Treasury Committee, whose role is to examine the expenditure, administration and policy of the treasury and related institutions, said in March that it would start an inquiry into private equity funds and how the industry conducts business as part of a wider review of transparency in Britain's financial markets. 
 On July 3, the committee will question representatives of the Financial Services Authority.

HEADLINE: Economics, Religion And Politics, In Bite Size

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
The Ensemble Studio Theater is in such a remote location -- walk west on 52nd Street and just keep going -- that by the time you arrive at its door, you feel as if you have discovered a hidden cultural treasure. At its best the Marathon -- the theater's annual one-act festival that has showcased new work by everyone from David Mamet to Tennessee Williams, and which this year is divided into two five-play series -- offers a similar sensation. 
 But it's not until the last of five shorts that the second series of Marathon 2007 displays any true inspiration, and we have the superb and often underused actor Larry Pine to thank for that. In ''Self-Portrait in a Blue Room,'' a sharp romantic piece by Daniel Reitz, Mr. Pine takes center stage as the aging artist Julian, preparing to meet with the president of the United States to receive an award. Judging by his impatience -- he calls the waiting room ''Hell's antechamber'' -- it's clear he's no Republican. 
 With sunken eyes and a long chin, Mr. Pine, a veteran supporting player who looks a little like Tom Stoppard, has the dignified face of royalty in decline, which is perfect for this dying master whose charm and wit are no match for his monumental ego. Julian can be cruel, especially to his patient and far younger boyfriend, Chad (a nicely stoic Chris Stack), but in Mr. Pine's flamboyant performance a touching vulnerability and fear of death emerges between biting barbs. 
 Peter Sagal's very clever ''Milton Bradley'' offers a more irreverent take on dying, in his sendup of the hollow tributes some clergymen make to the recently deceased. The play is set in a funeral home, where a rabbi (Stephen Singer) must make a speech about a hateful woman whose only life accomplishment was that she beat another elderly woman at pinochle. It's a pretty good Jewish mother joke, and the rabbi's speech, performed hilariously by Mr. Singer in a familiar stop-and-start cadence, demonstrates filibustering and diplomacy (her ''consistency of purpose'' is praised) that would make any politician jealous. 
 Elizabeth Diggs's ''Priceless,'' a tepidly acted work that portrays a young marriage through a comparison of a couple's spending habits (he's thrifty, she's not), and Amy Fox's ''Casting,'' about the fantasy life of a young girl, are modest playlets that seem like decent first drafts. Far more ambitious is Israel Horovitz's ''Beirut Rocks,'' a political drama about summer school students huddled in a Beirut hotel during the fighting in Lebanon last year. As bombs explode in the distance, the hostilities outside start to seep into the room until a mix of paranoia and odd behavior leads to a fight between a proud Jewish student from the Bronx and a quiet Palestinian girl who grew up in Massachusetts. It's capably drawn, but it might leave some with the impression that shedding light on Middle East politics requires more than one act.
 Marathon 2007 continues through June 30 at the Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Manhattan; ensemblestudiotheatre.org, (212) 352-3101.

HEADLINE: U.S. Courting a Somewhat Skittish Friend in Central Asia

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan, June 20 

 BODY:
The president of reclusive and authoritarian Turkmenistan said Wednesday that he was willing to expand his relations with Washington and with American businesses and that he would continue to cooperate with efforts to stabilize neighboring Afghanistan.
 The president, Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, also said he would like to build a pipeline under the Caspian Sea that would link this Central Asian country and its vast natural gas fields to routes that could carry the gas to the West.
 His remarks were made in a meeting here with Adm. William J. Fallon, commander of American troops in the region, and a small delegation of military and State Department officials and a journalist. 
 The meeting focused on security relations, where Turkmenistan and the United States have quietly developed stronger ties since the terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001. 
 But in spite of the relatively narrow agenda-- on the surface, a routine visit to a head of state by a senior American commander touring his area of responsibility -- it was also the latest step in trying to assess and engage one of the world's most puzzling and tightly controlled countries, and a new president whose course is not yet clear.
 Mr. Berdymukhammedov assumed office this year in a choreographed vote after the death of the previous president, Saparmurat Niyazov, the megalomaniac who had ruled the country since it reluctantly gained independence after the Soviet Union's collapse.
 A former Communist Party official who ultimately had the compliant Parliament appoint him president for life, Mr. Niyazov had combined the country's hydrocarbon wealth and a boundless ego to generate a bizarre and extensive personality cult. 
 He gave himself the name Turkmenbashi, the Father of All Turkmens, commissioned golden statues in his likeness, renamed April after his mother and January after himself, and presided over a construction spree of massive white-marbled buildings that rise from the steppe over an impoverished population of five million people. 
 He also ran a centralized and opaque government, reduced the length of public education, controlled the news media as an instrument of state expression and restricted other forms of public expression. Political prisoners disappeared into his jails. Western human rights organizations called his government one of the most repressive in the world.
 Since Mr. Niyazov's death in December, when Mr. Berdymukhammedov, a dentist and career bureaucrat, emerged from the Turkmenbashi entourage as the heir apparent, Western governments have delicately calibrated their diplomacy with hopes that the new president can be encouraged to put Turkmenistan on a different path.
 Diplomats have refrained from public criticism, choosing to work with him on economic and security issues, where he has been open to foreign contact. Mr. Berdymukhammedov, for his part, has hinted at change, including allowing a small number of public Internet connections in the capital and calling for improvements in the country's hobbled educational system. 
 ''Rome wasn't built in a day, and we don't expect that Turkmenistan is going to turn into a Jeffersonian democracy by next Thursday,'' Evan A. Feigenbaum, deputy assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, said in a telephone interview before Admiral Fallon's delegation arrived. ''We are proceeding under the assumption that there are possibilities for U.S.-Turkmen relations that simply did not exist a few months ago.''
 The meeting covered potential projects, with Mr. Berdymukhammedov discussing his desire to build a pipeline that would offer an alternate export route for gas under the Caspian Sea, bypassing the Russian pipeline network. 
 But the president noted the substantial obstacles that remained, including border demarcation with other Caspian states and environmental concerns. He also said he was willing to offer insurable investments to Western companies.
 Admiral Fallon's visit, in the end, appeared to reaffirm the two nations' security cooperation, the one area where the former president had already established ties with the United States. 
 Turkmenistan has always been strongly neutral, but late in his life Mr. Niyazov had been willing to cooperate with the American military in return for aid and training to combat terrorism and smuggling. Turkmenistan shares a border with northwestern Afghanistan, which added to its strategic importance to Washington after the terrorist attacks in 2001. 
 In recent years, larger numbers of Turkmen military, intelligence and police officers have been allowed to attend military schools and seminars in the United States and Europe, and the Nevada National Guard has helped train the Turkmen border service.
 At the Pentagon's request, Mr. Niyazov also gave the United States permission for military aircraft to fly through Turkmen airspace and allowed Western military aircraft to use a former Soviet military airfield, in Mary, for emergency landings.
 Mr. Niyazov further allowed a small group of American service personnel to operate a refueling point at the airport outside the capital for military planes.
 After the meeting on Wednesday, Admiral Fallon expressed satisfaction with what he called the ''good relations between the two countries'' in this area, and held open the possibility for more cooperation.
 Turkmenistan's state television, which is under the direct control of the president's office, also noted the visit approvingly, beginning the evening news broadcast with a segment about the meeting and casting it in a positive light. 
 The presenter also noted that Turkmenistan would continue to provide aid to Afghanistan, which Admiral Fallon had complimented in visits throughout the region this week
 Human rights organizations and exiled opposition members have criticized the new president and Western policies of negotiating with him, saying he has made small or insignificant gestures and otherwise maintained the system of one-man rule. They have urged the West to press Mr. Berdymukhammedov to relax his hold on the country and to recognize human rights.
 When Admiral Fallon was asked, in the presence of a Turkmen television team, about the place of civil society and democracy in the relationship between the countries, he said he and Mr. Berdymukhammedov had focused on security. After a short pause, he addressed the issue gently and obliquely: ''I think that people throughout the world have the same basic desires. They want to live in peace, they want a better life for themselves and would like to be able to make decisions for themselves.''
 The remark was not broadcast on Turkmen news.

HEADLINE: Zoellick Obtains Board Support to Lead World Bank, Officials Say

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20 

 BODY:
Robert B. Zoellick, President Bush's nominee for president of the World Bank, secured the support of the bank's board of directors on Wednesday after reporting to them about his recent meetings with bank representatives around the world, bank officials said. 
 Mr. Zoellick, 53, a top executive at Goldman Sachs and a former senior trade envoy and deputy secretary of state, met with the bank's 24-member board the day after he returned from meetings to reassure bank officials in Africa, Europe and Latin America about his plans for the institution. The board is expected to formalize its support for Mr. Zoellick on Monday. 
 Bank officials said that Mr. Zoellick outlined his views of the bank's opportunities and difficulties and told members that he would strive to stabilize the bank after the stormy two-year tenure of Paul D. Wolfowitz, who resigned in May amid accusations of favoritism to his companion, a bank employee.
 ''The board found Zoellick to be somebody who understands the issues and the needs of the bank,'' said a senior bank official who had been briefed on the meeting. ''It was a very positive meeting from the board's point of view.''
 By tradition, whoever is nominated by the United States for the bank presidency is elected to the job, but Mr. Bush's choice of Mr. Wolfowitz, a former deputy defense secretary, rankled donor nations in 2005. 
 Mr. Wolfowitz was approved after Gerhard Schroder, then chancellor of Germany, and Jacques Chirac, then president of France, decided not to reopen trans-Atlantic wounds from the onset of the Iraq war two years earlier by opposing the appointment. Many European officials said then that they would try to change the rules for Mr. Wolfowitz's successor.
 Some European officials said they still wanted to question the tradition of the president of the United States appointing the president of the bank. Several said the bank should consider candidates besides Mr. Zoellick.
 In the end, however, no other candidates emerged, and bank officials said Mr. Zoellick had succeeded in assuaging fears in Europe and elsewhere that someone appointed by Mr. Bush would try to impose an administration-backed agenda on bank decisions. 
 A bank official familiar with Mr. Zoellick's meeting said he was very precise in discussing possible changes in the bank's governing structure and its difficulties on issues like whether to continue lending to so-called middle-income countries that have easy access to capital markets, the need to raise money for the poorest countries and combating corruption in bank lending.
 ''Intellectually and professionally it was a very good performance,'' said a bank official familiar with the meeting.
 Mr. Wolfowitz's resignation will become effective on June 30, and officials said they did not expect Mr. Zoellick to take office until afterward. In the last 10 days, he visited Ghana, Ethiopia, South Africa, Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, Norway, Mexico and Brazil.
 Mr. Zoellick declined to comment on his meetings at the bank.
 He was the choice of a search led by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., who told the House Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday that Mr. Zoellick would ''rightly keep Africa at the center of the bank's focus and continue the vital campaign to fight corruption and reduce poverty.''

HEADLINE: Mexico Moves To Cut Back Tax Loopholes For Businesses

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 20 

 BODY:
Hoping to raise Mexico's tax collection rate to offset future declines in oil revenue, President Felipe Calderon presented a tax package to Congress Wednesday that seeks to close many of the loopholes that businesses have used to avoid paying taxes. 
 Mexico collects less than 11 percent of its gross domestic product in taxes, well below the average of about 16 percent for South American countries and 25 percent for developed countries. 
 The finance minister, Agustin Carstens, estimated that the tax measures, to be phased in through Mr. Calderon's term, would raise collection by an additional 3 percentage points of G.D.P. 
 The government has made up for its tax shortfall by heavily taxing the state oil monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos, which last year financed 40 percent of government spending. Starved for investment money, Pemex, as the company is known, now faces stagnant production and declining oil reserves. 
 Mr. Calderon, a member of the conservative National Action Party, won election last July by a tiny margin against a left-wing candidate after a bitter election that highlighted the country's stubborn poverty. Mr. Calderon is under pressure to address that poverty, but he is hamstrung by the lack of money. 
 The Mexican government, Wall Street and international financial organizations have long described changes in taxation, along with an overhaul of energy policy and the labor code, as crucial to the country's ability to expand economically. 
 Pamela K. Starr, an analyst for the Eurasia Group in Washington, wrote in a note that the tax package was ''politically palatable'' to a majority of legislators. But Congress is out of session until September, and it is still unclear whether the parties will agree to call a special session to take up the measure. 
 Under the proposed measure, companies would have to pay the larger of two assessed tax rates: the current corporate income tax rate of 28 percent or a new flat tax of 19 percent assessed on sales after deducting costs for raw materials and investment. 
 That measure is likely to be publicly popular, but it is also likely to be opposed by some of the most powerful companies in Mexico, which quietly backed Mr. Calderon's campaign last year. 
 The proposal also appears to hurt small companies and those dependent on labor, like software design companies and tourism, rather than on capital, said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an economist and consultant. 
 ''These companies are being treated almost in the same league as the big guys,'' said Mr. Ramirez de la O, who served as the economic adviser last year to the left-wing candidate, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. 
 The measures will also try to begin collecting taxes on workers in Mexico's vast underground economy, like street vendors, by taxing cash bank deposits over $1,800 a month at a 2 percent rate.

HEADLINE: Trying to Unite Europe, Again

 BODY:
Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, spoke good sense this week when he declared that negotiations on reorganizing the European Union can't start from scratch every time a member state has a change of government. 
 But that is what Poland's not-so-new president, Lech Kaczynski, and his twin brother, Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, are trying to do on the eve of an E.U. summit with their blustery demands that Poland retain almost as big a vote in the E.U. as the far more populous Germany. If they persevere, they would block adoption of a much-needed constitutional treaty, confirming the doubts of all those who question whether Europe can ever effectively unite. 
 The attempt to salvage the best bits of the old constitutional treaty -- defeated two years ago by referendums in France and the Netherlands -- is being led by Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel. Mrs. Merkel is skilled at outmaneuvering colleagues more intent on strutting before domestic constituencies. Wisely, she has pressed for the removal of all the trappings of a European federation (including the misnomer Constitution) in hopes of calming those who fear that Brussels's goal is to strip member states of all their sovereign powers. 
 Instead, the new draft focuses on reforms needed to make the expanded union more effective and transparent: a longer presidential term; a more unified foreign policy; a charter of fundamental rights; and fewer opportunities for national vetoes. 
 Mrs. Merkel has found an energetic ally in Nicolas Sarkozy, France's new president. But Britain's lame-duck prime minister, Tony Blair, is being less helpful, objecting to changes that he says could encroach on Britain's foreign policy, common law or labor and social legislation. We hope that as one of his last acts in office -- his successor, Gordon Brown, takes over next week -- Mr. Blair will be open to creative compromise and that together, Mrs. Merkel, Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Blair will block Poland's efforts to scuttle the much-needed reforms. 
 With all the challenges out there -- terrorism, global warming, an increasingly anti-democratic Russia and a nuclear-ambitious Iran -- Europe needs a strong union and the United States needs a strong European partner.

HEADLINE: U.S. URGING BLAIR TO BE LEAD ENVOY IN MIDEAST QUEST

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20 

 BODY:
The United States is pressing Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain to become a special envoy to the Middle East, representing the diplomatic ''quartet'' of world powers, administration officials said Wednesday.
 The appointment would be the most visible attempt at laying the groundwork for a Palestinian state since President Clinton wrangled with Yasir Arafat and Ehud Barak during the waning hours of his administration in 2001.
 If the proposal, endorsed by President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, goes forward, and if Mr. Blair, who leaves office next week, accepts, he would work on behalf of the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia to help the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, build the institutions and apparatus necessary for a viable state. 
 The proposal shows the renewed urgency in dealing with the changed political landscape brought on by the takeover of Gaza by Hamas. The power shift there has focused efforts on the West Bank, where Mr. Abbas and Fatah retain control. 
 European and American officials said that so far, the only grumbling about the possible Blair appointment has come from Russia, which has had contentious relations with Britain of late, including the charges regarding the poisoning of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former K.G.B. officer and a Kremlin critic who died in London in November.
 But diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic said that if Mr. Blair wanted the job, it was unlikely that Russia would seek to block the appointment.
 C. David Welch, assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs, met with Mr. Blair in London on Wednesday to make the case, a senior Bush administration official said. Mr. Welch, the official said, would not be in London ''if there weren't some seriousness to this.'' 
 The official likened the talks to the ''late stages of a scouting effort, seeing who's available for an N.B.A. draft,'' but added that the United States was not pursuing anyone other than Mr. Blair.
 Mr. Bush has spoken to Mr. Blair about the proposal, and discussed it Tuesday with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, Israeli and Bush administration officials said. Senior Israeli officials said Mr. Olmert was also very keen on the idea.
 But British officials said Mr. Blair had not yet decided if he would take on the task, and bristled that public comments from the Bush administration were premature. 
 It remains unclear how broad Mr. Blair's role would be. American and Israeli officials want him to focus primarily on shoring up Palestinian institutions and governance, economic development and security issues in the West Bank. 
 Administration officials said Ms. Rice would continue to try to work with Mr. Olmert and Mr. Abbas on a separate track that addresses the ''final status'' issues that have bedeviled peace negotiators since 1979: Jerusalem's future, a Palestinian state's borders and what to do about Palestinian refugees who fled, or were forced to leave, homes in Israel.
 Israel, in the past, has been more squeamish about discussing those issues. But that may be changing. Mr. Olmert indicated in meetings at the White House on Tuesday that now that Mr. Abbas had dissolved the national unity government and separated politically from Hamas, Israel was ready to act. 
 While Mr. Olmert cautioned against moving too fast on ''final status'' issues, he said he planned to look for ways to empower Mr. Abbas, administration officials said, including releasing tax revenues that Israel had been keeping from the Palestinians.
 But the lack of a link between the tracks -- final status versus Palestinian institution-building -- is the crux of why previous attempts at peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians have been unsuccessful. 
 ''The one thing we've learned is that it is impossible to distinguish between governance, security and politics,'' said Robert Malley, Middle East and North Africa director at the International Crisis Group. ''If one doesn't move, none of them move. That's the reason why the road map never got off the ground.'' 
 Mr. Malley was referring to President Bush's ''road map'' plan for eventual peace between Israelis and Palestinians, which calls for the formation of a Palestinian state after Palestinian officials take certain steps.
 The last envoy to represent the quartet, James D. Wolfensohn, the former World Bank president, left the post last year, expressing frustration with the lack of progress on the plan.
 Certainly, Mr. Blair would bring to the job a higher stature, and might also bring a credibility -- particularly with the Arab world -- that an American might not be able to match. 
 During the Israeli-Hezbollah war last summer, for example, Mr. Blair offered to travel to the region and noted at the time that as British prime minister, he could say and do things that did not necessarily carry the baggage of similar actions by Mr. Bush or Ms. Rice, presumably because of America's close relationship with Israel.
 Mr. Blair's appointment would also be an ironic footnote to the end of his 10 years of stewardship of Britain, given that his support of Mr. Bush and the war in Iraq hurt him politically at home. 
 But his close relationship with Mr. Bush is part of the reason why Mr. Bush wants Mr. Blair to take the envoy's role, administration officials said. 
 On the other hand, Mr. Blair is still wrestling with the perception that his American friend is calling the shots at a time when Mr. Blair is thinking about his own legacy.
 From the start, the two men had an unexpected bond, particularly given how close Mr. Blair was to Bill Clinton, with whom he shared a vision of a ''third way'' in domestic politics. Few had expected a similar bond with Mr. Bush. 
 But Mr. Blair, associates said, liked Mr. Bush's directness, and felt strongly that the role of Britain in the world would be enhanced by a close relationship with the United States.

HEADLINE: Earnings Up 7% at FedEx; Weaker Economy Is Cited

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, June 20 

 BODY:
FedEx posted a 7 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit Wednesday on higher revenue but said a sluggish American economy damped business.
 The company forecast earnings growth in fiscal year 2008 below the company's long-term target of 10 percent to 15 percent, in part because of planned investments for the company's long-term health. 
 But FedEx said its own economists predicted a bit of an economic upturn later this year.
 ''A weakened U.S. market is limiting demand for transportation services, but we expect the economy to show modest, year-to-year improvement beginning in late summer or early fall,'' FedEx's president and chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, said in a conference call.
 FedEx shares rose $1.74, to $109.80. 
 FedEx reported earnings of $610 million, or $1.96 a share, for the three months ended May 31, up from $568 million, or $1.82 a share, a year ago.
 The latest results included a gain of 6 cents a share from a settlement with Airbus after an order cancellation for A380 aircraft. Without the gain, the company earned $1.90 a share for the quarter.
 Revenue rose 8 percent, to $9.15 billion, from $8.49 billion.
 Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial were looking for a profit of $1.95 a share on revenue of $9.16 billion. FedEx had predicted it would earn $1.93 to $2.08 a share, including the gain on the Airbus settlement.
 For all of fiscal 2007, FedEx earned $2.02 billion, or $6.48 a share, up from $1.81 billion, or $5.83 a share, the previous year. Revenue rose to $35.2 billion from $32.3 billion a year earlier.
 American businesses have drawn down inventories for several financial quarters, Mr. Smith said, but FedEx expects that to begin turning around soon.
 ''Obviously, the big wild card in this whole thing is the price of fuel,'' he said. ''You can't take hundreds of billions of dollars out of the U.S. consumer's pocket -- which are then not recycled through our economy -- and not have it have an effect.''

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: PARIS, June 20 

 BODY:
The Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass is not the kind of guy who flies commercial. If his latest venture takes to the skies, he will not be the kind who flies subsonic either.
 Mr. Bass is financing an effort to build the world's first supersonic business jet. He was at the Paris air show this week promoting his project, known as Aerion, to aircraft makers and potential customers.
 ''With this plane you can have breakfast in New York, fly to London, stay for four hours and fly back to New York for dinner,'' said Mr. Bass, who now makes do with a Falcon private jet that flies below the speed of sound -- too slow to make that Manhattan dinner reservation.
 Even with a minimum price of $80 million, Mr. Bass said, his needle-nose jet has drawn keen interest, which says something about the can-you-top-this exuberance of the market for private aircraft. 
 Once a largely American niche item, business jets have ridden an updraft of wealth creation at the very top to become the fastest-growing segment of the global aerospace industry. As the orders pile up, the limits of what is conceivable in private air travel continue to be stretched.
 On Wednesday, Airbus confirmed that it had booked an order from an individual for its A380 superjumbo jet. It said only that the buyer was not from Europe or the United States. The $300 million plane commonly seats 525 people; Airbus said this one would be converted ''for personal use for him and his entourage.''
 At these economic altitudes, whether one opts for size or speed is mostly a matter of personal preference.
 On the tarmac at Le Bourget airfield, where the air show is held, well-dressed and tanned visitors sauntered between Falcon, Gulfstream and Bombardier jets like shoppers in a Louis Vuitton boutique.
 ''These are people who are willing to pay any price,'' said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va. ''The top end of society is also the fastest-growing segment of society.''
 Lines formed early at Falcon's new 7X. The gleaming $41 million eight-seater is the newest entrant in the superlarge business jet category, following Gulfstream's G500 and Bombardier's Global series. Dassault Falcon has already booked more than 160 orders for the plane. Its first delivery in the United States is to Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis, a loyal Falcon customer.
 On Tuesday, Serge Dassault, the French billionaire who controls the parent Dassault Aviation, turned up to inspect the 7X's interior, which features buttery leather seats and stained laurel burl wood trim. Since this display model will be used as Mr. Dassault's personal plane, the crowd parted respectfully to let the 83-year-old mogul through.
 Emerging from the roomy cabin later, Mr. Dassault pronounced himself satisfied. ''C'est bon,'' he said.
 Good, indeed. The Teal Group estimates that manufacturers will produce 999 business jets, worth $16.4 billion, this year. That is nearly double their output in 2003, when sales had bottomed out after the last big growth spurt ended in 2001-2.
 Teal's figures do not include passenger planes, like the A380, that are converted to private use. Airbus and Boeing both sell business-jet versions of their smaller planes. There are an estimated 150 such converted aircraft worldwide, but they account for only 5 percent of the market.
 Over the next decade, Teal projects, manufacturers will turn out 12,000 business jets, worth a cumulative $173.2 billon. While analysts expect a temporary plateau in sales after 2009, few predict a recurrence of the boom-and-bust cycle that has haunted the market.
 In part, this has to do with the increasingly global nature of wealth. The United States used to be the dominant market for these jets, making the industry hostage to the American economy. Now, Dassault Falcon generates barely 30 percent of its sales in the United States, according to its chief executive, John Rosanvallon.
 This year, Mr. Rosanvallon will deliver 10 planes to Russia, where, for an oil-rich oligarch, owning your own jet apparently ranks behind only your own yacht or professional soccer club.
 Brazil is another rising market, as is India, which has growing class of rich executives. 
 China is still a great unrealized hope, among other reasons because its airspace is sharply restricted by the military. Falcon sold its first jet two years ago to a state-owned Chinese company. 
 As private jets inch ever closer in size to smaller passenger planes, supersonic jets may be the next great symbol of exclusivity. For one thing, there has not been a supersonic commercial plane since the retirement of the Concorde in 2003. Supersonic business jets are already the subject of an almost theological debate among experts.
 Believers, like Mr. Aboulafia, say they are the inevitable next step for time-pressed executives. Skeptics say they are a pipe dream, subject to rising fuel prices and sonic booms that restrict flights over land, particularly in the United States.
 ''They will only exist in cartoon land,'' said Doug McVitie, managing director of Arran Aerospace, a market research firm in Dinan, France. ''Supersonic jets are too fast for the air traffic control system, in the same way as the A380 is just too big for the system.''
 In fact, the Aerion jet being promoted by Mr. Bass would fly faster than the speed of sound only part of the time. With straight wings rather than the delta-shaped design of the Concorde, it is designed to cruise at speeds from Mach 0.95 to Mach 1.6, which is roughly twice as fast as the Falcon 7X.
 This design makes the jet lighter, allowing it to use an existing Pratt & Whitney engine. That would also permit it to land at, say, Teterboro Airport in northern New Jersey, where many private plane owners base their aircraft.
 The wings were designed by Richard R. Tracy, an aerodynamicist who created jets for Bill Lear, one of the industry's pioneers. Mr. Tracy signed up Mr. Bass as his main investor late in 2003.
 Mr. Bass, who was born into a Fort Worth oil dynasty and is known for his own investments as well, declined to say how much he had put into this venture. But he maintains that there is a market for 300 supersonic jets over 10 years. His aim now is to find a manufacturer to share the risk of a five-year development program estimated to cost $2 billion. 
 His pitch is simple: the jet would cut three hours off a typical Paris-to-New York flight; one hour off a New York-to-Miami trip; and five hours off a New York-to-Tokyo flight, even with an hour refueling stop in Alaska (the top Gulfstream and Bombardier jets can fly that route nonstop).
 Dassault has declined Mr. Bass's proposal, despite his being a Falcon owner. Mr. Rosanvallon said he was doubtful of the concept, partly because of growing concerns about the environmental impact of high-speed jets. ''There is a growing social conscience,'' he said.
 Mr. Bass contended that his jet would be no more damaging to the atmosphere than slower, heavier planes -- and no less efficient. He said he had been ''besieged'' with interest during his week in Paris.
 ''Customers are becoming more vocal,'' he said, ''and when they become more vocal, they put more pressure on the manufacturers to produce a plane like this.''

HEADLINE: Workers See Few Options At Dow Jones

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Looking at the potential bidders for Dow Jones & Company -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and a joint effort by General Electric and Pearson -- some reporters and editors at The Wall Street Journal are calling the decision a choice between ''trash or slash.'' And they are wondering which might be worse.
 Ever since the News Corporation bid for Dow Jones, The Journal's owner, journalists there have predicted that Mr. Murdoch would dumb down and politicize the news pages. But now that G.E. and Pearson are weighing whether to make a rival offer, Dow Jones employees fear the results would be deep job cuts and a devotion to the bottom line, not great journalism.
 Several Journal reporters who had hoped for an alternative bidder now describe it as a case of ''be careful what you wish for.'' 
 Yesterday, negotiations for a sale took a baby step forward as the Bancroft family, owners of a controlling interest in Dow Jones, and the board of Dow Jones agreed that the board should begin direct talks with News Corporation for the first time. That came after the family's approval of a plan to limit News Corporation's control over the content of The Journal and Dow Jones Newswires, after weeks in which the Bancrofts had trouble agreeing on such a proposal.
 The Bancrofts had originally said that their representatives on the board would negotiate editorial control directly with News Corporation before turning things over to the Dow Jones board. But board members protested that that would leave them with little leverage to bargain for a higher price, and the Bancrofts ultimately agreed, family members and advisers said yesterday.
 Nonfamily board members had also urged the Bancrofts to speed their deliberations, arguing that the possibility of a G.E.-Pearson offer strengthened their bargaining position and that a long delay might prompt Mr. Murdoch to retract his offer.
 It is not clear how the Bancrofts' proposal differs from one drafted last week, which would have limited News Corporation's ability to hire and fire the top editors of The Journal and Dow Jones Newswires. Many Journal employees view the effort skeptically, but even some of them say it may be their better alternative. 
 ''If you put a gun to my head, I'd take Murdoch over G.E.-Pearson,'' said a senior editor at The Journal who declined to be identified because the deal is not complete. This editor reasoned that the G.E.-Pearson deal would mean immediate cuts and deteriorating quality, while a Bancroft family deal struck with Mr. Murdoch might hold off fundamental change for a few years.
 But a firm offer from Pearson and G.E. still seems far off. Talks between the companies have centered on the creation of a new corporate entity that would include Dow Jones; The Financial Times, which is owned by Pearson; and the CNBC cable channel, which is owned by G.E. 
 The proposal has been widely described as primarily defensive, to blunt competition from News Corporation, but analysts say it has strategic value on its own -- although perhaps not enough to justify anything like the $5 billion News Corporation has offered.
 ''I think it's great strategically, with a lot of opportunities for consolidation,'' said Larry Grimes, president of W. B. Grimes & Company, media industry investment bankers. ''Whether they can reach an agreement to make it work and justify a price that would make it happen, that's a very different question.''
 Justifying such a price is not the same issue for Mr. Murdoch, a shrewd businessman whose motivations sometimes go beyond profit to include prestige and political influence. He often pours money into the businesses he buys, and he is willing to let some of them, like The New York Post, lose a lot of money, year after year.
 In contrast, G.E. and Jeffrey R. Immelt, its chairman and chief executive, have a reputation for wielding the sharpest of pencils, aggressively hunting for savings, taking a hard, unsentimental look at any deal, and walking away if they are not confident it is a serious moneymaker. 
 Pearson and its chief executive, Marjorie Scardino, are often described as being more willing to pay premium prices for what they buy, though they have not made any major acquisitions recently.
 The Journal is the leading finance-oriented newspaper in the United States and The Financial Times holds that distinction in Europe, and uniting them would offer obvious areas for consolidation, like merging or shrinking competing bureaus in many cities. 
 But analysts say the possible advantages go much further: The Journal could largely retreat from Europe and The Financial Times could do the same in North America, they could consolidate printing operations and offer joint deals to advertisers. Similar arrangements could be made between The Economist, half-owned by Pearson, and Barron's, owned by Dow Jones.
 In addition, analysts say that a new corporate parent would be more aggressive than Dow Jones has been about eliminating overlapping jobs at The Journal and Dow Jones Newswires. And some see great advantages in combining the newswires with Interactive Data, a market information service in which Pearson holds a 62 percent stake, creating a more robust competitor to the proposed merger of Thomson and Reuters.
 ''I think our history shows that we value and nurture the things that make our acquisitions unique, and we don't slash and burn,'' said a G. E. executive who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter. ''But obviously, a lot of the strategic value in this would be in consolidation.''
 Despite the appeal, there are obstacles, among them the checkered history of corporate media marriages like the Tribune Company with Times Mirror, and Time Warner with AOL.
 ''You have to be very tough-minded, force people to give up turf, eliminate redundancy, not fantasize synergies that aren't really there, and have someone who's clearly in charge,'' said one media analyst, who was not authorized by his company to talk about the deal. ''But I would expect nothing less from G.E.''
 Several people also raised the possibility of antitrust issues. But the biggest stumbling block by far, is price -- News Corporation has offered $60 a share -- and most media bankers and analysts remain doubtful that G.E. and Pearson will ever make an offer. 
 ''The G.E.-Pearson thing could make a lot of sense,'' said John Kornreich, general partner of J. K. Media, a media investment firm. ''But not at a price like that.''
 In a surprising development yesterday, a group of investors offered to buy a 30 percent stake in Dow Jones for $60 a share -- the same price News Corporation offered for the whole company -- in return for two seats on the board. In a statement, the group said its offer -- which amounts to a $1.5 billion windfall for its shareholders -- would allow Dow Jones to make capital investments and ''remain independent from other media conglomerates.''
 The odd twist is that the group is led by Brad Greenspan, a creator of MySpace, the social networking site, which News Corporation bought in 2005 -- over Mr. Greenspan's objections.

HEADLINE: His Charge: Find a Key to Students' Success

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
Roland G. Fryer, who was hired by Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein to advise him on how to narrow the racial gap in achievement in the city's schools, made his professional name in economics by applying complex algorithms to document how black students fall behind their white peers. But his life story challenges his own calculations. 
 ''In some sense, I am an anomaly,'' said Dr. Fryer, who grew up poor and rose to become an assistant professor of economics at Harvard before he was 30. But he quickly corrected himself and added, ''I am not sure.'' 
 The way he sees it, there are thousands of students in New York's schools who have the potential to be as successful as he is. His job as the system's ''chief equality officer,'' he said, is to find, in his research, the keys to motivating them.
 An affable man with a tendency to be self-deprecating, Dr. Fryer seems comfortable mocking his new job title, with its acronym of C.E.O. 
 ''I didn't come up with it,'' he said in an hourlong interview on Tuesday at the Tweed Courthouse, the headquarters of the city Education Department. Looking across the table at one of the chancellor's press assistants, he laughed and pleaded for some help. ''This is your part.'' 
 Next year, Dr. Fryer will work for the department three days a week, without a salary, while commuting from Boston, where he will teach two classes at Harvard. For the 2008-9 school year, he will work here full time. City officials said his salary had not been determined but would be between $170,000 and $195,000. 
 As befits an academic, Dr. Fryer said it was impossible for him to begin his new job with a set of definite plans. In the interview, he said four times that he was ''still figuring out the questions'' he wanted to answer.
 His first job, though, he said, will be to mine data -- from graduation rates to test scores to demographic information -- to find out why there are wide gulfs between schools. Why, for example, does one school in Bedford-Stuyvesant do so much better than a school just down the block? And he will monitor the pilot program to pay fourth- and seventh-grade students as much as $500 for doing well on a series of standardized tests. That program will begin in 40 schools this fall. He hopes to find other ways to motivate students. 
 ''I don't know what it is, but I will tell you what it can't be,'' Dr. Fryer said. ''It can't be what happened when I was in schools, you know, people come and say, you know, 'Go to school and get a good job.' ''
 Words like that, he said, were not enough, because ''this dream that we are all talking about is less tangible to people who have not actually seen someone making the dream real.'' 
 Most of Dr. Fryer's work until now has been theoretical. He has published studies of how, by the time they are in second grade, black children are months behind their white counterparts. In another paper, he looked at the ways that high-achieving black students in racially integrated schools are less popular with their black peers and are accused of ''acting white.'' 
 In 2005, Dr. Fryer's work gained widespread attention when it was extensively highlighted in ''Freakonomics,'' a best seller by Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt.
 Dr. Fryer, 30, was born in Daytona Beach, Fla. His mother left him when he was young, leaving him with his father, who later became an alcoholic. During the school year, Dr. Fryer lived with his father near Dallas, and spent the summers in Daytona with his grandmother, a schoolteacher. 
 She motivated him, Dr. Fryer said, by telling him she would race to see who could make the beds faster. And if he was really well behaved, he would have a chance to sell the cans she had collected throughout the year -- a small fortune of about $13 for a 10-year-old. 
 (These days, Dr. Fryer said, when he talks to his grandmother about his research, she exclaims, ''They pay you for that?'')
 Chancellor Klein said Dr. Fryer's ideas acknowledge that children are motivated in different ways. 
 ''We know that children are in different environments, with different passions and fears and consequences,'' he said in an interview. ''We have to figure out what gets them to learn. How many kids got an extra dollar or two in their allowance for getting A's?'' 
 Chancellor Klein has long supported Dr. Fryer's ideas for incentives for schoolchildren, inviting him to try them out in several city schools in 2004. That effort was rejected by several schools, but tried in others on a small scale. 
 Mr. Klein met Dr. Fryer at a dinner party given by Lawrence H. Summers, then the president of Harvard. 
 ''Roland is an evidence-driven guy rather than prejudice, instinct or tradition, and that's clearly what is needed now,'' Dr. Summers said in an interview yesterday. ''So much of the research in education has been decades behind -- it has consisted more of platitudes and rhetoric than serious rigor and challenges.'' 
 Dr. Fryer is not lacking in ambition -- he once said he aspires to be someone akin to W. E. B. DuBois -- and said he was interested only in pursuing ''path-breaking'' plans in New York's schools. 
 But he will face hurdles in the labyrinth of the system. Teachers and have already raised questions about the effectiveness of paying students for high test scores. Other academics are privately saying his inexperience may be manifested in naivete. 
 But Dr. Fryer does not seem to be a man with doubts. The moment he knew he wanted to work directly in schools came two years ago, when a principal in Queens asked him to talk a fifth grader out of joining a gang. A few hours later, he was at a seminar at Harvard, arguing over the third decimal point in an equation. 
 ''I didn't know if I had done anything for that kid, really,'' he said, ''but all I could think was, 'Today has shown me a lot.' ''

 A. Wallpaper has experienced a major resurgence, along with the renewed popularity of patterns in general. But it can be expensive, particularly if the room is large. Luckily, wallpaper hanging has no rules, except the obvious: keep the panels straight, and make sure the air bubbles are smoothed out. 
 There is no reason not to paper one wall with your favorite wallcovering -- the wall with the fireplace, say, or the one where you plan to park the sofa -- and paint adjacent walls a complementary color. Far from seeming meager, or as if you couldn't afford more paper, this can give the room a visual jolt without overpowering it with pattern.
 Back in the 1950s the British interior designer John Fowler -- the father of the cozy, highly accessorized English-country look -- took this kind of minimalist approach in a guest room of the Hunting Lodge, his country house in Hampshire, and the idea still looks good. Instead of papering the entire space, he had the walls painted the palest blue and then created stripes by hanging a flowering wallpaper border by Mauny vertically. It is a stylish look that can accommodate any budget, however small. You could use an inexpensive paint and then splurge a bit on a more expensive border, say a deluxe hand-printed one.
 In my own bedroom, I'm planning to paper one portion of a long wall -- the section right behind the headboard. The paper will stretch from floor to ceiling, spanning the width of the bed. The effect, rather like a canopy, will be affordable and, I hope, eye-catching, to give the otherwise nondescript area a focal point.
 The Trellis as Statement
 Q.What is the best source for stylish trellises? I can find only the crosshatched kind.
 A. Some of the most delightful ready-made trellises I know can be found at Trellis Structures of East Templeton, Mass., trellisstructures.com or (888) 285-4624. Among its models are 16 wood patterns, from Palladian to Modern. Some attach to the exterior of a house or an outbuilding; others are free-standing and can line a garden path. They include a Palladian side panel (7 feet tall by 1.5 feet wide, $115) and the New England trellis, an elegant wall-like structure that Edith Wharton would have approved (7 feet 6 inches tall by 6 feet 8 inches wide, $435).
 This summer I'm going to build a small grape trellis across one end of a shed at my country house. I'm copying it from a historic photograph in ''Furnishing the Old-Fashioned Garden: Three Centuries of American Summerhouses, Dovecotes, Privies, Fences and Birdhouses,'' by May Brawley Hill (Harry N. Abrams, 1998).
 This trellis will have two vertical four-by-fours attached to the corners of the shed wall. Screwed horizontally to the front of the four-by-fours will be furring strips (two-by-ones), running from bottom to top, like a ladder. The furring strips will be three inches apart, and as the grapevines grow the tendrils will be threaded by hand through the strips.

HEADLINE: Health Coverage For All Americans

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 As Bob Herbert advocates in ''When Dollars Trump Compassion'' (column, June 19), we should, of course, insure and provide medical treatment to all children. But without universal health care, children could grow up to become uninsured adults. And adults with untreated chronic or serious health conditions could be unable to care for their children, whether the children are sick or healthy. 
 We shouldn't stop caring about the health of our children simply because they turn 18. Without providing health coverage for all Americans, children will remain at risk.
 Victoria Cherney
 Montpelier, Vt., June 19, 2007
 To the Editor:
 I have been moved by and appreciate Bob Herbert's columns about the lack of access to health care. One aspect of the problem that has not been mentioned and that I, as a pediatrician with an economically mixed population, see often, is that parents don't see access to health care as a right.
 When I see a child who hasn't been in for too long, and I ask the parent about it, often the answer I get is that they had no insurance. They are ashamed when they say it, as if it were a failing on their part. When I mention that the United States is the only first-world country that doesn't provide universal health insurance of some kind, they seem stunned. Where is their anger?

HEADLINE: Not Buying It

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
ON a Friday evening last month, the day after New York University's class of 2007 graduated, about 15 men and women assembled in front of Third Avenue North, an N.Y.U. dormitory on Third Avenue and 12th Street. They had come to take advantage of the university's end-of-the-year move-out, when students' discarded items are loaded into big green trash bins by the curb.
 New York has several colleges and universities, of course, but according to Janet Kalish, a Queens resident who was there that night, N.Y.U.'s affluent student body makes for unusually profitable Dumpster diving. So perhaps it wasn't surprising that the gathering at the Third Avenue North trash bin quickly took on a giddy shopping-spree air, as members of the group came up with one first-class find after another. 
 Ben Ibershoff, a dapper man in his 20s wearing two bowler hats, dug deep and unearthed a Sharp television. Autumn Brewster, 29, found a painting of a Mediterranean harbor, which she studied and handed down to another member of the crowd. 
 Darcie Elia, a 17-year-old high school student with a half-shaved head, was clearly pleased with a modest haul of what she called ''random housing stuff'' -- a desk lamp, a dish rack, Swiffer dusters -- which she spread on the sidewalk, drawing quizzical stares from passers-by.
 Ms. Elia was not alone in appreciating the little things. ''The small thrills are when you see the contents of someone's desk and find a book of stamps,'' said Ms. Kalish, 44, as she stood knee deep in the trash bin examining a plastic toiletries holder. 
 A few of those present had stumbled onto the scene by chance (including a janitor from a nearby homeless center, who made off with a working iPod and a tube of body cream), but most were there by design, in response to a posting on the Web site freegan.info. 
 The site, which provides information and listings for the small but growing subculture of anticonsumerists who call themselves freegans -- the term derives from vegans, the vegetarians who forsake all animal products, as many freegans also do -- is the closest thing their movement has to an official voice. And for those like Ms. Elia and Ms. Kalish, it serves as a guide to negotiating life, and making a home, in a world they see as hostile to their values.
 Freegans are scavengers of the developed world, living off consumer waste in an effort to minimize their support of corporations and their impact on the planet, and to distance themselves from what they see as out-of-control consumerism. They forage through supermarket trash and eat the slightly bruised produce or just-expired canned goods that are routinely thrown out, and negotiate gifts of surplus food from sympathetic stores and restaurants. 
 They dress in castoff clothes and furnish their homes with items found on the street; at freecycle.com, where users post unwanted items; and at so-called freemeets, flea markets where no money is exchanged. Some claim to hold themselves to rigorous standards. ''If a person chooses to live an ethical lifestyle it's not enough to be vegan, they need to absent themselves from capitalism,'' said Adam Weissman, 29, who started freegan.info four years ago and is the movement's de facto spokesman. 
 Freeganism dates to the mid-'90s, and grew out of the antiglobalization and environmental movements, as well as groups like Food Not Bombs, a network of small organizations that serve free vegetarian and vegan food to the hungry, much of it salvaged from food market trash. It also has echoes of groups like the Diggers, an anarchist street theater troupe based in Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco in the 1960's, which gave away food and social services.
 According to Bob Torres, a sociology professor at St. Lawrence University in Canton, N.Y., who is writing a book about the animal rights movement -- which shares many ideological positions with freeganism -- the freegan movement has become much more visible and increasingly popular over the past year, in part as a result of growing frustrations with mainstream environmentalism. 
 Environmentalism, Mr. Torres said, ''is becoming this issue of, consume the right set of green goods and you're green,'' regardless of how much in the way of natural resources those goods require to manufacture and distribute. 
 ''If you ask the average person what can you do to reduce global warming, they'd say buy a Prius,'' he added. 
 There are freegans all over the world, in countries as far afield as Sweden, Brazil, South Korea, Estonia and England (where much has been made of what The Sun recently called the ''wacky new food craze'' of trash-bin eating), and across the United States as well . 
 In Southern California, for example, ''you can find just about anything in the trash, and on a consistent basis, too,'' said Marko Manriquez, 28, who has just graduated from the University of California at San Diego with a bachelor's degree in media studies and is the creator of ''Freegan Kitchen,'' a video blog that shows gourmet meals being made from trash-bin ingredients. ''This is how I got my futon, chair, table, shelves. And I'm not talking about beat-up stuff. I mean it's not Design Within Reach, but it's nice.'' 
 But New York City in particular -- the financial capital of the world's richest country -- has emerged as a hub of freegan activity, thanks largely to Mr. Weissman's zeal for the cause and the considerable free time he has to devote to it. (He doesn't work and lives at home in Teaneck, N.J., with his father and elderly grandparents.) 
 Freegan.info sponsors organize Trash Tours that typically attract a dozen or more people, as well as feasts at which groups of about 20 people gather in apartments around the city to share food and talk politics. 
 In the last year or so, Mr. Weissman said, the site has increased the number and variety of its events, which have begun attracting many more first-time participants. Many of those who have taken part in one new program, called Wild Foraging Walks -- workshops that teach people to identify edible plants in the wilderness -- have been newcomers, he said.
 The success of the movement in New York may also be due to the quantity and quality of New York trash. As of 2005, individuals, businesses and institutions in the United States produced more than 245 million tons of municipal solid waste, according to the E.P.A. That means about 4.5 pounds per person per day. The comparable figure for New York City, meanwhile, is about 6.1 pounds, according to statistics from the city's Sanitation Department. 
 ''We have a lot of wealthy people, and rich people throw out more trash than poor people do,'' said Elizabeth Royte, whose book ''Garbage Land'' (Little, Brown, 2005) traced the route her trash takes through the city. ''Rich people are also more likely to throw things out based on style obsolescence -- like changing the towels when you're tired of the color.''
 At the N.Y.U. Dorm Dive, as the event was billed, the consensus was that this year's spoils weren't as impressive as those in years past. Still, almost anything needed to decorate and run a household -- a TV cart, a pillow, a file cabinet, a half-finished bottle of Jagermeister -- was there for the taking, even if those who took them were risking health, safety and a $100 fine from the Sanitation Department. 
 Ms. Brewster and her mother, who had come from New Jersey, loaded two area rugs into their cart. Her mother, who declined to give her name, seemed to be on a search for laundry detergent, and was overjoyed to discover a couple of half-empty bottles of Trader Joe's organic brand. (Free and organic is a double bonus). Nearby, a woman munched on a found bag of Nature's Promise veggie fries.
 As people stuffed their backpacks, Ms. Kalish, who organized the event (Mr. Weissman arrived later), demonstrated the cooperative spirit of freeganism, asking the divers to pass items down to people on the sidewalk and announcing her finds for anyone in need of, say, a Hoover Shop-Vac. 
 ''Sometimes people will swoop in and grab something, especially when you see a half-used bottle of Tide detergent,'' she said. ''Who wouldn't want it? But most people realize there's plenty to go around.'' She rooted around in the trash bin and found several half-eaten jars of peanut butter. ''It's a never-ending supply,'' she said. 
 Many freegans are predictably young and far to the left politically, like Ms. Elia, the 17-year-old, who lives with her father in Manhattan. She said she became a freegan both for environmental reasons and because ''I'm not down with capitalism.'' 
 There are also older freegans, like Ms. Kalish, who hold jobs and appear in some ways to lead middle-class lives. A high school Spanish teacher, Ms. Kalish owns a car and a two-family house in Queens, renting half of it as a ''capitalist landlord,'' she joked. Still, like most freegans, she seems attuned to the ecological effects of her actions. In her house, for example, she has laid down a mosaic of freegan carpet parcels instead of replacing her aging wooden floor because, she said, ''I'd have to take trees from the forest.'' 
 Not buying any new manufactured products while living in the United States is, of course, basically impossible, as is avoiding everything that requires natural resources to create, distribute or operate. Don't freegans use gas or electricity to cook, for example, or commercial products to brush their teeth? 
 ''Once in a while I may buy a box of baking soda for toothpaste,'' Mr. Weissman said. ''And, sure, getting that to market has negative impacts, like everything.'' But, he said, parsing the point, a box of baking soda is more ecologically friendly than a tube of toothpaste, because its cardboard container is biodegradable. 
 These contradictions and others have led some people to suggest that freegans are hypocritical, making use of the capitalist system even as they rail against it. And even Mr. Weissman, who is often doctrinaire about the movement, acknowledges when pushed that absolute freeganism is an impossible dream.
 Mr. Torres said: ''I think there's a conscious recognition among freegans that you can never live perfectly.'' He added that generally freegans ''try to reduce the impact.'' 
 It's not that freeganism doesn't require serious commitment. For freegans, who believe that the production and transport of every product contributes to economic and social injustice, usually in multiple ways, any interaction with the marketplace is fraught. And for some freegans in particular -- for instance, Madeline Nelson, who until recently was living an upper-middle-class Manhattan life with all the attendant conveniences and focus on luxury goods -- choosing this way of life involves a considerable, even radical, transformation.
 Ms. Nelson, who is 51, spent her 20s working in restaurants and living in communal houses, but by 2003 she was earning a six-figure salary as a communications director for Barnes & Noble. That year, while demonstrating against the Iraq war, she began to feel hypocritical, she said, explaining: ''I thought, isn't this safe? Here I am in my corporate job, going to protests every once in a while. And part of my job was to motivate the sales force to sell more stuff.''
 After a year of progressively scaling back -- no more shopping at Eileen Fisher, no more commuting by means other than a bike -- Ms. Nelson, who had a two-bedroom apartment with a mortgage in Greenwich Village, quit her job in 2005 to devote herself full-time to political activism and freeganism. 
 She sold her apartment, put some money into savings, and bought a one-bedroom in Flatbush, Brooklyn, that she owns outright. 
 ''My whole point is not to be paying into corporate America, and I hated paying a big loan to a bank,'' she said while fixing lunch in her kitchen one recent afternoon. The meal -- potato and watercress soup and crackers and cheese -- had been made entirely from refuse left outside various grocery stores in Manhattan and Brooklyn. 
 The bright and airy prewar apartment Ms. Nelson shares with two cats doesn't look like the home of someone who spends her evenings rooting through the garbage. But after some time in the apartment, a visitor begins to see the signs of Ms. Nelson's anticonsumerist way of life. 
 An old lampshade in the living room has been trimmed with fabric to cover its fraying parts, leaving a one-inch gap where the material ran out. The ficus tree near the window came not from a florist, Ms. Nelson said, but from the trash, as did the CD rack. A 1920s loveseat belonged to her grandmother, and an 18th-century, Louis XVI-style armoire in the bedroom is a vestige of her corporate life.
 The kitchen cabinets and refrigerator are stuffed with provisions -- cornmeal, Pirouline cookies, vegetarian cage-free eggs -- appropriate for a passionate cook who entertains often. All were free.
 She longs for a springform pan in which to make cheesecakes, but is waiting for one to come up on freecycle.com. There are no new titles on the bookshelves; she hasn't bought a new book in six months. ''Books were my impulse buy,'' said Ms. Nelson, whose short brown hair and glasses frame a youthful face. Now she logs onto bookcrossing.com, where readers share used books, or goes to the public library.
 But isn't she depriving herself unnecessarily? And what's so bad about buying books, anyway? ''I do have some mixed feelings,'' Ms. Nelson said. ''It's always hard to give up class privilege. But freegans would argue that the capitalist system is not sustainable. You're exploiting resources.'' She added, ''Most people work 40-plus hours a week at jobs they don't like to buy things they don't need.'' 
 Since becoming a freegan, Ms. Nelson has spent her time posting calendar items and other information online and doing paralegal work on behalf of bicyclists arrested at Critical Mass anticar rallies. ''I'm not sitting in the house eating bonbons,'' she said. ''I'm working. I'm just not working for money.'' 
 She is also spending a lot of time making rounds for food and supplies at night, and has come to know the cycles of the city's trash. She has learned that fruit tends to get thrown out more often in the summer (she freezes it and makes sorbet), and that businesses are a source for envelopes. A reliable spot to get bread is Le Pain Quotidien, a chain of bakery-restaurants that tosses out six or seven loaves a night. But Ms. Nelson doesn't stockpile. ''The sad fact is you don't need to,'' she said. ''More trash will be there tomorrow.''
 By and large, she said, her friends have been understanding, if not exactly enthusiastic about adopting freeganism for themselves. ''When she told me she was doing this I wasn't really surprised -- Madeline is a free spirit,'' said Eileen Dolan, a librarian at a Manhattan law firm who has known Ms. Nelson since their college days at Stony Brook. But while Ms. Dolan agrees that society is wasteful, she said that going freegan is not something she would ever do. ''It's a huge time commitment,'' she said.
 ONE evening a week after the Dorm Dive, a group of about 20 freegans gathered in a sparely furnished, harshly lit basement apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn, to hold a feast. It was an egalitarian affair with no one officially in charge, but Mr. Weissman projected authority, his blue custodian-style work pants and fuzzy black beard giving him the air of a Latin American revolutionary as he wandered around, trailed by a Korean television crew. 
 Ms. Kalish stood over the sink, slicing vegetables for a stir-fry with a knife she had found in a trash bin at N.Y.U. A pot of potatoes simmered on the stove. These, like much of the rest of the meal, had been gathered two nights earlier, when Mr. Weissman, Ms. Kalish and others had met in front of a Food Emporium in Manhattan and rummaged through the store's clear garbage bags. 
 The haul had been astonishing in its variety: sealed bags of organic vegetable medley, bagged salad, heirloom tomatoes, key limes, three packaged strawberries-and-chocolate-dip kits, carrots, asparagus, grapes, a carton of organic soy milk (expiration date: July 9), grapefruit, mushrooms and, for those willing to partake, vacuum-packed herb turkey breast. (Some freegans who avoid meat will nevertheless eat it rather than see it go to waste.)
 As operatic music played on a radio, people mingled and pitched in. One woman diced onions, rescuing pieces that fell on floor. Another, who goes by the name Petal, emptied bags of salad into a pan. As rigorous and radical as the freegan world view can be, there is also something quaint about the movement, at least the version that Mr. Weissman promotes, with its embrace of hippie-ish communal activities and its household get-togethers that rely for diversion on conversation rather electronic entertainment.
 Making things last is part of the ethos. Christian Gutierrez, a 33-year-old former model and investment banker, sat at the small kitchen table, chatting. Mr. Gutierrez, who quit his banking job at Matthews Morris & Company in 2004 to pursue filmmaking, became a freegan last year, and opened a free workshop on West 36th Street in Manhattan to teach bicycle repair. He plans to add lessons in fixing home computers in the near future. 
 Mr. Gutierrez's lifestyle, like Ms. Nelson's, became gradually more constricted in the absence of a steady income. He lived in a Midtown loft until last year, when, he said, he got into a legal battle with his landlord over a rent increase -- a relationship ''ruined by greed,'' he said. After that, he lived in his van for a while, then found an illegal squat in SoHo, which he shares with two others. Mr. Gutierrez had a middle-class upbringing in Dallas, and he said he initially found freeganism off-putting. But now he is steadfastly devoted to the way of life. 
 As people began to load plates of food, he leaned in and offered a few words of wisdom: ''Opening that first bag of trash,'' he said, ''is the biggest step.''

HEADLINE: On the Waterfront: A Matter of Preservation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Brooklyn Waterfront Called Endangered Site'' (Arts pages, June 14):
 As the developer of the Domino Sugar site on the Brooklyn waterfront, we agree with Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, about the need to integrate historic sites into development plans. 
 We strongly support the landmarking of the historic Domino refinery building, a centerpiece of the 11.5-acre site. We also want to preserve and build on the city's greatest legacy -- creating a home where people of diverse economic and cultural backgrounds can live together and form strong communities. 
 Our goal is a balanced community that preserves the best of the past while providing new parks, access to the waterfront and mixed-income housing with up to 30 percent affordable to low- and moderate-income families -- a community priority and our mission.
 Michael Lappin
 New York, June 14, 2007
 The writer is president of the Community Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit housing group, and CPC Resources, its development arm.
 To the Editor: 
 The Bloomberg administration is committed to protecting New York City's industrial legacy not only along the Brooklyn waterfront but also in all five boroughs. 
 In addition to the former Domino sugar-processing plant, more than 50 industrial and commercial buildings in Dumbo and 12 structures that make up the former Eberhard Faber Pencil Company complex in Greenpoint are being considered for designation as landmarks by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. 
 Since 2002, the commission has granted landmark status to scores of buildings that recall the city's rich industrial past, from the Estey Piano Company Factory in the Bronx, to the Gansevoort Market Historic District in Manhattan.
 These successes, as well as the thousands of others the commission expects to accomplish in the months and years ahead, come at a time of unprecedented economic growth and change, demonstrating that protecting our distinctive heritage and moving our city forward can go hand in hand.

HEADLINE: No, Despite the Polls, It's Not Really a Horse Race (Not Yet, Anyway)

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
For at least a generation, press critics have complained bitterly about the news media's obsession with polls and the horse-race aspect of the presidential campaign. The constant focus on who is ahead is a pointless distraction, those critics argue, from what should be the real substance of the campaign, like what the candidates would do as president. 
 But there is another reason to avoid putting too much stock in any assessment of the horse race, more than six months before the voting begins in the Iowa caucuses: It may have very little relationship to the ultimate outcome. 
 Events change, voters change, candidates and campaigns implode, new ones enter. (Like, say, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, who appeared to edge closer to a race-scrambling independent candidacy this week.) Even the activists, at this stage of the campaign, are not terribly focused or committed. Pollsters say they may be measuring whims and name recognition as much as settled judgments. 
 Yes, the national polls show certain patterns: Among the Republicans, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York tends to be at the head of the pack; former Senator Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee and Senator John McCain of Arizona are right behind, and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts is moving up behind them. And yet, consider this: Only 44 percent of the Republicans who said the abortion issue was ''very important to them'' could identify Mr. Giuliani as the ''pro-choice candidate'' in a recent Pew Research Center poll. 
 As Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew center, put it: ''People aren't paying a lot of attention. Their attitudes are soft, so tests of their preferences are not reliable.''
 A little history backs him up. Four years ago at this point, Howard Dean's campaign for the Democratic nomination was beginning to take off; his fund-raising, especially over the Internet, shocked his rivals in the end-of-June campaign finance reports.
 ''In May of 2003, nobody thought Howard Dean was possible,'' said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. ''By the fall of 2003, the talk was that he was unstoppable. And the common wisdom was wrong at both points.'' 
 By the end of 2003, Mr. Dean was the clear front-runner for the Democrats in some polls. Then, in 2004, the voters entered the equation, and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the eventual nominee, suddenly began to move.
 ''Three weeks out, let alone seven months out, John Kerry was well behind in Iowa and New Hampshire -- and the truth is, in the course of less than three weeks, he tripled his vote in Iowa and quadrupled his vote in New Hampshire,'' said Mark Mellman, Mr. Kerry's pollster that year.
 Most voters simply did not make their minds up until after Jan. 1, Mr. Mellman added. 
 Bill McInturff, a pollster for Mr. McCain in 2000 and today, said that national polls were of limited utility at this stage, and that state polls were subject to drastic change. 
 ''Results in the early races ripple through the primaries,'' Mr. McInturff said, recalling Mr. McCain's upset victory in New Hampshire seven years ago, just before the race moved to South Carolina. ''The day before New Hampshire, McCain was 20 points down in South Carolina. The day after, he was tied.'' 
 The 1992 campaign offered another object lesson in the limits of early polls: That big, outside events can upend any tidy news media narrative for how a campaign will proceed. President George Bush seemed invincible after the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf. But the memory of the war receded, and the economic slowdown settled in. And suddenly, in the fall of 1991, Mr. Bush's popularity plummeted, and the Democratic nomination seemed worth having. 
 Polls, of course, are only one way to handicap a race. Fund-raising tells a lot, and so do more intangible standards -- like a candidate's experience, discipline and ability to avoid mistakes, or to handle them. Some candidates, like Bill Clinton in 1991, have a strategic sense and a political rationale -- where they want to take the party and the country -- that makes their campaigns seem sturdier from the start. 
 And polls can be useful beyond the horse race, for exploring, say, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's continued strength among women or Senator Barack Obama's among affluent voters or the intensity of conservatives in a post-Bush era. 
 But some analysts and political operatives have long complained that horse-race polls, at this stage, can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. A candidate does not do well in the polls, therefore does not get good (or much) coverage, therefore does not raise money, therefore does not do well in the polls.
 Mr. Mellman, who does not have a horse in the current race, says, ''What you've got is a lot of information -- poll numbers, early endorsements -- that don't necessarily have a lot of real meaning to the outcome of the race, but the campaigns peddle them as metrics of success.'' 
 Mr. McInturff said, ''Polling affects press coverage, which affects your name ID, which affects polling.'' Even so, he adds that candidates can defy this by breaking out in early states, as Mr. McCain did in 2000.
 This, in the end, is a source of comfort to the candidates who do not place near the top in the current horse-race polls, like Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware. ''Notwithstanding what you write about,'' Mr. Biden told reporters this week, ''nobody has made up their minds in the Democratic primary.'' He added, ''Nobody.'' 
 James Carville, a key adviser to Mr. Clinton in the 1992 campaign, puts it slightly differently: ''I've never seen so many pay attention to so much that means so little.''

HEADLINE: A Prime Minister Cool to Culture Will Leave Behind a Hot Arts Scene

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: LONDON, June 20 

 BODY:
Over the past 10 years, while cultural innovation has seemingly been sparse in traditional creative breeding grounds like the United States and France, the arts have been flourishing in Britain. Never before have museums been so popular; not since the 1960s have artists, composers, playwrights, designers and the like enjoyed such prestige.
 Could this be Tony Blair's brightest legacy as he steps down as prime minister on Wednesday? 
 True, given the attention that Mr. Blair has devoted to ''saving'' education, health and Africa, this is not how he would like to be remembered: Apart from some youthful guitar strumming, he is not a cultural animal. And it is of course not how he is likely to be remembered here: He will not be easily forgiven by many Britons for leading Britain into the Iraqi war.
 Yet during his decade in office Britain has shaken off its creative lethargy and emerged as the liveliest cultural territory in the West. And even if Mr. Blair himself is not much loved in artistic circles, this metamorphosis has taken place under his watch.
 So does he deserve credit?
 In 1997, 18 years of Tory rule had left the country's arts infrastructure in a dilapidated state. But it was actually the most recent Tory prime minister, John Major, who provided the key to sweeping renovation of cultural institutions when the arts were assigned a significant share of profits from a new national lottery.
 In a sense, then, it was merely Mr. Blair's good fortune to be at Downing Street when this vast investment bore fruit: Just in London, the British Museum, the Royal Opera House, Sadler's Wells Theater, the National Portrait Gallery and Tate Britain were all modernized and expanded, while Tate Modern was created on the South Bank in London.
 Still, his government did multiply the budget of the Arts Council of England in such a way that funds have flowed more generously into long-struggling cultural centers, theaters and orchestras that depend on subsidies to survive. Regional theater, virtually abandoned by the Tories, has also returned to life.
 Further, in a popular -- and populist -- gesture, the government agreed to cover the additional cost of free entrance to 24 national galleries and museums. As a result visits to these collections have increased by 53 percent since 1997, with Tate Modern particularly successful in drawing people unaccustomed to visiting museums.
 Two unrelated variables have also bolstered this mini-renaissance. Steady economic growth has fueled prosperity, and fat wallets have always helped the arts -- and, in this case, not only Britain's market-savvy contemporary artists, like Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin. Despite the high price of tickets for, say, West End theaters or the Royal Opera House, the public keeps coming.
 At the same time, thanks to this economic growth and the new immigration that it has drawn, London has become Europe's most international city. And this has enormously broadened its arts horizon: from being the capital of ''Little England,'' London now welcomes foreign culture: artists at Tate Modern, theater companies at the Barbican Center, modern dance troupes at Sadler's Wells.
 Yet, bizarrely, instead of celebrating cultural excellence as an end unto itself, Mr. Blair's government has all too often preferred to camouflage its support for the arts either as an economic strategy to promote job creation in the cultural ''industries'' or as a tool for social inclusion intended to embrace ethnic minorities or disaffected urban youth.
 Equally puzzlingly, only in March this year, during the countdown to his retirement from office, did the prime minister himself step forward to boast that London was now the creative capital of the world, its arts enjoying a ''golden age,'' ''more confident, assertive, creative and alive'' than a decade ago.
 But while many cultural luminaries were willing to buy that claim, his speech was a one-off. His Downing Street Web site lists 17 ''big issues'' on which Mr. Blair expounds his views and achievements. These include Northern Ireland, Africa, Iraq and Afghanistan as well as numerous domestic issues, but not culture.
 So has his designated successor, Gordon Brown, any incentive to identify with the arts? Certainly he has never displayed any interest in culture. Further, over the past 10 years, as chancellor of the exchequer and therefore head of the Treasury, he was always perceived as opposed to increasing government spending on the arts.
 But as prime minister he now has a larger constituency to please. And on June 18 the opposition Conservative Party did him the favor of pointing out potential pitfalls.
 The Tories' culture spokesman, Hugo Swire, suggested in a newspaper interview that ''we do not want to ban free admissions, but we believe museums should have the right to charge if they wish.'' Such was the backlash, though, that Mr. Swire retracted his thought almost as soon as it had appeared in print. And presumably Mr. Brown took note: Free admissions to museums are now sacrosanct.
 One issue that Mr. Brown cannot avoid, though, is financing of the 2012 London Olympics. With the cost of building the necessary infrastructure in east London now far exceeding original estimates, the arts world is already alarmed that the Department of Culture, Media and Sports will take from culture to give to sports.
 The Olympics were of course intended as another feather in the cap of ''cool'' London, but the cost overrun and management disarray are already eroding popular enthusiasm for the games. And if the arts are called on to pay for this, Mr. Brown may well find the public sympathizing with the cultural world's vociferous laments.
 In a sense, then, this is Mr. Blair's legacy. More than ever, a significant part of the British population takes a lively arts scene for granted. This may not have been Mr. Blair's highest priority, but a combination of government policy, economic growth, artistic talent and, let's face it, a cult of celebrity has given the public a stake in what might once have been viewed as an elitist pastime.
 Mr. Blair may prefer to be remembered as a global statesman, but one day he may be happy to be associated with a cultural revival. Meanwhile, as he moves into 10 Downing Street, Mr. Brown may be wise not to forget that artists and intellectuals often have the last word on how politicians go down in history.

HEADLINE: Mike Wallace: 'Gotham,' Public Health, the Meaning of 'Manhattan'

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Mike Wallace, a historian of New York City, answers readers' questions on his writing; on public health and public schools; on the meaning of the name "Manhattan"; and on the cyclical nature of history. 

 BODY:
Here is the latest installment from Mike Wallace, the historian and author of "Gotham," who has been taking questions from readers this week. He will post more answers on Friday, but he is not accepting any new questions. 
Michael Hurley: 
Dr. Wallace: An excellent question, and I wish I could give you a precise answer. The safest response is that I'm plunking away at my computer as fast as I can, and am looking forward to its completion as much (probably more!) than you are. Should you be interested in seeing a teaser of sorts, a snippet (entitled "New York and the Nazis"), extracted from a chapter in progress, will be appearing in the next issue (No. 7) of The Reading Room, out in about a week.

Leighkaren Cherrington: 
Dr. Wallace: "Hilly island" is my understanding, and it's what Ted Burrows and I went with in Gotham I. The argument goes that it's an amalgam of the Munsee word "mannah" (island) and the northern Algonquian suffix "hatin," meaning hills, but this is a murky business, at best. Another analysis traces the word to "Mannahattanink," Munsee for "place of general intoxication." For a more definitive answer, should one exist, you'll have to consult a specialist who's up to date on the recent literature. 
As to the island's vendors, the safe answer is that they were members of a band of Munsee speakers, Munsee being a dialect of the Delaware language, in which their name for themselves was Lenape-"Men" or "People," and they called their land Lenapehoking - "where the Lenape dwell." These bands - perhaps a dozen or so - were spread across the territory between eastern Connecticut and central New Jersey, and within their particular spheres, tended to move around a lot, alternating between different campsites. As one contemporary observer wrote, the Lenapes lived "very rudely and rovingly, shifting from place to place, accordingly to their exigencies, and gains of fishing and fowling and hunting, never confining their rambling humors to any settled Mansions." Which is why some people think that the people who "sold" Minuit the island might well have been Canarsees, whose main campsite was in Brooklyn, where King's Highway now crosses Flatbush Avenue, and didn't really "live" here, but were only in town for some clamming. But again, this is a question best addressed to experts.
Kurt Conklin: 
Dr. Wallace: On the public health front, I think there's work to be done on the history of ecological illness -- the fallout from pollution, in particular. We've got a bead on the relationship nowadays between highway exhaust in the South Bronx and high rates of asthma there -- but the longer term impact of chemical and other air and water pollutants on city residents deserves further analysis.
In education, one thing that's interested me recently is the city's pioneer role in teaching tolerance. In the 1920s, partly in response to the anti-immigration furor that produced the restrictive 1924 legislation, an local area high school teacher, one Rachel DuBois, set out to combat nationalist chauvinism and foster "world-mindedness" in her students by showing them what other countries had contributed to human progress. She organized a sequence of school assemblies at which representatives of different groups were invited to perform, present or discuss some collective accomplishment. Determined as she was to counter negative stereotypes about assorted "others," her assemblies tended toward the uplifting - students listened to Italian operas, watched German folk dances, observed a Japanese flower arranger or a peanut bread maker at work (the latter a nod to African-American agro-scientist George Washington Carver). Though even such mild measures were considered subversive by some.
In the 30s, against a backdrop of Nazi racialism, she expanded her program, and tested out new methodologies in conjunction with Leonard Covello, pioneering principal of Benjamin Franklin High School in East Harlem. When it opened in 1934, the school had 34 ethnic groups were in attendance - including substantial percentages of blacks, Puerto Ricans, Germans, Jews and Irish. Covello deemed the experiment a success, and urged the New York City Board of Education to adopt her approach universally.
As the global situation worsened, educational authorities increasingly warmed to DuBois' argument that the city's schools - the only "common meeting ground of all our varieties of cultures" - had a responsibility to help their 1,250,000 pupils deal with growing world and local tensions. Finally, on December 14, 1938, prompted by Kristallnacht horrors, the Board passed a "Tolerance Resolution," which required all schools to hold assemblies that stressed the importance of "tolerance and freedom for all men," and made children aware of the "contributions of all races and nationalities." DuBois' Service Bureau office was besieged by teachers seeking guidance; a manual called Adventures in Intercultural Education was developed; and during 1939 she offered teacher training courses at NYU. The idea caught fire across the country, with school districts nationwide implementing programs in "intercultural education" and local teachers colleges offering courses on using the methodology.
Marisa Cravens: 
Dr. Wallace: It's not just New York's history that's cyclical, it's the country's, and indeed much of the world's. There were ups and downs as early as the colonial era, but it was really only in the early nineteenth century that the modern roller coaster ride began. The canal era boom of the 1820s-30s raced to culmination and crisis in 1837, then tumbled into a seven year depression. The rail-spurred prosperity of 1844-57 was interrupted by the Panic of 1857, reignited by the Civil War, then snuffed out by the Panic of 1873, which inaugurated a lengthy period of hard times. Resurgence in the 1880s gave way to depression in the 1890s. Corporate consolidation and war with Spain ushered in prosperity in the 1900s, which subsided after the Panic of 1907. World War I and a consumer goods revolution led to the 1920s boom, which collapsed into the 1930s depression. Lifted again by the Second World War the city flourished during the long postwar boom, until laid low by the mid 1970s recession. A 1980s quasi-boom buckled in 1987, making way for the stagnant early 1990s, the brisker dot.com revival, and then a fin-de-siecle tumble, even before the towers came down.
These cycles created characteristic and remarkably similar cultures of boom and bust. The jaunty and expansive 1830s, 1850s, 1900s, 1920s, 1950s, and 1980s -- times of comparably frenetic construction and high living in the city -- gave way to the depressed 1840s, 1870s, 1890s, 1930s and 1970s, periods marked by unemployment, homelessness, and contentious protest movements.
Given that the rules of the capitalist game remain in place, it's hard to imagine that they won't generate yet another turn of the cyclical wheel. It's true that there are more sophisticated tools in place with which to steer the economy, but I'm hardly alone in seeing disturbing signs of fragility and instability in the economy - from a colossal balance of payments deficit and reliance on the kindness of Chinese bond buyers, to the really scary fact that hedge funds have managed to do an end run around what remains of the New Deal regulatory apparatus, which has been badly eroded over the last twenty years. Given that these huge pools of capital can slosh around the planet at will, taking ever riskier positions as opportunities for arbitrage flatten out, while sucking in not just superrich folks' megabucks, but your and my bank and pension fund monies, it's no surprise that a consummate insider like former S.E.C. Chairman William H. Donaldson recently called the hedge-fund industry "a ticking time bomb that is going to blow up at some point."

HEADLINE: Yoga at the Crossroads of the World

BYLINE: JENNIFER 8. LEE


HIGHLIGHT: Dozens gather in Times Square to celebrate the summer solstice through yoga sessions. 

 BODY:
About 80 men and women -- some from as far as California and Honduras -- woke up extra early to visit one of the world's busiest intersections in search for serenity.
A fence guarded the group of people in Times Square in Manhattan as they listened to Douglass Stewart, a lead yoga instructor, belt out directions. Taxis honked horns and fire trucks blared by with their sirens loud. Yet, the group of people were unfazed as they shuffled on their mats.
More than 800 yoga enthusiasts registered for six sessions, said Tim Tompkins, a yoga enthusiast and president of the Times Square Alliance, the sponsor of the event. The sessions will go throughout the day, with the last one starting at about 7:30 p.m. This is the event's fourth year; the event is held to coincide with the summer solstice. The Times Square Alliance also sponsors a New Year's Eve celebration. 
"What better way to bring in the summer solstice in the most chaotic place in the city," Mr. Tompkins said. 
Attendance has grown considerably since 2003, when Mr. Stewart and Mr. Tompkins and another friend performed yoga at 5:30 a.m. at the intersection of Seventh Avenue and Broadway. The next two years, interest in the yoga event rose appreciably. 
All six yoga sessions scheduled for today are being held on the traffic island where the Armed Forces Recruiting Station sits. Carol Solimene, 45, who came from her home in Tiverton, R.I., for the session, said she has practiced yoga for 13 years. 
"It was worth the trip," Ms. Solimene said of doing yoga in the unusual environment. "I found it to be energizing in its own way."
A native New Yorker, Robin Downs, flew in from her Los Angeles home for Father's Day. She planned her schedule around the yoga event. She has been practicing yoga for 12 years. 
"I came back to experience Times Square in a different way." Ms. Downs said. "The session was a sense of peace amongst all of the madness. I'm going to make this trip an annual event."

HEADLINE: In Virginia, a Blue Ridge Retreat That's 'a Little Undiscovered'

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

 BODY:
JOSEPH RADA had been a New Jersey boy his whole life -- born in Perth Amboy, grew up in Holmdel, worked in Elizabeth, raised a family in Lincroft. Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains were hardly on his mind.
 ''One day I was at work, and one of my buddies said he bought a place on a lake down here and would I come visit him on a vacation,'' Mr. Rada, a retired supervisor for a natural gas company, said of his first trip to Smith Mountain Lake, in 1992. ''It wasn't a year before I bought a house here, too. Who in Jersey could have a house overlooking a lake with a dock for a couple-hundred-thousand dollars?''
 Mr. Rada has since sold that first house -- at a 200 percent profit, he said -- and now owns a three-bedroom, three-bath town house he bought for $320,000 two years ago in the Mariners Landing development at Smith Mountain Lake. It has a sunset view of the lake from the back covered porch and a sunrise view, only disturbed by the first hole of the Mariners Landing golf course, from the front covered porch. 
 ''It's all too relaxing here,'' he said. ''I meet people all the time who come here for a second home or retirement from New Jersey.''
 The lake, southeast of Roanoke, was created between 1963 and 1966 with the damming of the Roanoke River and some tributaries. The region around the lake takes in towns in Franklin, Pittsylvania and Bedford Counties.
 Jacki Spillett arrived from Florida. Her husband, Rick, operates hotels in Florida and owns a small hotel company, and they had spent a number of vacations over those years visiting her sister, who lives on Smith Mountain Lake.
 ''My husband is in the rat race, and people in Florida drive like maniacs,'' said Mrs. Spillett, who has four children and four grandchildren. ''When we leave Florida and come to the real South, there is a different attitude -- teenagers with 'yes, ma'ams' and 'no, sirs.' In Virginia, everything is slowed down, and it is a wonderful way to live.''
 So now the Spilletts, who live in North Palm Beach, Fla., spend a lot of the summer in their four-bedroom house on the lake. Even the son who lives in Hawaii comes to visit, she said. 
 And Smith Mountain Lake has that odd combination of nothing and everything to do. ''There aren't really places to go clubbing or that many organized events,'' said Rob Gerner, who attended the University of Virginia in the mid-1960s, moved to the region in the late 1970s and became a real estate agent there. ''People tend to just use the lake in whatever way possible. They fish or boat or water-ski. They hike. They sit out and look at the scenery. It's not a fast life here, just a good one.''
 The Scene
 Smith Mountain Lake is mostly a late-spring-through-early-fall kind of place. There is no real snow-skiing area -- it is a bit too far south -- and the lake is best when the weather is warm.
 ''You come here even in May and there may only be 50 boats out on the lake,'' Mr. Gerner said. ''We're still a little undiscovered.''
 Joan Griffith said the region is still trying to find its identity, but is filling with people who want to create a community.
 ''There are newcomers clubs and garden clubs and just a feeling of people wanting to find a new lifestyle,'' she said. She has reveled in her whiplash-like life -- growing up in Minnesota, working in Arizona, moving to a log cabin in West Virginia, then coming to Smith Mountain Lake and deciding to sell real estate.
 ''I never really lived in the South, but the people were just so friendly and the lake was so beautiful,'' she said. ''High-pressure people like me seem to just slow down when they get here.''
 There are a few restaurants around the lake and four golf courses, but most socializing in Smith Mountain Lake, residents say, takes place on or by the water or at home.
 ''You see people fishing together, but mostly they meet at the dock or in the state park and then invite each other over for dinner,'' said Mr. Gerner, adding that, for culture, people go to Roanoke or Lynchburg, where there are colleges, clubs and minor league sports teams.
 ''I'm sure it will change a little bit if more people move in permanently, but so far it seems everyone comes here looking for the same thing: a bit of rest from whatever hectic place they came from.''
 Pros
 Smith Mountain Lake has 500 miles of shoreline, with mountain and water views almost everywhere. The lake is clean and accessible from many docks, both private and public. Roads may be rural and most often two-lane, but they are rarely clogged. People tend to eat at home, so restaurant lines are almost nonexistent. Property taxes are low -- about $1,500 on a $300,000 house -- because there are few schools to support.
 Cons
 The area is remote. It is 45 minutes from Roanoke, which, while pleasant, is no metropolis. It is mostly a do-it-yourself place, where people boat or fish or swim on their own. It is not a place for people who need organized activities or more than rudimentary services and entertainment. 
 The Real Estate Market
 There was a time, in the late 1970s, said Mary Lou McDonald, an agent with EastLake Real Estate, when land around Smith Mountain Lake was as cheap as the tobacco grown on it. ''People tell me of buying five acres for $500 an acre,'' she said. ''This is still an inexpensive place for what it is, but not anything like that.''
 There have been three rushes toward second-home development at Smith Mountain Lake. The first was in the mid-1980s, when some developers put up a few town houses and single homes near the lake, but, Mr. Gerner said, it still seemed too remote for most middle-class people who could afford beach or mountain property.
 Then in the 1990s, fresh off the sustained economic boom, there was a little push for high-end lakefront property, which at the time, Mr. Gerner said, could go for about $300,000 for a large three-bedroom house with its own dock on the lake. That died off about six or seven years ago, with the general economic downturn.
 About four years ago, he said, soon-to-be-retiring baby boomers started discovering the area. Town house condominium complexes, like Mariners Landing, with playgrounds, pools and tennis courts, started being built.
 This spring, a two-year-old, three-bedroom, three-bathroom house on a golf course with a shared dock on the lake was going for $535,000. A 1,400-square-foot town house with a single-slip dock was for sale for $334,000. A three-bedroom house built in 1973, on one acre on a peninsula, was for sale for $734,000.
 ''I'm guessing that would be a teardown, though,'' said Ms. Griffith, who sells real estate for Long & Foster. ''These days, someone buying that big a lot will want a bigger house. It's less about a lot of land, and more about how many views of the water you can have.''
 Ms. McDonald said that it had been only in the last couple of years that million-dollar properties have arrived.
 ''They are really spectacular, though,'' she said, showing off a 3,000-square-foot house with three garages, more granite than in the state of New Hampshire in the kitchen and, to be sure, a dock and a boat slip, for $1.8 million. ''But then golf dues are only about $1,000 a year, so you can make it up on the other end.''
 Lay of the Land
 POPULATION The region around Smith Mountain Lake encompasses several towns in Franklin, Pittsylvania and Bedford Counties. The Smith Mountain Lake Chamber of Commerce estimates that the year-round population is 22,000.
 SIZE The lake is 20,600 acres and has 500 miles of shoreline. 
 LOCATION The lake is about 25 miles southeast of Roanoke and 34 miles southwest of Lynchburg.
 WHO'S BUYING Second-home buyers from North Carolina, Virginia, the Washington area, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Florida. 
 GETTING THERE There is a small private airport near Smith Mountain Lake; commercial service is at Lynchburg Regional and Roanoke Regional Airports. Most people, however, drive, using either Interstate 81, then heading east from Roanoke, or taking Route 29 and heading west from Gretna. 
 WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING Mariners Landing Resort and Conference Center (1217 Graves Harbor Trail, Huddleston; 540-297-4900; www.marinerslanding.com) offers studio suites for $99 a night as well as other accommodations. All rooms at the Westlake Waterfront Inn (2050 Morewood Road, Hardy; 540-721-3307; www.westlake-waterfront-inn.com) overlook the lake. Rates are $120 to $150 from Memorial Day to Labor Day, $80 to $100 in the off-season.

HEADLINE: The China Puzzle

 BODY:
The ''Chinese miracle'' has been the biggest economic story for several years now, a tale of a nation rising from the ashes of a Stalinist command economy to become the world's premier trading partner. But China reminds us with distressing regularity that the progress has been selective. 
 The latest reminders are reports of slave labor in Chinese factories and the discovery that some of the popular Thomas the Tank Engine toys manufactured in China have lead in their paint. Before that, it was the contaminated dog food, the stubborn support of Sudan for its oil, the regular reports of human rights abuses, the huge economic disparities between city and country, the controls on the media.
 Why rehearse these faults now? Because governments and companies tend to become so seduced or intimidated by China that they won't hold it to high standards of human rights and business ethics.
 Western companies have been so anxious to transfer manufacturing to China's cheap factories that they have been happy to close their eyes to what else goes on over there -- just as Google or Yahoo were happy to assist in repressing information to get a toe into the Chinese market, or as Washington and other Western capitals compete in trying to please visiting Chinese leaders. The ultimate source of China's failings is a Communist Party that has jettisoned worn-out Marxist economic theories but clings to its authoritarian rule on all other fronts, creating a dangerously unbalanced behemoth.
 This is not an argument against trading with or investing in China. Globalization can be a potent force for democratization. But human rights violations cannot be relegated to untouchable internal affairs. Just as the world has not hesitated, rightly, to lambaste the United States over issues like Guantanamo Bay, it should not be shy about systematic and widespread violations of human rights in China. 
 China's unreformed political system fosters corruption and an undue focus on short-term economic gains, which will lead to more internal inequities and injustices and more tainted exports. A politically reformed China would be an even more formidable economic power, but a less destructive one.

HEADLINE: Where Outdoors Is the Way Up

BYLINE: By WENDY KNIGHT

 BODY:
WEDGED between old stockyards and a boarded-up packing plant on the western edge of town, the kayak park is not easy to find. But it is just the kind of thing that draws outdoor enthusiasts to Ogden, Utah. 
 Of the 15 paddlers gathered at the park, on the Ogden River, one Saturday this spring, nearly half were from Salt Lake City, 35 miles away, while one man drove 90 miles from Provo for the day. 
 ''Ogden is rocking right now,'' said Craig Haaser, 44, a potter born and raised in Ogden who was among the paddlers at the park that day. 
 Set in the western foothills of the Wasatch Mountains, Ogden, a city of approximately 83,000 people, is fast gaining on places like Boulder, Colo., as a destination for extreme sports. 
 Miles of mountain biking wind through the Wasatch-Cache National Forest within minutes of downtown, and the Ogden and Weber Rivers provide ample opportunity for in-town kayaking and canoeing. In addition, Snowbasin Resort, the site for the 2002 Olympic downhill and super G ski events, is less than 20 miles up Ogden Canyon.
 Among several new developments in town is the 125,000-square-foot Salomon Recreation Center that will include a climbing wall, a surf rider pool, a bowling alley, a dance studio, a wind tunnel and a Gold's Gym. The center, which is to open this summer, is part of a multimillion-dollar entertainment and residential complex called the Junction that will occupy 20 formerly decrepit acres downtown. 
 While the 2002 Olympics helped raise Ogden's profile, it is the efforts of city officials, outdoor-company executives and real estate developers that are transforming the town, a former railroad hub. 
 The city is poised to be ''the high adventure Mecca of the country,'' said Mayor Matthew Godfrey, 36, over a chopped salad at Rooster's Brewing Company on Historic 25th Street. 
 The mayor, who took office in 2000, says he sees outdoor recreation as a means to a vibrant and financially sound community. 
 ''We need more high-paying jobs,'' he said. ''We need tourism. We need a 20-to-40-year-old demographic that likes to work hard and play hard.'' 
 To achieve that, he is recruiting recreation companies to move to town. One such company is Goode Ski Technologies, a manufacturer of carbon fiber water and snow skis and ski poles, formerly based in Waterford, Mich. 
 ''The mayor rolled out the red carpet for me, literally,'' recalled David Goode, the president and founder who relocated his 35-employee company to Ogden in August 2005. 
 Other ski companies, like Scott USA and Rossignol, have established small operations downtown or in Business Depot Ogden, an industrial park north of downtown. This fall, Amer Sports, the maker of Salomon and Atomic skis, expects to move its headquarters into the former American Can Building at 20th and Grant Streets that it is currently renovating. 
 Though Ogden is emerging as a snow sports hub, many other sports lure visitors to town. With a $1.5 million investment from Goode Ski Technologies, the city is also building a 70-acre water ski park on an existing lake that will include a half-mile-long slalom course, a 17-acre fishing lake and an 18,000-seat amphitheater for plays and concerts, a complex that Mr. Goode hopes will help to bring the water ski championship to Ogden in 2011. 
 Ogden already is host of a spring marathon and the Xterra Mountain Championship, an off-road triathlon with mountain biking and trail running events. It is also on the brink of being a notable climbing destination. 
 TWO years ago, Jeff Lowe, 56, a former world-class mountaineer who sits on a mayoral sports advisory committee, established Ogden Climbing Parks, a nonprofit organization to ''make Ogden attractive to climbers,'' he said. Mr. Lowe, who moved back to Ogden after 30 years in Boulder, established a series of climbing routes using bolted ladder rungs, called a via ferrata, on private land in Waterfall Canyon last year. His current project is a tower of ice -- suspended from steel cables -- to be used for ice climbing. He plans to build it next winter in Ogden. 
 The city's commitment to outdoor recreation and an adventure-based economy is attracting young professionals, some of whom are buying and refurbishing 1920s bungalows in once rundown neighborhoods. 
 ''We see it as a diamond in the rough,'' Delanie Hill, 32, said of Ogden's downtown. She and her husband, Jeff, 34, are both graphic designers; they bought a 2,200-square-foot Arts and Crafts house in 2000 for $115,000. 
 ''It was kind of a lot at the time,'' Ms. Hill said, considering other young professionals were buying two-bedroom homes for $40,000 or $50,000 in their neighborhood around Harrison Avenue and 27th Street. Once an area of ''extreme poverty with two and three families living to a house'' the neighborhood has changed sharply in recent years, said Ms. Hill, who grew up near Alta Resort and worked in Jackson Hole. 
 ''I can't afford to live in Jackson,'' she said, ''but I can here.'' 
 The average price of a three-bedroom home in Ogden runs about $160,000, according to Stan Booth, an Ogden-based real estate agent with Coldwell Banker. Real estate ''exploded'' a couple years after the 2002 Olympics, Mr. Booth said, especially in Ogden Valley, where ''people from Florida and California paid asking price and felt they were getting a killer deal.'' The market has since leveled off, he said. 
 In 2004, Mr. Haaser, the kayaking potter, who lives in Ogden year round, bought a four-bedroom house, which he is remodeling, with views of Snowbasin, for $215,000. He recently received an unsolicited offer of $350,000 for the five-acre property. 
 Rising property values aside, it is the revitalization of downtown that is drawing the most attention. Once home to brothels and taverns frequented by railroad workers in the late 1880s, and more recently to transients and prostitutes who moved in after residents and commerce fled the downtown in the 1980s, Historic 25th Street is both a link to Ogden's past and its future as a tourist destination. 
 Faux gas lanterns and sycamore trees strung with white lights line the wide east-west boulevard. Shaded by striped awnings, the century-old brick storefronts house art galleries, acupuncturists and cafes. 
 The town's arts scene is anchored by Peery's Egyptian Theater, which is a satellite site for the Sundance Film Festival in Park City and presents theatrical and musical performances throughout the year. 
 There are still empty buildings and a handful of dank bars on 25th Street, where men in dirty T-shirts call out to women walking by. Near a taco stand on the corner of 25th and Washington Boulevard, a gritty man with a faded blue bandanna around his forehead waited at the bus stop. 
 ''That's what keeps Ogden from being too cool,'' Mr. Lowe said. 
 Despite the lingering rough-town image, development continues. The mayor is seeking to build a gondola that would connect downtown to a proposed ski and resort community that would occupy nearly 1,800 acres and include Malan's Basin, 1,440 acres of mountainside land owned by a Salt Lake developer, Chris Peterson, who is championing the idea. 
 Beyond the added $10 million in tax revenues the mayor expects from the private investment, the mayor says he is intrigued with the ''urban to mountain experience'' the gondola would create. 
 But some residents are skeptical. ''Nothing about this makes sense from a common sense perspective,'' said Dan Schroeder, a physics professor at Weber State University and board member of the local Sierra Club, referring to the logistics of relocating existing power lines and water reservoirs. 
 While the reduction of pollution and traffic appeals to many of the town's environmentally conscious residents, it is the development of public and private land -- including a 113-acre public golf course and over 200 acres of undeveloped land currently used for mountain biking and hiking -- into a private residential community of empty nesters and second-home owners that rankles some. 
 ''Ogden is known because of its outdoor recreation,'' Mr. Haaser said. ''What we have here is wonderful. Let's just keep in that way.''

HEADLINE: Speaking Simply of War and the True Courage of Heroes

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
In ''Beyond Glory,'' a solo show about war veterans that opened last night at the Laura Pels Theater, Stephen Lang portrays a series of former servicemen recollecting their combat experiences and the acts of courage that won them the United States military's highest laurel, the Medal of Honor.
 Does that make it sound like a talking war memorial? Well, sorry about that, but it more or less is. No disparagement intended: Unearthing and airing for public contemplation the flesh-and-blood stories that are celebrated in stone and bronze by the country's many statues honoring its soldiers is a worthwhile enterprise. Mr. Lang and his director, Robert Falls, do it with their own fine measure of honor. 
 ''Beyond Glory,'' which has toured military installations and been seen at the Goodman Theater in Chicago, is certainly not obvious fare for a warm summer evening in New York. But with American soldiers facing deadly combat overseas every day, this modest show provides a powerful reminder of the hardships, psychic stresses and physical dangers that men and women endure on the front lines. The Medal of Honor is not awarded for congeniality or well-shined shoes, after all, but for courageous action in the most harrowing of circumstances.
 Adapted by Mr. Lang from a book by the journalist Larry Smith containing the oral histories of veterans of several wars, ''Beyond Glory'' allows the voices of servicemen to be heard without the filter of the conventions of drama or the prerogatives of deadline-driven journalism. Its sobriety, simplicity and lack of histrionics are the show's signal strengths.
 Although video screens behind Mr. Lang are used occasionally to evoke the turmoil of combat, and a (thankfully subtle) musical score adds a sentimental note of underscoring here and there, ''Beyond Glory'' is really beyond reproach in its no-frills treatment to the material. Even Mr. Lang's forceful performance, impressive as it is, never calls attention to itself in a self-aggrandizing way.
 With his chiseled physique, commanding square jaw and sharp buzz cut, Mr. Lang might almost seem to be carved from a block of granite. But he individualizes each of the eight portraits here with precision and economy, becoming a new man by a subtle adjustment of posture that alters his physical presence, evoking a new personality through the coloring of his voice. 
 A couple of the men we meet are already familiar. Vice Adm. James B. Stockdale, a veteran of combat in Vietnam who spent more than seven years as a prisoner of war, was H. Ross Perot's running mate in the 1992 presidential election. The highest-ranking Naval officer incarcerated in the ''Hanoi Hilton,'' as the Hoa La prison came to be sardonically known, then-Commander Stockdale describes, in gruff, sober tones the gruesome tortures he endured and the quiet defiance he displayed toward his captors, cognizant as he was of the need to set an example for the other troops. ''I got to be quite a thorn in their side,'' he says with a flicker of pride, before going on to recall a desperate suicide attempt that finally shamed the prison guards into treating the Americans with less brutality. 
 Daniel K. Inouye, the senator from Hawaii who was awarded his medal as a second lieutenant in the Army, reminisces about the ferocity of his outrage as an American of Japanese descent when the skies rained horror on Pearl Harbor in World War II. ''My own people were just a generation removed from the land that spawned these bombers and sent them to drop death on Hawaii, on my own home,'' he says. ''I screamed at the sky, 'You dirty Japs!' I wanted to kill them.'' 
 But most of the veterans represented here are unknown to the general public, and their exploits are no less worthy of rediscovery. Among the most interesting is First Lt. Vernon Baker, another World War II vet who was part of the all-black ''Buffalo'' division that fought in Italy. His story of leading his men in a brutal battle to take a hilltop castle is full of gritty, powerful details. ''Every time a man died, I took the dog tags off him,'' he recalls. ''I had a pocketful when I got back.'' Most sobering is the news that no black soldier received a Medal of Honor during the war. Lieutenant Baker didn't receive his until the Army began investigating the oversight decades later. 
 Mr. Lang also portrays another African-American veteran, Specialist Clarence Sasser, a medic who recalls the horror of a brutal slaughter in a rice paddy in Vietnam in which only about a dozen soldiers of more than a hundred survived. ''The hardest thing was lying there all night, listening to them beg for their mamas,'' he says.
 The sources of the courage that the men draw on in the nerve-shredding heat of battle remain mysterious, a mixture of loyalty to their fellow soldiers, intense training and natural instinct. Detachment seems to help, too.
 ''I never, ever felt anything about killing the enemy,'' says Staff Sgt. Nick Bacon, an Arkansan honored for service in Vietnam. ''I have compassion for the people, the women and the children. I like the Vietnamese people. I've been over there since. I got no hatred. The war was never personal with me. It was absolutely a game of survival.'' 
 The soldiers in ''Beyond Glory'' all survived, some with disfigured bodies, but all with their moral and psychological faculties intact. That is not always the case, sadly, and this quietly celebratory show may leave you wondering whether today's Medal of Honor recipients, who have faced a new kind of enemy and endured insidious new combat tactics in the Middle East, will be equally fortunate.

HEADLINE: Once Again, Trade Effort Stumbles On Subsidies

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, June 21 

 BODY:
A high-level meeting aimed at salvaging global trade talks collapsed Thursday when the United States and the European Union fell out with India and Brazil over plans to cut agricultural subsidies and tariffs.
 The four members of the World Trade Organization were trying to break a persistent deadlock over an issue that has bedeviled the Doha round of negotiations since 2001: how much rich countries will reduce the domestic farm subsidies that have distorted trade in commodities like cotton, sugar and corn.
 The failure of the talks appears to have defeated the strategy of bringing together the United States, Europe, Brazil and India -- a grouping known as the G-4 -- to resolve serious differences before turning to the entire membership of the W.T.O., comprising 150 countries. 
 Brazil and India, two countries that have assumed a leadership role for much of the developing world, rejected American and European advances, saying that they were not adequate to warrant opening their markets to more imports of the industrialized world's goods and services. The United States, in turn, contended that Brazil and India arrived at the talks, held in Potsdam, Germany, outside Berlin, with virtually no negotiating flexibility.
 Now, the United States trade representative, Susan C. Schwab, will head to Geneva, where she will meet with the W.T.O.'s director general, Pascal Lamy, and appeal to other developing countries to press Brazil and India for new concessions that would restart the round.
 ''We are absolutely determined not to give up on the Doha round,'' Ms. Schwab said. ''It may be that the G-4 process does not get us there.''
 The breakdown Thursday, though a serious blow, does not appear to have generated the same level of despair as a similar episode last August, when Mr. Lamy officially suspended the Doha round. Though Mr. Lamy said in a statement that an agreement in Potsdam ''would have been helpful,'' he held out hope that other members could resuscitate the negotiation.
 ''Helpful does not mean indispensable,'' Mr. Lamy said. ''This negotiation is an endeavor among the 150 members of the W.T.O.''
 Peter Mandelson, the European trade commissioner, likewise acknowledged the setback even as he underscored the heavy burden W.T.O. members now face. ''It is not the end of the Doha round,'' Mr. Mandelson said. ''It places a very major question mark on the ability of the wider W.T.O. membership to complete this round but does not in itself mean that the negotiations cannot be put back on track.''
 United States officials attributed the deadlock in Potsdam to Brazil and India, saying the two countries showed no flexibility at all when the meeting, which was supposed to have continued through Saturday, began on Tuesday.
 ''They adopted that attitude from the beginning and it cast a chill over the entire week of the discussions,'' said Mike Johanns, the secretary of agriculture.
 United States officials said they had sounded out various possibilities with Brazil and India but had received no hints that those countries would scale back their own trade barriers.
 ''Large economies like Brazil and India should not stand in the way of progress for smaller, poor developing nations, but that appears to be what happened in Germany this week,'' said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman.
 Kamal Nath, the Indian trade minister, said the United States had offered to cap its domestic agricultural subsidies at $17 billion, considerably lower than the $22 billion it had offered before, but still well above the $11 billion that American farmers are now receiving. Mr. Nath said that offer had ''no logic or equity,'' a point his Brazilian counterpart, Celso Amorim, echoed.
 ''It was useless to continue the discussion on the basis of the numbers put on the table,'' Mr. Amorim said.

HEADLINE: Expansion Of Economy Is Expected To Continue

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The economy should expand modestly in coming months as a healthy job market continues to trump weakness in housing prices, a gauge of future business activity showed yesterday.
 The Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators rose a higher-than-expected 0.3 percent in May, lifted by rising stock prices, higher consumer expectations and the availability of jobs. 
 Economists said that jobs should continue to be plentiful, despite an unexpected surge in jobless claims last week.
 The Labor Department reported that unemployment claims totaled 324,000 last week, up 10,000 from the previous week, to the highest since mid-April.
 While the big increase was unexpected, analysts said it did not change their view that the labor market remained hardy. Even with the increase, analysts noted that claims remained close to their average -- 319,000 -- over the first five months of the year.
 While the overall United States economy grew at a lackluster 0.6 percent in the first three months of this year, many analysts say the pace picked up significantly in the spring.
 The Conference Board's upbeat report shows that the impact of the housing slump has been fairly contained so far, said Patrick Newport, an economist with Global Insight. ''It just hasn't spilled over to the rest of the economy,'' he said.
 It also indicates that the economy is doing better than last month's leading indicators report suggested, Mr. Newport said.
 May's increase is in contrast to a revised 0.3 percent drop in April, down from the original 0.5 percent decline. Economists attributed the drop to soaring gas prices and a decline in building permits.
 A pickup in the economy has raised worries about rising inflation, however.
 Stocks rose yesterday after the Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported that its index of manufacturing activity in its region jumped more than expected, rising to 18 in June, from 4.2 in May.

HEADLINE: The Little Engine That Could Poison

BYLINE: By CHRISTIAN WARREN. 
Christian Warren, the historian with the New York Academy of Medicine, is the author of ''Brush With Death: A Social History of Lead Poisoning.''

 BODY:
FOR decades, Thomas the Tank Engine and his fellow trains have been teaching children important life lessons. Now the plucky locomotives -- especially the haughty and sometimes naughty James the Red Engine -- are serving up important lessons about regulating environmental poisons in the global economy.
 Last week, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission announced that a toy maker, RC2 Corporation of Oak Brook, Ill., was recalling some 1.5 million Thomas & Friends wooden railway toys because their bright red or yellow coatings contain lead. 
 The commission routinely issues recalls of lead-tainted children's products, but usually these are trinkets -- bubble-gum-machine toys, cheap imported novelties and no-brand children's jewelry -- and provoke little public outcry. Thomas & Friends products are a different story: they are purchased in upscale toy stores for $10 to $70 apiece, often by politically empowered parents who are extremely averse to exposing their children to contaminants of any kind. 
 The Product Safety Commission has not disclosed the actual lead content in the recalled toys. But a commission spokesman said RC2's Chinese manufacturer appears to have substituted highly leaded pigments for some portion of the lead-free paint the corporation had specified. 
 As always happens when a new lead hazard is discovered, a spirited game of blame and counterblame has ensued: RC2 should have exercised greater control over its Chinese partners; the safety commission should have caught the problem earlier; the Bush administration should not have cut the commission's budget by 10 percent in the last two years, forcing it to reduce its force of investigators and compliance agents. 
 It is important to do what we can to prevent the import of dangerous toys. But it is at least as important to help our international partners curtail the use of lead and other toxic substances in their own markets. Lax product safety and environmental regulation overseas undoubtedly lowers manufacturing costs there, but it also perpetuates the risk to our children and guarantees harmful exposure to both workers and children in countries that continue using lead as blithely as we once did.
 Until a few decades ago, lead-painted toys were as American as the Little Dutch Boy, the National Lead Company emblem who cheerfully extolled the virtues of pure lead paints for homes, cars, water tanks and toys. At the beginning of the 1920s, childhood lead poisoning was nearly invisible, but as doctors reported more and more pediatric fatalities, blame focused initially on the lead paint on toys and crib furniture, though some reports implicated lead-painted woodwork and windowsills (which would turn out to be the far greater threat). In 1930, the lead industry countered with a shoddily conducted ''survey'' of toy and crib manufacturers, most of whom denied using lead paint, or asserted their products were harmless. 
 Our government took them at their word. No laws were passed to regulate the amount of lead in toys. And even after 1955, when the paint industry agreed to voluntary restrictions on the amount of lead in paint for interior use in homes, American manufacturers continued to use highly leaded paints in all manner of consumer products. 
 It was not until the 1960s and '70s that America woke to the danger. Gradually, it became apparent that our environment was awash in lead -- spewing from the tailpipes of cars burning leaded gasoline, flowing from the solid-lead pipes that carried drinking water and painted onto almost every surface. 
 At the same time, scientific research was beginning to discredit the old notion of a ''threshold for harm'' from lead. Hospitals and public health agencies had accepted the lead industry's assertion that children could sustain blood-lead levels as high as 50 to 70 micrograms per deciliter without harm. But mounting evidence of irreversible damage at far lower blood-lead levels undermined the very notion of a threshold for harm.
 With lead poisoning known to be a danger to all children, the United States undertook a remarkable, if still far from complete, purging of environmental lead, resulting in a reduction in average blood-lead levels to less than two micrograms per deciliter at century's end, from almost 15 in the mid-1970s. 
 Consequently, researchers today can detect lead's damage even below 10 micrograms per deciliter (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ''level of concern'' for children). And they have seen that a rise in blood lead at this low level is associated with a greater decrease in I.Q. than a same-sized increase above 10 micrograms per deciliter. So, while getting rid of those last 10 micrograms may be expensive (and may entail removing James the Red Engine from Junior's clenched fist), it is an investment worth making. 
 It is also a project we cannot undertake alone. The RC2 recall should remind us that sometimes the best way to help ourselves is to help others -- a lesson Thomas the Tank Engine would probably endorse. It took us decades to reduce the amount of lead in our environment; now we must export the lessons of this progress.
 In many parts of the world, from Asia to Africa to Eastern Europe, children and workers still face levels of lead exposure not seen here for decades. The red and yellow lead paint at RC2 Corporation's Chinese toy factory may still be used on toys for domestic consumption, or for export to other countries. Our children will not truly be safe from hazardous products and environmental hazards until stiff standards are global norms.

HEADLINE: Brisk Demand in Emerging Markets Keeps Aircraft Makers Busy

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, June 21 

 BODY:
In the 1990s, a start-up airline or one in emerging markets would begin service with a few old planes and wait until customer demand and profits were solid before taking on the cost of new ones.
 No more. Many new airlines in Asia, South America and Mexico are not growing slowly or cheaply. Buoyed by rapidly rising demand from fliers who are trading in long bus and train rides for the speed of air travel and by aggressive financing from banks eager for a piece of the emerging markets, even the youngest companies are ordering new planes, sometimes by the dozen. 
 The demand for aircraft means that the two biggest manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing, are making them as quickly as they can -- and that is still nowhere near fast enough. The wait for an Airbus 320 single-aisle passenger jet is almost five years. 
 The problem is that the plane makers have become increasingly dependent on orders from airlines in volatile developing economies, and it is inevitable that some of the new airlines will fail, or be absorbed by larger, stronger carriers. 
 ''Start-up airlines and low-cost airlines have become much more significant customers of Boeing and Airbus,'' particularly after United States and European airlines cut back orders after Sept. 11, 2001, said Philip Baggaley, airline credit analyst at Standard & Poor's.
 ''Manufacturers were all the more eager to sell planes to airlines that were still expanding, from Asia and the Middle East to the low-cost airlines in Europe,'' he said. Some of these airlines, of course, are more financially stable than others.
 At the Paris air show this week, Airbus, a unit of the European aerospace consortium EADS, especially benefited from orders by carriers in fast-growing markets: FlyAsianXpress, a Malaysian start-up, ordered 15 Airbus planes. A young Indian domestic carrier, Kingfisher Airlines, ordered 50 and Qatar Airways ordered 80. 
 The demographics and economic predictions for some of the emerging markets are so positive that no one is predicting a collapse in plane prices or a glut. But as India's airline industry shows, there will be a few hiccups along the way as carriers in crowded emerging markets consolidate and untested business models are tried in a cyclical business. 
 Any extra planes that come onto the market now can be quickly absorbed by another emerging market airline, or even one of the traditional carriers, specialists say. But a series of consolidations or anything that dampens consumer demand in a broad way could spell trouble. 
 Some of the froth in the market is being fueled by wide-open capital markets and a growing reliance on a financing tool called ''sale leasebacks.'' Using that tool, airlines order a new plane, then sell it to a financier for cash when it is delivered, lease it back and pay rent. This type of financing has been used for decades, but it is being applied more aggressively than before, as a result of a model in India that is spreading. 
 Indian airlines have financed as much as 100 percent of their fleet, which helps them increase the number of flights and passengers quickly -- with little cash on hand. In the past, airlines commonly financed half their fleet or less. Now, lenders say, imitators of this Indian tactic have sprouted around the world. 
 The new Indian carriers lease the planes ''soon after commencing operations,'' said Michael Weiss, the head of aircraft finance at Investec Bank in London. They place significant orders with airline manufacturers, which allow them to get discounts on list prices. Then, after they sell the planes to leasing companies at market value, the airline entrepreneurs put the difference toward daily operations, Mr. Weiss said. 
 ''Over time,'' Mr. Baggaley of Standard & Poor's say, ''there has been a trend toward greater emphasis on aircraft itself as collateral, rather than the airline that uses it.'' 
 Airbus executives say they are not concerned that much of the growth in orders is from start-ups and emerging markets. ''It is more attractive to buy a new aircraft,'' said Paul Kiteley, senior vice president for leasing markets at Airbus. ''They have much lower fuel burn and they have a honeymoon period on maintenance,'' clear advantages over used planes. 
 Boeing executives also say they have no reason to worry. Still, they are calling for caution. ''People think that the more airplanes I order, the more money I can take upfront,'' said Dinesh A. Keskar, Boeing's commercial airline vice president for sales, adding, ''You have to pay sooner or later.'' 
 Passengers on the low-cost and emerging market airlines can be among the winners. Traveling on a start-up airline once meant boarding a plane that had a new coat of paint and an old everything else. Now, in many countries, the cheapest flights will be on new planes, while some established carriers are saddled with the old ones. 
 Fast-growing airlines in developing markets tend to have newer fleets than their competitors in countries where air travel is well established. The average age of China Airlines' fleet is 5.1 years, for example, and that of Emirates is 5.4 years -- about half that of Western carriers like American Airlines or British Airways. 
 The aircraft leasing market has finally recovered from the terrorist acts of 2001. Leasing plummeted 79 percent in 2001 from the year before, to $2.8 billion, according to Dealogic. Last year, it grew to $8.2 billion, and is on track to equal that this year. Investors from hedge funds and private equity have jumped in, and many banks have rebuilt their businesses. The figures from Dealogic do not take into account leasing deals with companies that are not publicly traded, which adds billions to the total.
 ''There is a lot of liquidity in the leasing markets in aircraft across the world right now,'' said Hylton Heard, a director at Fitch Ratings. ''There is a huge demand out there for aircraft and for aircraft financing, and a lot of money chasing it. 
 ''It is a very volatile market and the performance of this debt goes up and down according to world travel demands. As quickly as this market has shown improvement, it can go the other way.''
 Mr. Baggaley, at Standard & Poor's, agreed. ''Focusing on the aircraft works in the strong times,'' he said. ''How well it works in a downturn depends on how global the downturn is and how dark it gets.''

HEADLINE: EBay Is Preparing to Re-enter the China Auction Business

BYLINE: By VICTORIA SHANNON

DATELINE: STRASBOURG, France, June 21 

 BODY:
EBay is on track to rejoin the online auction business in China this summer, with tight restrictions on sellers to clamp down on sales of counterfeit goods, the company's chief executive said this week. 
 Meg Whitman, the chief executive, said eBay's partnership with TOM Online would start within a few months, somewhat later than first planned. It is eBay's second attempt to break into the Chinese market after the collapse of the company's EachNet venture, and the first with a local partner.
 To win shoppers' trust, the venture, TOM eBay, has decided to use an escrow service, where payments will be held until buyers are satisfied with their purchases. The venture will also do more to assure the reliability of those holding the auctions and will institute restrictions on the number of luxury goods any individual can sell.
 ''Whatever we do elsewhere to assure trust and safety, in China we have to do more,'' Ms. Whitman said during an interview on a trip to Europe.
 Despite eBay's previous failure in China, Ms. Whitman said the partnership with TOM Online, which owns 51 percent of the venture, might crack the increasingly wired Chinese market. ''We have a good shot at it,'' she said.
 But eBay has been disappointed in Asia before, besides the EachNet debacle. The company also pulled completely out of Japan in the face of the huge success of Yahoo Japan, which is owned by Softbank.
 Ms. Whitman attributed eBay's collapse in Japan in 2000 to the company's late start and indicated that eBay was not looking to return there soon. 
 ''It's the second-largest economy in the world; it's the second-largest Internet market in the world,'' Ms. Whitman said. ''We need to think about it. If we go back, we can't go back with a look-alike product. We have to go back with something different.''
 Yahoo, in turn, recently said it would close its North American auction business, conceding the ''first-mover advantage'' to eBay in the United States. EBay also dominates the Internet auction business in Europe, though Ms. Whitman said the company was weak in Eastern Europe.
 EBay has had some success in China. Skype, the Internet phone business that eBay bought two years ago, recently said it had more customers there than in the United States, and its growth rate in China is faster than anywhere else, Ms. Whitman said.
 Outside of emerging markets, overall revenue growth has slowed to a still healthy pace of about 30 percent. That has led investors and others to start to call eBay a ''mature'' Internet company.
 Ms. Whitman said that in Germany, one of its best markets, ''we have all the Germans already.''
 The next task will be to get Germans, who give eBay its biggest single-country business outside the United States, to become more active as a community and as users of eBay's other networks, like Skype and the financial payment service PayPal.

HEADLINE: Making Waves In Dairyland

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19 

 BODY:
Ron Kind, a Democratic representative from Wisconsin dairyland, is making a name for himself as a crusader for big changes in farm policy. It's making many of his colleagues nervous.
 Mr. Kind, a six-term congressman, has introduced legislation that would drastically reduce farm subsidies while pouring more money into land conservation programs and rural development. He gathered 200 votes for a similar bill in 2002 and says he believes he has additional momentum this time around.
 ''There are so many reasons to do it,'' Mr. Kind said, ticking off high crop prices and increasing pressure from foreign trading partners as two reasons to curb subsidies. ''Now we are going to see if this Congress has the stomach for meaningful reform.''
 To no one's surprise, Mr. Kind's crusade has raised the hackles of the powerful farm lobby and its supporters in Congress, who describe his proposal as naive, ill conceived and even dangerous. 
 But Mr. Kind has also created a quandary for Democratic leaders in Congress, particularly in the House, who are striving to maintain and expand on the small gains they made in rural America during the 2006 elections.
 The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, and the House majority leader, Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, both voted for Mr. Kind's bill in 2002. 
 But now that they are in leadership positions, attacking farm subsidies could alienate voters in rural districts, particularly in the South and in the Corn Belt. Several Democratic lawmakers who represent rural, conservative districts, like Jim Marshall of Georgia and freshmen representatives like Zachary Space of Ohio and Nancy Boyda of Kansas --support extending the current farm bill and the generous subsidies that go with it.
 ''Politically, it wouldn't be a very favorable thing for me,'' Mr. Space said, referring to Mr. Kind's proposal. He said the farmers in his district in eastern Ohio are ''pretty comfortable'' with the current subsidy program.
 ''They rely fairly heavily upon the commodity provisions,'' Mr. Space said. ''To gut those there would have an adverse impact.''
 But siding with the farm lobby and maintaining the status quo would anger environmentalists, produce farmers and urban lawmakers who are demanding an overhaul of the farm support program along the lines of what Mr. Kind has proposed. In fact, half a dozen other Democrats have offered proposals on the farm bill that provide variations of Mr. Kind's plan.
 ''There are a lot of Democrats who would just as soon forget this,'' said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit organization that supports setting farm policy in a new direction. ''This is something that makes leadership squirm a little bit because it can be divisive in the caucus.''
 Mr. Cook predicted that Democratic leaders would try to negotiate a compromise to avoid a floor fight, possibly offering more money to nutrition and conservation programs while maintaining some semblance of the subsidy programs.
 But Patrick Westhoff, research associate professor at the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute at the University of Missouri, said the opposing Democratic proposals for the farm bill are so far apart that finding a middle ground is going to be difficult.
 ''It's not obvious what the compromise is,'' he said.
 Brendan Daly, a spokesman for Mrs. Pelosi, described the negotiations over the farm bill as a ''fluid process'' and said Democratic leaders were still discussing proposals. He predicted that the final bill, which is expected to emerge from Congress this fall, would include some reforms but would probably not go as far as those proposed by Mr. Kind.
 The farm bill not only provides subsidies to farmers, but it also covers conservation, rural development and nutrition programs, including the $33 billion in support for food stamps for the poor. Congress typically rewrites the farm bill every five to six years.
 Last year, the federal government paid farmers $16 billion in subsidies, a figure that is expected to decline to about $12 billion this year, according to the Agriculture Department. 
 Though he is from a state known for its dairy industry, Mr. Kind is in many ways an unlikely farm policy reformer. The son of a school administrator and telephone repairman, he was a high school sports hero who went on to Harvard, where he was quarterback of the football team.
 He spent his summers working in the Washington office of Senator William Proxmire, a Democrat from Wisconsin who highlighted government waste with his ''Golden Fleece'' awards. Mr. Kind earned a master's degree at the London School of Economics and a law degree at the University of Minnesota.
 Mr. Kind, who is 44 and has the good looks of a television anchorman, was elected to Congress in 1996 and represents a district in southwest Wisconsin with thousands of dairy farms, many big beneficiaries of the programs that he is trying to upend. From 1995 to 2005, for instance, his district received $1.4 billion in farm subsidies, far more than any other Congressional district in Wisconsin, according to data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.
 He argues that if Congress is going to overhaul the farm program, it has to do it across all commodities, including the dairy industry. Mr. Kind said his farmers realized that change was inevitable and would welcome more money and programs for beginning farmers.
 The primary criticisms of farm subsidies are that they encourage overproduction and consequently artificially lower prices and that they benefit only a small percentage of farmers, primarily large growers of corn, cotton, soybeans, rice and wheat. 
 Under Mr. Kind's proposal, subsidies would be reduced and replaced with ''revenue management accounts'' that would function like an individual retirement account, with the difference being that farmers could tap into it to pay for small losses that are not covered by crop insurance.
 Over the next five years, Mr. Kind's proposal would increase spending on conservation by $6 billion, anti-hunger programs by $5 billion, renewable energy by $1 billion and rural development, $700 million.
 At a meeting last week of a House Agriculture subcommittee, lawmakers said that Mr. Kind's proposal would accelerate consolidation of smaller farms and could ultimately increase food costs. Several members noted that Congress tried to eliminate subsidies in 1996 but was forced to bail out farmers when commodity prices plummeted.
 To emphasize the point, the subcommittee voted unanimously against Mr. Kind's proposal, and chose instead to continue the current farm subsidy program unchanged for the next five years. The full House Agriculture Committee will consider the recommendation after the July 4th holiday.
 At the hearing, Frank Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma, was particularly alarmist, saying the Kind bill was ''a danger to every consumer of agricultural products.''
 ''It's a threat to everyone,'' he said. ''I'm frightened as to what Mr. Kind can do to rural America on the floor of the House.''
 Mr. Kind said he was not surprised by the reaction of the House Agriculture Committee, which has traditionally supported commodity subsidies. In the coming weeks, he said he would continue to court support from his colleagues. Already, his bill has bipartisan support in the House, and Senator Richard Lugar, Republican from Indiana, has introduced a similar measure in the Senate.
 ''We are still up against the commodity lobby; they will make it difficult,'' Mr. Kind said. ''It's going to depend on Democratic leadership.''

HEADLINE: Voucher Use In Washington Wins Praise Of Parents

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Students who participated in the first year of the District of Columbia's federally financed school voucher program did not show significantly higher math or reading achievement, but their parents were satisfied anyway, viewing the private schools they attended at taxpayer expense as safer and better than public schools, according to an Education Department study released yesterday. 
 The students themselves painted a picture different from that of their parents, though, feeling neither more satisfied nor safer than did students attending public schools. 
 ''The program had a substantial positive impact on parents' views of school safety, but not on students' actual school experiences with dangerous activities,'' the study said.
 A Republican-controlled Congress established the voucher program, for Grades K through 12, in 2004. Over the last three years it has provided scholarships of up to $7,500 annually to cover tuition, fees and transportation expenses for each of about 1,800 poor children to attend private school. About 90 percent of the participating students have been African-American, and an additional 9 percent Hispanic, according to the Congressionally mandated study.
 The results were eagerly awaited, because studies of similar programs elsewhere, in cities including Cleveland, Milwaukee and Dayton, had not produced definitive conclusions about whether vouchers significantly increased the academic achievement of students who previously attended public schools.
 The new research found that in the Washington program's first academic year, 2004-5, it ''generated no statistically significant impacts, positive or negative, on student reading or math achievement.''
 But Grover J. Whitehurst, director of the Institute of Education Sciences, the Education Department agency that oversaw the study, told reporters yesterday that it was too early to tell whether the program would significantly affect student achievement. The students had been attending private schools for an average of less than a year when they were tested for the study, not much time for their new academic environment to affect performance.
 Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings said in a statement, ''The report's findings are in step with rigorous studies of other voucher programs, which have not typically found impacts on student achievement in the first year.''
 Because the number of students who have applied for the program exceeds the number of available scholarships, or the number of seats available to them in the 58 participating private schools, eligible students have been chosen by lottery. As a result, researchers were able to study two randomly selected groups: one of scholarship recipients and another of students rejected by the lottery who continued to attend public schools. The researchers, led by Patrick J. Wolf, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas, compared the academic outcomes of the two groups, as well as their perception, and that of their parents, toward their schools.
 About two-thirds of the participating students attended parochial schools operated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington; the rest attended other private schools. The $7,500 scholarship that families spent was about half the average public expenditure per student in the District of Columbia public schools.
 Parents of students using the vouchers were significantly more likely to give the school their child attended a grade of A or B than were parents of students rejected by the lottery, the study found.
 Joseph P. Viteritti, a professor of public policy at Hunter College, said those findings were consistent with studies of other voucher programs.
 ''To me,'' Mr. Viteritti said, ''it just means that parents are happy to have a choice.''
 But Clive R. Belfield, an economics professor at the City University of New York who has studied voucher programs, noted the new report's finding that of the 1,027 students who entered the Washington program in the fall of 2004, only 788 remained in it by the fall of 2006. 
 ''That's quite a bit of attrition,'' Mr. Belfield said. ''If parents are so satisfied, why have about 20 percent of the students left the program?''

HEADLINE: As Japan Ages, Universities Struggle to Fill Classrooms

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: DAZAIFU, Japan 

 BODY:
When Yasunori Iwanaga was choosing universities three years ago, it was not the academic program, the strong team in judo, his favorite sport, or even the study abroad program in England that swayed him to choose Fukuoka University of Economics.
 It was the hot spring in the dormitories.
 Perched immodestly on the edge of a steaming bath, a dozen judo teammates soaking happily near him, the junior in economics said he picked this university when he saw the spa pictured in a brochure. The university's resortlike new dormitories also boast private karaoke rooms, an English garden with pink roses and a swimming pool.
 ''This was the only university to recruit us by offering a hot spring,'' Mr. Iwanaga, 21, said. ''They really wanted us to come here.''
 Japan has one of the oldest and most established systems of higher education in Asia, but today its universities are scrambling to find new ways to attract students. Years of falling birthrates have rapidly shrunk the population of young Japanese, leaving more universities unable to find enough students to fill their classrooms and campuses. 
 The rapid graying of Japan's population has already been felt in other parts of society, including the lower rungs of the nation's education system where hundreds of half-empty elementary and high schools have closed or been merged over the last two decades. But it has only recently begun to affect higher education.
 Japan's postwar baby boom started earlier than America's. As a result, according to census statistics, the number of 18-year-olds in Japan peaked at 2.05 million in 1992, when the baby boomers' children were entering universities, and has fallen steadily, to 1.3 million this year. Estimates show it dropping to 1.21 million in two years. This year, as a result, nearly a third of the nation's 707 public and private four-year universities cannot fill all of their openings, according to the Education Ministry and university groups. Roughly half of college-age Japanese attend universities.
 Only three universities have gone bankrupt for lack of students. Three years ago, Hiroshima's Risshikan University became the first Japanese university to fail since World War II. But the Education Ministry and university groups are busily writing guidelines to help them deal with a retrenchment that few developed nations have had to face.
 ''We are entering an era of survival of the fittest,'' said Yasuhiko Nishii, an official at the Promotion and Mutual Aid Corporation for Private Schools of Japan, the national association of private schools, including universities. ''We need to find ways to let weaker universities close without disrupting the education of their students.''
 Many universities have responded by hunting for new pools of prospective students, like foreigners and ''silver students,'' retirees who study for fun. In March, Osaka University gave a doctorate in mathematics to a 71-year-old former engineer who entered graduate school after retiring.
 At Fukuoka University of Economics, near this city on Kyushu, a southern island, administrators responded to the plunge in applications with a $50 million project in 1999 to build lavish dormitories, in which all 700 rooms are singles -- a luxury on Japan's traditionally spartan campuses -- and are wired for the Internet. 
 The university has also halved tuition to 590,000 yen, or about $5,000. The school also created a ''celebrity business'' major to train professional entertainers, after administrators saw a survey showing many young Japanese now aspiring to creative pursuits like music, rather than the ''salaryman'' positions sought by their parents' generation.
 The prospect of universities fighting to win students has prompted national hand-wringing about the future of Japanese higher education. Since the founding in 1877 of the nation's first modern university, the University of Tokyo, Japanese universities and their grueling entrance exams have been the society's main mechanism for sorting its youth, tracking the brightest into top business and government jobs. Many fear that this mechanism could be impaired if universities lower standards to attract more students.
 But in a country where higher education has long been viewed as a four-year break before entering the work force, some administrators welcome the competition, saying it will force schools to improve the quality of instruction -- or perish. Atsushi Hamana, president of Kansai University of International Studies in Miki, Japan, says that schools are realizing that young people actually want to study to get the skills to compete in a globalizing economy. 
 ''It's ironic, but it took this crisis to make universities realize they actually have to educate their students,'' Mr. Hamana said.
 Another promising change has been an opening of Japan's doors to more foreign students, whose numbers have increased in recent years, but are still far fewer than in America. Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, founded in 2000 in Beppu, a southern city, could be the shape of things to come in Japan. Almost half its 5,421 students are from overseas, mainly China and South Korea. About 42 percent of the 128 faculty members are also foreign, including the president, who is from Sri Lanka.
 Half of the classes are taught in English. The university is also unusual in Japan because it has a full-fledged, American-style career office to help students find jobs. The university has been rapidly expanding, and its international environment and solid academic program have proved a draw for young Japanese: Last year, 3,753 applied for about 750 spots.
 What Japanese universities are desperate to avoid is a fate like that of Hagi International University, one of the three universities to fail because of too few students.
 Hagi converted from a two-year junior college to a four-year university in 1999 with grandiose plans of becoming the region's top school. But from the start, it failed to attract its annual capacity of 300 freshmen. The campus became increasingly empty as new enrollees dropped from about 200 the first year to just three in 2006, the university said.
 Hagi first tried to fill its thinning ranks by recruiting in China, but the immigration authorities stopped that in 2002 after 26 Chinese students disappeared, apparently to work illegally in Japan, the university said. Next, it hired a top professional golfer and offered Japan's first major in golf culture, but that drew only about 30 students.
 Deep in the red, Hagi International sought court protection for bankruptcy in 2005.
 ''We tried to find ways to attract new students,'' said Masanori Hatachi, the president of the university, which now has a new owner and a new name, Yamaguchi University of Human Welfare and Culture. ''Problem was, there just weren't a lot of new students to be found.''
 After bankruptcy, the university was taken over by a construction company and revived in April as a smaller university offering degrees in the health field. Mr. Hatachi said the new focus should make it more competitive because in rapidly graying Japan, care for the elderly was one of the few guaranteed growth markets for young job seekers. 
 ''It's not enough anymore to offer a traditional education,'' he said. ''A university has to be a place where students think they can learn what they need.''

CORRECTION-DATE: June 29, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Friday about the dearth of university students in Japan misstated the reason that the numbers of college-age children of baby boom parents there peaked in 1992, years earlier than the American peak. It was because Japan's baby boom was concentrated in the years immediately following World War II, while the American boom lasted until 1962. It was not because Japan's boom started earlier; both started in 1946.

HEADLINE: Seen on the Street: Photographers' 'Everyday Epiphanies'

BYLINE: By MARTHA SCHWENDENER

 BODY:
When artists talk about ''training the eye,'' they generally don't mean doing exercises to maintain 20/20 vision. They mean honing a set of instincts, learning to see relationships among colors or objects or spaces. The title of this small but potent collection of contemporary photographs from the Metropolitan Museum's collection describes this kind of vision another way: seeing what is ''Hidden in Plain Sight.'' The show focuses mostly on versions of street, rather than studio, photography. 
 The artists here discovered ''found still lifes,'' as the wall text puts it, which resulted in ''everyday epiphanies.'' These are prefaced by an epigraph from Henry David Thoreau, written in his diary in August 1851: ''The question is not what you look at but what you see.'' Thoreau may have been speaking of nature or writing, but his dictum works well enough for photography. (It's still an odd choice for a show focusing on 20th- and 21st-century photography, but never mind.) 
 Some of the great 20th-century photographers who devoted themselves to capturing quiet, overlooked everyday phenomena are here. One of the most surprising groups of images comes from Walker Evans, who began working with a Polaroid SX-70 camera in 1973 (and, because he was Walker Evans, was given an unlimited supply of film by its manufacturer).
 Instant color prints of a partly eaten pie, a newspaper display and smashed beer cans show Evans extending his exploration of the everyday world during the last two years of his life, but in an entirely different way. Only a few of the 2,600 pictures he made with the SX-70 are here, but you can see in their small, somewhat limited color format what Evans described when he said the SX-70 ''reduces everything to your brains and taste.''
 William Eggleston, a pioneer of color photography (although ''Colour Before Color,'' a show organized by the British photographer Martin Paar and on show at Hasted Hunt in Chelsea, disputes the idea of Americans leading the way in color photography), offers similar epiphanies. A view inside a freezer, framed by its constricted outlines, offers a portrait of middle America before the age of the chef Alice Waters and Ben & Jerry's. Nestled inside the cramped freezer are boxes of generic Tater Tots, a beef pot pie and that paragon of bland pleasure, vanilla ice milk.
 Stephen Shore, another color-photography innovator, is represented by a fabulous landscape, ''U.S. 97, South of Klamath Falls, Oregon,'' taken in 1973. In a work that simultaneously looks backward to Evans and forward to Richard Prince, Mr. Shore captured a billboard advertisement featuring a lake and a mountain, set against the ''real'' backdrop of mountains and a picture-perfect, cloud-flecked sky. The photograph, which skillfully spoofs sweeping Romantic vistas, also foreshadows Mr. Prince's commentary on how the American West was mythologized (and commodified) in Marlboro advertisements.
 Some photographs in ''Hidden in Plain Sight'' feel less ''found'' than others: More effort went into finding their subjects than Evans expended before shooting dinner leftovers. Rachel Harrison, for instance, staked out and photographed a house in Perth Amboy, N.J., where thousands of Christians had come to see what they believed was the face of the Virgin Mary on a second-floor window. Ms. Harrison's close-up of the window, smudged with fingerprints, looks a bit like an Abstract Expressionist painting with hints of pink, blue and lavender. The telling detail is a window nearby with its curtain slightly open to reveal a flower arrangement lurking in the shadows, a juxtaposition that highlights how the divine, in both art and faith, is often right next to the mundane.
 Other photographers traveled farther to discover found still lifes or landscape interventions. The mattress springs hanging in the trees in Carrie Mae Weems's photograph, taken on Sea Island, Ga., look like a bit of hurricane detritus. It was actually placed there by members of the Gullah community, descendants of African slaves, to capture evil spirits.
 Gabriel Orozco's travels in Africa led him to a cemetery in Timbuktu, Mali, where spherical terra cotta grave markers dot the sandy landscape. Bertien van Manen captured the aftermath of wedding party in a teahouse in China littered with the hulls of sunflower seeds. A visit to a Tibetan Buddhist children's refuge in northern India yielded Lewis Koch's elegant photograph of a mathematics equation solved by a young monk with rolled pieces of dough on a tabletop. Another, more famous image taken in India is also included here: Alex Webb's stunning 1981 street photograph of sari-clad figures partly hidden by paintings of giant eyes, hung as if they were awnings. It takes a moment before you locate a child emerging from the shadows, squinting in the bright sunlight.
 The show was organized by Mia Fineman, a senior research associate in the museum's department of photographs who occasionally writes about art for The New York Times and organized last summer's ''On Photography: A Tribute to Susan Sontag.'' This is a small show -- just a few dozen photographs in two rooms -- but it may take longer to absorb than much larger ones. What it offers, after all, is not just photographs but a way of looking at the world. It is a crash course in training the eye, not just for budding photographers but for anyone who feels that the world is full of overlooked phenomena.
 In which case maybe another Thoreau epigraph would have worked just as well. In the essay ''Economy,'' from ''Walden,'' he asked, ''Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each other's eyes for an instant?'' The beauty of photography is that it freezes that instant, extending it for as long as we care to look.

HEADLINE: High Goals For Reducing Emissions In New Jersey

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
The New Jersey Legislature passed a bill yesterday that set ambitious goals for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases from power plants, refineries, motor vehicles and other sources that contribute to global warming. 
 Business leaders expressed concerns about the bill's effect on energy costs and the state's competitiveness, but environmental advocates hailed it as pathbreaking, and Gov. Jon S. Corzine said he was ready to sign it into law. 
 Under the new law, greenhouse gas emissions generated by every aspect of the state's economy, not just electricity-generating stations, will have to drop about 13 percent, to 1990 levels, by 2020. The bill further requires that emissions be capped at 80 percent of 2006's levels by 2050. 
 A few other states have set emissions reduction goals, but none go as far into the future as New Jersey's. California, which passed a similar law earlier this year that was widely considered the toughest in the country, extends only to 2020. 
 While the legislation sets reduction goals, it does not specify how they will be met. Instead, it instructs the Department of Environmental Protection to work with other state agencies, including the Board of Public Utilities and the Department of Transportation, over the next year to recommend ways of meeting the 2020 emission reduction targets. 
 The same agencies have until June 30, 2010, to develop recommendations for reaching the reduction goals for 2050.
 ''This is a vital step in protecting our state's environmental resources and the health of New Jerseyans,'' said Assemblyman John F. McKeon, an Essex County Democrat who was one of several sponsors of the bill. ''New Jersey's aggressive protection of its resources will help set a national tone.'' 
 The bill also establishes a statewide greenhouse-gas monitoring program that will include pollution emitted by out-of-state power plants that export electricity to New Jersey. A plan to collect fees from every company that emits greenhouse gases -- chiefly carbon dioxide -- to support the monitoring program was dropped after industry opposed it. 
 The lack of specifics about how emissions would be cut has been a concern of New Jersey's business leaders. ''For a state trying to hold on to manufacturing and high-paying jobs, we're worried about the effect those regulations would have on electricity rates and our competitiveness,'' said Sara Bluhm, assistant vice president for energy affairs at the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. 
 In a letter to legislators last month, the association said the bill ''drives up the cost of electricity, and does so with no global environmental benefit.'' It also called the bill premature because other major initiatives have not been put into practice. 
 One of those programs is the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a pact among 10 Northeastern states, including New Jersey, to reduce emissions from power plants 10 percent by 2019. That agreement also establishes a ''cap and trade'' mechanism for buying and selling pollution allotments among the 10 states that is intended to soften the effect of the regulations on industry. 
 Jeffrey R. Holmstead, the former chief of air and climate change programs at the federal Environmental Protection Agency and now head of the environmental strategies group at Bracewell & Giuliani, said that without a cap and trade program or specific regulations for emissions reductions, New Jersey's efforts were unlikely to be successful. 
 ''Having spent a lot of years working on these issues, I can see the political appeal of doing these things,'' Mr. Holmstead said. ''But to willy-nilly go out and set goals that can't be met, and assign another group to figure out how to get there, doesn't make any sense to me.'' 
 Suzanne Leta Liou, global warming and clean energy advocate for Environment New Jersey, a lobbying group, said a cap and trade program was not necessary. 
 Ms. Leta Liou said conservation and alternative energy sources, like offshore wind turbines, could substantially reduce emissions and could, in the end, save consumers money. Some conservation measures could be directed at government and industry, and others could affect consumers, like requiring that low-resistance replacement tires be sold in the state. 
 Dale S. Bryk, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said actions like New Jersey's would increase the pressure for national standards.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 27, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about a law passed by the New Jersey Legislature that sets ambitious goals for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases misstated a provision of the bill. It requires that emissions be capped at 20 percent -- not 80 percent -- of 2006's levels by 2050.

HEADLINE: In Pequot Family That Led Tribe To Casinos, a Feeling of Rejection

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

DATELINE: MASHANTUCKET PEQUOT INDIAN RESERVATION, Conn. 

 BODY:
Things are different now for the Hayward family, who took this tiny tribal nation on a dizzying odyssey two decades ago from virtual dust to startling wealth and power.
 With Haywards at the helm, the Pequots built one of the most profitable casinos in the world here, a teal and lavender fortress known as Foxwoods that looms like Xanadu above the rustic woods.
 Within a few years, the tribe traded in a life of pig farming and maple sugaring for one of lavish homes, expensive cars and private school educations.
 But 15 years after Foxwoods opened, the family that brought the Pequots back from the brink, that repopulated an almost empty reservation and rebuilt its economic soul, says the tribe has cast it aside in recent years. 
 Richard A. Hayward, a former pipefitter who led the tribe for 23 years, has rarely been seen on the reservation since being deposed as the Pequot leader several years ago. 
 The rest of the 70-member Hayward clan say they, too, have been shunned by the Pequot family that now controls the tribal government.
 After years of infighting, the Haywards say they have been demoted, fired, pushed out of jobs. Several say it has gotten so bad that they are thinking of moving away from land they fought to reclaim.
 ''We gave them everything on a platter,'' said Theresa H. Bell, 55, a Hayward who resigned in September from running the Pequot museum, a Hayward dream financed by casino profits. ''And they just slapped us in the face.''
 Other members of the 800-person tribe see it differently.
 They say the Haywards withdrew from tribal affairs after their leader, Mr. Hayward, fell from power several years ago. They say it was the Haywards who had wielded power unfairly. 
 John L. Holder, who helped rebuild the tribe and is now executive assistant to the tribal chairman, said Mr. Hayward became rude and undemocratic as chairman.
 ''He ridiculed people to the point of tears," Mr. Holder said.
 Despite the internal tribal feuding, Foxwoods remains a major economic force in Connecticut, with 10,000 employees and annual revenues of more than $1 billion. Its success has served as a model, a tonic, for impoverished tribes across the country who followed the Pequots' lead, embraced gambling and made their own fortunes.
 But the Haywards say that that success is increasingly threatened by the dissension and by the inability of their successors, the Sebastian family, to adapt to a crowded gambling market. 
 They point to a slip in revenues from slot machines, the workhorses of megacasinos like Foxwoods. Slot revenues fell last year after more than a decade of skyrocketing growth, in part because of competition from Mohegan Sun, a rival Indian casino five miles west.
 Current tribal leaders described the Pequots' finances as sound and said any disagreements were routine. ''We are no different than other large families in terms of diverse opinions,'' the tribal chairman, Michael J. Thomas, wrote in an e-mail message. He added, ''There is no pattern of any disagreement that runs along family or ethnic lines.''
 Mr. Holder said that while the Haywards had some legitimate concerns, many stemmed from bitterness and misunderstanding. ''The tribe is not doomed,'' he said.
 The Haywards, however, are undeniably disillusioned. One Hayward sister walks the reservation in a sweatshirt advertising Foxwoods' gambling rival, the Mohegan Sun. Five of Mr. Hayward's eight siblings spoke out about their disagreements this spring with a reporter, rare moments of openness for a private people who seldom speak to the press.
 The Haywards described the tribe as deeply troubled. They say they worry, for example, that too many young Pequots, their own children included, are increasingly idle and drawn to drugs because they are given lots of money at an early age. 
 ''It's going to break up,'' Loretta Libby, 76, who has spent most of her life on the reservation, said of her tribe. ''We are breaking up.''
 Money and Popularity
 Even today, Pequot families on both sides say they owe a lot to Mr. Hayward, who is known as Skip. The eldest of nine siblings, he rebuilt the Pequot nation when other East Coast tribes had scattered to the winds.
 Like others in the tribe, the Haywards had abandoned the rocky soil of the reservation many years earlier. But they returned in the 1970s when their grandmother, Elizabeth George, warned that the state was talking of turning their ancestral homeland into a park.
 At the time, there was little here but a creaky house, where two elderly Pequot half-sisters lived, and a tangled swamp. But Mr. Hayward lured Pequots from as far away as California and London to join them.
 ''You will be millionaires,'' he promised new arrivals, according to relatives. They laughed and called him crazy, but by 1983, the tribe had won federal recognition, a crucial step toward opening the casino.
 Among the Pequots he recruited were the Sebastians, a family that had been absorbed by the Narragansett tribe of Rhode Island.
 The Sebastians had intermarried with blacks, the Haywards had intermarried with whites, and racial tensions occasionally surfaced in the early days as the tribe began its gambling ventures. But any rancor was largely muffled by the sound of the slot machines once Foxwoods opened in 1992.
 ''The limos were driving all over town,'' said Susan B. Mendenhall, the mayor of Ledyard, the nearest town. ''It took a while to get used to it.''
 With money came popularity. A tribe that had struggled to attract members now drew calls from people claiming to be Pequot. In truth, few surviving Pequots are full-blooded. Even the Haywards are, at most, one-eighth Pequot, Hayward clan members said. The diluted bloodlines have prompted critics to call them inauthentic Indians, who are cashing in on legal loopholes and white guilt.
 Their defenders point out that East Coast tribes like the Pequots were among the first to meet Europeans and among the first to be largely exterminated and assimilated. 
 Several years ago, to prove their ancestry, the tribe started testing its members' DNA. Several people learned that they were not Pequot at all. Others learned that their children were not their own, tribal members said. 
 ''It was a disaster,'' Ms. Bell said, comparing it to ''The Jerry Springer Show.'' Tribal leaders stopped the testing.
 None of this initially affected Mr. Hayward's reign. Under his leadership, the tribe became an influential political player and major campaign contributor. Mr. Hayward's picture even ran on the cover of Forbes magazine. 
 Criticism built, though, as he pushed the tribe toward ambitious, some said wide-eyed, endeavors, like a shipbuilding business that flopped and a plan to build a theme park called Pequot Island.
 There were also accusations, denied by the Haywards, that they engaged in the same kind of shunning that they now feel victimized by, that they rewarded each other with generous salaries and were bigoted against the black tribal members. Even Mr. Hayward's friends became concerned about his leadership.
 ''I told Skip many times over, 'Things are not going well, Skip, you have got to pay more attention to your backyard,' '' said Mickey Brown, president of Foxwoods from 1993 to 1997.
 In 1998, Mr. Hayward, who declined to be interviewed for this article, lost his bid to retain the chairmanship of the tribe. He tried again in 2003, but lost to the current leader, Michael Thomas, a Sebastian. At that point, his family said, Mr. Hayward became vice chairman, but two years ago walked away from tribal affairs.
 ''My people have lost faith in me,'' his sister, Belinda McKeon, recalls him saying. ''It is time for me to go.''
 Even with its disputes, life on the Pequot reservation resembles the Magic Kingdom compared with the grinding poverty that afflicts many Native Americans. They typically confront unemployment rates of about 40 percent and per capita incomes of less than $13,000, a fraction of what a Pequot might spend on a car.
 The gated community here, near the tribe's $18 million golf course, features rambling homes, manicured lawns and driveways filled with luxury cars. Under the tribe's profit-sharing system, each member 18 and older, working or not, receives a monthly payment that averages about $100,000 a year, tribal members say.
 Tribal leaders make more. One tribal council member, in a court filing several years ago, said she had made as much as $1.5 million in a year. Each Pequot is also guaranteed a job, free medical care, day care and tuition at any private school or college.
 Some tribal members say it has been too much too fast. 
 ''My own nieces and nephews are ruined,'' said Robert Hayward, Richard's brother. Two of his sisters said their children were refusing to work or go to school. Tribal officials have acknowledged that some Pequots have also struggled with drugs.
 Until 1999, the profit-sharing program paid bonuses to Pequots who stayed involved in education or tribal life. Now payments are set by age.
 Impact of Sudden Wealth
 ''I wish I could get him to work,'' Ms. McKeon said of her 19-year-old son, who she said had dropped out of high school. He receives $8,000 monthly from the tribe, she said, and has bought three cars in the last six months, including one that has already been repossessed.
 Mr. Thomas, the tribal chairman, is among those who have expressed concern about the impact of sudden wealth.
 ''We have replaced dependency on Uncle Sam with dependency on the tribe,'' he said, ''which is only slightly healthier.''
 But tribal officials say interest in education has not withered among the young and that for the most part, they are still taking advantage of employment opportunities so plentiful that other tribes visit the reservation to study the Pequot program.
 Still, some tribal members say they are concerned that casino profits will shrink in the face of competition from venues in Rhode Island, New York and Pennsylvania, as well as from the Mohegans down the road. While slot revenues increased by 46 percent during the first five full years Foxwoods was open, they grew by 3 percent during the last five.
 ''There are a lot of developments over time that have changed the dynamics,'' said Alan P. Meister, an economist who studies Indian gambling. Over all, though, he said, Foxwoods remains financially stable. ''They're trying to stay a step ahead,'' he said.
 The current tribal government is focusing on gambling efforts outside Connecticut, planning partnerships in casinos in Las Vegas and California, officials said. The tribe is also building a $700 million casino and hotel expansion at Foxwoods in partnership with MGM and has invested in real estate.
 Mr. Hayward's departure from tribal government years ago did little to repair the rift between the families. In its aftermath, the Haywards, who insist the tribe needs to diversify more than it has, have tried to block some of the Sebastians' plans and have worked to unseat Mr. Thomas.
 Richard Hayward still lives in the area, but friends say they have not seen him in years, not even in old haunts, like John's Mystic River Cafe in Mystic, or Pequot headquarters, where he used to direct the tribal council from a cranberry leather chair. 
 In recent years, he turned down the tribe's offer to give him a retirement party or to make a casino coin that bears his likeness. His brother Robert, one of the few Pequots who still see him on a regular basis, said, ''He's sick from what happened.''
 But Haywards and Sebastians are far from the only ones affected by the tumult. Jean Swift is a Pequot who belongs to neither family. She spent years as a financial officer for the Pequot government and says the tension between the two families is affecting the whole tribe. 
 ''If there is fighting among those two,'' she said, ''it leaves us all feeling without a sense of solidarity with the tribal nation.''

HEADLINE: Government Report Rates Hospitals on Their Heart Treatment

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21 

 BODY:
The federal government has gingerly stepped back into rating the care delivered by the nation's hospitals, releasing for the first time in nearly two decades a list of hospitals where heart patients are most likely to die.
 Officials at the 42 hospitals on the list, which represent about 1 percent of hospitals nationally, said either that they were shocked by the numbers or refused to comment at all. 
 ''We were stunned when this issue was raised with us,'' said Dr. Brian D'Arcy, chief medical officer of the Catholic Health System of Western New York. Kenmore Mercy Hospital near Buffalo, which is part of that system, was on the list. 
 ''We believe it's a statistical anomaly related to hospice-type patients,'' Dr. D'Arcy said.
 The hospital reviewed the care it provided to each patient who died during the government's review period, he said, and decided that the care was appropriate. 
 Although federal officials had released the data to hospitals weeks ago, some hospital officials seemed caught off guard by the government announcement. Dr. Robert Schott, a cardiologist who is director of medical affairs for the Sutter Medical Center in Sacramento, said he became aware of the federal designation only on Thursday.
 ''We take the data very seriously, and I don't know why we're outside of the normal range,'' Dr. Schott said.
 The report, based on a study of about 5,000 hospitals, also identified 55 where patients died far less often than the national average. Among those hospitals is NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.
 ''I think we just try very hard,'' said Dr. Herbert Pardes, NewYork-Presbyterian's president and chief executive.
 The report was released by the Department of Health and Human Services after a yearlong study. It is part of a broad push by federal health-care officials to begin demanding accountability from hospitals for the quality of the care they provide. 
 For the Bush administration, the push is an essential part of keeping much of the American health-care system in private hands and giving consumers information about how they perform. 
 Health care often seems to operate by a unique set of economic rules that result in huge inefficiencies. One reason for this is that patients have little ability to choose doctors or hospitals based upon an accurate assessment of the quality and price of the care provided. A recent survey of Pennsylvania hospitals, for instance, found that high costs do not correlate with high-quality care.
 ''This is a glimpse into the future,'' said Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of Health and Human Services. ''For most of its history, Medicare has been paying for services but not for results.''
 After a request for such data more than two decades ago from The New York Times, the government published hospital mortality statistics in the 1980s. But the data were widely criticized as unfair, because government officials did little to adjust for the relative health of the patients being counted. Time and again, the hospitals found with the worst scores were those that treated the poorest and sickest patients.
 As a result of such criticism, the Clinton administration stopped releasing the statistics. 
 But business groups have been increasingly pushing the government to provide data to allow them to demand better care. So the Bush administration gathered some top health researchers to come up with a way to provide fairer numbers.
 Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a professor of medicine at Yale University, said he and others had joined the effort by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ''to prove to C.M.S. that they couldn't do this.''
 But the more they studied the issue, the more the researchers decided that they could use sophisticated statistical analysis to adjust for the relative health and medical histories of patients admitted to every hospital, Dr. Krumholz said.
 Richard Umbdenstock, president of the American Hospital Association, said hospital trade associations had joined the effort ''because we believe that patients should have the information they need to make choices.''
 Peter V. Lee, chief executive of the Pacific Business Group on Health, said the hospital associations regarded the effort warily and and noted that consumers would learn little about most hospitals from the report. 
 A list of the hospitals can be found at www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov. 
 ''Without showing true differentiation among most hospitals, we aren't serving consumers, purchasers or even the hospitals themselves,'' Mr. Lee said.
 At a news conference, government officials acknowledged that the report was far from perfect. Mr. Leavitt said the government had hoped to come out with a report that he likened to a Formula One race car.
 ''But what we're really developing today is a go-cart,'' he said. ''It will get nothing but better as time goes on.''
 The rankings measured hospitals only on how well they handled patients suffering from heart attacks or heart failure. Next year, the government will add pneumonia. And officials said they would probably begin to show increasing differentiation among the vast majority of hospitals now ranked as average.
 Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, said hospitals at the bottom of the government's rankings ''need to look at their systems, processes and education and find out how to get better.''
 ''If that's what comes out of all this,'' Dr. Nissen said, ''that's a huge benefit.''
 But Dr. Michael A. Weber, a professor of medicine in the cardiology division at the State University of New York Downstate College of Medicine, said the rankings might needlessly scare some patients.
 ''I'm a bit concerned that people might not go to the appropriate hospital and to one farther away and arrive too late to be adequately helped,'' Dr. Weber said.

HEADLINE: Senate Adopts an Energy Bill Calling for Higher Mileage for Cars

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS. 
Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21 

 BODY:
The Senate passed a broad energy bill late Thursday that would, among other things, require the first big increase in fuel mileage requirements for passenger cars in more than two decades.
 The vote, 65 to 27, was a major defeat for car manufacturers, which had fought for a much smaller increase in fuel economy standards and is expected to keep fighting as the House takes up the issue.
 But Senate Democrats also fell short of their own goals. In a victory for the oil industry, Republican lawmakers successfully blocked a crucial component of the Democratic plan that would have raised taxes on oil companies by about $32 billion and used the money on tax breaks for wind power, solar power, ethanol and other renewable fuels. 
 Republicans also blocked a provision of the legislation that would have required electric utilities to greatly increase the share of power they get from renewable sources of energy. 
 As a result, Senate Democrats had to settle for a bill that calls for a vast expansion of renewable fuels over the next decade -- to 36 billion gallons a year of alternatives to gasoline -- but does little to actually promote those fuels through tax breaks or other subsidies.
 The combination of breakthroughs and setbacks highlighted the blocking power of the entrenched industry groups, from oil companies and electric utilities to car manufacturers, that had blanketed Congress in recent days to defend their interests. 
 The clashes and impasses also provided a harbinger of potentially bigger obstacles when Democrats try to pass legislation this fall to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases tied to global warming.
 Democrats conceded that they had had won only a partial victory, but said they would have additional opportunities to push their agenda when the House takes up similar legislation, with the goal of passing it before the Fourth of July recess. 
 ''This bill starts America on a path toward reducing our reliance on oil by increasing the nation's use of renewable fuels,'' said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader. 
 Environmental groups, though disappointed by the setbacks on renewable fuels, nevertheless hailed the vote on higher mileage requirements as a long-sought victory that could eventually reduce American gasoline consumption by more than 1 million gallons of gasoline a day. 
 If the Senate bill becomes law, car manufacturers would have to increase the average mileage of new cars and light trucks to 35 miles per gallon by 2020, compared with roughly 25 miles per gallon today. 
 Car companies had lobbied ferociously for a much weaker requirement of 30 miles per gallon for light trucks and sport-utility vehicles. To muster enough votes to prevent a filibuster, about a dozen lawmakers from both parties hammered out a deal that included the higher standard but omitted explicit requirements for further increases in efficiency after 2020.
 ''We are thrilled,'' said Kevin Curtis, a lobbyist for the Pew Campaign for Fuel Efficiency. ''This is the first time in decades that the Senate has passed a significant increase in fuel economy standards.''
 The car industry's main trade association, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, appeared stunned by the sudden compromise and refused to comment publicly on the bill Thursday night.
 With a vote of 57 to 38, the Senate came three votes short of the number needed to cut off a filibuster on the tax package. Republican opponents argued that tax increases on oil companies would reduce exploration for oil and lead to higher prices on gasoline.
 Republicans also blocked another central goal, known as the Renewable Portfolio Standard, that would have required electric utilities to produce at least 15 percent of their power from renewable fuels by the year 2020.
 ''Republicans continue to pander to the big oil and energy companies,'' Mr. Reid complained after conceding defeat on those issues. ''Republicans repeatedly demonstrate that they do not care about the priorities of the American people, throwing up roadblocks at every turn instead of working with us to reduce skyrocketing gas prices.'' 
 Earlier in the day, President Bush had urged Congress to pass an energy bill, though he said the Senate measure fell far short of his goals.
 Oil executives and their lobbyists had fanned out across Congress in recent days and run frequent ads in newspapers, all delivering a carefully coordinated message: higher taxes on oil production would lead to higher gasoline prices.
 The oil industry has also fielded former lawmakers, including Bennett Johnston, former Democratic senator from Louisiana, and Don Nickles, former Republican senator from Oklahoma. And it circulated a study by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, on how higher taxes could lead to higher gasoline prices.
 Senator Reid quickly accused Republicans of doing the bidding of oil companies at a time when they are earning record profits.
 Republican opponents of the tax package said it was unfair to oil companies, would reduce investment in exploration and would ultimately increase American dependence on foreign oil.
 ''Instead of reducing gasoline prices, this is going to add to add to the cost of gasoline,'' said Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona. 
 Republicans were themselves divided, with ten voting alongside Democrats to limit debate and prevent a filibuster. Only one Democrat, Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, a major oil-producing state, voted to allow the filibuster. 
 The bill was particularly alluring to lawmakers from farm states, which already benefit from government supports for corn-based ethanol and stood to gain even more from additional incentives for wind power and cellulosic ethanol made from plants like switch grass.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, pleaded with members of his party to drop their opposition.
 ''We're taxing the oil industry to get a renewable energy industry started,'' Mr. Grassley said on the Senate floor. ''I hope you'll understand that God only made so much fossil fuel and that there's got to be a follow-on if we're going to have growth in our economy.''
 The Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group that has pushed for higher standards, estimated that the Senate requirements would eventually reduce American oil consumption by 1.2 million barrels a day and reduce emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases by an amount equivalent to removing 30 million of today's cars from the road.
 ''Today, the Senate roundly rejected the automobile industry's scare tactics,'' said Michelle Robinson, director of the Union of Concerned Scientists' clean vehicle program.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 26, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in some copies on Friday about the Senate's passage of an energy bill referred incorrectly at one point to the estimated fuel savings that could result from a mandatory increase in the efficiency of passenger vehicles. Consumption could possibly decrease by more than one million barrels a day, not one million gallons a day. (In the petroleum industry, a barrel is equal to 42 gallons.)

HEADLINE: Killings Surge in Oakland, and Officials Are Unable to Explain Why

BYLINE: By SOLOMON MOORE

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., June 15 

 BODY:
The names of friends and family members killed in this city over the last two years come easily to Rob Wilson, a rangy, dreadlocked 17-year-old gang member. 
 A brother was shot to death in a drug deal in 2005. Oakland police officers killed a cousin in a shootout last year. Gang members shot down a friend in March.
 ''It used to be I would just hear about somebody getting shot, but I wouldn't know them,'' said Mr. Wilson, who is known as Deka and who pulled up a pants leg to show a bullet wound from a shooting last year. ''Now, it's getting closer and closer to me, these deaths.''
 The shootings are part of a cresting wave of violence in Oakland, which recorded 148 homicides in 2006, a 57 percent increase over 2005 and the highest number in 11 years. As of last week, 43 people had been killed in 2007, fewer than the 60 killed over the same period last year, but still far short of a turnaround. 
 Law enforcement officials and community organizers in Oakland are hard pressed to explain the rise, particularly since homicides in the two other big cities in the Bay Area, San Jose and San Francisco, have not increased substantially. 
 Possible explanations include large numbers of violent parolees returning from prison, increasing gang violence, the availability of guns, a growing methamphetamine trade and police recruitment shortfalls. But some of those factors also exist in San Francisco and San Jose, which has a comparable number of parolees and, arguably, a larger and longer-standing gang problem than Oakland.
 ''We're trying to make sense of it,'' said Officer Roland Holmgren, a spokesman for the Oakland Police Department. ''But it's irrational.''
 The variable and somewhat mysterious homicide rates in the Bay Area mirror a national pattern in crime data for 2006 released earlier this month by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The data show killings increased significantly in some cities, including Atlanta, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington, and decreased in others, including Dallas, Los Angeles and Miami, with no definitive explanation for the differences. 
 Many criminologists and law enforcement officials are debating whether the violent-crime data signal a significant national trend. In a report, ''A Gathering Storm -- Violent Crime in America,'' the Police Executive Research Forum, a professional organization of police chiefs, warned last year that violent crime increases were ''the front end of a tipping point of an epidemic of violence not seen for years.''
 Among other factors, the chiefs blamed a decline in federal spending for a decrease in crime prevention and community policing programs and for a dip in police staffing.
 Many criminologists, however, question whether the recent increases in killings are large enough, widespread enough or consistent enough to be considered a trend. And even those who do discern a pattern say that they are often unable to explain why it is happening or what policing strategies would be best to use.
 ''There are a thousand different stories competing against each other,'' said Frank Zimring, a criminologist at the University of California, Berkeley. ''When you put all the dots together, instead of knowing more, we know less.'' 
 Murders rose 6.7 percent in 2006 in cities with more than a million people, but in the nation's three largest cities, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, violent crime either declined or held steady. In cities with populations from 250,000 to 500,000 violent crime increased 3.2 percent and murders rose 3.7 percent.
 ''Two years does not a trend make, but two years can be the beginning of one; we just don't know yet,'' said Joel Wallman, a criminologist at the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation in New York City. ''Some of these are such small changes, and the timeframe of the trend is so short that it's very difficult to determine whether this is a real trend or just random noise.'' 
 Junious Williams, the chief executive of the Urban Strategies Council, a group in Oakland that studies urban poverty and crime, said the increase in homicides was prevalent in many predominantly African-American cities. Over the last five years, African-American suspects accounted for 65 percent of Oakland's killings, according to a study by the council, and 77 percent of victims.
 ''Most of the cities experiencing increases in homicides have black pluralities, if not majority black populations,'' Mr. Williams said. ''Here in Oakland, the majority of the crimes are being committed by young brothers.''
 Poor educational opportunities, high unemployment and a criminal justice system that reinforces criminal behavior have led to an ''honorific culture'' akin to that of the Wild West for many inner city black communities, said a Harvard sociologist, Orlando Patterson.
 Respect for traditional social norms was on the decline, Mr. Patterson said, in the face of a growing hip-hop culture that puts an emphasis on street credibility for respect. 
 Some criminologists argued that the recent increases signified that the historic declines in crime in the late 1980s and 1990s had bottomed out after abnormally high levels in the wake of the crack cocaine epidemic. Tougher sentencing guidelines, widespread incarceration and the subsiding crack trade have run their course, these criminologists say, and without those overriding factors, crime rates are returning to more natural, regional levels.
 ''Even the kind of crime we're seeing now is nowhere near what we were seeing in the early 1990s,'' said Jack Riley, a researcher at the RAND Corporation, a research organization in Santa Monica, Calif.
 Whatever the debate nationally about a crime trend, many people who live and work in Oakland are seeing more death at their doorsteps.
 Jordan Murphy, 18, barely made his high school graduation last week, having been mistaken for a rival gang member and shot in the thigh in August.
 Tony Alcala, 17, survived three bullets, one in the stomach and two in the back, when he was shot last year. The police told him later that two of the men who attacked him had been arrested, and a third gunman had been killed by gang members sympathetic to Mr. Alcala.
 Dr. Javid Sadjadi, an emergency room doctor at Highland Hospital, Oakland's main public trauma center, said doctors there treated 425 shooting victims last year, some of them several times.
 ''We're starting to see the same people getting shot several times in several different incidents,'' Dr. Sadjadi said, recounting a 14-year-old shooting victim who died recently after being admitted to the hospital, his third admission for having been shot.
 Dr. Sadjadi recalled one day last summer when the hospital treated more than 10 victims of shootings. 
 ''We're also seeing much younger patients,'' he said. ''Last year was a record for shooting victims who were youths between the ages of 14 and 17.''

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Urges Tougher Rules On Smog

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21 

 BODY:
Pollution standards are too weak to protect people from the air they breathe, the E.P.A. administrator said Thursday, recommending tougher limits on the smog across the country.
 Still, under pressure from big business, the administrator, Stephen L. Johnson, left the door open to keeping the rules as they are. 
 It is the Environmental Protection Agency's first new recommendation since 1997 for ground-level ozone, the principal component of smog, that noxious combination of car exhaust, industrial emissions and gasoline vapors aggravated by summertime sun and heat.
 Mr. Johnson recommended reducing current smog standards by 11 percent to 17 percent. Among other benefits, the agency estimated this could reduce by 30 percent to 60 percent the risk of children's having trouble breathing normally.
 ''Based upon the current science, I have concluded that the current standard is insufficient to protect public health,'' Mr. Johnson said, noting that ozone can harm the lungs and aggravate asthma.
 Studies have linked increased ozone levels with higher hospital admissions. The agency will release an impact analysis of its proposal in a few weeks that will detail health benefits and economic costs.
 The E.P.A. measures smog by calculating the concentration of ozone molecules in the atmosphere over an eight-hour period. The current standard is 0.084 parts per million, which the agency proposes reducing to 0.070 to 0.075 parts per million.
 The agency will take public comment for 90 days and settle on a final number by March 12, 2008. But it is also soliciting comments on alternate standards, including keeping the current one or going down to 0.060 parts per million.
 Environmentalists criticized the E.P.A.'s decision to consider keeping the current standard, noting that the agency's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee has said the standard should be no higher than 0.070 parts per million.
 ''The science overwhelmingly supports closing the door on the current standard once and for all,'' said Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. ''Instead of listening to science, the administrator seems to be intent on listening to the wish lists of polluting industries.''
 Business and industry groups, including the National Association of Manufacturers, have been lobbying for the smog standard to stay the same, contending that lowering it would be costly and unnecessary. Although the E.P.A. says ozone levels have dropped 21 percent nationwide since 1980, states are still working to meet the smog levels set in 1997 because doing so takes years.

HEADLINE: $4 Billion Price On Bigger Plan For Expansion Of Javits Center

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
After a six-month review of the expansion plan for the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the Spitzer administration is seriously considering a revamped proposal that would include additional exhibition space but cost $4 billion, more than twice the previous estimate.
 Not long after taking office, Gov. Eliot Spitzer said he wanted to turn the much-maligned Javits center into a ''thoroughbred'' of exhibition halls. He dismissed the $1.8 billion expansion plan he inherited from Gov. George E. Pataki as a ''mouse'' and an ''elephant.'' 
 But fixing the problems of the imposing black-glass complex, which stretches along 11th Avenue between 34th and 38th Streets, has proved to be both enormously difficult and hugely expensive, according to two executives involved in the review. 
 A senior official, who requested anonymity, said the Spitzer administration quickly concluded that the existing plan would have little economic effect and would provide only a modest amount of new exhibit space, while underestimating the potential costs by $1 billion. 
 But even as the Spitzer administration's review was under way, construction costs in the city were rising rapidly; city officials said delays were costing $17 million a month.
 The governor has not made a final decision on the expansion plan, and state officials have told executives in the trade show industry that it might be two to three months before he does. 
 The two executives involved in the review of the Javits center project said the latest proposal would add 550,000 square feet of exhibit space and meeting rooms, up from about 300,000 square feet in the current plan, and would renovate the old structure. The new plan would also entail a vertical expansion, adding three levels to the three already there, an unusual feature in an industry that favors long horizontal spaces.
 Asked about the new proposal, Senator Charles E. Schumer, who has pressed for the expansion, said it was the first he had heard of it. Hotel and convention executives say they were also unaware of the proposal.
 ''We should be able to get a lot more for $4 billion than just another floor on top of the existing convention center,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''In fact, a whole new convention center would cost $4 billion.''
 Things cost more in New York, but a $4 billion expansion would be at the outer range of convention centers built in the United States, experts say. Boston completed a new exhibit hall three years ago with 716,000 square feet of meeting and exhibit space at a cost of $850 million, or $1,187 a square foot. The new plan in New York, by comparison, would cost $7, 272.73 a square foot.
 For a projected $4.8 billion, Boyd Gaming is planning the Echelon complex in Las Vegas, which includes 5,000 hotel rooms, a casino, two theaters and a 750,000-square-foot convention center.
 ''This would be one of the larger investments ever made in the convention and exhibition industry,'' said Michael Hughes, associate publisher of Tradeshow Week, an industry magazine. ''The issue for New York comes down to a return on investment. New York is the most underserved North American city in terms of exhibition space.''
 The two executives did not say how high the cost would have to go before the Javits expansion became prohibitive.
 The project has long been troubled, with seemingly widespread support but never enough propulsion to get off the ground. Almost from the day the complex opened in 1986 with 760,000 square feet of exhibit space and 30,000 square feet of meeting rooms, exhibitors and hotel owners were lobbying to expand the complex to attract larger trade shows and meetings.
 Despite a leaky roof and a faulty air-conditioning system, the Javits center is one of the busiest convention halls in the country.
 An effort to double the size of the center in 1997 ran afoul of wrangling between the state and the city. Governor Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, with the support of community groups and unions, developed the current plan to expand. But it still took six months to get legislative approval. 
 By 2006, the projected cost had risen to $1.68 billion, from $1.4 billion, while the size of the expansion shrank. The proposal also came under severe criticism from trade show managers and users of the center, who complained that the design would increase the cost of producing shows and still not provide enough room to attract larger conventions.
 The expansion plan calls for extending the center two blocks north to 40th Street and adding a ballroom that could be divided into meeting rooms. The New York Police Department had imposed new security measures for trucks entering the center that increased the cost at one point by $100 million, but it has since reduced its requirements. 
 The Spitzer administration has tried to balance the demands of the trade show industry with the city's insistence that the center sell its truck marshaling yard, between 39th and 40th Streets, and build an eight-story garage at the site's north end. Critics said the garage would eat up what should be exhibit space, but the Bloomberg administration wanted the trucks off the local streets, which have been rezoned for a commercial and residential district. 
 Last month, Governor Spitzer appeared to favor a whole new plan in which a new $3.8 billion convention center would be built over the nearby railyards, while the land beneath the center would be sold to developers to offset the costs. But he suddenly abandoned that plan after a meeting with city officials.
 The latest expansion proposal would bring the total size back to 1.34 million square feet, the executives said. It would also put a security screening system for the trucks in the yard between 39th and 40th Streets. The state would then sell the development rights overhead to residential and commercial builders.

HEADLINE: City Smokers' Ranks Drop 19%, Study Says

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The city's department of health, citing a combination of high taxes, workplace limits and $10 million in grim television advertising, said yesterday that the number of smokers in New York City had declined by 240,000 in the last five years.
 That change represents the sharpest drop since the city began keeping records in 1993, and one of the steepest declines in the nation since 1965, when the surgeon general first warned Americans about the dangers of smoking. 
 ''When we look at the U.S. data overall, from 1965 to the present, this is faster than the United States as a whole in any period,'' said Jennifer Ellis, the city health official who helped direct the study.
 City researchers, writing in a widely followed publication of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the share of the city's residents who smoked had dropped by 19 percent during the period of the study.
 They said that in 2002, about 1,305,000 city residents smoked, or about 21.6 percent of the adult population, and that in 2006, about 1,065,000 residents, or 17.5 percent, smoked. The study was based on interviews with 10,000 city residents and used the same measures that the C.D.C. uses. The sharpest drops were in the Bronx, where smoking dropped from 25.2 percent of the population to 19 percent, and in Manhattan, where the rate dropped from 21.2 percent to 16.1 percent. Staten Island was flat, at 27.3 percent in 2002 and 27.2 percent in 2006.
 Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the commissioner of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said in a telephone interview, ''The big picture is that if you are willing to do the right thing and take political risks as Mayor Bloomberg did'' with curbs on smoking in public places, ''you can get enormous health benefits.''
 Moreover, Dr. Frieden said, the administration will continue to press for higher cigarette taxes of 50 cents more per pack. Adjusted for inflation, he said, a pack is actually 60 cents cheaper now than when taxes were last raised in 2002.
 At that time, New York City increased the excise tax on cigarettes from 8 cents to $1.50 per pack. New York State also raised its excise tax from $1.11 to $1.50. Both resulted in the highest combined city/state tax in the United States at the time.
 The tax increases raised the average price of a pack from $5.20 to $6.85. The city's revenue from cigarette taxes has declined to $120 million this year from $123 million in 2005.
 Councilman Tony Avella, Democrat of Queens, who has clashed with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg about smoking curbs in restaurants, said he would oppose higher taxes.
 ''People who smoke are addicted,'' he said. ''All you succeed in doing is making addicts pay more in taxes.''
 Dr. Frieden said the city would continue to buy television advertising. ''The tobacco industry is spending at least $400 million in New York City alone for marketing and promotion,'' he said. Even if the city and state spent $20 million annually, he said, ''We would still be outspent 20 to 1.''
 Bill Phelps, a spokesman for Philip Morris USA, the nation's largest tobacco company, declined to comment.
 The health department researchers, writing in the most recent issue of the C.D.C.'s morbidity and mortality report, said the rapid drop in smoking in the city represented a continuation and an acceleration of long-term trends.
 The drop, they said, represents as many as 80,000 fewer premature deaths from cancer and other smoking-related diseases, if the smokers quit the habit permanently.
 The researchers attributed the most recent drop in the smoking rate to the 2006 television campaign highlighting the physical ravages of smoking.
 The commercials ran on broadcast and cable channels. The researchers said that the typical New York viewer would see the city's antismoking ads, called ''Nothing Will Ever Be The Same,'' as many as 110 times over the course of a year.
 Moreover, the researchers said that separate research suggested that 9 of 10 city smokers had seen the ads.

HEADLINE: A Firefighter's Death; Bigger Javits; Albany Breakdown; JT Leroy

BYLINE: SEWELL CHAN


HIGHLIGHT: The morning news: the death of a firefighter; an even bigger expansion of the Javits Convention Center; gridlock in Albany as the legislative session ends; and more. 

 BODY:
The local headlines today are dominated by the death of Firefighter Daniel F. Pujdak, who fell from the fourth floor of a warehouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, on Thursday afternoon while fighting a fire that began with a lighted cigarette left on a windowsill.
The Times notes that Firefighter Pujdak grew up close by, in the heavily Polish neighborhood of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and had been a firefighter for less than two years. The Daily News and The New York Post both make the article the wood -- the lead story on their front pages. The News says that the firefighter went into cardiac arrest after the fall and that he died at Bellevue Hospital Center with his family at his side.

The News also reports that when the wooden windowsill caught fire, it caused "a plume of smoke that made the blaze appear larger than it was." The Post writes, "Exclusive video obtained by The Post shows Pujdak tumbling about 50 feet off the stationary ladder propped up against the brick building."
An Even Bigger Javits? 
In an exclusive report, Charles V. Bagli of The Times says that the Spitzer administration, after a six-month review, is considering an even bigger plan for the expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, one that could cost $4 billion -- more than double the previous estimate.
The governor had previously dismissed the expansion plan he inherited from his predecessor, George E. Pataki, as both a "mouse" and an "elephant." 
But the lengthy review has convinced the governor's staff that the current plan "would have little economic effect and would provide only a modest amount of new exhibit space, while underestimating the potential costs by $1 billion."
The Clock Counts Down
Yesterday was the last day of the legislative session in Albany, and as is often the case, negotiations broke down on some of the most important bills. Nicholas Confessore of The Times reports that a deal to resolve a host of major issues -- from reform of the state's public authorities to construction of new power plants -- seems to have unraveled at the last minute. Danny Hakim and Nicholas Confessore report that agreement was reached on a small number of measures: requiring suspects indicted on rape charges to take H.I.V. tests; expanding Family Health Plus, a state-financed health insurance program; waiving the sales tax on clothing and footwear in New York City; and expanding the city's 421a program, which gives tax incentives for building affordable housing.
The News reports that a much-anticipated compromise on congestion pricing fell apart after the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, could not manage to muster support from his members for a package of campaign-finance changes that Gov. Eliot Spitzer has insisted upon. Meanwhile, The Post reports that the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, denied even being close to a deal with Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Bruno on having a commission recommend ways to implement congestion pricing -- subject to legislative approval next February -- and on allowing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to come up with a more detailed plan. 
For those who like to see action out of Albany -- any action -- perhaps the silver lining is that the Legislature is expected to come back into special session in July to take up a number of contentious issues left over from the regular session. So more fireworks can be expected.
Diminished Capital? 
Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Bloomberg particularly want the Legislature to act on congestion pricing in some fashion by July so that the city can be eligible to compete for some $500 million in federal transportation dollars to put traffic fees into effect. 
However, The News has an analysis this morning about the potential political drawbacks of Mayor Bloomberg's surprise announcement on Tuesday that he was leaving the Republican Party and becoming a political independent. President Bush's approval rating may be hovering around 25 percent, but his administration still controls important purse strings, and federal lawmakers now worry that the city's pleas for various forms of federal support may not receive as warm an audience as they previously have.
The News has some interesting quotes on this: 

        
Discussing a federal terrorism insurance program that the city would like to see extended, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said of Mr. Bloomberg, "This is the worst time for him to antagonize all the Republicans. His personal political agenda and the city's legislative agenda and timetables diverged, and he stuck with his own." (And that's from a liberal Democrat!)
        
Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from Long Island who has been an ally of the mayor on domestic security issues, said, "Let's face it. His standing among Republicans outside of New York has obviously gone down. It would be easier for me if he had stayed a Republican."
        
Representative Vito J. Fossella of Staten Island, the only Republican congressman from New York City, who was co-chairman of the mayor's 2005 re-election campaign, "said Bloomberg could still be effective," but offered less than reassuring words: "Mike Bloomberg has always elevated himself. Will there be a political reality down the road? There may be."
A Clash of Perspectives in Federal Court
Alan Feuer's latest chapter from the tangled saga of Laura Albert, the reclusive writer who created a fake identity, JT Leroy, analyzes the competing narratives being offered in a civil fraud trial taking place in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The production company that bought a movie option based on the book in 2003 and is now suing Ms. Albert is trying "to couch the trial as a fairly straightforward financial matter," while Ms. Albert "has clearly seen the trial as a less-than-pleasant extension of certain questions of identity arising out of childhood trauma."
At closing arguments, Gregory Curtner, the chief lawyer for the production company was particularly bold, telling the jury: "We bought the identity of the book's author. And we bought it, in part, because she was pimping it, pumping it, she was hustling it any way she knew how because she wanted to get the money."
Ms. Albert has denied that the character JT Leroy was a profit-making venture.
The Post is a bit less nuanced in its report, quoting Mr. Curtner accusing Ms. Albert of being "exploitive" and "evil" and using mental illness as a cover for fraud.
To (Bureaucratically) Bury, or Praise, a State Trooper
David W. Chen, The Times's Trenton bureau chief, reports that the New Jersey state police superintendent has concluded that the state trooper who was driving Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey during a car accident two months ago violated policy by speeding and using emergency lights; was not adequately aware of the situation; and could have prevented the accident. The trooper, Robert J. Rasinski, has been disciplined, but officials would not specify the punishment.
Interestingly, Governor Corzine -- who has apologized for neglecting to wear a seat belt -- issued a statement that did not criticize Trooper Rasinski in any way. "Moments ago I spoke to Trooper Rasinski and reiterated my personal gratitude, and the gratitude of my family, for the way he controlled the S.U.V. on April 12," Mr. Corzine said. "I have confidence in Rob and would expect him to remain in the Executive Protection Unit."
A Cloudy Picture for a Fabled Theme Park 
AM New York reports that a deal to give the Astroland amusement park at Coney Island a reprieve until next summer may be in jeopardy. A developer planning a massive transformation of Coney Island wants a rezoning before it commits to keeping the park open until 2008, the newspaper said, quoting Councilman Domenic M. Recchia Jr. of Brooklyn. Eventually, the idea is to have the theme park relocated to a different part of Coney Island.

HEADLINE: The Fight Against Malaria

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''Can a Vision Save All of Africa?'' (Talking Business column, June 16), Joe Nocera highlighted the importance of sustainable projects. While his emphasis on long-term thinking is on target, his concerns about malaria as the ''disease du jour'' should not overshadow the reality that significant accomplishments are being made in the fight against malaria. 
 International organizations and donors are now working together to increase efficiency. For example, when other funding fell short, the World Bank recently stepped in with $25 million for Tanzania, keeping its successful insecticide-treated net program going. Partners are realizing that success lies in building skills that will equip countries to fight malaria, independent of donor whims. 
 Certainly, vision alone -- whether from Jeffrey Sachs, Bill and Melinda Gates, or Bono -- won't solve problems like malaria. Progress is being made against malaria; lives are being saved. But more remains to be done, and a little (long-term) vision can't hurt. Matthew Lynch 
 Baltimore, June 20, 2007

HEADLINE: Marshall D. Shulman, 91, Dies; Expert on Soviet Union

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Marshall D. Shulman, who devoted his life to understanding the Soviet Union as a leading scholar, a policymaker and a principal builder of Columbia University's Russian studies program, died on Thursday at his home in Sherman, Conn. He was 91, meaning that he was born before the Soviet Union and outlived it.
 His wife, Colette, announced the death. The couple also shared a home in Manhattan. 
 Dr. Shulman was the longest serving director of the Russian Institute at Columbia, which became the W. Averell Harriman Institute for Advanced Study of the Soviet Union in 1982, after Dr. Shulman persuaded Mr. Harriman and his wife, Pamela, to endow the institute with $11.5 million.
 He also held the rank of ambassador as the principal adviser on Soviet matters to Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance in the Carter administration and was a speechwriter for Secretary of State Dean G. Acheson in the Truman administration. As a private citizen, he helped organize meetings between scientists and others from the United States and Russia that many believe helped ease cold war tensions.
 His best known book, ''Stalin's Foreign Policy Reappraised'' (1963), was a staple in Soviet studies for many years, and his 1966 book of lectures, ''Beyond the Cold War,'' foreshadowed the detente between the Soviet Union and the United States that occurred during the Nixon administration.
 Marshall Darrow Shulman was born in Jersey City on April 8, 1916, a year before the Russian revolution. His first passion was the violin, but when he was 6 or 7, he heard Yehudi Menuhin, who was almost exactly the same age, play. His wife said he never touched a violin again.
 After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1937, he succeeded in his next ambition, to be a journalist. He worked as a reporter for The Detroit News for two years, covering the sometimes bloody confrontations surrounding the birth of the United Automobile Workers union.
 For the next few years, he began graduate studies in government and economics at the University of Chicago and in English literature at Harvard, and worked in several writing and public affairs jobs. During World War II, he served as a glider pilot in the Army Air Forces, receiving the Bronze Star.
 At the end of the war, while recovering from pneumonia in a hospital in the Philippines, he concluded that the major postwar issue would be Soviet-United States relations.
 ''I didn't know anything about it,'' he said in an interview with The New York Times in 1986. ''I didn't even know the language.''
 He enrolled in the first class of the new Russian Institute at Columbia, earning a master's degree in 1948 and a doctorate in 1959. In 1954, he was recruited to be associate director of the Russian Research Center at Harvard. He next taught at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University from 1961 to 1967.
 He then went to Columbia as director of the Russian Institute. He became very involved in what came to be called ''second-track'' diplomacy, meaning meetings between scientists and other experts, often on arms control issues.
 ''He was the guy who could find some kind of common ground between the two parties,'' said Robert Legvold, the Marshall D. Shulman professor of political science at Columbia and, in 1986, Dr. Shulman's successor as head of the institute.
 Secretary of State Vance recruited Dr. Shulman to be his principal adviser on Soviet affairs, but Dr. Shulman grew frustrated about the deterioration in Soviet-American relations in the late 1970s. He said in an interview with The Times in August 1980 that the possibility of nuclear war ''is likely to increase rather than to diminish.''
 A month earlier, The Times quoted a friend of Dr. Shulman in the State Department as saying that Dr. Shulman experienced ''success in modest ways, but failure in the great sweep of things.''
 Dr. Shulman said, ''I couldn't characterize it any better than that.''
 Dr. Shulman's first wife, Elizabeth Van Anda Thomson, died in 1956. He is survived by his wife, the former Colette Schwarzenbach, and two children from his first marriage, Lisa Rubenstein of Winchester, Mass., and Michael of Jamaica Plain, Mass. 
 Dr. Shulman did not believe he could write a sentence without wearing a green eyeshade. He was buried with one. His sly wit was evident after Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie, who succeeded Mr. Vance, praised him profusely at a surprise award ceremony.
 ''My father would have liked it,'' Dr. Shulman said at the time. ''My mother would have believed it.''

HEADLINE: Is 'Made in China' a Warning Label?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''As More Toys Are Recalled, the Trail Ends in China'' (front page, June 19):
 Given that production of exported goods from China is seemingly driven by greed and that the regulation of imports from China is dangerously lax, let's not wait for hundreds or thousands of poisoned Americans (and pets) to force a revision of consumer safety laws governing imported products. 
 Congress should pass legislation that requires a prominent warning label when any product sold in the United States is manufactured in or contains ingredients obtained from China. American consumers could then purchase or pass, knowing that there might be a potential health risk involved with the product. 
 The loss of billions of dollars would serve as an effective wake-up call to Chinese exporters and American importers to clean up their appalling business practices. Pietro Allar 
 New York, June 19, 2007
 To the Editor:
 As the dangers surrounding some Chinese imports are revealed, where is the concern for the young Chinese people who work with these products on a daily basis? 
 The photographs accompanying your June 19 article about the lead paint used on Thomas & Friends toy trains included one of two young people touching up toys. What about their exposure to lead paint?
 As American consumers, we have the responsibility to consider the ways in which our desire for large quantities of cheaply made toys affects the health and safety of all young people, not just our own children. And American corporations hungry for cheap labor and high profit margins need to revisit their business ethics (or lack thereof). 
 Of course, keeping our children safe from lead and other toxic materials is vitally important. My 3-year-old daughter has one of the Thomas & Friends trains in her toy box. I will solve the lead paint problem in her life by tossing it in the garbage. Unfortunately, getting the lead out of the lives of the young people shown in the photographs won't be as easy. Lyz Bly
 Cleveland, June 19, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Your headline notes that the ''trail ends in China,'' but it begins in the boardrooms of corporate America, which has sacrificed ethical behavior on the altar of maximum profits.
 Consequently, American citizens are not only losing the jobs that have been shipped to less expensive Chinese workers, but we also have no assurance of receiving a safe, quality product. Carol A. Popp 
 Westland, Mich., June 19, 2007
 To the Editor:
 You report that recently recalled products made in China include toys with lead paint, fake eyeballs filled with kerosene and baby rattles that are a choking hazard. You also note the tainted pet food and poisoned pharmaceuticals and toothpaste. Who knows what we'll hear about next? 
 Three cheers for free trade and that wonderful global economy! Who needs regulation to get in the way of doing business? Joseph Schulte 
 Nanuet, N.Y., June 19, 2007
 To the Editor:
 China is sending unsafe toys to the United States and Canada. In Canada, Chinese-manufactured contaminated toothpaste with a counterfeit ''Colgate'' label has been found on the shelves in a number of stores.
 It is now time to inform China that if one more unacceptable item arrives on our shores, all imports from China will be refused. Make the Chinese government take responsibility for all exports from its country.
 Brian J. McNally 
 Ottawa, June 19, 2007
 To the Editor:
 We question why you stress the fact that most recalled toys are made in China. Since, as you note, about 80 percent of all toys are made in China, it follows that most recalled toys would be made there, too.
 We also question your use of toy safety in the United States to dramatize a broader, unrelated story about outsourcing to China and Chinese counterfeit products. This needlessly alarms parents about an entire industry instead of focusing on recently recalled products.
 The American toy industry objects to being drawn into this larger battle. Toys sold here are the safest in the world, and the standards and testing procedures used are extensive, effective and widely emulated by other countries. The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission regularly lists toys as among the safest products it monitors.
 Mistakes do occur. They are usually caught and corrected quickly. Voluntary product recalls do not represent failure, but instead demonstrate the success of the last stage of our toy safety system. Ours is a system that works. Carter Keithley 
 President
 Toy Industry Association
 New York, June 21, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Re ''A Lesson That Thomas Could Teach,'' by David Leonhardt (Economix column, June 20):
 Ensuring the safety of imported toys is simple: Require that all toys, imported or domestic, pass a safety review against federal safety standards and certification by an independent organization before they can be exhibited for sale at the major wholesale toy fairs in this country.
 Manufacturers would be required to pay for the testing and certification. Precertification would ensure that manufacturers understand and are in compliance with the standards. 
 Random testing of retail products actually sold in the United States, with severe penalties for failure to meet the standards, would ensure that the final delivered goods are the same as those exhibited and sold at the fairs. William L. Imhof

HEADLINE: Making Botox Both Medicine And Cosmetic

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
David E. I. Pyott, 53, became president and chief executive of Allergan in 1998 after spending his earlier management career in the nutrition subsidiaries of Novartis and Sandoz. The stock stood at $15.74 and the company was best known for its contact lens care solutions.
 Allergan, based in Irvine, Calif., spun off the lens care and eye surgery businesses into Advanced Medical Optics in 2002. Since then, its identity has been increasingly linked to Botox, its branded delivery system for minute doses of a bacterial toxin that can paralyze muscles for several months. Thanks to Botox's growing portfolio of cosmetic and medical applications, Allergan has forecast Botox sales this year of up to $1.16 billion. 
 But the company also makes a range of pharmaceuticals for various eye and skin care products. Wall Street has applauded the company's strong growth and strategic moves like the $3.4 billion acquisition last year of Inamed, which made Allergan a leader in silicone breast implants and implants to treat obesity in addition to giving it Juvederm, a new injectable gel for combating wrinkles. Yesterday, the stock closed at $114.47, down $2.79. Mr. Pyott discussed these recent developments. Following are excerpts:
 Q. How should we think of today's Allergan?
 A. We're seen as a biologics company because of Botox. Our valuation is in line with Genentech. But we are a very small version of Johnson & Johnson in many ways. Wall Street likes that a third of our business is discretionary spending. It's a hedge against Medicare and insurers tightening their coverage. 
 Q. You started out viewing Botox strictly as a medical product, right? 
 A. Yes. Dr. Alan Scott was treating crossed eyes and fluttering eyelids, which is how we got into the business. We thought we'd get $5 million in worldwide sales. Fortunately, we got that wrong. 
 Q. Botox's medical sales will top $500 million this year. How does the medical market work?
 A. Twenty indications have been approved in various countries. Cervical dystonia (a neck muscle disorder that pulls the head out of position) is the biggest approved medical use in the U.S. Excessive sweating -- that's hyperhidrosis -- is another interesting application, which affects eight million people in the U.S. The price per vial for medical and cosmetics is the same almost everywhere in the world but you need 300 to 400 units to treat spasticity in a leg or arm, compared to 20 to remove a crease between the eyes. 
 Q. But far more people are now getting Botox for cosmetic purposes and that segment is growing faster, right? 
 A. Last year, worldwide, Botox use accelerated in cosmetics by 32 percent. Botox for therapeutics grew 17 percent. In the short term, cosmetics will become more than 50 percent of the use. But it could swing back at the end of the decade. We are working on headache relief and bladder control for people with spinal cord injuries. We're looking at 2009 for approval on the headache and 2011 for bladder control. 
 Q. People have been opening storefronts in shopping centers for Botox treatments. Is misuse a concern?
 A. Patients should receive their treatments in an appropriate medical setting from people who are well trained. If you are just looking for a simple removal of the crease between the eyes, most people can do that. If you are looking to change the shape of the eyebrows, it requires a very precise weakening of six or seven muscles and that's where you need an expert. 
 We heavily discourage -- we even mandate -- that our sales people don't go to places like spas. We will supply to anyone who can establish their credentials as a medical professional. If it's someone new, we make sure they have a valid license through a state medical society.
 Q. Isn't the huge amount of money spent on Botox for cosmetic purposes -- and your other products like dermal fillers and breast implants -- a horrifying sign of misplaced priorities in American society?
 A. This is a worldwide phenomenon wherever there is a buildup of wealth. The cosmetic use comes out of the entertainment budget.
 Q. So how reliant are you on the state of the economy?
 A. People ask and I have to tell them it doesn't seem to have much effect if you look back to what happened after the Internet bubble burst. We go down to households with $50,000 but most have a lot more than that.

HEADLINE: A Jagged End to an Erratic Week

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street ended a volatile week with a sharp decline yesterday as investors again succumbed to nervousness about souring subprime loans and rising interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 185 points.
 The steep pullback, coming a day after a respectable gain, was characteristic of the erratic sessions Wall Street has endured in recent weeks as it has dealt with concerns ranging from interest rates to the health of hedge funds to, more recently, the prospects of unfavorable legislation from Washington.
 Yesterday's session, unusually devoid of economic or earnings data, began with a focus on the initial public offering of a stake in the management arm of the Blackstone Group. In the most talked-about initial offering since Google went public, the stock of the equity firm opened well above the $31 a share at which it had been priced late Thursday. The stock rose $4.06, or 13.1 percent, to close at $35.06. 
 Enthusiasm over Blackstone was not broad enough to prop up the markets, however.
 The Dow fell 185.58 points, or 1.37 percent, to 13,360.26. On Thursday, stocks had fluctuated before ending higher, with the Dow recovering 56 points after a 146-point tumble on Wednesday.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 19.63 points, or 1.29 percent, to 1,502.56, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 28.00 points, or 1.07 percent, to 2,588.96. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.06 points, or 0.60 percent, to 834.75.
 The week was a rough one on the stock market. The Dow lost 2.1 percent, while the S.& P. 500 fell 2 percent and Nasdaq lost 1.4 percent.
 Stocks lost ground even as bond yields fell. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 5.13 percent from 5.18 percent on Thursday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, rose 14/32, to 95 5/32.
 The dollar fell against most other major currencies, while gold prices rose.
 Light crude oil rose 49 cents, to $69.14 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Investors have been grappling with concerns about whether the economy will heat up and prompt the Federal Reserve to put off cutting, or perhaps even raising, interest rates. Also, concerns about the health of Bear Stearns hedge funds involved with subprime loans, those made to people with poor credit, have weighed on the markets.
 In addition, lawmakers in Washington are impatient with some of the vast sums Wall Street investors have generated and could look to tamp down big payouts with higher taxes. Several House Democrats proposed yesterday an increase to the taxes paid by those who manage hedge funds and private equity companies.
 Bill Schultz, chief investment officer at McQueen, Ball & Associates, contends the pullback in stocks is not unexpected given the sizable gains Wall Street has seen. Even with yesterday's losses, the Dow is up 7.2 percent for the year, while the S.& P. 500 is higher by 5.9 percent and the Nasdaq is up 7.2 percent.
 ''There's a point where you need to see a pause before people get excited again,'' he said. ''Do you commit at this point or do you wait for a pullback? There's a sense that maybe we may be a little bit overextended here.'' 
 Yesterday's session brought added volatility for some stocks as the Russell indexes made changes, adding and subtracting some companies. The changes can stir some unusual trading activity as managers of investments that track the index try to square their holdings with the latest makeup of an index.
 Neil Massa, senior trader at MFC Global Investment Management, contends stocks were showing volatility yesterday in part because of the rebalancing of the Russell indexes. Even the moves among some small-capitalization companies can affect larger stocks, he said, as investors jockey for positions.
 ''I think it spills over and I think this is a little healthy pullback from the highs we've been seeing,'' he said.
 The session comes ahead of a busy week. The Federal Reserve is scheduled to meet, and investors will receive several readings on the housing sector. Also, the final report on economic growth in the first quarter will come with release of the gross domestic product.
 In corporate news, Jabil Circuit, a contract electronics manufacturer, rose $1.93, or 9.1 percent, to $23.13 after its fiscal third-quarter profit excluding items like restructuring costs topped Wall Street's estimate.
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about three to one on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: For Women, a Recipe to Create a Successful Business

BYLINE: By LAURA NOVAK

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
One morning in May, Veronica Salazar stuffed refried beans into sandal-shaped masa cakes, concentrating to block the commotion in a cavernous kitchen here in the Mission District. The chopping of vegetables added to the din as the clang of metal pans against stainless steel equipment competed with background music from a local Spanish-language radio station.
 But this kitchen, known by the Spanish name La Cocina, is no ordinary restaurant or commercial operation. Instead, the chefs here -- all women, most of them immigrants -- work side by side to achieve a common goal: starting their own food businesses and, in some cases, elevating themselves out of poverty.
 Known as a ''kitchen incubator,'' La Cocina (la-koh-SEE-nuh) is a shared-use space created two years ago to provide a platform for women entrepreneurs without assets. Offering a low hourly rate for access to 2,200 square feet of restaurant-quality kitchen space, the nonprofit La Cocina also provides training from high-profile mentors and technical assistance on creating business plans and building marketing programs. 
 ''There's an entrepreneurial gene,'' said Valeria Perez Ferreiro, executive director of La Cocina. ''And we are finding amazing entrepreneurs who are already cooking or have a product that is so promising that it deserves to be seen in the market and that we think has a chance for success.''
 Ms. Salazar, 32, was one of the first participants in La Cocina and is one of its bigger successes. Her company, El Huarache Loco, makes traditional foods from Mexico City.
 Working with intensity, she needed to produce 700 of her trademark huaraches, the bean-filled cakes, for her weekly booth at a farmer's market and hundreds more for Carnaval San Francisco festivities over Memorial Day weekend. She also prepared fish and shrimp ceviche as an employee stirred 30 gallons of carnitas in a brazing skillet for a catering job for 100 people. 
 ''I come here to learn all the business, and I need to learn more every day,'' Ms. Salazar said, while dicing pounds of tomatoes for a salsa roja. ''Tomorrow, I have three parties. So if I do this tomorrow, I know I can do something by myself.'' 
 The specialty foods prepared here are a reflection of the ethnic makeup of La Cocina's participants. More than half the women are Latina, with another 8 percent African-American. The rest are Asian or Caucasian. Their products, both fresh and packaged, range from Mexican street fare to Irish chocolates, vegetarian sushi, South African meat pies and Brazilian cakes.
 La Cocina has opened its own booth at the high-end Ferry Building Marketplace, where it sells its participants' packaged products along with house-made charcuterie, pricey olive oils and $8-a-dozen organic eggs. 
 Every day La Cocina's calendar is replete with participants preparing packaged products and hot food for catering jobs, coffee shops and a busy farmer's market near the airport. Anna Shi's Gourmet has a standing weekly order for 900 of her vegetarian tofu egg rolls for the Berkeley school district. Maria del Carmen Flores sells 1,500 of her yucca and plantain chips in 50 stores. Independent grocers around the Bay Area and Whole Food Markets throughout the state have picked up many of La Cocina's specialty products. 
 ''The really cool thing about a business incubator is that when you get entrepreneurial people in one place, there's a synergistic effect,'' said Tracy Kitts, vice president and chief operating officer of the National Business Incubation Association, a nonprofit membership organization. ''Not only do they learn from staff, they learn tons from each other, and this really contributes greatly to their success.'' 
 The association estimates there are 1,200 incubation programs in the United States. Only 19 of them are kitchen incubators, Mr. Kitts said, because the start-up and operating costs are much higher than for a mixed-use space. Eight of those programs are in urban areas, including Rochester, New York City, Denver and Minneapolis.
 La Cocina is housed in a starkly modern structure wedged among tattered row houses and apartment buildings in the Mission District. Residents are primarily low-income people from Mexico and El Salvador, where Ms. Perez Ferreiro says there is a strong tradition of entrepreneurship. 
 La Cocina was created by the California Women's Foundation in response to a survey that indicated that 90 percent of women in the Mission District said they needed adequate equipment and proper permits to run their businesses, but that commercial kitchen space in San Francisco was either unaffordable or geographically inconvenient. Many of them said they were cooking illegally out of their homes. 
 The foundation and government grants make up more than three-quarters of La Cocina's $575,000 annual budget. About 17 percent of its funding comes from rent charged to six commercial tenants (including men), who pay $30 to $40 an hour, depending on the type of equipment being used. The program participants pay $8 to $10 an hour for the space, utensils and small ware. 
 ''We are not creating a parallel nonprofit world where they are in a sheltered workshop,'' Ms. Perez Ferreiro said. ''The reason we charge a fee is that we want them to have a business model that is sustainable. If they don't incorporate the cost of doing business, it's artificial, and it's going to crumble.'' 
 To avoid that, Jason Rose, La Cocina's culinary director, and Caleb Zigas, the program director, both of them bilingual, meet weekly with the women to review food costs, recipes and sales and marketing plans. Participants also pair with consultants from partner organizations who work on finances and cash flow statements. 
 Ms. Salazar of El Huarache Loco employs five family members at her booth at the Alemany Farmers' Market, where Mr. Zigas says she takes in $3,000 every weekend. Costs of goods, licenses, employee wages and kitchen rental means she nets $1,000. But he points out that Ms. Salazar will soon be able to afford to buy a home; he is searching for commercial space for her to open a restaurant, a prospect he calls ''thrilling.'' 
 ''It's the translation from informal economy, which is cash-in, cash-out, to a formal economy, which is concept, then investment, then growth,'' Mr. Zigas said. ''It's a really hard conceptual translation to make, to go from knowing how much you're making every day to thinking about money in a longer-term vision.'' 
 When Jill Litwin applied to La Cocina, she had abundant vision but needed help with what she calls her ''road map.'' Ms. Litwin is the owner of Peas of Mind, a line of frozen organic toddler food that she developed in Vermont.
 At first, she was only capable of making 12 mini-casseroles at a time. The staff brought in a food scientist to help Ms. Litwin recalibrate her recipes so that each batch would turn out 400. They also introduced her to a human resources specialist and made a critical introduction to a food buyer for Whole Foods Market. 
 ''They are helping people produce products that are high quality and of great integrity,'' said Justin Jackson, executive coordinator for purchasing at Whole Foods in Northern California. ''If it wasn't well thought through and executed properly, our interest wouldn't be what it is.'' 
 Peas of Mind is now in 80 stores in California, 20 of them Whole Foods Markets, which is discussing plans to take her product national. Ms. Litwin says she has doubled her 2006 sales in the first quarter of this year. 
 ''If you are an entrepreneur, you are in your own world and you never know if you're on the right track,'' Ms. Litwin said. ''This is definitely a community you can bounce ideas off of. And if they don't know the answer, they'll find somebody who does.''

HEADLINE: It's Anger, Not Nostalgia, At This Antioch Reunion

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio, June 22 

 BODY:
The messages have been flying through alumni chat rooms, sometimes 10 a minute, ever since Antioch University announced that it was closing, at least for now, the undergraduate college that once seemed the very symbol of the 1960s.
 Sue the rascals, one urged. Another said, Secede. 
 So perhaps it was inevitable that on Friday at their reunion here Antioch's alumni, once the youths trained to smash the system, stayed faithful to their tradition, baring their claws at a run-in with university trustees who had voted to close their college because of low enrollment and a financial crisis. 
 As John Feinberg, class of '70, president of the alumni board, put it: ''We're not plain vanilla. Ben & Jerry could have named a new flavor for us.''
 True, early plans for a tent city fizzled, and no paint splattered the walls at the meeting with the trustees. But the alumni, fired up by last week's surprise announcement of the closing, flocked to this rural campus. The university says it expects more than 400 to show up this weekend. 
 Friday's gathering, the first chance for trustees to tell alumni directly about their surprise decision to close the 155-year-old college, combined political grilling with encounter session for a caustic mix. 
 Trustees -- holding back tears, their voices quavering -- used questions as springboards to express their sadness and anguish over the closing. But impatient alumni demanded answers. ''We came here from all across the United States at our own expense,'' shouted one from the back rows. ''We want answers!''
 Another shouted: ''Less talk! More questions!'' 
 Trustees insisted they had no other choice, given the college's falling enrollment and dire finances, than to shut it and perhaps reinvent it four years down the road. A new curriculum program, intended to save money and shrink the faculty by abolishing majors and developing areas of concentration instead, projected that 190 new students would enter Antioch last September; instead 63 showed up. This year the college had 125 acceptances for September, but it was still not enough. The school is to be shut in July 2008.
 ''We have the same love and passion for Antioch that you have,'' said Arthur J. Zucker, chairman of the university board of trustees. ''Something dramatic had to be done.''
 Part of the alumni frustration stemmed from how the decision came about, which seemed to many a repudiation of Antioch's tradition of weekly ''community government'' meetings where students, faculty members and administration officials discuss a range of issues. As Richard Daily, class of '68, a lawyer and alumni board member, said in an interview, ''Antioch is one of those institutions where nothing happens by diktat -- except its closure.''
 True to their training in community organizing, alumni created a breakaway fund to raise money for Antioch College, which university officials are hoping to reinvent and reopen in 2012. Aiming to raise $40 million in two years, the alumni board plans to leverage the money to guarantee them a voice in shaping Antioch's future, Mr. Daily said.
 ''The Antioch Emancipation Fund,'' as Cary Nelson, class of '67, president of the American Association of University Professors, described it.
 The faculty, too, is threatening legal action to stop the closing.
 In its heyday in the 1960s, Antioch was a center of hippie culture on campus, with more than 2,000 students enrolled. ''Antioch was always at the head, with the beatniks, the antiwar movement, civil rights,'' said Barrie Grenell, who attended in the 1960s. ''And now we're in the forefront of disintegrating colleges.''
 In its glory days, it attracted students who wanted to change the world, through war protests or work in communities. But Steven Lawry, Antioch's president, said in an interview that more recently, the college became a magnet for students who felt marginalized, and so bred a political narrowness and culture of resentment. By way of example, he cited students getting ''called out'' for wearing Nikes, seen as an emblem of globalization.
 ''It became less about intellectual rigor, than a political and social experience,'' he said. ''The boot camp of the revolution became the model.'' 
 ''We were offering,'' he added, ''a political re-education'' instead of a liberal education.
 And that model, he added, is sharply at odds with what most students are looking for these days. He said there had also been huge failures in management going back decades, like not seeking bequests from alumni. But he added that the college had also deteriorated and lacked clarity about its strengths. And it lacked its own board of trustees, instead reporting to a board that covers the college and five satellite campuses in four states for graduate and continuing education students.
 With enrollment down to 400 and the college struggling for every student, though, alumni insist that the death of the Antioch they knew does not represent some larger social change among the country's youth, just the fruit of years of neglect and poor management. 
 Heading into what for many may be their final class reunion here, several alumni said they left the meeting unconvinced that the closing was inevitable.
 Trustees acknowledged that they should have made a last-ditch emergency appeal for donations from alumni, and consulted with faculty members and alumni before taking such a drastic step. 
 Tim Noble, class of '02, the grandson of a past Antioch president, asked trustees why, given their failures, alumni should trust them now with the institution's future.
 One by one, trustees took to the lectern, offering to step down , until one, Sharon Merriman, class of '55, rejected the criticism, saying Antioch's woes were long in the making. ''We make a great shooting gallery,'' she said, ''but we didn't create these problems all by ourselves, and we can't solve them all by ourselves.''

HEADLINE: Homes Sell. Homes Don't Sell. Builders Still Build.

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
THE American housing market, as measured by home-building activity, is falling at the most rapid rate in decades, underscoring the pain felt by builders who were far too optimistic about the state of the market. 
 Even with the plunge, however, starts have been very high relative to the number of homes that builders are trying to sell, a fact that could indicate the weakness will last while builders seek to sell homes they have already built.
 The accompanying charts on housing starts show the total number of single-family homes begun in rolling 12-month periods, and compare that with the number begun in the period ended a year earlier.
 In the 12 months through May, 1.27 million single-family homes were started, a figure that is 25 percent below the number started in the 12 months through May 2006.
 The rapid fall clearly caught builders by surprise, in part because many of them had never seen anything like it. During the period covered by the charts, going back to 1990, the fastest fall had been in 1991, when the pace fell 18 percent during a recession.
 There have been such rapid declines before, but not in the memory of most current builders. In 1975, amid the most severe recession since the Great Depression, the decline was 37 percent, the highest recorded since the government started collecting the statistics in 1963. There was also a large drop in 1982, during a recession that came when interest rates were extraordinarily high.
 When the economy went into recession in 2001, however, the annual decline was never as high as 6 percent. That recession was the only one that had virtually no effect on the housing market, as repeated interest rate reductions from the Federal Reserve served to reinvigorate building quickly.
 While the rate of decline over the last year was high, the level of housing starts, as can be seen, is still higher than it was for most of the 1990s, which could indicate it has further to decline.
 Most analyses of housing starts do not look at the annual totals cited here; instead, they look at seasonally adjusted annual rates. That figure for May was 1.17 million homes, well below the 12-month total. It has stabilized since hitting bottom in January, which led some analysts to conclude that the worst was over for housing.
 The seasonal adjustments are, however, significant and those numbers can show significant fluctuations even when the market is steady, as weather conditions lead builders to move starts forward or back from what they might have planned. While the annual rate fell in May, the actual number of homes started was virtually unchanged from April.
 The other charts show the trend in the number of new homes on the market, through April. (May figures will be released Tuesday.) The inventory of new homes for sale rose to the highest level ever last summer, at 573,000 homes in July, and has since begun to fall, going down to 538,000 in April. 
 But that figure was equal to 40 percent of the home starts in the previous year, the highest level ever. It is unlikely that home starts will turn up significantly until that inventory is significantly reduced.

HEADLINE: A Mayor Often Ill at Ease, And Usually Muted on Iraq

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The mayor's lips are pursed. The tuxedo-and-gown dinner crowd in the Pierre hotel ballroom has fallen still, just a few spoons rattling along the rims of dessert plates. At the very front of the room, the spotlight has settled on Michael R. Bloomberg. Someone is reading an award citation for his work as mayor. Mr. Bloomberg oscillates. He bounces on his toes, nods his head. His eyes appear to be pinned open. Though he has not uttered a word, Mr. Bloomberg's body seems to all but scream: Get me out of here. 
 It is easy to watch him going through the motions of the routine antics of public officialdom -- the giving of plaques, the issuing of proclamations, the receiving of medals -- and believe that he shows up only because, somehow, if just through body language, he can sneer at the ceremony. That the soul of a punk-rocker has been wrapped in custom-tailored suits. 
 By quitting the Republican Party, Mr. Bloomberg has made himself available for a presidential campaign, ready for voters who like their coffee strong. Yet for all his bluntness, Mr. Bloomberg has kept his lips pursed on the defining exercise of American power in the 21st century -- the invasion of Iraq -- except to offer quiet, unambiguous support. 
 At the Pierre on Thursday, as the gold medal of the Foreign Policy Association was draped around his neck in honor of his efforts at education reform, Mr. Bloomberg ducked his head and managed the barest of smiles.
 Mr. Bloomberg combines frank indifference to ritual with what seems like a full-brained embrace of problems: Here are 158 pages on how the city can cut the amount of carbon fuels it burns. Here's a new telephone number for all city services. Here's a reorganized school system.
 He raced through his speech Thursday evening without bothering much about the oratory, but still managed to offer a panoramic view on a few topics. He noted that in a global economy, a weak education meant second-class citizenship. Without 400,000 to 500,000 immigrants every year, he said, the country would not have enough people to pay for Social Security, to start new businesses, or to refresh the culture. And how, he asked, could the United States have visa rules that forced brilliant foreign graduate students who had gotten American degrees to leave the country?
 ''We just have to stop this craziness, and understand who we are, and not be so threatened by terrorism that the terrorists win without firing a shot,'' he said.
 Although he was speaking to a foreign policy group, Mr. Bloomberg barely mentioned Iraq or the central role that the city was assigned in the justification for the war. 
 In May 2004, a year after the invasion, Mr. Bloomberg served as host to Laura Bush, who had come to New York in an effort to rally support for the war effort. Mrs. Bush visited a memorial for Sept. 11th victims. Standing next to Mrs. Bush, with the Statue of Liberty in the background, Mr. Bloomberg, right, suggested that New Yorkers could find justification for the war at the World Trade Center site, even though no Iraqi is known to have had a hand in the Sept. 11 attacks.
 ''Don't forget that the war started not very many blocks from here,'' he said that day in 2004. 
 Apart from these remarks and other comments about the cruel history of Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bloomberg has said little about the war or other foreign affairs; to do so, he and his aides have said, would be a form of grandstanding for which he has no taste. 
 A few hours before the mayor gave his speech on Thursday night, American military officials announced that 14 more soldiers had been killed in two days. And for Iraqi civilians, the death toll of 9/11 is not a once-in-an-epoch moment, but often the monthly body count in the morgues. In his speech, Mr. Bloomberg remarked on the sacrifice of soldiers and what he implied was the ingratitude of people opposed to the war.
 ''We shouldn't forget that we have young men and women overseas fighting and dying, sadly, so that we can protest,'' he said. ''I sometimes think young protesters don't realize that their right to protest is not something that they would have elsewhere, and it's a right that has to be fought for continuously.''
 As for those who made the decision to go to war, Mr. Bloomberg's lips remained firmly sealed.

HEADLINE: At Talks on Europe's Charter, a Crisis Averted, for Now

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and DAN BILEFSKY

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Saturday, June 23 

 BODY:
Europe's leaders averted a crisis on Saturday after Poland stepped back from a dramatic threat to veto a treaty to replace the European Union's defunct constitution.
 During two days of tense diplomacy at a summit meeting here, Poland, one of the newest members of the 27-nation bloc, warned that it would prevent an agreement, prompting a counterthreat from Germany, which held the chairmanship of the meeting, that it would continue negotiations without Warsaw. 
 But a last-minute meeting and telephone calls organized by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany helped to convince Poland's leaders that their intransigence could leave them isolated. 
 Diplomats worked into the early hours on Saturday to try to complete the deal, as supporters of the original constitution complained that it had been diluted too much. Collapse had appeared all but inevitable after Poland repeatedly objected to a proposed new voting system based on population, arguing that it would favor larger countries like Germany.
 Warsaw shocked its European Union colleagues by invoking Nazi Germany at the meeting and arguing that it deserved political compensation for its losses in World War II. 
 Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski of Poland argued, ''If Poland had not had to live through the years of 1939-45, Poland would today be looking at the demographics of a country of 66 million.'' The Polish delegation even brought a team of 10 mathematicians to Brussels to ensure that it was not duped into agreeing to an unfavorable voting system. 
 Failure would have damaged Europe's aspirations to improve its stature on the world stage at a time when the union is striving to become an equal partner with Washington and play a leading role on global issues like climate change, the Middle East and an assertive Russia. 
 Speaking to reporters, Mr. Blair said: ''This gives us the chance to move on. It gives us the chance to concentrate on issues to do with the economy, climate change, defense, energy. It allows us to move on to things that are ultimately more important.''
 Failure here would have also badly damaged Mrs. Merkel, who had staked Germany's prestige on a successful outcome now, when it holds the union's rotating presidency.
 She has recently been praised for her stewardship of a Group of 8 summit meeting this month at a Baltic Sea resort, where she successfully pressed President Bush on global warming. A major policy failure in Brussels would have focused attention on her failings at home, including lagging economic reforms. 
 Following Mrs. Merkel's diplomacy, Warsaw accepted a compromise delaying the introduction of the voting system until 2014 and additional measures protecting smaller nations from being outvoted.
 Key obstacles to a new treaty began to fall away late Friday. Britain, which had also threatened a veto, accepted formation of a new office for foreign policy, withdrawing reservations over the plan after negotiators scrapped the title ''foreign minister,'' which offended London's sensitivities about preserving its national sovereignty. 
 Britain won further changes, including guarantees that its employment and social security laws would not be affected by a European Union charter of rights and that it would not be outvoted on justice and home affairs questions. 
 Still, most of the diplomatic activity was focused on Poland's veto threat, which posed the risk of continuing the paralysis that has long afflicted the effort to negotiate a new European Union treaty. 
 Poland's leaders were left in no doubt that they could also provoke a backlash against their nation, which has emerged as one of the bloc's most difficult members.
 European officials have warned in recent days that Poland, which has demanded European Union support in recent disagreements with Russia, could find itself isolated and could put at risk the generous subsidies it received from the European Union. 
 Mr. Sarkozy emerged as a pivotal figure, and he was engaged in furious diplomacy to try to persuade Poland. Mrs. Merkel has only rarely made public appearances here, instead negotiating behind the scenes. 
 Mr. Sarkozy said psychological and historical factors made relations between France and Poland less tense than relations between Poland and Germany.

HEADLINE: Vote on Mileage Reveals New Configuration in the Senate

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22 

 BODY:
Automakers had to know they were in serious trouble when Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat with deep blue-collar roots, announced that she had lost patience with their annual objections to higher gas mileage rules.
 ''When automobile manufacturers told me they could not meet the increased standards, I listened,'' said Ms. Mikulski, who said she had always been swayed by the potential loss of middle-class manufacturing jobs. ''I listened year after year, and now I have listened for more than 20 years. After 20 years, I firmly do believe it is time for a change.''
 Bolstered by such converts as Ms. Mikulski, the Senate just before midnight Thursday approved an energy bill that would for the first time in more than two decades require auto companies to produce cars and trucks that get substantially more out of a gallon of gas. 
 But that was about the only industry it took on. The measure, approved on a bipartisan 65-to-37 vote, essentially spared oil and gas companies and major utilities and fell short of goals initially set by supporters in areas like renewable fuels.
 Still, lawmakers treated the traditionally insurmountable opposition of the auto industry as little more than a speed bump on the way to the bill's passage. That amounted to a cultural shift in the Senate, where an alliance of union-backed Democrats, lawmakers of both parties from auto-producing states and business-minded Republicans had always pulled together to hold off increases in fuel efficiency rules, also called the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards. They traditionally argued that the technology for higher mileage was not available, car costs would rise and Detroit would be forced to make lighter and smaller but more dangerous cars.
 But with gasoline at $3 per gallon, the industry hemorrhaging jobs and foreign manufacturers producing cars that get better mileage, advocates of increasing the mileage standards were able to stitch together a potent coalition behind an increase. 
 ''The time has come for us to speak for the American people and not the car manufacturers,'' Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader, said earlier in the week as he inspected new plug-in, hybrid electric cars in a park adjacent to the Capitol.
 If the Senate bill becomes law, new cars, light trucks and S.U.V.'s will have to get an average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020, compared with roughly 25 m.p.g. today. Automakers had sought not only more time to reach the higher standard, but they had also lobbied, unsuccessfully, for a separate, and more relaxed, S.U.V. requirement of 30 m.p.g. by 2025. S.U.V.'s now must achieve an average of 21.3 m.p.g.
 The outcome left industry allies in Congress scrambling Friday to try to head off a similar result in the House, where the influence of the automotive industry is declining as well. They acknowledged a very real image problem for the car industry but said moving too quickly was unfair to American industries that had higher labor and benefit costs than their foreign competitors. And they said oil industry allies had purposefully put the Senate spotlight on automobiles to protect oil and gas companies from new regulation.
 ''The reality is that Big Oil would like to keep the focus off of them,'' said Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan.
 Backers of the bill suffered two major defeats. Republicans blocked a proposal to impose about $32 billion in new taxes on oil and gas companies to subsidize production and research of renewable energy sources. Lawmakers also prevented a vote on a plan to require utilities to produce 15 percent of their electricity with renewable fuels by 2020.
 But Democrats promised on Friday to continue to pursue those initiatives and said they had the votes to prevail eventually. And they hailed the bill that passed as a major step forward, pointing to new energy efficiency standards for appliances and the federal government as well as a requirement for the annual use of 36 billion gallons of alternative fuels like ethanol by 2022.
 ''Beyond petroleum has to be more than a television commercial,'' said Senator Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat who played a central role in securing the votes for the measure.
 Some interest groups criticized the bill as not doing enough while Republicans said it could drive up the price of gasoline at the pump while doing nothing to promote more domestic oil and gas production.
 ''This is really an anti-energy bill,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.
 But the chief development by far was the approval of the automotive mileage changes over intense lobbying by the auto industry. Lawmakers and Senate officials said they quickly heard from angry representatives of the major car manufacturers and unions, who complained that the mileage rules gave Nissan, whose fleet already comes close to meeting the new mileage standard, an advantage. This helped pick up the votes of senators from Tennessee, where Nissan has plants.
 At the same time, auto industry allies said provisions on flexible-fuel vehicles that favored domestic companies were watered down, removing a potential competitive advantage by Detroit over its foreign rivals. 
 Ms. Stabenow said members of the Michigan Congressional delegation met Friday to plot strategy for the upcoming House energy fight and to try to win improvements in the mileage rules and perhaps some help for the industry. 
 Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and the senior member of the House, has long been able to thwart efforts to increase mileage standards. But Mr. Dingell and Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California have bumped heads on the issue, and momentum is building in the House for an aggressive package of energy initiatives.
 Mr. Reid, the majority leader, predicted Friday that the House and Senate would be able to reconcile their differences quickly, allowing Congress to deliver a final bill to the president in the near future.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 25, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the Senate's approval of legislation that would require auto makers to produce cars and trucks that get substantially higher gas mileage misstated the final vote. With 92 of 100 senators voting, it was 65 to 27 -- not 65 to 37.

HEADLINE: A Lifeline Of Sorts To Newspapers

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
So I went to Chicago this week to see Sam Zell, the billionaire real estate mogul who not all that long ago sold one of his major holdings, Equity Office Properties Trust, to the Blackstone Group for $39 billion. 
 In all of human history, there has never been a larger private equity deal. But was I interested in interviewing him about this great triumph? Nah. As a cog in the wheel of the struggling newspaper industry, I wanted to hear what Mr. Zell had to say about his recent -- how to describe it? ''Takeover?'' ''Bear hug?'' ''Assumption of control?''-- of the Tribune Company, owner of The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times, a handful of television stations and the Chicago Cubs, among other assets. 
 As Zell deals go, this hardly ranks among his biggest; he's putting up a ''mere'' $250 million to gain control of a company with $5.5 billion in revenue last year. But what it lacks in economic heft, it more than makes up for in complexity. When the deal closes, probably at the end of the year, the Tribune Company will go from being a public company to a private S corporation, meaning it will pay no corporate taxes. Its sole owner will be an employee stock ownership plan, which is essentially a fund, owned by employees, which owns the company's stock. ESOPs also pay no taxes, meaning that both the company and its owner will no longer be taxpayers. Mr. Zell, who will become chairman of the company, will immediately recoup his $250 million and then reinvest an additional $315 million (don't ask). He'll have an option to buy 40 percent of the company for another $500 million to $600 million. (If he does so, he will become the one taxpayer in the deal.)
 The Tribune Company will be laden with debt, $13 billion in all, which it plans to pay down in part with the extra cash flow that is generated from not having to pay taxes. If the company does well -- or even just decently -- everyone will make out, starting with the employees whose stock in the ESOP will be worth a lot more than $28 a share, the discounted price the ESOP paid for it. 
 But if it continues to sink -- and just this week, the Tribune Company announced that May revenue fell 11.1 percent -- then the company could wind up in default, which would hurt everyone, starting, again, with the employees, who would lose the value of their ESOP shares. 
 This state of affairs means that all hands at the Tribune Company have a powerful incentive to figure out some way to stop the bleeding, and start growing again. And all of us who work at the country's other newspaper companies, which are also bleeding to greater or lesser degrees, have a rooting interest in Tribune's experiment. Which is not to say we all ought to be racing to set up ESOPs. As is so often the case, one man's meat is another man's poison.
 A VISIT to Mr. Zell's Chicago office is always a bit of a trip. A short gruff man with a trim white beard, Mr. Zell, 65, tends toward gold chains, brightly colored shirts and jeans. He is joyously blunt-spoken and quite funny. And his office is festooned with extravagant music boxes he designs each year and sends out at Christmastime. Last year's version, for instance, features a Frank Sinatra soundalike singing lyrics, written by Mr. Zell, that lampoon Sarbanes-Oxley, while two sculptured hands moved forward, as if to throttle American capitalism. (You can see and hear most of the collection at www.yegsz.com; it's worth a visit for the sheer entertainment value.)
 But back to the Tribune Company. The newspaper industry, as has been documented ad nauseum, is hurting because the Internet has wreaked havoc on its business model. The once-lucrative classified ad business has been largely destroyed, while circulation has fallen sharply as people have either stopped reading the paper, or taken to reading it online free. Advertising on the Internet, meanwhile, generates only a fraction of the revenue that ads in a newspaper bring in. The trick, which no one has yet solved, is to figure out how to grow as readers and ads continue to gravitate to the Internet.
 As it turns out, Mr. Zell doesn't have a silver bullet either. He seemed to take the view, for instance, that all it would take for the Tribune Company to start generating more ad revenue was a smarter advertising sales approach. And while he said he had ideas he wasn't ready to unveil until the transaction closed, he didn't seem to believe, as so many do (myself included), that the news business is going to have to find a different model if it hopes to thrive again. ''It is a 160-year-old business that has a lot of history and an opportunity to do a much better job,'' he said, speaking of the Tribune Company.
 Mr. Zell also made it plain that he did the deal not because he harbored some deep feelings about the role of newspapers in a democracy, but because he was getting a good asset on the cheap. ''I looked at this as a business transaction,'' he told me. ''That's just who I am. My entry point is $34 a share''-- and that low price is why he jumped in. (The ESOP trustee negotiated the lower $28 a share for the employees.) He was just doing what he's done his entire career: buying an out-of-favor asset.
 What most seemed to excite him was the ESOP itself. And why not? As the Lehman Brothers tax expert Robert Willens said, ''He is using it in a way that no one has ever done before.'' Mostly, ESOPs are set up when family owners want to cash out of privately held companies and turn them over to their employees. Mr. Zell, by contrast, is using it to buy out the shareholders of a large public corporation --and turn it into a tax-free private company. 
 ''If I do it right,'' Mr. Zell said, ''the Tribune will offer a new kind of example. If I can get people to focus on the fact that they own it, we can make progress towards creating value.'' He continued: ''Being a private company will be beneficial.'' Righting the ship, he thought, would be easier if the Tribune Company no longer had to worry about the pressures of Wall Street.
 In that case, I asked him, should Dow Jones and The New York Times Company --two companies where revenue and the stock price have declined in recent years --follow him into ESOP-ville? More broadly, if going private made sense for the Tribune Company, did it therefore make sense for other media companies? This is an idea that gets talked about a lot these days among journalists, who fear that the nonstop cost-cutting demanded by Wall Street will damage even the best newspapers -- and who see private ownership as a panacea.
 Mr. Zell quickly dismissed Dow Jones from the discussion; its ''point of entry'' was too high, thanks to Rupert Murdoch's $60-a-share offer. But for the Times Company, and many other media companies with depressed stock prices, it might well make sense, he said.
 But I'm not so sure. The notion of taking a struggling company private is an appealing one on the surface. Brian Tierney, the Philadelphia advertising executive who led a consortium of local investors who bought The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Daily News from Knight Ridder last year, told me that running them as a private enterprise has made a world of difference. ''We are spending $14 million to boost marketing and circulation,'' he said. ''Knight Ridder spent $300,000. If we were publicly traded, we couldn't do this.'' Of course, going private didn't prevent Mr. Tierney from calling for big layoffs when the papers turned in some dismal numbers shortly after he took them over.
 The truth is, the problem is the same for all newspaper companies, whether private or public. They all have to continue groping toward an uncertain future until they find a way to start growing again. If they don't, they're doomed. ''Badly run newspapers will fail,'' said Merrill Brown, a media industry consultant. The Tribune Company may no longer have to face pressure from Wall Street, but it is going to have an enormous amount of debt to service, and that is going to create short-term pressure at least as onerous as anything Wall Street could devise.
 However much Mr. Zell admires his ESOP, it's worth remembering that the Tribune Company acted out of desperation. It had put itself up for sale and had come up empty. Other newspapers companies, despite their problems, aren't in the same dire place. In the case of The New York Times Company -- which has been facing off with an activist investor from Morgan Stanley, who has gained considerable support for his view that the company needs to do much more to bolster its share price -- the company has a different kind of shield. Its supervoting Class B shares are held by a family, the Sulzbergers, that is completely united in its desire to continue to own the company, and to see it through to better times. 
 As infuriating as it may be to the company's public shareholders, that unity offers just as much insulation as Mr. Zell's ESOP -- without the burden of all that ESOP debt. At Dow Jones, the company ran out of time when the controlling Bancroft family became divided. Indeed, the pressure of the public marketplace might actually be a net plus for the Times Company, because it means that management is constantly being reminded that it doesn't have time to waste in finding ways to start growing. Otherwise it will end up in the same place as Dow Jones. As it turns out, there are worse fates than having to deal with Wall Street analysts.
 ''Quality and profitability go hand in hand,'' Katharine Graham used to say. These days, that notion is precisely what's in question -- and what is so scary to so many in the newspaper business. If Sam Zell can use an ESOP to prove her right, God bless him. But until then, I'm not jumping on the ESOP bandwagon.

HEADLINE: Detroit Would Like Higher Numbers but Not This One

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

 BODY:
YAHOO looked to new leadership in its battle against Google. It was a bad week for automakers. Home Depot downsized by a unit, and Wal-Mart introduced products and services for the unbanked.
 YAHOO UPHEAVAL What's next for Yahoo? Terry S. Semel resigned Monday as Yahoo's chief executive, amid growing shareholder dissatisfaction over the company's poor performance and Mr. Semel's high pay. Perhaps more than anything, Mr. Semel became a victim of Google, whose technology prowess and startling success over the last few years left Yahoo a very distant second in the Internet's hottest business: search advertising. 
 The job of restoring the company's fortunes now falls on a co-founder, Jerry Yang, who was appointed chief executive, and the longtime chief financial officer, Susan L. Decker, who was promoted to president, the No. 2 post. The two have vowed not to change course, but rather to do a better job of executing Yahoo's current strategy, which they helped shape. 
 They will have to deliver results -- and quickly -- to skeptics in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, who believe that Yahoo needs more drastic changes.

 HOME DEPOT STREAMLINES Home Depot said Tuesday that it would sell its Home Depot Supply unit to a three private equity firms for $10.3 billion, cutting off one of the last vestiges of its controversial former chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli.
 The three buyers -- Bain Capital, the Carlyle Group and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice -- will acquire a supplier of materials like cement and pipes for professional builders that has generated 13 percent of the retailer's sales and 8 percent of its operating profit.
 But the unit never fit in alongside the faucets and light bulbs that are Home Depot's mainstays.
 Struggling to lift its stock price, Home Depot will put proceeds of the sale toward a $22.5 billion share repurchase plan. But the retailer must find other ways to generate growth as it runs out of room to build new stores.

 FUEL ECONOMY PUSH Detroit auto companies spent more than 20 years fighting increases in fuel economy requirements. But this week, that battle ended with a stunning defeat. And the companies face the prospect of yet another setback.
 The Senate approved a sweeping energy bill Thursday night that requires cars and trucks to get a combined average of 35 miles a gallon by 2020, a 40 percent increase from the current standard, which has been in place since the 1980s.
 Now the action moves to the House, where Democrats have vowed to impose an even stricter standard than the Senate bill.
 In normal times, auto companies could count on their old friend Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan to help them thwart an increase. But Mr. Dingell was among Michigan lawmakers who warned executives that it was time to dispense with their past resistance and figure out something with which they could live.

 TOY STORY Parents of Thomas the Tank Engine fans tried to decide whether to throw out those pricey toy trains this week after RC2 issued a warning that lead paint was used in two dozen Thomas & Friends toys sold from January 2005 until this year. 
 RC2, a little-known company based in Oak Brook, Ill., offered to replace the toys if customers mailed them back. By the end of the week, RC2 had still not publicly explained how lead became added to the paint on the wooden toys. RC2 subcontracts its manufacturing to a number of third parties in China, and the Thomas recall has raised questions about the hidden costs of outsourcing to countries like China.
 RC2 also makes toys based on character from other famous shows like ''Dora the Explorer'' and ''Sesame Street.'' Despite concerns about the Thomas toys, RC2 executives attended the annual licensing convention in New York this week, where manufacturers like RC2 met with movie studios, television networks and other media companies each year to sew up licensing deals. HIT Entertainment, the owner of the Thomas & Friends brand, also attended. Yesterday, a law firm based in Seattle, Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against RC2 on behalf of Channing Hesse, a mother in Downers Grove, Ill., who had purchased seven of the recalled Thomas & Friends toys for her toddler sons. RC2 executives were unavailable to comment yesterday on the suit or any other aspect of the recall, a spokeswoman for the company said.
 In the coming months, media companies that own the rights to famous brands and characters might keep a closer watch on where their products are made.
 LOUISE STORY
 DOW JONES TWISTS The story of Dow Jones & Company, owner of The Wall Street Journal, took more plot twists than a cheap thriller, ultimately moving a little closer to a takeover by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
 General Electric and Pearson, the British publisher, seriously explored making a competing bid, before concluding that it would not make sense to match the $5 billion price offered by the News Corporation.
 After weeks of internal debate, the Bancroft family agreed on a proposal to keep Mr. Murdoch from controlling The Journal's content and gave it to the Dow Jones board. Rather than talk directly with the News Corporation as they had planned, the Bancrofts turned matters over to the board, which will conduct the first negotiations on Mr. Murdoch's offer.
 An Internet entrepreneur made a surprise offer for 30 percent of Dow Jones, to keep it out of News Corporation's hands, but company officials and advisers did not take the idea seriously.
 The Dow Jones board must decide whether to tinker with the Bancrofts' proposal, and then it will be up to Mr. Murdoch to say whether he can accept the changes.

 NONBANK BANK On Wednesday, Wal-Mart released plans to introduce a prepaid Visa debit card and quadruple the number of in-store money centers offering check cashing and money order services to at least 1,000. 
 The announcement was the latest sign of the retailer's effort to expand into financial services with products aimed at low-income customers: about 27 million Wal-Mart shoppers who do not have checking accounts or are unlikely to walk into a bank.
 Given Wal-Mart's penchant for squeezing costs out of every business it enters -- from changing oil to dispensing prescription drugs -- the move could threaten the prospects of check-cashing companies and credit unions, as well as big and small banks.
 And there are likely to be more products coming. After it withdrew its application for a special banking license, Wal-Mart executives said that they would begin aggressively rolling out financial products through third parties. The prepaid cards and money center services are ''foundational products'' upon which the retailer would build. 
 ''Our concept is to go up the credit ladder of financial services,'' Jane J. Thompson, the president of Wal-Mart financial services, said in an interview.
 Could Wal-Mart-branded mortgages and home equity loans be next?

HEADLINE: North Korea 'Prepared' to Shut Down Reactor, U.S. Envoy Says

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, June 22 

 BODY:
The chief American nuclear envoy, returning from the first visit to North Korea by a ranking United States official in five years, said here Friday that Pyongyang had assured him it was ready to shut down its main nuclear reactor and would ultimately disable it. 
 In the course of a two-day trip, Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, met with his counterpart, Kim Key-gwan, and Foreign Minister Pak Ui-chun. But he said he did not seek a meeting with Kim Jong-il, the supreme leader.
 The fact that North Korea invited Mr. Hill suggested that it was ready to resume the stalled six-nation talks on ending its nuclear program. By dispatching Mr. Hill to Pyongyang, Washington demonstrated its willingness to treat North Korea as a serious partner in bilateral negotiations, a status it has craved but had often been denied by the Bush administration.
 Under an agreement reached in February, North Korea agreed to shut down its main nuclear reactor at Yongbyon after the return of $25 million in funds that had been frozen after Washington said they came from various economic crimes and trade in missiles and nuclear equipment.
 At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Hill said the North Koreans ''indicated that they are prepared, promptly, to shut down'' the reactor and ''also said they are prepared to disable the Yongbyon facility.''
 Despite the palpable optimism surrounding Mr. Hill's visit, North Korea is still a long way from giving up its full stockpile of nuclear weapons. To date, the government has admitted only that it has produced plutonium for weapons at Yongbyon. But the Bush administration suspects it has purchased equipment for enriching uranium, opening a second pathway to making bombs. North Korea has denied having such technology. 
 ''I am coming away from this two-day set of meetings buoyed by the sense that we are going to be able to achieve our full objectives, that is, the complete denuclearization,'' Mr. Hill said. ''But we are also burdened by the realization of the fact that we are going to have to spend a great deal of time, a great deal of effort and a lot of work in achieving these.''
 It was unclear how far Mr. Hill went in demanding that North Korea disclose whether it has a second, covert program of enriching uranium. ''We discussed the need to have a complete list of all nuclear weapons programs,'' Mr. Hill said, ''and I would just say that all means all.'' 
 During the last high-level visit of a United States official, in 2002, Mr. Hill's predecessor, James Kelly, confronted the North with evidence that Washington said pointed to a uranium enrichment program.
 In the ensuing confrontation, North Korea expelled United Nations nuclear inspectors, restarted the Yongbyon reactor and produced more plutonium. It conducted its first nuclear test last October.
 In the six-nation talks in February in Beijing, North Korea promised to shut down the Yongbyon reactor by mid-April. To secure that deal, Washington had to agree to the release of the $25 million. Mr. Hill's visit came shortly after the money was released to North Korea, which responded by inviting back the United Nations inspectors, who were expected in North Korea on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: These Tour Guides Know the History Not Found on Plaques

BYLINE: By DAVID K. RANDALL

 BODY:
Jennifer Nugent Duffy stood in the middle of Central Park, clutching a clipboard, and talked about what was no longer there. 
 ''We are standing near Seneca Village, what was once the largest concentration of African-American landowners in New York before the park was built,'' she told a group of about 30 adults on a recent Saturday afternoon. ''But if you look, there is nothing marking Seneca Village at all.'' 
 Ms. Duffy, a graduate student at New York University, is a tour guide for Big Onion Walking Tours. As she had done at several other sites along the way on this tour, she talked about the history of the city that was not always reflected in the historical markers that line its streets and parks. 
 Each summer, thousands of tourists line up for walking tours led by guides who explain the stories behind the city's historical sites. The number of licensed tour guides has increased to roughly 1,500 from about 1,200 four years ago. They must pass a 150-question exam given by the city's Department of Consumer Affairs, but it is their knowledge of the history that is not part of the test that often sets them apart. 
 The Empire State Building, St. Patrick's Cathedral and the Chrysler Building are easy. But far fewer tour guides know where Manhattan's African slave market stood, or the block where ''Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' was written, or where a wall still stands from Washington Park, the Brooklyn Dodgers' home before Ebbets Field. 
 Seth Kamil, who started Big Onion Walking Tours in 1991 while a graduate student at Columbia University, said impressing audiences with knowledge of unmarked history helps keep the company in business. ''I think it's our ability to talk about the things that people can't see evidence of, and at the same time give the historic context so they understand both what happened and why you can't see it,'' he said. 
 In a city founded in the 17th century, unmarked sites abound. Take, for instance, the J. P. Morgan Building on Wall Street, the site of a 1920 explosion that resulted in nearly 40 deaths and about 400 injuries. It was one of the nation's deadliest terrorist attacks until the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people. The J. P. Morgan Building's outer structure still has marks from the blast, but there is no plaque or explanation of what happened there. 
 ''There are things that are unmarked because the city chooses not to remember them,'' Mr. Kamil said, ''and there are things that are marked in different ways that now, in the year 2007, we just don't see anymore because we're looking for something different.''
 A memorial in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn does not list the names of the thousands buried there who died in the Civil War, he said, though volunteers have recently added 1,200 new gravestones for Civil War veterans. 
 Kevin Walsh, who compiled unmarked historical and cultural sites for his book, ''Forgotten New York,'' and writes a blog with the same name, said the interest in hidden history reflects, in part, a growing embrace of preservation in the city. 
 ''New York used to have this reputation that we didn't keep anything; we simply tore it down and built up something new,'' he said. ''There's always been tours that hit the highlights like the Empire State Building, but there are other outlets that take people around to see the innards of the city that are historical in their own right but few people know.''
 Many unmarked historical sites are tied to events that New York may prefer to forget. 
 Alan Singer, a professor of secondary education at Hofstra University, leads an annual walking tour of Lower Manhattan that visits unmarked locations known to have played a part in America's slave trade. Along with a marked burial ground for blacks from the Colonial era, the tour stops at the site of a slave market on Wall Street, a bank that helped finance journeys to Africa, and places where slaves revolted in 1712 and 1741. 
 ''There's a sense of hidden history that comes out in these tours that can make you question some of the economic foundations of our modern society,'' he said. 
 One reason some historical sites are unknown is that placing markers often conflicts with the rights of property owners. Historical markers, unlike street signs, are not something the city is required to install, and it is up to an owner to decide whether to mark a building with a plaque, said Lisi de Bourbon, a spokeswoman for the Landmarks Preservation Commission. 
 To tour guides, a marker, or the absence of one, often serves as a starting point for discussion. ''I personally wouldn't want all of those places to have a plaque on them because the plaques often reduce history down to a name and person and doesn't tell the whole story,'' said James Nevius, a historian and a guide who, with his wife, offers walking tours in Manhattan and Brooklyn. 
 After finishing her tour of Central Park, Ms. Duffy said, ''I think the real appeal of these tours is that you can show people an unmarked site, and it's the feeling of 'we're not supposed to be here.' ''

 CORRECTION:
 An article on June 23 about New York City tour guides who specialize in historical sites that do not carry official markers referred incorrectly to Seneca Village, once the largest concentration of African-American landowners in New York. There is in fact a plaque at Central Park West and 85th Street that commemorates the site, which covered 81st to 89th Streets between Seventh and Eighth Avenues in what is now a section of Central Park; the site is not unmarked.

HEADLINE: Architecture, Taken Apart With Pen And Ink

BYLINE: By JEREMY KAHN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20 

 BODY:
David Macaulay could be called the Mr. Wizard of architectural history. In 23 books over three decades, his arresting pen-and-ink illustrations have explored everything from the construction of ancient pyramids to the subterranean systems that support a modern metropolis. 
 Often marketed to children, these books are equally popular with adults, who appreciate their ability to use a primarily visual language to make history, architecture and engineering clear to laymen.
 The first major retrospective of the 60-year-old Mr. Macaulay's work opens on Saturday at the National Building Museum here: ''David Macaulay: The Art of Drawing Architecture,'' a tour of his work and his methods. Mr. Macaulay assisted with the exhibition and will be present for ''The Big Draw,'' an opening-day event in which visitors may try their own hands at drawing exercises. The show, in fact, encourages this sort of family-friendly viewer participation with sketching stations throughout the gallery.
 Mr. Macaulay was trained as an architect at the Rhode Island School of Design, but never practiced. Instead, after brief stints as an interior designer and high school art teacher, he returned to the college as an illustration instructor, a position he still holds. 
 His first children's book, ''Cathedral,'' detailing the methods used to build Gothic churches, was published in 1973 and established a formula he has returned to many times -- in ''Pyramid'' and ''Castle,'' for example. He examined the construction of a Roman town in ''City'' and the maze of pipes and tunnels under modern cities in ''Underground.'' He is perhaps best known for ''The Way Things Work,'' which reveals the mechanical and electronic innards of everything from radio telescopes to automatic transmissions. 
 Much as Mr. Macaulay's books deconstruct the built world, the retrospective seeks to ''explode and explain'' his creative process, said Kathleen Franz, an assistant professor of history at American University, who served as the exhibition's curator. This is most apparent in the first section, ''Visual Archaeology,'' which tries to reverse-engineer ''Mosque,'' his latest book, published in 2003. 
 ''Mosque,'' which Mr. Macaulay has called his response to the events of 9/11, explores the construction of 16th-century Ottoman mosques. Visitors to the museum watch an edited version of the home video that Mr. Macaulay shot during a research trip to Istanbul, and may page through a reproduction of the sketchbook he kept on the trip. Some of the hundreds of preliminary drawings he made as he chose images for the book are also displayed. (Tellingly, Mr. Macaulay refers to his own creative process as ''linear chaos.'')
 In a world of computer-aided design, he continues to do all his drawings by hand, in pen and ink. For this book he also built and photographed a paper architectural model to capture more effectively various angles of the mosque's interior.
 Mr. Macaulay is known for selecting surprising points of view, and this aspect is highlighted in a section of the show called ''Playing With Perspective.'' Here you find his pioneering ''worm's eye'' depictions of building foundations and city traffic from ''Underground''; his fish-eye view of a medieval hall from ''Castle''; and his pigeon's-eye panoramas of Rome from his fable of love, ''Rome Antics.''
 To reinforce the theme, the curators have blown up some of Mr. Macaulay's sketches and affixed them to the floor, suspended them from the ceiling or transferred them to glass panes, forcing the viewer to engage in the action -- looking down, up or through -- suggested by the illustration's perspective.
 Innovative methods of describing structure and scale are more of Mr. Macaulay's strong points. To illustrate the comparative sizes of the world's great domes, he depicted how five of these architectural wonders -- the Hagia Sophia, St. Peter's Basilica, Les Invalides, the United States Capitol and the Pantheon -- could fit inside a sixth, the Houston Astrodome. 
 In 2003, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Williamsburg Bridge, he wrote an ''Op-Art'' piece for The New York Times, ''Want to a Build a Bridge?,'' that included a scale silhouette of the bridge with instructions for cutting it out and constructing a newsprint model. (An example of the results is on display.)
 Also on view are the sketchbooks that Mr. Macaulay used while planning ''Building Big'' (2000), his look at the engineering feats that make bridges, tunnels, skyscrapers and domes possible. Ms. Franz said her intent had been to demonstrate how Mr. Macaulay uses drawing to pose problems -- both of engineering and of illustration -- and solve them. (''Avoid predictable and dull chronological history of bridge building,'' reads one sketchbook note to self.) 
 The exhibition's final section, dedicated to Mr. Macaulay's more fanciful, satiric and political work from the late 1970s and early 1980s, may be the least familiar to visitors. Yet, at least for adults, it may prove the most rewarding.
 Mr. Macaulay often draws parallels between his own work and that of the 18th-century Italian draftsman Giovanni Battista Piranesi, popular for his engravings and etchings of romanticized landscapes. He shares Piranesi's fascination with ruins; many of Mr. Macaulay's images in this section of the show focus on remnants of modern structures in some imagined future. 
 Some images he created in 1976 for a series called ''Great Moments in Architecture'' are in the style of Piranesi, and his 1982 ''Veduta della stazione grand central,'' which depicts the post-apocalyptic ruins of Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, makes clear reference to Piranesi's art. 
 There is a playful aspect to some of this work. ''Noseschwanstein'' from 1976 is an image of a grand castle perched on a mountainous proboscis. His 1979 book ''Motel of Mysteries'' is a subtle satire of a field with which Mr. Macaulay has often been linked: archaeology. In it he humorously postulates the destruction of American civilization in a catastrophic avalanche of junk mail. Then, 2,000 years in the future, an archaeologist stumbles across the ruins of a motel and must decipher the function and meaning of the artifacts he finds inside. Unsurprisingly, the archaeologist gets most of it wrong. 
 There is also a haunting quality to some drawings. In ''Unbuilding,'' from 1980, Mr. Macaulay imagines the dismantling of the Empire State Building by a fictional Saudi prince who has purchased the structure to have it rebuilt in his kingdom's oil fields. The book's plot reflects the era's anxieties about energy independence, economic decline and famous landmarks' falling under foreign ownership. 
 But the images of a symbolic building slowly stripped down to I-beams will resonate with viewers today as it recalls photographs of the World Trade Center's steel exoskeleton poking above the wreckage of ground zero.
 ''David Macaulay: The Art of Drawing Architecture'' opens today and continues through Jan. 21 at the National Building Museum, 401 F Street NW, Washington; (202) 272-2448 or nbm.org.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 4, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in The Arts on June 23 about ''David Macaulay: The Art of Drawing Architecture,'' an exhibition at the National Building Museum in Washington, misstated the nature of the show and attributed an erroneous distinction to it. The exhibition is a survey of Mr. Macaulay's drawing process, and is therefore not the first major retrospective of his work. (The first major retrospective opened in 2004 at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., and is currently at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers.)

HEADLINE: A Taste of Detroit On Capitol Hill

BYLINE: By Micheline Maynard

 BODY:
The halls of Congress have been looking like the floor of the Detroit auto show in recent days. All manner of Detroit executives have found their way to Washington to lobby lawmakers on efforts to raise automobile fuel economy standards. 
During the last two weeks, the crew has included Mark LeNeve, vice president for vehicle sales at General Motors, as well as Troy A. Clarke, the company's North American president. His counterpart at Ford, Mark Fields, also flew to Washington last week, while Thomas W. LaSorda, the president of the Chrysler Group, did his own share of arm-twisting.
 The place they all probably wanted to be, however, was a lunch last Tuesday sponsored by the Michigan Business Group, which represents companies, universities and law firms with ties to the state. Guests included 12 members of the Detroit Tigers and their manager, Jim Leyland. The Tigers certainly found Washington to their liking: they swept a three-game series with the Washington Nationals.

HEADLINE: Worries That Nature Performed Kansas Town's Coup de Grace

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
GREENSBURG, Kan.
 It is morning in Greensburg, population uncertain. The sun rises from the flat-line horizon to cast light upon the tidy curbside piles of debris that had been homes, the untidy piles of brick that had been downtown, the denuded trees that now look like pale hands reaching skyward.
 In the context of Kansas, the violent thunderstorm that had rolled through overnight was no more than a street-cleaning; a cosmic throat-clearing, really. Now, on the last day of spring and seven weeks after the tornado, another morning has come to say it was not a dream, your entire town really is gone. 
 Yes, a tornado nearly two miles wide really did mow through here one night last month. It really did kill 10 of the 1,450 residents. It really did destroy just about every house, business and church, as though determined to erase Greensburg, home of the World's Largest Hand-Dug Well, from memory. And yes, all this in about the time it takes for a cup of coffee to cool.
 The adrenaline rush that immediately followed the disaster, the gumption that temporarily displaced the grief, has slowed with the passing time and the rising heat. The extraordinary has become mundane, so much so that the incessant broadcasts of disaster updates -- 1610 on your AM dial -- serve as a kind of Muzak of catastrophe.
 Residents have until July 15 to retrieve their pets at the former Countryside Vet Clinic ... FEMA is hiring for local positions ... Kansas All Hazards Behavioral Health is offering crisis counseling ... Leave room for emergency and military vehicles when parking ...
 In Davis Park, where 205-mile-an-hour winds left the ball field's scoreboard bowing as if in deference, young AmeriCorps volunteers mill about their encampment. As they clean out the destroyed homes -- saving photo albums and tossing moldy clothes with clinical detachment -- they hear the doubts that residents harbor about Greensburg's future.
 Sabrina Hilton, 24, a suntanned and mosquito-bitten AmeriCorps volunteer from St. Louis, says that many people just want their homes '' 'dozed'' so that they can move on. ''A lot of older residents don't see the value in building again,'' she says. ''They can't fathom putting the energy into it.'' 
 At park's edge, under a red and white tent left over from a religious Mother's Day service more than a month ago, people from all walks sign up to volunteer their services. An AmeriCorps volunteer assigns them to lots that need clearing and offers them gloves and rakes.
 Here comes Daniel Miller, 65, a straw-hatted carpenter from Arkansas who has been here a month. His team of Mennonite volunteers is nearly finished clearing a lot on West Florida Avenue and is looking for its next assignment. He say he tries not to focus on the ruined family belongings at his feet; if he did, he could not work.
 And here come two white-haired bikers from New Mexico, both 64, who call themselves Totem-Jane and Ladders. Rolling past the destruction along Kansas Avenue, they had decided there was no choice but to stop, accept two rakes and spend a few hours on a lot on South Bay Street.
 ''We thought they could use a little help,'' Totem-Jane says.
 It is afternoon in Greensburg, and the sun is high and hot. Jon Clark, 58, catches his breath in front of what had been his printing shop on Main Street. The night of the tornado, Mr. Clark, a Vietnam War veteran, and his father, Harold, a World War II veteran, hunkered down in the basement of their home, waiting for this battle of nature to subside.
 When some semblance of calm came, the son poked his head out.
 The father asked: Is the house gone?
 The son answered: Dad, I think everything is gone. Including the house.
 Jon Clark, weathered, lanky, points out what was where. This hole in the ground was Hunter Drug Store; you should have seen its classic soda fountain. This pile was the county museum, where the town's relics were kept. And this collapsed building here was the Twilight Theatre, with its uncomfortable chairs and fabulous tin ceiling.
 ''This is the lobby here,'' he says, standing in daylight, a few feet from the concession stand's marquee. Pop, $1.50. Beef jerky, 75 cents.
 Mr. Clark says he struggles with the knowledge that Greensburg, 110 miles west of Wichita, was in steady, aging decline, and that many of those displaced by the tornado are not coming back. ''It's a real thorny issue,'' he says. ''Was this storm a mercy killing?''
 True, some government officials see a rare opportunity to build a town anew -- to transform Greensburg into an environmental, economic model of modern rural life, a place that attracts rather than loses young people. Visions of a new, different downtown are already being considered.
 But Mr. Clark says that as debris piles are carted away and the town is wiped clean of virtually all but its roads, his ache of loss intensifies. ''At least I could recognize the rubble,'' he says.
 It is evening in Greensburg, and the little left standing casts long shadows. The volunteers return their rakes and the claws of demolition take their last few swipes, while strong breezes from the south blow through the deserted streets to create phantom movement.
 A twirl of dust rises from rubble on Florida Avenue. An electric fan spins at curbside on Walnut. And at a broken, abandoned house on Lincoln, a screen door slams shut.

HEADLINE: A Diplomat Reflects on Taiwan's Isolation

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

 BODY:
Taiwan's small circle of international supporters -- countries that have diplomatic relations with the 23 million inhabitants of the island known as the Republic of China instead of the 1.3 billion of the People's Republic across the Taiwan Strait -- got a little bit tighter earlier this month when Costa Rica announced that it was switching its allegiance to China.
 The move by Costa Rica, a Central American nation with four million people, was the eighth defection from Taiwan's side since 2000, following in the small footsteps of Chad, Senegal, Grenada, Vanuatu, Dominica, Liberia and Macedonia. Roughly 170 countries recognize China, while Taiwan retains just 24. The battle has not been entirely one-sided. This year, St. Lucia, a Caribbean island nation, made the switch from China to Taiwan. 
 For Andrew Hsia, Taiwan's departing consul general and its shadow ambassador to the United Nations, Costa Rica's decision was an unfortunate capstone on his six-and-a-half-year tenure in New York, particularly in light of his friendship with the Costa Rican ambassador, Jorge Urbina. ''He called me and said that he will always remain a personal friend,'' said Mr. Hsia, a diplomat for 25 years.
 Mr. Urbina said he was sad to learn that Mr. Hsia would be leaving for New Delhi, where he will be the Taiwanese liaison in India, but his government's decision to recognize China was a practical one. ''It's one-fifth of humanity,'' Mr. Urbina said, referring to mainland China. ''It's just a matter of common sense.''
 The shift reflects China's growing economic reach, said Douglas Paal, the former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, effectively the unofficial United States ambassador there from 2002 to 2006. ''Countries that used to be remote from China now are trading partners,'' he said. 
 Taiwan has worked diligently but also in vain to regain membership. China took its seat in 1971. China's staunch opposition and influential Security Council veto cuts off any avenue of entry. Far from slowly gaining ground and legitimacy, Taiwan's government has had to watch China grow stronger and more assertive on the world stage, while its own power dwindled by comparison.
 The fight has been less about political pressures than financial incentives, a practice sometimes called pocketbook diplomacy. Taiwan once had far more money to lavish on development aid. China's recent pledges of aid have garnered a great deal of attention. ''The democratization of Taiwan made the executive and the Foreign Ministry more accountable to the legislature,'' said Richard Bush, an Asia expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ''China's Foreign Ministry doesn't have to be accountable to any legislature,'' allowing it to spend more freely on a diplomatic chess match.
 Officials at the mission say they will again push for admission to the United Nations in September. Last week Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, said he would hold a referendum in 2008 on whether to apply for United Nations membership under the name ''Taiwan.'' Until the switch in 1971, Taiwan held the seat for all of China. A United States State Department spokesman warned against such a referendum, saying it could increase tensions with China.
 Mr. Hsia will not be around for that fight. He leaves for India this week. His successor, Kenneth Liao, began work on Friday. Mr. Liao was previously consul general for Taiwan in Houston.
 When Mr. Hsia took the test to join the foreign service, he said the examiners asked him why he was not going to a law firm or a shipping company where he could make a lot more money for less work.
 ''I said, 'Simply because it is difficult, it's more challenging,' '' he recalled. After a pause, he added, ''I was young,'' then began to laugh.
 In New York, his job was particularly difficult: To represent Taiwan before an organization that does not recognize it as a country and does not even allow him on the premises, except as a guest. But he manages to remain philosophical about it. ''We are a very pragmatic people,'' Mr. Hsia said. ''To us, survival is the most important thing.''

HEADLINE: THE WEEK AHEAD

BYLINE: By Jesse Green

 BODY:
Contemporary playwrights seldom aim middlebrow, but theaters still need lighter works to balance out their seasons. Hence the recent ransacking of the Broadway attic in search of retro-chic warm-weather wear. The Roundabout, which had a hit two Junes ago with ''The Constant Wife,'' is clearly hoping for another with John van Druten's ''OLD ACQUAINTANCE,'' in which two writers, friends since childhood, find themselves competing over a husband, a daughter and literary success. Though it has not been revived on Broadway since its premiere in 1940, when Jane Cowl played the ''serious'' Village novelist and Peggy Wood the matronly purveyor of trash, it became an echt ''women's picture'' in 1943, with Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins, and was remade in 1981 as the ecch ''Rich and Famous,'' with Jacqueline Bisset and Candice Bergen. Now the hysterics and bons mots are in the capable hands of Margaret Colin and Harriet Harris. Let the (beautifully dressed) catfight begin! In previews, opens Thursday, American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org; $51.25 to $86.25. 
THEATER
 Bohemian or Brahmin, the characters in ''Old Acquaintance'' have maids. Not those in ''MORNING STAR,'' which also opened on Broadway in 1940, starring Molly Picon in her first English role and featuring a 15-year-old Sidney Lumet as Hymie the bar mitzvah boy. The play, a semiautobiographical weepie by Sylvia Regan -- the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire figures in the plot -- follows several decades of domestic and economic tsouris in the Lower East Side household of a Russian Jewish matriarch. (Imagine ''Awake and Sing!'' as a daytime serial.) Popular all over the world but seldom revived in New York, it's a natural for the Peccadillo Theater Company and its artistic director, Dan Wackerman, whose recent work (''Room Service,'' ''Counsellor-at-Law'') makes an excellent case for preserved chestnuts. Previews start Thursday, opens July 2, Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com; $20.

HEADLINE: In a World on the Move, a Tiny Land Strains to Cope

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

DATELINE: MINDELO, Cape Verde 

 BODY:
Virtually every aspect of global migration can be seen in this tiny West African nation, where the number of people who have left approaches the number who remain and almost everyone has a close relative in Europe or America.
 Migrant money buoys the economy. Migrant votes sway politics. Migrant departures split parents from children, and the most famous song by the most famous Cape Verdean venerates the national emotion, ''Sodade,'' or longing. Lofty talk of opportunity abroad mixes at cafe tables here with accounts of false documents and sham marriages.
 The intensity of the national experience makes this barren archipelago the Galapagos of migration, a microcosm of the forces straining American politics and remaking societies across the globe.
 An estimated 200 million people live outside the country of their birth, and they help support a swath of the developing world as big if not bigger. Migrants sent home about $300 billion last year -- nearly three times the world's foreign aid budgets combined. Those sums are building houses, educating children and seeding small businesses, and they have made migration central to discussions about how to help the global poor. A leading academic text calls this the ''Age of Migration.'' 
 But it is also the age of migration alarm, as European ships patrol African coasts to intercept human smugglers and new fences are planned along the Rio Grande. Countries that want migrant muscle and brains also want more border control. Many of them see illegal migrants as a security threat, especially in a terrorist age, and worry that large-scale migration, even when legal, can undercut wages, require costly services and subject national identities to bonfires of religious and cultural conflict.
 The stakes can be seen here in Mindelo, a semicircle of barren hillsides that gaze out at the only sign of natural life, a beckoning sea. In a country with little rain and a history of famine, migration began as a necessity and became part of the civic DNA. You can dine at Cafe Portugal, drink at the Argentina bar and stroll Avenida da Holanda.
 Yet Holland -- the Netherlands -- now requires would-be migrants to pass a test on Dutch language and culture. Other countries have raised the cost of visa applications, discouraged applicants by requiring them to travel to the Cape Verdean capital, Praia, and placed new penalties on employers who hire illegal immigrants. While the Netherlands has long been a favorite destination for residents of this island, a Cape Verdean song now warns that ''Holland belongs to the Dutch.''
 Watch out
 Because they can make you go back swimming
 And you'll get home with seaweed in your teeth
 Mindelo, Cape Verde's second-largest city, contains 63,000 people and about as many variations on the migrant's tale. On the hillside neighborhood of Monte Sessego, Maria Cruz, 70, beams at the living room suite her son sent from Rotterdam. Out toward the airport, Stenio da Luz dos Reis, 17, studies Dutch and hopes to join his mother in the Netherlands. Down by the beach, Orlando Cruz, 46, stares at vacant tables. He fell off a ladder in New Jersey and used the insurance money to start a hotel and restaurant, which are now nearly empty.
 As construction racket fills her half-finished house, Evanilda Lopes, 27, speaks freely about the fraudulent papers that got her to the Netherlands. As he hustles change for his H.I.V. medication, Manuel Gomes, 41, is equally frank about the crimes that got him deported from Providence, R.I. He moved there as a child and grew up wild -- selling drugs, stealing cars and burglarizing homes. Now like hundreds of others deported here from the United States, he finds himself a man without a country, exiled to a world no less foreign for having been the place of his birth. 
 ''You have a Cape Verdean here who would cut his right arm off to go back,'' said Mr. Gomes, who lives in a one-room hovel without running water or electricity.
 If Cape Verde is the Galapagos of migration, Jorgen Carling, a Norwegian geographer, is its Darwin. A rising star on the academic circuit, Dr. Carling, 32, visited Cape Verde 10 years ago, taught himself Kriole, the local language, and has been returning ever since.
 ''Cape Verde is a showcase of the contradictions and frictions of global migration,'' he said. ''It is in a quite dramatic transition -- from being so dependent on migration to trying to cope with a world in which borders are closing.''
 The tensions he cites abound. Migration reduces poverty. But it increases inequality between migrants and others back home. Migration can express family devotion. It can also strain family bonds.
 And while migration may be at record levels, so is the frustration of people who want to migrate but cannot. That is because as migration grows, the desire to experience its economic rewards grows even faster.
 ''Migration is probably more important to more people than it has ever been,'' said Dr. Carling of the International Peace Research Institute, a nonprofit group in Oslo. ''But what characterizes the world today is also the feeling of involuntary immobility.''
 These conflicts can be seen in a block home on a dusty hill where migration unites and divides four generations. At 79, the owner, Antonia Delgado, is old enough to remember famines, and she spent decades living in a shanty made of used oil drums. Thanks to the money her son sent from the Netherlands, she has four rooms, electric lights and indoor plumbing. 
 But she no longer has the son. He stopped calling more than five years ago, and she is not sure if he is alive. ''I'm very worried,'' she said. ''He helped me so much.''
 Now she relies on money sent by a second family migrant, her granddaughter Fatima, a nanny in Portugal. That brings Ms. Delgado monthly support of $135, but leaves her raising her granddaughter's son, an 11-year-old with a missing front tooth and irrepressible smile.
 The boy, Steven Ramos, is sorting through parallel complexities. His mother's salary buys school supplies, martial arts lessons and the occasional DVD. But she left five years ago and has come home only once. His father works in the Netherlands and rarely calls. Steven called him ''ingrote'' -- for ungrateful -- choosing a Cape Verdean term for migrants who forget those left behind.
 Though Steven's mother now has a work permit, she cannot get a visa for Steven, who has spent his childhood thinking their reunion was imminent. He cried when her recent visit ended but cast her departure in traditional Cape Verdeans terms, as something natural, necessary and good. ''I cried, but I wasn't sad because I knew she needed to go,'' he said. '' She went to give us better conditions.''
 An Identity Linked to Migration
 Without migration, Cape Verde would not exist. The 10-island chain, 385 miles off the coast of Senegal, was uninhabited until the 15th century, when Portugal settled it with two migrant streams -- Europeans and African slaves. Cape Verde became a creolized mix of both continents and a supply depot for the slave trade.
 Mass emigration began in the late 1800s on whaling ships that brought Cape Verdeans to New England. It continued after World War II with European guest-worker plans, which sought temporary labor but brought permanent settlement.
 Those same plans brought Turks to Germany, South Asians to Britain and North Africans to France, and a generation later, many Europeans remain concerned about continuing cultural conflicts. ''We asked for workers, but we got people,'' is a famous European lament.
 Cape Verde gained independence from Portugal in 1975, about the time the guest-worker plans ended. Still, Cape Verdean migration continued -- legally (through family reunification laws) and illegally (through visitors who stay after visas expire). Many people here travel on tourist visas, then seek a European or American citizen to marry, often of Cape Verdean ancestry. 
 Migration is so central to their identity, Cape Verdeans often boast that emigrants outnumber the people who remain. That is true, Dr. Carling said, only when counting emigrants and their descendants. By that standard, he estimates there are 460,000 Cape Verdeans on the islands and 500,000 overseas, including 265,000 in the United States. ''Sodade,'' the hit by Cesaria Evora, a Mindelo resident and a Grammy award winner, conveys ''longing, longing, longing for my island.''
 Some scholars argue that migrants form a record share of the world's population, though weak data make historical comparisons difficult. Despite current alarm, migration is likely to grow. Rich economies with aging work forces need labor. Workers in poor countries need jobs. Border crossings are hard to prevent, and the rewards of moving have never been greater. The average pay raise awaiting today's unskilled migrants, in inflation-adjusted terms, is about twice as high as that which greeted migrants a century ago, during the last great period of global migration.
 Economists generally argue that migration has helped rich economies expand by supplying needed labor, though some low-skilled domestic workers may suffer wage reductions because of increased competition. 
 From the start, Cape Verde has embraced its emigrants -- as kinsmen, investors, lobbyists for foreign aid, safety valves for population growth and eventually as voters. With migrant help, Cape Verde has doubled its per capita income since 1990, to about $2,100, a high figure by African standards. Remittances, the sums that migrants send home, make up 12 percent of the gross domestic product and once were twice as high. Migrants elect their own representatives to the National Assembly. 
 More broadly, however, development experts are split on the effects of migration. Remittances feed and shelter the poor, and migrants sometimes return with new business contacts and ideas. But migration can also drain countries of talent and promote dependency, among individuals and governments. No country has climbed out of poverty through migration alone. Despite the economic progress here, the unemployment rate hovers above 20 percent and the fastest-growing industry, tourism, is dominated by low-wage jobs.
 While Dr. Carling admires Cape Verde's ability to invent itself as a nation beyond borders, he also sees problems with the constant emphasis on departures. It can weaken relationships, he said, leave marriages short-lived and promote indifference among students and workers. ''The possibility of relying on remittances -- and the prospect of going abroad one day -- can alienate you from the environment here,'' he said.
 Even as Cape Verdeans struggle to get out, others are migrating in. This, too, is characteristic of the age of migration -- most ''sending'' countries are also ''receiving'' countries, underscoring how universal the phenomenon is. Nearly half the migrants from poor nations move to other poor nations.
 Mindelo, on the island of Sao Vicente, is filled with Chinese shopkeepers chasing new markets and West African peddlers fleeing homelands torn by war and worse poverty. Many hope to move on to the Canary Islands, which are part of Spain, aboard dangerous smuggling boats on journeys that kill hundreds if not thousands every year. 
 ''This is life and death,'' said Emmanuel Kofi Cathline, a local peddler who migrated from Ghana 17 years ago and once made money here helping migrants book the illegal journeys. Though crackdowns have chased him from the business, he remains loyal to what might be called the global migrants' creed. ''If a place is no good, change it,'' he said. ''Go to another place!''
 A Test of Optimism
 For all the rising barriers, many Cape Verdeans remain confident they will leave. Mr. da Luz dos Reis, the teenager studying Dutch, answered the door in a blaze of sartorial optimism: orange shorts and orange shirt -- can you guess the Dutch national color? -- with the word ''Holland'' stretched across his back. 
 His mother left for the Netherlands six years ago to work as a maid, and his younger sisters just joined her. Having passed his 16th birthday, Mr. da Luz dos Reis was left behind, with a workbook containing 100 questions in Dutch. 
 Thirty will appear on a test. No. 62 asks if it is important to learn Dutch quickly. (It is.) No. 59 asks if wife beating is permissible. (It is not.) Mr. da Luz dos Reis pays $70 a month for a tutor and must take the test in Dakar, two hours away by plane. But he is not one to gripe. 
 ''It's good,'' he said of the test. ''Then we get there with an idea of what it's like.'' Besides, he added, ''it's their country.''
 Across town, Evanilda Lopes, 27, has more experience and less optimism. A stylish woman with rhinestones on her Coco T-shirt and blond extensions in her hair, she was raised on reports of fashion and comfort from six older siblings in Europe. She left school at 17 and spent five years seeking a tourist visa, which arrived only after she had created a fictitious bank account and job. ''It was the way I could go,'' she said.
 Things soured in the Netherlands. Her aunt lined up three Dutch men for her to marry, but Ms. Lopes rejected them all. The atmosphere in the house grew hostile. Ms. Lopes moved in with a Dutch plumber, and they had a child they named Giovanni. Cohabitors in the Netherlands have residency rights, but when the relationship expired so did her permission to stay. 
 She came home last fall with a cache of the luxury goods she had gone to Europe to find -- belts, handbags, sandals, perfume. She sold them on the streets and made enough money to start building a home for her and Giovanni, 5, who has just come home to a country he does not know.
 Ms. Lopes alternately calls her time in the Netherlands a blessing and a curse. ''I was young and I didn't know life was so hard,'' she said. With a half-finished house and half-formed plans, she has her shoes on one shore, her mind on another and her innocence lost somewhere in between.

HEADLINE: A Rocky Start For British REITs

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
AFTER much fanfare, legislation creating real estate investment trusts in Britain, one of Europe's biggest property markets, took effect on Jan. 1. Almost immediately, nine of the country's largest real estate companies converted to REITs, while five others made the switch soon after and a handful more plan to follow suit by year-end. 
 In the months leading up to the big debut, expectations ran high, with the hope that Britain's already-strong commercial real estate industry would further flourish. A REIT market, after all, could attract more investors globally and make it easier for the local companies to raise capital. (The corporate structure gives real estate investment trusts favorable tax treatment in exchange for disbursing most of their income to shareholders as dividends.)
 But all of that enthusiasm has since turned into disappointment. British REITs are among the worst-performing real estate investments so far this year, according to industry analysts, with sinking share prices and dividends that are comparatively lower than those of their global peers. 
 ''Here's a U.K. REIT that says, 'Buy me, I yield 2.5 percent,' '' said Jeremy M. Anagnos, the co-chief investment officer of CB Richard Ellis Global Real Estate Securities. ''But here you have a very astute property investment base, and they know what they could get elsewhere.'' 
 The average dividend yield on REITs worldwide, in fact, is roughly 4 percent, versus around 2.5 percent for British REITs, according to Mr. Anagnos. In the United States, the dividend yield is around 4.3 percent, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. 
 Although some money managers are steering clear of the nascent British market for now, others say they are finding value in some of its shares. Many REITs now trade on the London Stock Exchange at deep discounts -- from 5 to nearly 15 percent below net asset value, according to Eric N. Roseman, the president of ENR Asset Management in Montreal -- perhaps making some of them ripe for takeovers. By contrast, most REITs globally tend to trade at a premium relative to the value of the properties they own, Mr. Roseman said.
 During a visit to New York City early this month for REIT Week, an annual conference sponsored by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Liz Peace, the chief executive of the British Property Federation, urged investors in the United States and elsewhere to be patient. 
 ''The message,'' she said, ''is this: Don't write off the British market; we've only been around for a few months.'' 
 In recent years, Britain's overall commercial real estate market has had a solid track record, with shares of real estate companies returning 33 percent, annualized, in the three years through 2006, and 48 percent last year alone, according to Ms. Peace, who attended the conference with a contingent of British REIT executives. 
 The president and chief executive of the American REIT association, Steven A. Wechsler, said that ''to a large extent the market there had already factored in the conversion to REITs,'' and he offered his own support. ''I don't think there is anything particularly important in terms of what happens in the first few months,'' he said. ''REITs are a long-term investment.''
 Some managers of mutual funds -- through which average investors in the United States can gain exposure to global property markets -- say they think that it may take a while for Britain's REIT market to gain its bearing, as it has for recently established REIT markets elsewhere. 
 ''A few years ago, they never even heard of the 'REIT' term,'' Mr. Anagnos said. Now, more than two dozen countries worldwide have public REIT markets or legislation in place or under consideration to create them.
 ''France has had four modifications of the REIT model in the last five or seven years,'' said Samuel A. Lieber, the manager of the Alpine International Real Estate Equity fund, which has 11 percent of its holdings in British property companies. 
 In Britain, Mr. Lieber said, ''it will take five years or more for companies to rebalance and orient themselves toward cash-flow generation as opposed to net asset value growth.'' 
 It is that focus on asset growth, he and others have said, that is partly responsible for the low dividends. ''British companies historically have not been focused on cash flow,'' Mr. Lieber said. ''REITs in general are excellent distributors of real estate cash flow.''
 The British market has also been adversely affected by higher interest rates, Mr. Roseman said. He noted that last month, the Bank of England again raised its base rate, to 5.5 percent, to help keep inflation in check. ''You don't want to buy anything that's interest-rate sensitive,'' he said.
 But Mr. Roseman said, ''there probably are some cherry-picking opportunities'' amid the British correction, and others agreed.
 Even though REIT share prices are down around 14 percent, on average, from the beginning of the year through the middle of last week, ''the underlying real estate fundamentals are very solid,'' said Scott Crowe, the global strategist and a manager of Cohen & Steers' global and international real estate portfolios, which have about 20 percent of their holdings in British properties. 
 At Brixton, a British REIT specializing in industrial and warehouse space, ''the demand is strong,'' said Tim Wheeler, its chief executive, who attended the REIT convention in New York. He notes that 30 percent of his country's tenants are American companies.
 Also at the convention was Harry Hyman, the managing director of the Primary Health Properties, another British REIT. ''We've seen a massive rental growth in London,'' he said. ''I don't have any vacancies in my portfolios.'' 
 Mr. Anagnos agreed that the British commercial market was essentially healthy, with rental growth and higher occupancy rates, though he expressed concern about the impact that new developments might have, particularly in London. ''There is a supply pipeline looming on the market,'' he said, with big developments due for completion by 2010. 
 Many money managers are bullish about the office markets in the West End of London, where, they say, space is especially limited. 
 Mr. Wheeler says that this is one area where Brixton has focused, and that new developments from his company are expected to come on line within the next 18 months. 
 Among the other companies with exposure to the West End of London, according to Mr. Anagnos, are Great Portland Estates and the Land Securities Group, both REITs, and Derwent London, which is expected to convert to REIT status this summer.
 ''We really like that company,'' Mr. Crowe said of Derwent. ''It's trading at a 20 percent discount.''
 American investors, who can also buy shares of individual British REITs directly through their brokers, can learn more about the companies at the Web sites of the British Property Federation (www.bpf.org.uk/) and of the London-based organization Reita (www.reita.org).
 Most of the interest so far has come from large institutional investors, though that could gradually change as the market becomes more established.
 ''What's most appealing is that this is a specialization, a niche,'' Mr. Wheeler said. ''You don't have to go to Europe or America to grow the business.''

HEADLINE: When the Diploma Is Just a Dream

BYLINE: By EMILY BRADY

 BODY:
WHEN he lets his mind drift, Jaime Carrera dreams not of his future but his past.
 In a perfect world, Jaime, who is 18, would be graduating from high school this month, along with 41,000 seniors from around the city, and maybe anticipating one last carefree summer before heading off to college.
 Instead, he will be spending months or maybe years in a ramshackle workshop in the West Farms section of the Bronx. There, six days a week, along with two of his uncles, Jaime sands, solders and paints metal doors and gates for $360 a week. 
 Jaime, who lives with his elder brother in Parkchester, and whose baby-faced looks and bashful demeanor belie his grown-up job, is not a high school dropout -- simply because he never dropped in. He came to New York alone three years ago from Tehuacan, his valley home in the Mexican state of Puebla, where his mother and three other siblings still live, but education was not on his mind. ''I came here to work,'' he said. 
 Jaime is one of the city's undocumented teenagers, most of them males like himself, who, in the words of Robert Courtney Smith, a sociologist at Baruch College who studies Mexican immigrants in the city, are ''caught between two dreams -- the dream of second-generation upward mobility, and of making money now and being able to live a little better.'' Many of these teenagers, who often immigrate alone and speak little English, are scrubbing dishes in restaurant kitchens and hammering away at construction sites well before reaching 18, the standard age for high school graduation.
 It is virtually impossible to track the numbers of this group, but Richard Fry, a demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center, estimates that of the one million foreign-born Americans 15 to 17 who were counted in 2005 by the Census Bureau, about 60,000 interrupted their schooling abroad before migrating and probably never resumed their studies in the United States. Of this group, Mr. Fry said, 69 percent were, like Jaime, from Mexico. 
 On Sundays, his day off, Jaime plays baseball with friends and his uncles at a field in Bedford Park that is big enough to accommodate four games at once. Dominicans play at one end, Mexicans at the other, and women with small children cluster around both groups.
 Stories like Jaime's often bubble up among the players and the crowd. Enrique, a 22-year-old who would not give his last name because of his shaky immigration status, said he started working in construction when he came to live in New York with his three brothers seven years ago. ''I didn't enroll in school then because I didn't know how,'' he explained. ''And I had a lot of expenses.'' 
 Six months into his new job, Enrique fell three stories at a work site, shattering his wrists. He still works in construction, but his wrists ache at the end of the day and he still thinks about school. 
 ''I want to know something else,'' Enrique said. ''A doctor, or maybe a veterinarian.''
 Jaime, who spent his first year in New York washing dishes before going to work with his uncles, has less lofty but nonetheless ambitious goals. He would like to learn English and to program and repair electronic systems in cars. 
 ''It's an immigrant community that has a lot of ganas -- a lot of desire to move ahead,'' Professor Smith said of Mexicans in New York. The trouble, he added, is that the economic, social and community support needed to get ahead has not kept pace with that desire.
 In the opinion of Claire Sylvan, executive director of the Internationals Network for Public Schools, which works with the city's Department of Education to oversee eight schools serving recent immigrants, the challenge is to customize schools by offering night courses and other flexible approaches that will meet these teenagers' needs. 
 ''They've been driven here for economic reasons,'' Dr. Sylvan said. ''It's a hard group to keep in school without giving them the support they'd need.''
 Angelo Cabrera, now 32, was once one of these teenagers. Like Jaime, he came to New York from Puebla when he was 15, and then he worked in the Bronx for three years, in the basement of a supermarket. 
 In retrospect, he is thankful that he held that job, Mr. Cabrera said, because it drove him into school. After earning a G.E.D., he earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Baruch College and founded the Mexican-American Students Alliance, a nonprofit group that helps Mexican-Americans get an education. 
 ''If I tell them anything,'' Mr. Cabrera said, ''it's that education is the best investment they can make, for themselves and their families. It's the opportunity to reach the American dream.''

HEADLINE: Worries That Nature Performed Kansas Town's Coup de Grace

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
GREENSBURG, Kan.
 It is morning in Greensburg, population uncertain. The sun rises from the flat-line horizon to cast light upon the tidy curbside piles of debris that had been homes, the untidy piles of brick that had been downtown, the denuded trees that now look like pale hands reaching skyward.
 In the context of Kansas, the violent thunderstorm that had rolled through overnight was no more than a street-cleaning; a cosmic throat-clearing, really. Now, on the last day of spring and seven weeks after the tornado, another morning has come to say it was not a dream, your entire town really is gone. 
 Yes, a tornado nearly two miles wide really did mow through here one night last month. It really did kill 10 of the 1,450 residents. It really did destroy just about every house, business and church, as though determined to erase Greensburg, home of the World's Largest Hand-Dug Well, from memory. And yes, all this in about the time it takes for a cup of coffee to cool.
 The adrenaline rush that immediately followed the disaster, the gumption that temporarily displaced the grief, has slowed with the passing time and the rising heat. The extraordinary has become mundane, so much so that the incessant broadcasts of disaster updates -- 1610 on your AM dial -- serve as a kind of Muzak of catastrophe.
 Residents have until July 15 to retrieve their pets at the former Countryside Vet Clinic ... FEMA is hiring for local positions ... Kansas All Hazards Behavioral Health is offering crisis counseling ... Leave room for emergency and military vehicles when parking ...
 In Davis Park, where 205-mile-an-hour winds left the ball field's scoreboard bowing as if in deference, young AmeriCorps volunteers mill about their encampment. As they clean out the destroyed homes -- saving photo albums and tossing moldy clothes with clinical detachment -- they hear the doubts that residents harbor about Greensburg's future.
 Sabrina Hilton, 24, a suntanned and mosquito-bitten AmeriCorps volunteer from St. Louis, says that many people just want their homes '' 'dozed'' so that they can move on. ''A lot of older residents don't see the value in building again,'' she says. ''They can't fathom putting the energy into it.'' 
 At park's edge, under a red and white tent left over from a religious Mother's Day service more than a month ago, people from all walks sign up to volunteer their services. An AmeriCorps volunteer assigns them to lots that need clearing and offers them gloves and rakes.
 Here comes Daniel Miller, 65, a straw-hatted carpenter from Arkansas who has been here a month. His team of Mennonite volunteers is nearly finished clearing a lot on West Florida Avenue and is looking for its next assignment. He say he tries not to focus on the ruined family belongings at his feet; if he did, he could not work.
 And here come two white-haired bikers from New Mexico, both 64, who call themselves Totem-Jane and Ladders. Rolling past the destruction along Kansas Avenue, they had decided there was no choice but to stop, accept two rakes and spend a few hours on a lot on South Bay Street.
 ''We thought they could use a little help,'' Totem-Jane says.
 It is afternoon in Greensburg, and the sun is high and hot. Jon Clark, 58, catches his breath in front of what had been his printing shop on Main Street. The night of the tornado, Mr. Clark, a Vietnam War veteran, and his father, Harold, a World War II veteran, hunkered down in the basement of their home, waiting for this battle of nature to subside.
 When some semblance of calm came, the son poked his head out.
 The father asked: Is the house gone?
 The son answered: Dad, I think everything is gone. Including the house.
 Jon Clark, weathered, lanky, points out what was where. This hole in the ground was Hunter Drug Store; you should have seen its classic soda fountain. This pile was the county museum, where the town's relics were kept. And this collapsed building here was the Twilight Theatre, with its uncomfortable chairs and fabulous tin ceiling.
 ''This is the lobby here,'' he says, standing in daylight, a few feet from the concession stand's marquee. Pop, $1.50. Beef jerky, 75 cents.
 Mr. Clark says he struggles with the knowledge that Greensburg, 110 miles west of Wichita, was in steady, aging decline, and that many of those displaced by the tornado are not coming back. ''It's a real thorny issue,'' he says. ''Was this storm a mercy killing?''
 True, some government officials see a rare opportunity to build a town anew -- to transform Greensburg into an environmental, economic model of modern rural life, a place that attracts rather than loses young people. Visions of a new, different downtown are already being considered.
 But Mr. Clark says that as debris piles are carted away and the town is wiped clean of virtually all but its roads, his ache of loss intensifies. ''At least I could recognize the rubble,'' he says.
 It is evening in Greensburg, and the little left standing casts long shadows. The volunteers return their rakes and the claws of demolition take their last few swipes, while strong breezes from the south blow through the deserted streets to create phantom movement.
 A twirl of dust rises from rubble on Florida Avenue. An electric fan spins at curbside on Walnut. And at a broken, abandoned house on Lincoln, a screen door slams shut.

HEADLINE: A Diplomat Reflects on Taiwan's Isolation

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

 BODY:
Taiwan's small circle of international supporters -- countries that have diplomatic relations with the 23 million inhabitants of the island known as the Republic of China instead of the 1.3 billion of the People's Republic across the Taiwan Strait -- got a little bit tighter earlier this month when Costa Rica announced that it was switching its allegiance to China.
 The move by Costa Rica, a Central American nation with four million people, was the eighth defection from Taiwan's side since 2000, following in the small footsteps of Chad, Senegal, Grenada, Vanuatu, Dominica, Liberia and Macedonia. Roughly 170 countries recognize China, while Taiwan retains just 24. The battle has not been entirely one-sided. This year, St. Lucia, a Caribbean island nation, made the switch from China to Taiwan. 
 For Andrew Hsia, Taiwan's departing consul general and its shadow ambassador to the United Nations, Costa Rica's decision was an unfortunate capstone on his six-and-a-half-year tenure in New York, particularly in light of his friendship with the Costa Rican ambassador, Jorge Urbina. ''He called me and said that he will always remain a personal friend,'' said Mr. Hsia, a diplomat for 25 years.
 Mr. Urbina said he was sad to learn that Mr. Hsia would be leaving for New Delhi, where he will be the Taiwanese liaison in India, but his government's decision to recognize China was a practical one. ''It's one-fifth of humanity,'' Mr. Urbina said, referring to mainland China. ''It's just a matter of common sense.''
 The shift reflects China's growing economic reach, said Douglas Paal, the former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, effectively the unofficial United States ambassador there from 2002 to 2006. ''Countries that used to be remote from China now are trading partners,'' he said. 
 Taiwan has worked diligently but also in vain to regain membership. China took its seat in 1971. China's staunch opposition and influential Security Council veto cuts off any avenue of entry. Far from slowly gaining ground and legitimacy, Taiwan's government has had to watch China grow stronger and more assertive on the world stage, while its own power dwindled by comparison.
 The fight has been less about political pressures than financial incentives, a practice sometimes called pocketbook diplomacy. Taiwan once had far more money to lavish on development aid. China's recent pledges of aid have garnered a great deal of attention. ''The democratization of Taiwan made the executive and the Foreign Ministry more accountable to the legislature,'' said Richard Bush, an Asia expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ''China's Foreign Ministry doesn't have to be accountable to any legislature,'' allowing it to spend more freely on a diplomatic chess match.
 Officials at the mission say they will again push for admission to the United Nations in September. Last week Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, said he would hold a referendum in 2008 on whether to apply for United Nations membership under the name ''Taiwan.'' Until the switch in 1971, Taiwan held the seat for all of China. A United States State Department spokesman warned against such a referendum, saying it could increase tensions with China.
 Mr. Hsia will not be around for that fight. He leaves for India this week. His successor, Kenneth Liao, began work on Friday. Mr. Liao was previously consul general for Taiwan in Houston.
 When Mr. Hsia took the test to join the foreign service, he said the examiners asked him why he was not going to a law firm or a shipping company where he could make a lot more money for less work.
 ''I said, 'Simply because it is difficult, it's more challenging,' '' he recalled. After a pause, he added, ''I was young,'' then began to laugh.
 In New York, his job was particularly difficult: To represent Taiwan before an organization that does not recognize it as a country and does not even allow him on the premises, except as a guest. But he manages to remain philosophical about it. ''We are a very pragmatic people,'' Mr. Hsia said. ''To us, survival is the most important thing.''

HEADLINE: In City's Challenges, Police Leader Finds Motivation

BYLINE: By TIM MURPHY

DATELINE: Mount Vernon 

 BODY:
SINCE David E. Chong took over as police commissioner here a little over a year ago, he has had his share of successes.
While the rate of major crimes -- murder, rape, robberies -- rose 17 percent in the year before he took over as commissioner, in May 2006, they fell more than 7 percent in the year since his arrival, Mr. Chong said.
 A 22-year veteran of the New York Police Department, Mr. Chong, 49, received early praise from city leaders for improving morale on a police force that had gone through 10 commissioners in 12 years. He became a familiar presence at community meetings and on the streets, where he often joined his force's bike patrol in a city whose neighborhoods span from the gritty and poor to the leafy and affluent. 
 And he won approval to hire 10 officers, bringing the force to 200, the largest it has ever been.
 ''He leads by example and mixes it up with the community,'' said the city's mayor, Ernest D. Davis.
 But challenges remain. On one night in late April, a 20-year-old man was shot dead in the street. ''It's a big deal, because it's only April and we've got three murders,'' Mr. Chong said the next day in his office. ''My toughest days are when I have to deal with young people dying.'' 
 His week got worse. By that Friday, Mount Vernon, a city of 68,000 that borders the Bronx and grapples with youth- and gang-related crime despite an economic resurgence in the past decade, would record another homicide, a shooting, a stabbing, the beating of a police officer and the evacuation of the high school amid rumors of an imminent revenge shooting. (It did not occur.)
 Yet despite the constant updates from investigators coming over the intercom in his office, Mr. Chong, in a blue gingham shirt, a bright yellow tie and Dockers pants, remained affable. He was surrounded by numerous citations that he had received for bravery during 9/11 rescue efforts at ground zero. Also in his office was an action doll named Detective Chow, which Mr. Chong says a Hong Kong toymaker modeled after him in 1990, when he was an undercover officer investigating Asian gangs in New York.
 Mr. Chong, who was born in Toronto and moved to New York City's Lower East Side when he was 9, rose to the rank of lieutenant commander before retiring in 2002. Stints in academia and as deputy commissioner for public safety in White Plains followed. He still lives in White Plains with his wife, Patricia, a former baker, and their daughter, Katie, 2. 
 But he yearned to return to police work. ''I felt I could really make a difference in this city,'' he said.
 Toward that end, he has initiated a task force to strip young people of guns. He also started programs meant to keep children from turning to crime, like one in which officers return truants to school and notify their parents. ''It sends a message to kids that we're watching them,'' he said. 
 Another program, set to begin soon, will bring police officers together for dinner and games with middle-school boys at risk of becoming involved with gangs and crime. ''It's cultural awareness, for both police officers and kids,'' he said. ''You break down the stranger thing.''
 So far, he is getting positive feedback. ''He has an excellent understanding of what it's like to be a cop,'' said Officer John Jones, a Mount Vernon native and 28-year member of the city's police force.
 Andrew M. Grascia, an investigator with the Westchester County district attorney's office and president of the New York Gang Investigators Association, said Mr. Chong was not afraid to collaborate. ''He'll try anything if it'll help the kids,'' Mr. Grascia said.
 Arthur Muhammad, the minister of Mount Vernon's Nation of Islam chapter, who moderated two community forums after the slayings, said that participants applauded Mr. Chong's declaration that the best way to stop the local drug trade was to stamp out the demand.
 ''He's perceived as very sincere,'' said Mr. Muhammad, adding that he felt the city's majority African-American and West Indian population had no objection to having an Asian-American as police commissioner.
 Mr. Chong appreciated the good reviews. ''I need this job for my moral state,'' he said. Though he is hesitant to talk about it at length, he admits to being haunted by memories of 9/11, and to undergoing counseling. While rescuing people from the World Trade Center's south tower, he became trapped there for a half-hour after it fell. ''It's extremely hurtful for me to revisit that,'' he said. 
 He said he has daily migraines and bouts of asthma, interrupting a phone conversation one morning with a deep, wheezing cough. 
 One topic he will gladly linger on is his daughter. He said he was told that Katie was the first baby from Chongren, China, to be adopted by someone whose name indicated a link to that area. Photos of her beaming face dot his office, and he says he ends his long work days by bathing her and putting her to bed. ''When we brought her back from China, she was so skinny and malnourished,'' he said, ''and now she's a typical American kid.'' 
 It's clear that it is Katie, as much as his new job fighting to lower the crime rate in a challenging city, that motivates him these days.
 ''A veteran officer once told me that if you've saved one life, you've succeeded,'' he said.

HEADLINE: My Time as a Hostage, And I'm a Business Reporter

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
 AS an American journalist based in China, I knew there was a good chance that at some point I'd be detained for pursuing a story. I just never thought I'd be held hostage by a toy factory.
 That's what happened last Monday, when for nine hours I was held, along with a translator and a photographer, by the suppliers of the popular Thomas & Friends toy rail sets.
 ''You've intruded on our property,'' one factory boss shouted at me. ''Tell me, what exactly is the purpose of this visit?'' When I answered that I had come to meet the maker of a toy that had recently been recalled in the United States because it contained lead paint, he suggested I was really a commercial spy intent on stealing the secrets to the factory's toy manufacturing process.
 ''How do I know you're really from The New York Times?'' he said. ''Anyone can fake a name card.'' 
 Thus began our interrogation, which was followed by hours of negotiations, the partial closing of the factory complex and the arrival of several police cars, a handful of helmet-wearing security officers and some government officials, all trying to free an American journalist and his colleagues from a toy factory.
 Factory bosses, I would discover, can overrule the police, and Chinese government officials are not as powerful as you might suspect in a country addicted to foreign investment.
 I shouldn't have been surprised by the reception. The last time I arrived at a factory under suspicion for selling contaminated goods (toothpaste), they quickly locked the gate and ran. A month earlier, I walked into the headquarters of a company that sold tainted pet food to the United States, and the receptionist insisted the owner was not in. When my translator called the owner, we heard his cellphone ring in the adjoining room. I peeked in and saw the boss scamper out the backdoor. 
 For American journalists, there's a tradition of showing up at a crime scene, or visiting a place that has made news. But in China, where press freedoms are weak, such visits can be dangerous.
 Last year, a young man working for a Chinese newspaper was beaten to death after he tried to meet the owners of an illegal coal mine. Local officials later insisted he was trying to extort money.
 My colleagues at The Times have been detained several times. And one of our Chinese research assistants is now serving a three-year prison term for fraud. He originally had been accused of passing state secrets to The Times, a charge this paper has denied.
 But life in China is generally much easier for business reporters like me. Usually, I'm welcomed at factories. State-owned companies often treat me like a visiting dignitary. I'm seated in a kind of royal chair next to the chairman. We drink tea and the chairman makes welcoming remarks while the company's official photographer snaps our picture.
 On the walls of many of the factories I visit are portraits of the powerful: Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao and others whose images signal to anyone visiting that a factory is ''connected'' and has the blessing of the Communist Party.
 But my toy factory visit made me wonder: who really holds the balance of the power in that relationship these days?
 Many experts have told me that one of the most serious problems in China is that the government lacks the power to control the nation's Wild West entrepreneurs, deal makers and connected factory owners.
 Bribery is rampant, and government corruption widespread. Just a few weeks ago, the top food and drug regulator was sentenced to death for taking huge bribes from pharmaceutical companies. But it's not clear that strong messages like that will stop the anarchy.
 ''China effectively has no oversight over anything,'' said Oded Shenkar, a business professor at Ohio State University and author of ''The Chinese Century: The Rising Chinese Economy and Its Impact on the Global Economy, the Balance of Power and Your Job.'' 
 ''People have this idea they are Big Brother and everyone is under watch,'' Mr. Shenkar said. ''But this is not China. In China, local authorities often turn a blind eye to problems because maybe they're invested in it.''
 Indeed, the impotence of local officials was clear to me from my visit to the RC2 Industrial Park in the city of Dongguan, which is thought to be the largest toy manufacturing center in the world.
 The private plant is the main supplier to the RC2 Corporation, an Illinois company. And the Hong Kong or Chinese entrepreneurs who run the facility seemed to hold great sway over the government.
 We had no problem entering the complex or looking around until we met ''Mr. Zhong,'' a rough-looking factory complex supervisor. He scolded us for entering the grounds and taking photographs, and then invited us to a small villa on the campus, a stylish house filled with luxurious rooms, black leather chairs, a giant-screen TV, a huge stock of Cuban cigars, even a massage parlor.
 This would be our prison. (Business correspondents are a more fortunate breed than war reporters.) Mr. Zhong offered an interview and a tour. But he later changed his mind and issued an ultimatum: hand over the pictures or we call the police.
 Confident we had signed in properly with the security guards, who had allowed us onto the campus, we opted for the police. After over an hour, the police failed to show up, and we tried to leave, only to be nearly tackled by the factory's ragtag army of security officers.
 My translator then called the police.
 The scene was farcical. We were locked inside the factory gate, surrounded by 16 security guards and 4 or 5 factory bosses. All trucks trying to bring supplies in or out of the complex were rerouted. Inside, large crowds of factory workers in blue uniforms were gawking. A crowd had also gathered outside the gates.
 The police arrived an hour later, listened to both sides and then stood around. More police officers came. And more police officers stood around. It was clear they had no power to intervene.
 So we called government officials, who suggested other government officials, who offered up more.
 Finally, after hours of waiting, a higher-level government official arrived to settle the dispute.
 He was a friendly man who admitted that he could not release us, that he didn't have the power. We should negotiate, he said. For the next five hours, he shuttled between rooms in the villa trying to negotiate a settlement. There were shouting matches. There were demands that pictures be turned over. 
 After hours of squabbling, Mr. Zhong demanded we write a confession saying we had trespassed. He settled for a few sentences explaining why I had come and that I had not asked his permission to take any pictures.
 The fight between government and factory during our detainment seemed to underscore the dysfunctional relationship the Chinese government has with industry. 
 In the endless back and forth, it was apparent that the government I often imagined as being all powerful and all seeing could be powerless and conflicted when it came to local businessmen and factory owners. 
 When we were released early Tuesday from a local police station, where we were sent to fill out a report, we noticed that while our translator was giving an account of the day to the police, the factory bosses were laughing and dining in another room, making the nexus of power in these parts and in this age ever more clear.

HEADLINE: The Capitol Energy Crisis

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
When you watch a baby being born, after a difficult pregnancy, it is so painful and bloody for the mother it is always hard to tell the truth and say, ''Gosh, that baby is really ugly.'' But that's how I feel about the energy legislation passed (and not passed) by the Senate last week.
 The whole Senate energy effort only reinforced my feelings that we're in a green bubble -- a festival of hot air by the news media, corporate America and presidential candidates about green this and green that, but, when it comes to actually doing something hard to bring about a green revolution at scale -- and if you don't have scale on this you have nothing -- we wimp out. Climate change is not a hoax. The hoax is that we are really doing something about it. 
 No question, it's great news that the Democrat-led Senate finally stood up to the automakers, and to the Michigan senators, and said, ''No more -- no more assisted suicide of the U.S. auto industry by the U.S. Congress. We're passing the first bill since 1975 that mandates an increase in fuel economy.'' If the Senate bill, which now has to go through the House, becomes law, automakers will have to boost the average mileage of new cars and light trucks to 35 miles per gallon by 2020, compared with about 25 miles per gallon today. 
 But before you celebrate, pay attention to some fine print in the Senate bill. If the Transportation Department determines that the fuel economy goal for any given year is not ''cost-effective'' -- that is, too expensive for the car companies to meet -- it can ease the standard. That loophole has to be tightened by the House, which takes up this legislation next week.
 But even this new mileage standard is not exactly world leading. The European Union is today where we want to be in 2020, around 35 miles per gallon, and it is committed to going well over 40 m.p.g. by 2012. Ditto Japan.
 There are other things that make the Senate energy effort ugly. Senate Republicans killed a proposed national renewable electricity mandate that would have required utilities to produce 15 percent of their power from wind, solar, biomass and other clean-energy sources by 2020. Twenty-three states already have such mandates. No matter. Making it national was too much for the Republicans.
 And the Senate, thanks again to the Republicans, also squashed a Democratic proposal to boost taxes on oil and gas companies that would have raised some $32 billion for alternative fuel projects. 
 Despite all the new research on climate change, the Senate didn't even touch the idea of either a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax to limit carbon dioxide emissions. An effort by Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota to legislate a national reporting (''carbon counter'') system to simply measure all sources of greenhouse gas emissions, which would enable a cap-and-trade system to work if we ever passed one, also got killed by Republicans. We can't cap and trade something we can't measure.
 Here is the truth: the core of our energy crisis is in Washington. We have all the technology we need right now to make huge inroads in becoming more energy efficient and energy independent, with drastically lower emissions. We have all the capital we need as well. But because of the unique nature of the energy and climate-change issues -- which require incentives and regulations to build alternatives to dirty, but cheap, fossil fuels -- you need public policy to connect the energy and capital the right way. That is what has been missing.
 ''We have to work to ensure that the House will at least toughen the provisions that the Senate passed,'' said Dan Becker, director of the Sierra Club's Global Warming Program.
 The public wants it. But energy policy gets shaped in the halls of Congress -- where wily lobbyists, legacy industries and politicians greedy for campaign contributions regularly sell out the country's interests for their own. Only when the public really rises up -- as it has finally done against the auto companies -- do we even get moderate change. Don't look to the Bush team to lead the revolution. 
 ''We are the only major country in the world where no one even knows the name of the environment minister -- the head of our Environmental Protection Agency,'' said Representative Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. ''Whoever it is -- and most people don't even know if it is a he or a she -- has been in a six-year witness protection program. Until the Democrats took over, no Bush E.P.A. administrator appeared before the House committee in charge of energy and climate change.''
 Folks, we're home alone. So call your House member -- especially the Republicans. If you don't, some lobbyist will.

HEADLINE: Training for the Twists Of Driving a School Bus

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED. 
E-mail: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
UNTIL recently, Sandra Castillo, 37, a laid-off factory worker, had never driven anything larger than a car. But now she was at the wheel of a 30-foot-long school bus. She made a tight right turn from a wide avenue into a narrow side street in Brooklyn as smoothly as a veteran bus driver.
 At her side, with a dual brake if needed, sat Christopher Kaminski, an instructor in a program that was training her to seek a new vocation as a bus driver. Three other trainees riding in passenger seats on this early June morning would later have their turns at the wheel. 
 Once she is qualified, Ms. Castillo said, she will seek a job with a school bus company, and later with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the public buses in New York City. ''The M.T.A. pays more,'' said Ms. Castillo, a Queens resident who is divorced and has an 11-year-old son. 
 She and the other trainees were enrolled in Red Hook on the Road, a program that helps low-income or unemployed New York City residents become bus or truck drivers. The program began in 1995 to train residents of the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, and was later expanded to residents of the entire city, said Tracy Anderson, director of program development at Brooklyn Workforce Innovations. 
 The group, a nonprofit based in Park Slope, operates the program and other job training efforts at no cost to the trainees. The other programs involve woodworking, installation of telecommunications cables and production assistant work for film and television crews.
 The four-week, full-time driving program includes two weeks in the classroom learning about subjects ranging from map reading and commercial driving regulations to job interview skills and working with supervisors. 
 The other two weeks are on the road, and students are divided into groups of four. Each group has its own instructor and school bus or truck, with the trainees taking turns driving the vehicle throughout Brooklyn and parts of Queens. By the end of the two weeks, each trainee has had 20 hours of driving -- not to mention many more of observing their fellow trainees. 
 The day after road practice ends, the students take the state test for a category of commercial driver's license that permits driving buses and all sizes of trucks except tractor-trailers. The program aims to place graduates who pass the test with companies that operate trucks, school buses, private coaches, charter buses, airport shuttle buses and transit vans for the disabled.
 The companies may provide additional testing and training, said Julio Perez, the driving program's director. Graduates who later seek to move to the M.T.A. are subject to its training and civil-service hiring procedures, he noted. 
 Over the program's 12 years, about 1,200 people have graduated, Ms. Anderson said. Last year, she said, 232 enrolled, 220 graduated, 207 passed the licensing test -- sometimes after two or more tries -- and 195 were placed in jobs with an average initial salary of $13.62 an hour, or nearly $550 for a 40-hour week. 
 More than 90 percent of the graduates who were placed in driving jobs in 2005 are still in such jobs, she said. 
 About half the applicants interviewed for the program are accepted for the 20 or so spots in each of the dozen training cycles offered each year, Mr. Perez said, and over a given year men outnumber women by two to one.
 After Ms. Castillo finished her turn at the wheel, Romualdo Martinez, 54, of Queens, took over. He said he had lost his job when the alarm company where he worked for 29 years closed a manufacturing plant and warehouse on Long Island. 
 Mr. Martinez, who is married and has a young son, said he was nervous only on his first day behind the wheel. ''After that I was very comfortable,'' he said. Now, after some training, he slowed and glided the bus smoothly between concrete barriers close to both sides of the vehicle where construction work had turned a stretch of street into a narrow single lane.
 A third trainee, Marialyn Martinez, 33, of the Bronx (who is not related to Mr. Martinez), said that poor pay was among the reasons she had left her job as an emergency medical technician working for a private ambulance company. The fourth in the group, Luzdary Tintinagoz, 45, of Brooklyn, had given up driving for a car service because of the long hours.
 Both women have young children, and mentioned this as one reason for wanting to become school bus drivers. As Ms. Martinez said: ''The hours will be like my kids' hours at school, so we'll be able to spend more time together.''
 Eligibility requirements for the driving program are available at www.rhor.org and (718) 237-4846.

HEADLINE: Across Region, a Scramble to Find Lifeguards

BYLINE: By NANCY M. BETTER

 BODY:
Wantagh, N.Y.
 THE second Sunday in June dawned chilly and gray, but that did not stop dozens of young men and women from pouring through the gates of Jones Beach at 7 o'clock. Their mission was to swim 100 yards in less than 75 seconds, run 1,200 yards in 6 minutes and rescue a life-size mannequin from the waves in less than 85 seconds. All this in the hope of landing a $12.56-an-hour job as a new lifeguard at one of Long Island's eight state swimming areas. 
 ''We usually hire 500 lifeguards each summer, and we're still short about 70 or 80 people,'' said Eileen Larrabee, a spokeswoman for the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. ''We need to fill the remaining jobs at this test session.'' 
 As the Fourth of July holiday approaches, state parks managers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are scrambling to fully staff public swimming areas. Perennial shortages are widespread, and officials have issued appeals for lifeguards. Gov. M. Jodi Rell of Connecticut recently made a plea for applicants on the state's Web site. ''I strongly encourage our young people to consider spending this summer doing something truly memorable -- protecting and saving lives,'' she wrote.
 Despite the job's glamorous image -- there is a reason ''Baywatch'' ranks as one of the most-watched television shows in the world of all time -- being a lifeguard appears to be losing its luster. ''It doesn't seem to be as popular a profession as it once was,'' said Dwayne Gardner, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, which manages the state's 11 public swimming areas. 
 Mr. Gardner's office teamed up with the American Red Cross and several other agencies last winter to develop a water safety task force that, among other issues, analyzes how to recruit and train more lifeguards. ''We're looking for creative new ways to market the job,'' he said.
 Economics play a key role; although Jones Beach pays starting lifeguards almost $13 an hour, most areas offer less. At Westchester County's seven swimming areas, wages begin at $10.61 an hour. At New Jersey's 14 state swimming areas, lifeguards usually make $8.50 to $10.50 an hour. 
 ''We are losing kids to other summer jobs,'' said Dana Loschiavo, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. ''They can make more money working at food stands on the boardwalk, although I don't understand why they would want to scoop ice cream instead of being a lifeguard.''
 At Island Beach, one of New Jersey's largest state swimming areas, 50 lifeguards have been hired, but finding qualified candidates was not easy, said James Bruce, the area's lifeguard captain. Mr. Bruce, a middle school guidance counselor in Holmdel who has worked as a lifeguard for 29 summers, has witnessed a slow but steady decline in the job's appeal. He attributes this partly to teenagers' spending habits. 
 ''Ipods and cellphones are expensive,'' he said. ''If kids are looking for the highest-paying job, it isn't likely to be lifeguarding.''
 Scott Kieras, the assistant director of the Parks and Recreation Department in Wilton, Conn., said low pay was not the only issue; college students are also opting to take career-boosting internships. To combat this, he is hiring younger siblings of experienced lifeguards, some as young as 16, the minimum age. These staffers do not mind the position's less attractive duties, like emptying garbage cans and pulling weeds. 
 ''If I can hire them early enough, I can keep them for three or four years,'' Mr. Kieras said.
 Training requirements can also prove too rigorous for some. The American Red Cross, which certifies about 200,000 lifeguards annually, recently revamped its waterfront certification process. The course costs $325 and involves 37 hours of class time; in addition to lifesaving skills, it covers first aid and C.P.R. Some candidates flunk before they even take the written test.
 ''I can't tell you how many people don't know how to do rhythmic breathing, which is necessary for the job,'' said Natalie Dos Santos, director of health and safety at the Western Connecticut chapter of the American Red Cross. ''You really have to be able to swim well to be a lifeguard.''
 Ms. Dos Santos also said that the image of being a lifeguard was at odds with the reality. ''This is not about sitting in the sun and having fun,'' she said. 
 The most challenging part: dealing with difficult patrons.
 ''I lifeguarded when I was a kid, and it's even tougher today,'' Ms. Dos Santos said. ''Some patrons don't realize that the lifeguards are not their children's baby sitters. They can be very demanding and distracting.''
 To reach younger recruits nationwide, the American Red Cross has created a 10-hour program, ''GuardStart: Lifeguarding Tomorrow,'' for 11- to 15-year-olds who one day would like to become lifeguards. Lessons are grouped into five areas: prevention, fitness, response, leadership and professionalism. 
 For some lifeguards, what starts as a part-time job becomes an adjunct career. Elizabeth Jaramillo, 25, a social worker at Stamford High School, began working as a lifeguard as a teenager. Today, she continues to spend her summers in a high white chair with a whistle around her neck. 
 ''It can be hard, when there aren't enough guards on duty and you don't get enough breaks,'' she said. ''But you get to swim, get a tan and possibly save a life. And you know that you can always find a job, because lifeguards are always in demand.''

HEADLINE: Anxiety in the Land of the Anti-Immigration Crusader

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
PARKER, Colo.
 IT'S hardly news that illegal immigrants lead fitfully uncertain, insecure lives. The storm winds of capitalism, uneven immigration-law enforcement and international border politics can blow unpredictably and fiercely at any time.
 But very similar tones of anxiety about the universe and its curveballs can be easily found in this upper-middle-class suburb southeast of Denver -- in the home district of Representative Tom Tancredo, the man waging a one-note anti-immigration campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.
 Mr. Tancredo's district is the richest, best educated and most family friendly in Colorado (the latter based on numbers of children counted by the census). Housing prices are high and there are few immigrant-based industries like manufacturing, meat-packing or agriculture. Nearly 9 of every 10 residents are white, while less than 1 in 10 are Hispanic. In several dozen interviews across the district, most people said they didn't even know an illegal immigrant. 
 So why would illegal immigration be a cause celebre in a place like this, the whitest Congressional district in Colorado? 
 Residents and local political leaders say the answer comes down, at least partly, to words like ''order'' and ''stability.'' Those concerns may mask a certain amount of bigotry or bias. But the residents say they are motivated by concerns about borders they consider broken, leaving America open and vulnerable, especially in the post-9/11 world. Government, which many people here talk about with far more scorn and rage than they do about immigrants, has become a puppet to economic forces that demand cheap and mobile labor, they say.
 In short, local residents and immigration experts say, beneath the anger about immigration is great anxiety about a global economy that has made people feel less in control of their lives, their country and the culture they grew up with -- wherever they work, and however nice their house is.
 ''Globalization causes Mexicans to come because the jobs in their country are going to China,'' said Chris H. Lewis, a senior lecturer at the University of Colorado who teaches Western immigration history and globalization. ''And globalization makes the middle class in this country feel we don't have a voice, that our future is being created somewhere else.''
 Both illegal immigrants and many here in Mr. Tancredo's district endure transience and isolation, albeit in different ways -- from corporate relocation and outsourcing on the one hand, to old-fashioned immigrant job insecurity on the other. And both sides see the hard truth of the global job market: jobs flow downhill toward lower wages.
 ''I've got all kinds of people in my district -- engineers, computer-science people especially -- whose jobs have been eliminated by H1B,'' Mr. Tancredo said in a telephone interview, referring to the federal visa program aimed at attracting foreign technical workers. ''They believe, and I believe, it's because the company found a source of cheaper labor.''
 Yet jobs created Parker, which had only a few hundred people as recently as 1980, and now has 45,000. The nearby Highlands Ranch area grew from literal ranch land in that same period to more than 130,000 people today. While some people surely came for the climate or to take advantage of Colorado's outdoor lifestyle -- far more came for a job, especially in the high-tech industries in Denver, to which many people commute. Illegal immigrants have followed, as well, typically commuting to work here from enclaves in Denver where rents are relatively cheap.
 Stanley A. Renshon, a psychoanalyst and a professor of political science at the City University of New York, said Americans have developed what he calls a ''de facto identity'' that allows for diversity and individualism as long as a few core beliefs and values are shared, like personal responsibility and respect for the country. If people don't assimilate into the broader culture, he said, then the idea that communities can coalesce is challenged -- especially in new places like Mr. Tancredo's district where cohesion is still weak.
 ''I've done a lot of review of the public-opinion polls, and Americans are foursquare against illegal immigration and foursquare for immigrants becoming Americans,'' he said. ''When people talk about becoming an American, that to me is the hidden core of the immigration debate.''
 Some Mexican immigrants -- legal and illegal -- cling to their old culture and language because they say that American life, whether in the new suburbs or the cities, is fragmented and rootless, lacking the richness of their traditions and culture. Equally protective of their culture, many in Mr. Tancredo's district say illegal immigrants who don't assimilate and learn English are in fact a major contributing cause of the cultural fragmentation. 
 ''Portugal is Portugal because of the Portuguese language; Spain is Spanish; France is -- God knows -- France is French; Germany is Germany, all because of language,'' said Dick Hanson, 71, a retired Navy man who came to Parker in the 1980s. ''That, to me, is the thing that holds, that builds a country.'' 
 Mr. Tancredo makes much the same point. ''The impact of immigration -- legal and illegal -- on jobs, schools, health care, the environment, national security, are all very serious problems,'' he said. ''But more serious than all of them put together is this threat to the culture. I believe we are in a clash of civilizations.''
 Bill Lieb, a 52-year-old business-owner and Republican from Highlands Ranch, said he generally supported Mr. Tancredo. He said nonetheless that the American economy had become dependent on immigrants, both legal and illegal, and that the challenge was to come up with a policy to provide for those labor needs and fix what he said was ''unregulated, uncontrolled chaos'' at the borders. 
 He said his business trips to Mexico and China have made him more sympathetic to the plight of illegal immigrants. The Mexican government supports only the rich, he said.
 ''If I lived there, I'd want to get the hell out, too,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Capitol Energy Crisis

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
When you watch a baby being born, after a difficult pregnancy, it is so painful and bloody for the mother it is always hard to tell the truth and say, ''Gosh, that baby is really ugly.'' But that's how I feel about the energy legislation passed (and not passed) by the Senate last week.
 The whole Senate energy effort only reinforced my feelings that we're in a green bubble -- a festival of hot air by the news media, corporate America and presidential candidates about green this and green that, but, when it comes to actually doing something hard to bring about a green revolution at scale -- and if you don't have scale on this you have nothing -- we wimp out. Climate change is not a hoax. The hoax is that we are really doing something about it. 
 No question, it's great news that the Democrat-led Senate finally stood up to the automakers, and to the Michigan senators, and said, ''No more -- no more assisted suicide of the U.S. auto industry by the U.S. Congress. We're passing the first bill since 1975 that mandates an increase in fuel economy.'' If the Senate bill, which now has to go through the House, becomes law, automakers will have to boost the average mileage of new cars and light trucks to 35 miles per gallon by 2020, compared with about 25 miles per gallon today. 
 But before you celebrate, pay attention to some fine print in the Senate bill. If the Transportation Department determines that the fuel economy goal for any given year is not ''cost-effective'' -- that is, too expensive for the car companies to meet -- it can ease the standard. That loophole has to be tightened by the House, which takes up this legislation next week.
 But even this new mileage standard is not exactly world leading. The European Union is today where we want to be in 2020, around 35 miles per gallon, and it is committed to going well over 40 m.p.g. by 2012. Ditto Japan.
 There are other things that make the Senate energy effort ugly. Senate Republicans killed a proposed national renewable electricity mandate that would have required utilities to produce 15 percent of their power from wind, solar, biomass and other clean-energy sources by 2020. Twenty-three states already have such mandates. No matter. Making it national was too much for the Republicans.
 And the Senate, thanks again to the Republicans, also squashed a Democratic proposal to boost taxes on oil and gas companies that would have raised some $32 billion for alternative fuel projects. 
 Despite all the new research on climate change, the Senate didn't even touch the idea of either a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax to limit carbon dioxide emissions. An effort by Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota to legislate a national reporting (''carbon counter'') system to simply measure all sources of greenhouse gas emissions, which would enable a cap-and-trade system to work if we ever passed one, also got killed by Republicans. We can't cap and trade something we can't measure.
 Here is the truth: the core of our energy crisis is in Washington. We have all the technology we need right now to make huge inroads in becoming more energy efficient and energy independent, with drastically lower emissions. We have all the capital we need as well. But because of the unique nature of the energy and climate-change issues -- which require incentives and regulations to build alternatives to dirty, but cheap, fossil fuels -- you need public policy to connect the energy and capital the right way. That is what has been missing.
 ''We have to work to ensure that the House will at least toughen the provisions that the Senate passed,'' said Dan Becker, director of the Sierra Club's Global Warming Program.
 The public wants it. But energy policy gets shaped in the halls of Congress -- where wily lobbyists, legacy industries and politicians greedy for campaign contributions regularly sell out the country's interests for their own. Only when the public really rises up -- as it has finally done against the auto companies -- do we even get moderate change. Don't look to the Bush team to lead the revolution. 
 ''We are the only major country in the world where no one even knows the name of the environment minister -- the head of our Environmental Protection Agency,'' said Representative Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. ''Whoever it is -- and most people don't even know if it is a he or a she -- has been in a six-year witness protection program. Until the Democrats took over, no Bush E.P.A. administrator appeared before the House committee in charge of energy and climate change.''
 Folks, we're home alone. So call your House member -- especially the Republicans. If you don't, some lobbyist will.

HEADLINE: Where Is Washington's Love for Shareholders?

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SOMETHING terrible happened last week in terms of legal protections for stockholders. The terrible thing came out of the present administration, and I simply cannot understand how it could have gotten it so wrong, except on the basis of the machinations of one of our favorite subjects, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary.
 The loyal reader will recall that a few months ago, I wrote in this space about a stunning decision by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals involving Enron. In that decision, the judges reversed a federal district court and threw out a case against the investment banks that are accused of helping to make the Enron fraud possible. 
 The Fifth Circuit did not deny that the Enron fraud took place with the aid of many large investment banks. And the Fifth Circuit did not deny that Enron fraud was made possible by investment banks not just helping out when Enron asked for questionable accounting schemes, but also coming forward to help obscure the truth about Enron's parlous situation and therefore badly misleading investors.
 No, the Fifth Circuit said that under a case with totally different facts, called Central Bank of Denver vs. First Interstate Bank of Denver, there was no liability for parties who were not an integral part of the fraud, but ''merely'' (always a red-flag word in legal opinions) ''aiding and abetting'' and could not be liable under federal securities law in a class action. 
 To allow for certainty in fraud cases (in other words, the certainty that stockholders will be mistreated), the Fifth Circuit said that the class-action case against the investment banks could not even go to trial. 
 There was much screaming and gnashing of teeth over this opinion, especially from longtime proponents of stockholders' rights, like Lynn E. Turner, former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission (and me).
 This set up a conflict of circuits because other courts of appeal had held that there could be, as it is called, ''scheme liability'' when an investment bank or an accounting firm had been an integral part of a fraud scheme. The Supreme Court will generally hear such cases.
 Now comes the part that is enough to make you cry if you, like me, had any hope that the law had something to do with justice or the Department of Justice. 
 Many writers and public figures came forward to ask Christopher Cox, the chairman of the S.E.C., to file an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to hear the Enron case. Mr. Cox, while a great guy, has not always been the most attuned to shareholder issues. But Mr. Cox and his S.E.C. did the right thing and drew up an amicus brief on behalf of the shareholders asking the highest court to hear the case.
 This was Saul on the road to Damascus and a great turning point -- except that's when Mr. Paulson weighed in. Mr. Paulson, who before becoming Treasury secretary was head of Goldman Sachs, a huge investment bank (in which I am a paltry stockholder), urged Paul D. Clement, a worthy gent who is the United States solicitor general at the Justice Department, not to file the S.E.C. amicus brief in the Enron case.
 Why? Well, certainly not because such a move might result in a change that could cost investment banks a ton of money. No, it wasn't that at all. It was because if the law started to go after investment banks for aiding and abetting and making possible immense securities frauds, that would hurt the competitiveness of United States financial markets.
 That same old whining about how poor, poor Wall Street, where high-ranking officials can make only $50 million or $60 million a year and where hedge fund managers can make $1 billion-plus a year, might be hurt if stockholders were actually protected from sneak attacks by investment bankers.
 Poor, poor Wall Street, where the Champagne flows like water and the players get billions for helping the rich get richer. We had better protect them instead of the widows and orphans who were wiped out by the fraud at Enron.
 The next thing we knew, others in the White House weighed in, saying they did not want trial lawyers running amok looking for people to sue and upsetting businessmen. 
 And that was that. Mr. Clement decided not to file the brief in the Supreme Court. The shareholders of Enron and other similarly situated companies will have their cases heard, but without the justices partaking of a fine opinion from the S.E.C. siding with them. That's the kind of juice Mr. Paulson has.
 Now, Goldman Sachs is a defendant in an Enron stockholders' case in which allegations of an illegal offering statement for Enron's stock -- underwritten by Goldman Sachs -- have been made. It is not the same case as is under discussion in the ''scheme liability'' cases, but the basic issue -- fraud connected with Enron -- is the same.
 As noted, Mr. Paulson until recently was head of Goldman Sachs. I think it is fair to assume that a clubbable guy like him still has many friends in investment banking.
 So he apparently felt there was something wrong about standing up for stockholders of Enron hurt by investment banks' possible manipulations of truth -- but nothing wrong with his using his exalted post at Treasury to protect his Wall Street pals. Surely there is an ethical issue there somewhere. If not in the statutes, is there not the ethical issue of Mr. Paulson, one of the highest honchos in the land, lacking basic shame?
 I KNOW that Mr. Bush does not read The Times. But I know a lot of people at the White House do. Please, some of you, reconsider this embarrassment. There is no justice in this refusal to aid the Enron shareholders. There is no political gain from slapping the little guy in the face. There is no money to be made: Wall Street is giving lavishly to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama already.
 The G.O.P. is supposed to be on the side of the small investors, not of those accused of being crooks -- or so I used to think. Was I wrong all along? Is the Bush White House just the handmaiden of Wall Street? Please don't let this be true. I am sure Mr. Paulson is a powerful figure. And I know the hour is late. But the time is always right to do right, and that time is now. 
 Please ask the solicitor general to reconsider filing the S.E.C.'s brief. The basic building block of capitalism is trust, and it is crumbling.

HEADLINE: Texas Town, Now Divided, Forged Bush's Firm Stand on Immigration

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: MIDLAND, Tex. 

 BODY:
Late last spring, Republicans in this West Texas oil town called for a boycott of Dona Anita's Mexican restaurant, a retaliatory step against its owner, Luz Reyes, for closing shop and showing up at a rally against proposed new penalties for illegal immigrants.
 But President Bush's three best friends here defied the boycott and went to the restaurant, Mr. Bush's favorite when he lived here, regardless. One of them, the president's close confidant and former commerce secretary, Donald L. Evans, told Ms. Reyes: ''Luz, you didn't do anything wrong. We love you.'' 
 The hometown divide helps to shed light on a broader rift, as Mr. Bush and like-minded Republicans engage in an unusually contentious fight with the rest of their party in the national debate over immigration. 
 Mr. Bush has pursued a goal of providing citizenship for the millions of illegal immigrants with rare attacks on his conservative supporters, who have derided his approach as tantamount to amnesty. There are various political motivations for Mr. Bush to push for his plan, including the rapid growth in the nation's Hispanic population, a voting group that he has long considered to be potentially Republican. 
 But the roots of Mr. Bush's passion lie here in Midland, now heavily Hispanic, the city where Mr. Bush spent much of his childhood and to which he returned as a young adult after spending his high school and college years in the more genteel settings of Andover and Yale. 
 As a boy, and later as a young, hard-drinking oilman, his friends say, Mr. Bush developed a particular empathy for the new Mexican immigrants who worked hard on farms, in oil fields and in people's homes and went on to raise children who built businesses and raised families of their own, without the advantages he had as the scion of a wealthy New England family.
 The symbiosis fit with the Bush family's Northeastern, free-trade Republicanism, which took on a Mexican flair, especially after Mr. Bush's parents hired a live-in Mexican maid in Texas who became part of the family, and his brother, Jeb, married a young woman from Mexico who initially spoke little English.
 But interviews in Midland also tell another story, of how a place that Mr. Bush credits with informing his relatively liberal views on immigration has started to move away from him. 
 Central to the shift is the perception among some in this city of about 100,000 people that he does not understand the sense of siege that has set in about the illegal population that has grown considerably since he traded the Texas governor's mansion for the White House seven years ago. 
 ''There's just a real disconnect between the folks of West Texas and the president right now,'' said Mike Conaway, who was the chief financial officer for Mr. Bush's oil exploration company here in the 1980s and now represents the area as a Republican in Congress.
 The disconnect has been exacerbated by a steady increase of illegal immigrants since Mr. Bush left the state, and newspapers reported on the strains on social services that they have brought. It is visible on a grand scale, with Mr. Conaway and this state's two Republican United States senators, Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn, breaking with Mr. Bush on immigration in recent months after having followed his lead with Rolex reliability for most of his term.
 And it is visible in smaller, more personal terms here in Midland, with the boycott that some Republicans called against Ms. Reyes's restaurant. The dispute put Mr. Evans and the rest of Mr. Bush's friends -- who used to join Mr. Bush and his wife there nearly every Friday night -- on the opposite side of the local Republican Party, including its chairwoman, Sue Brannon.
 Mr. Evans said his appearance at the restaurant after the boycott had been called was ''just dinner, not a political statement'' against fellow local Republicans including his close friend Ms. Brannon.
 But to Ms. Reyes, who has known Mr. Bush and his wife since their twins were in baby carriers, and who recounted the encounter with Mr. Evans in an interview at her restaurant, it was an important show of support from a group she still calls ''the Bush clique.'' 
 New Beginnings
 George H. W. Bush came to the Midland-Odessa area in 1948 when his son George W. was 2, hoping to make his own fortune in oil. He eventually formed a drilling company, the Zapata Petroleum Corporation -- named for the movie ''Viva Zapata!'' about the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata -- and later took as a partner Jorge Diaz Serrano, a contender for the Mexican presidency before being imprisoned for fraud. 
 Friends of the current president have recalled how they occasionally saw Mexican workers in his father's oil fields, part of a steady trickle of new immigrants from the other side of the Southern border who also took jobs as ranch hands, maids and groundskeepers. 
 Randall Roden, one of Mr. Bush's close childhood friends, recalled an upbringing that included ''being aware that there were people who were poor and hard-working, and just looking for better opportunity, and a chance to do just about anything.''
 Joe O'Neill, another friend from the time who remains close with Mr. Bush to this day and who helped introduce Mr. Bush to the first lady, said of the newcomers, ''They were hard-working and they were usually very close families -- there was generally a father and a mother at home; you noticed it.''
 Mr. Bush's closest boyhood contact with anyone of Hispanic descent seems to have been in Houston, where the Bushes moved when George W. Bush was in middle school, two years before he went to boarding school at Andover in Massachusetts. His mother sought household help in the local paper, and answered an advertisement for a Mexican woman who was seeking sponsorship in return for housekeeping services. The woman, Paula Rendon, moved in and has stayed on with the Bush family for decades, following George H.W. and Barbara Bush to the White House and back home.
 The current president has mentioned her only rarely, but he has described her as ''a second mother.'' Mr. Bush declined several interview requests. But in a brief e-mail exchange, Mr. Bush's younger brother Jeb said of Ms. Rendon, ''I adore her,'' and added, ''I got pretty good at Spanish thanks to her.'' But, he said, he became fluent through his wife, Columba, with whom he has three children whom George H. W. Bush once famously, and affectionately, called ''the little brown ones.''
 The Son Returns
 Mr. Bush returned to Midland in 1975 to find a much more Hispanic town than the one he left behind, because of an influx of Mexicans who went there to cash in on the 1970s oil boom just as Mr. Bush did.
 ''When the president and I came here we saw more and more Hispanics moving into the oil fields, working on well-servicing rigs -- 12-hours-a-day kind of stuff,'' said Mr. Evans, who arrived in Midland around the same time and married one of Mr. Bush's grammar school friends. ''So we saw a lot of Hispanics coming into that sector of our economy here, and of course, migrating their way into the community, and the schools.''
 Mr. Bush became a man about the small city, drawn to its Mexican restaurants and the entrepreneurs behind them feeding on the boom times.
 ''The sky was the limit and who we were mattered less than where we were going,'' said one of his friends from the time, Jose Cuevas, a third-generation Mexican American who established a fast-food burrito chain with a few thousand dollars.
 Mr. O'Neill said, ''He had a great deal of admiration for someone like Jose who started with a lot less and built it up.''
 Another Hispanic friend from the time, George Veloz, recalled playing basketball at the Y.M.C.A. with Mr. Bush and sometimes ''sharing a few cold ones.'' 
 Mr. Bush's parents had eaten at the small Mexican restaurant Mr. Veloz's parents started after immigrating from Mexico, and which Mr. Veloz went on to build into a statewide chain. ''As important as that family is, he didn't treat me any different than any of the friends he grew up with,'' Mr. Veloz said.
 A Different Climate
 In a telephone interview, Ms. Brannon, the local party chairwoman who has known Mr. Bush for decades, said Mr. Bush did not understand the new realities of illegal immigration. She said the friends he made in the Hispanic community when he lived in Midland were ''not here illegally and taking freebies.'' 
 ''I love George and Laura dearly, and I respect him,'' she said, ''but this immigration thing is going to ruin our country.'' 
 In winning election as governor in 1994, and winning re-election in 1998, Mr. Bush succeeded in drawing an unexpectedly high level of support from Hispanic voters.
 He did so in part by speaking out against efforts by Pete Wilson, then the governor of California, to push initiatives intended to cut off services for illegal immigrants in his state.
 Mr. Bush also spoke out against antitrade sentiment at the time in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times that had as its headline, ''No Cheap Shots at Mexico, Please.''
 In a state that had for the most part reacted negatively to the amnesty provisions enacted under Ronald Reagan in 1986, Governor Bush found Texas to be largely receptive to his push to provide a bilingual education program for the children of Hispanic immigrants.
 In the current climate, that seems like a distant memory, a casualty of what Mr. Bush's longtime political adviser, Karl Rove, a Texan, said reflected how ''the feelings about immigration have waxed and waned over the years'' in Texas. In the 1990s, Mr. Rove said, Texans felt as if the immigration problem was relatively under control -- an assessment of that time that even Ms. Brannon shared. But now, she said, ''there's just more and more coming in.''

HEADLINE: A Success in New York, A Wild Card for the Nation

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL. 
James Barron contributed reporting.

 BODY:
He no longer brags about his dating exploits or shows off his impolitic side. He has largely reined in his temper with reporters and loosened his manner with voters. But Michael R. Bloomberg, New York's once-improbable mayor, would still be a highly unlikely presidential contender.
 A zealot for privacy, he slips away to Bermuda on weekends to practice his golf game. Divorced with a steady companion, he frequently indulges a louche sense of humor, joking at a dinner one night that if Salma Hayek joined him at the official mayor's residence, he might actually live there. And he still likes to end his evenings with a nightcap out, leading to the occasional public admission of having had perhaps a merlot or two too many.
 New Yorkers may have become accustomed to the eccentricities of the billionaire information mogul who took an unorthodox path to public service. But, as he has thrust himself more fully into national politics, even Mr. Bloomberg has questioned whether the rest of the country is ready for him.
 ''He's still himself,'' said Douglas A. Muzzio, a professor at the Baruch School of Public Affairs. ''His dislike of and unwillingness to engage in traditional politics provides both the raison d'etre for his candidacy and the unlikelihood of winning.'' 
 And yet, since his election in 2001, he has become more adept at the political game he had so assiduously shunned, gaining increasing prominence as a symbol of centrist, nonpartisan leadership.
 His recent defection from the Republican Party set off speculation about his possible presidential ambitions. Some analysts dismissed the move as a tactic to retain influence as he approaches 2009, when term limits will force him from office. 
 But Mr. Bloomberg has been underestimated before -- few political experts believed he could win City Hall, for instance -- and his don't-sweat-the-small-stuff manner can mask what associates say is an intense focus and determination. 
 ''He's completely goal-oriented,'' said Steven Rattner, a Democratic donor who is close to the mayor. ''He picked up golf, and now he's determined to catch Tiger Woods. He decided he wanted to learn Spanish and carves out the time for lessons, no matter how busy he is.''
 That focus has its roots in his middle-class upbringing in Medford, Mass., helping him climb from the lower rungs of Wall Street to the top of his own multibillion-dollar enterprise and then the thin-air precincts of New York's high society. That, in turn, helped his political ascent.
 ''People don't take it seriously; they think it's something to amuse yourself with, but it's where the power is,'' said David Patrick Columbia, who chronicles the haute life on his Web site, newyorksocialdiary.com. ''Everybody wanted him at their dinner tables, and by the time he was ready to run for office, all of those important and influential people thought he ran a good business, he could run a good city.''
 With his popularity soaring, many New Yorkers would now seem to agree. But that was not always the case. Associates say Mr. Bloomberg would be the first to admit he did not so much win the election as his opponent, Mark Green, lost it, though the novice politician was also helped by the endorsement of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, as well as his near-limitless ability to finance his own campaign.
 After his surprising win, however, Mr. Bloomberg wasted no time getting to work. Even before taking office, associates say, he began calling business leaders, urging them to stay and to move back downtown in a city still wrenched by the human and economic toll of 9/11. He attacked looming deficits with an 18.5 percent property tax increase and pursued his own interest in improving public health by pushing through an unpopular smoking ban. 
 ''He came in with a businessman's mind-set,'' said Edward Skyler, a deputy mayor who followed Mr. Bloomberg from his company to the mayoral campaign, then to City Hall. ''Basically his mentality was: 'Let's do it and get it over with. It's not going to get any better by waiting.' He knew what was ahead of him.''
 That willingness to take on difficult problems like a troubled school system, housing that is beyond the reach of many residents and entrenched poverty, and an ability to promote his pursuits to the public, have earned him widespread support among voters. Some experts say it is unclear whether his administration is making significant or long-lasting strides in these areas, but others applaud at least the efforts.
 At the same time, Mr. Bloomberg's unwillingness to engage in the symbolic acts many constituents find meaningful and what some see as an inability to project empathy with the travails of ordinary New Yorkers have led to accusations that he is out of touch.
 But colleagues describe a hard-working boss who would rather be on the telephone or in meetings with deputies and commissioners doing the business of the city than at ribbon-cuttings and news conferences. Those who have worked with him over the years say that although he lets his staff pursue projects in their own way and does not micromanage, he is deeply engaged in the details of their work, rewriting and editing speeches and policy papers himself. 
 ''He delegates but really requires accountability,'' said Patricia E. Harris, his closest deputy. 
 Current and former associates say that Mr. Bloomberg is demanding, expecting those around him to be able to defend their proposals from all angles and at any time. He can also be short-tempered and impatient, they say, though his anger is generally brief. 
 They also describe a manager who pays attention to their lives, asking about their children and spouses.
 Friends and associates say he is extremely loyal. Merryl H. Tisch, a philanthropist and vice chancellor of the state Board of Regents who has known Mr. Bloomberg for decades, said that she saw him the evening he returned from his recent trip to California, during which he had announced his split with the Republican party. He was at a reception in honor of her longtime building superintendent, who had died about a year ago. The man, Ms. Tisch said, had also helped look after Mr. Bloomberg's town house a few doors down from her building, and Mr. Bloomberg had spoken at the man's funeral, and stayed for the entire service.
 ''It's not like he's doing it because he's running,'' she said. ''He's doing it because that's the Michael who did it last week like this, who did it 10 years ago like this, who did it 20 years ago like this. There's a natural sense of grace to him.''
 It is clear that Mr. Bloomberg enjoys his Manhattan life, from his Upper East side town house to his sparkling social circle. Even before becoming mayor, he was an unabashed enthusiast for New York. 
 With his companion, Diana L. Taylor, the former state banking superintendent, he still spends many evenings traipsing through the benefit circuit as well as visiting community and political organizations throughout the city, or having lively conversation with friends over dinner with lots of red wine.
 Still, as his profile rises nationally, these same qualities many New Yorkers embrace about Mr. Bloomberg may make him seem faintly exotic to middle-American voters.
 ''I still think we're a country that has a certain distrust of things that happen in cities,'' said Fred P. Hochberg, dean of Milano The New School for Management and Urban Policy, in discussing what Mr. Bloomberg would have to overcome. He added that the nation had not elected an unmarried president since the 19th century, ''because voters tend to look for a parental figure in their executive leaders, there is an official residence and we think about families living there.''

 ''He's completely goal-oriented,'' said Steven Rattner, a Democratic donor who is close to the mayor. ''He picked up golf, and now he's determined to catch Tiger Woods. He decided he wanted to learn Spanish and carves out the time for lessons, no matter how busy he is.''
 That focus has its roots in his middle-class upbringing in Medford, Mass., helping him climb from the lower rungs of Wall Street to the top of his own multibillion-dollar enterprise and then the thin-air precincts of New York's high society. That, in turn, helped his political ascent.
 ''People don't take it seriously; they think it's something to amuse yourself with, but it's where the power is,'' said David Patrick Columbia, who chronicles the haute life on his Web site, newyorksocialdiary.com. ''Everybody wanted him at their dinner tables, and by the time he was ready to run for office, all of those important and influential people thought he ran a good business, he could run a good city.''
 With his popularity soaring, many New Yorkers would now seem to agree. But that was not always the case. Associates say Mr. Bloomberg would be the first to admit he did not so much win the election as his opponent, Mark Green, lost it, though the novice politician was also helped by the endorsement of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, as well as his near-limitless ability to finance his own campaign.
 After his surprising win, however, Mr. Bloomberg wasted no time getting to work. Even before taking office, associates say, he began calling business leaders, urging them to stay and to move back downtown in a city still wrenched by the human and economic toll of 9/11. He attacked looming deficits with an 18.5 percent property tax increase and pursued his own interest in improving public health by pushing through an unpopular smoking ban. 
 ''He came in with a businessman's mind-set,'' said Edward Skyler, a deputy mayor who followed Mr. Bloomberg from his company to the mayoral campaign, then to City Hall. ''Basically his mentality was: 'Let's do it and get it over with. It's not going to get any better by waiting.' He knew what was ahead of him.''
 That willingness to take on difficult problems like a troubled school system, housing that is beyond the reach of many residents and entrenched poverty, and an ability to promote his pursuits to the public, have earned him widespread support among voters. Some experts say it is unclear whether his administration is making significant or long-lasting strides in these areas, but others applaud at least the efforts.
 At the same time, Mr. Bloomberg's unwillingness to engage in the symbolic acts many constituents find meaningful and what some see as an inability to project empathy with the travails of ordinary New Yorkers have led to accusations that he is out of touch.
 But colleagues describe a hard-working boss who would rather be on the telephone or in meetings with deputies and commissioners doing the business of the city than at ribbon-cuttings and news conferences. Those who have worked with him over the years say that although he lets his staff pursue projects in their own way and does not micromanage, he is deeply engaged in the details of their work, rewriting and editing speeches and policy papers himself. 
 ''He delegates but really requires accountability,'' said Patricia E. Harris, his closest deputy. 
 Current and former associates say that Mr. Bloomberg is demanding, expecting those around him to be able to defend their proposals from all angles and at any time. He can also be short-tempered and impatient, they say, though his anger is generally brief. 
 They also describe a manager who pays attention to their lives, asking about their children and spouses.
 Friends and associates say he is extremely loyal. Merryl H. Tisch, a philanthropist and vice chancellor of the state Board of Regents who has known Mr. Bloomberg for decades, said that she saw him the evening he returned from his recent trip to California, during which he had announced his split with the Republican party. He was at a reception in honor of her longtime building superintendent, who had died about a year ago. The man, Ms. Tisch said, had also helped look after Mr. Bloomberg's town house a few doors down from her building, and Mr. Bloomberg had spoken at the man's funeral, and stayed for the entire service.
 ''It's not like he's doing it because he's running,'' she said. ''He's doing it because that's the Michael who did it last week like this, who did it 10 years ago like this, who did it 20 years ago like this. There's a natural sense of grace to him.''
 It is clear that Mr. Bloomberg enjoys his Manhattan life, from his Upper East side town house to his sparkling social circle. Even before becoming mayor, he was an unabashed enthusiast for New York. 
 With his companion, Diana L. Taylor, the former state banking superintendent, he still spends many evenings traipsing through the benefit circuit as well as visiting community and political organizations throughout the city, or having lively conversation with friends over dinner with lots of red wine.
 Still, as his profile rises nationally, these same qualities many New Yorkers embrace about Mr. Bloomberg may make him seem faintly exotic to middle-American voters.
 ''I still think we're a country that has a certain distrust of things that happen in cities,'' said Fred P. Hochberg, dean of Milano The New School for Management and Urban Policy, in discussing what Mr. Bloomberg would have to overcome. He added that the nation had not elected an unmarried president since the 19th century, ''because voters tend to look for a parental figure in their executive leaders, there is an official residence and we think about families living there.''

HEADLINE: How Bernanke Made Them Believe

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 ALMOST nobody said it publicly, but when Ben S. Bernanke took over as chairman of the Federal Reserve a little more than one year ago, there was an undercurrent of speculation that he might be a little green.
 Unlike his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke had spent almost all his adult life as an academic economist at Princeton. Except for two years as a Fed governor, and a year as a top academic adviser to President Bush, he had never had to make economic forecasts or to set policy with real money on the line. And even then, most of the real power was in Mr. Greenspan's hands.
 Mr. Bernanke also seemed detached. He thrived on econometric models. He was skeptical about relying on individual intuition and discretion, both hallmarks of Mr. Greenspan. And less than three months into the job, Mr. Bernanke looked naive when he set off a market frenzy by chatting informally with Maria Bartiromo of CNBC and telling her that the markets had misread the Fed's intentions. 
 Could an Ivy League academic like this ever have Street credibility? But as Mr. Bernanke meets with Fed policy makers this week to set interest rates, the answer is clear: yes, yes and yes again.
 If anybody has had to learn on the job, it has been Fed watchers and investors rather than Mr. Bernanke. 
 The news out of the Fed's meeting on Thursday will not be that it kept the overnight Federal funds rate at 5.25 percent. Investors have assumed that for weeks now, just as they assume that the Fed will reiterate that inflation is a bigger risk than slower growth.
 The real news is that financial markets now accept the Fed's view of the economy and are no longer betting against it. 
 That is a significant change. In May 2006, bond investors were convinced that inflation was not going to slow the way Mr. Bernanke thought. But since then, measures of core inflation, which exclude the volatile ups and downs of food and energy, have been edging back down to the top of the Fed's unofficial target of 2 percent a year.
 In February, when economic growth had weakened, many investors became convinced that a serious slowdown was at hand and that the Federal Reserve would feel compelled to reduce interest rates by June.
 Few believe that anymore. The evidence suggests that economic growth in the second quarter this year could hit an annual pace of 3 percent. Despite the protracted plunge in housing and the exploding problems of subprime mortgage lenders, the economy still looks poised to bump along only slightly below its long-term trend rate of about 3 percent a year. 
 Put another way, the economy today is pretty much exactly where Mr. Bernanke hoped it would be one year ago. Economic growth has slowed slightly, gradually reducing inflationary pressures. And while job creation has slowed, unemployment remains low, at 4.5 percent.
 Brian Sack, a senior economist in Washington at Macroeconomic Advisers, said one of Mr. Bernanke's most-criticized moves now appears to have been providential.
 In April 2006, Mr. Bernanke kicked off a bond market sell-off by telling a Congressional hearing that the Fed might pause in its campaign to raise rates even if the risks of inflation and slower growth ''are not entirely balanced.''
 Investors took that as a sign that Mr. Bernanke was soft on inflation, because consumer prices were ticking up noticeably at the time. 
 As it happened, the Fed kept raising rates through June. Stopping even then seemed a bit early, because inflation was running above the Fed's comfort level. But the Fed was betting that the impact of previous rate increases, combined with the slowdown in housing, would complete much of the remaining work without the need for higher rates.
 That bet proved to be correct.
 ''In hindsight, it was a masterful move,'' Mr. Sack said. ''It allowed the economy to weather a massive downturn in housing without a broader slowdown.''
 Perhaps more revealing, Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials never wavered when confronted with the inevitable noise of contrary economic indicators. Steadiness is no virtue if the course turns out to be wrong. But the Fed's steadiness under Mr. Bernanke has thus far been largely validated by events in the real world.
 To be sure, the ''soft landing'' did not come about in the way Mr. Bernanke and the Fed's own forecasters had expected. He predicted in early 2006 that housing would experience a ''gradual cooling'' that would probably not last terribly long.
 What actually occurred was a severe plunge in home building, a ballooning inventory of unsold houses and an implosion in the market for subprime mortgages for people with weak credit. 
 The other surprise was that unemployment remained lower than the Fed had expected. The central bank's forecast last year anticipated that unemployment would hover from 4.75 percent to 5 percent in both 2006 and 2007. Instead, it has averaged about 4.5 percent since September. 
 Neither of those surprises has derailed the Fed's game plan so far, but they still could. The Fed is far from infallible, and policy makers are ultimately making educated guesses. 
 If the housing downturn endures or becomes worse, it could have ripple effects on nonresidential investment and consumer spending. On the other hand, low unemployment could drive up wages faster than productivity and rekindle inflation pressures. 
 BUT for the moment, financial markets have stopped second-guessing the Fed's outlook. The federal funds futures market now indicates that investors are not expecting the Fed to cut rates this year. That is consistent with what Fed officials have been implying for quite a long time now.
 ''The markets have repriced to an economic and monetary policy outlook that is very much aligned with the Fed's thinking,'' said Richard Berner, North American economist at Morgan Stanley. 
 It is always possible that both the Fed and the markets are wrong; agreement is not the same thing as being right. But if nothing else, it suggests that Mr. Bernanke has attained his Street credibility.

HEADLINE: Iran Cracks Down on Dissent, Parading Examples in Streets

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
Iran is in the throes of one of its most ferocious crackdowns on dissent in years, with the government focusing on labor leaders, universities, the press, women's rights advocates, a former nuclear negotiator and Iranian-Americans, three of whom have been in prison for more than six weeks. 
 The shift is occurring against the backdrop of an economy so stressed that although Iran is the world's second-largest oil exporter, it is on the verge of rationing gasoline. At the same time, the nuclear standoff with the West threatens to bring new sanctions. 
 The hard-line administration of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, analysts say, faces rising pressure for failing to deliver on promises of greater prosperity from soaring oil revenue. It has been using American support for a change in government as well as a possible military attack as a pretext to hound his opposition and its sympathizers. 
 Some analysts describe it as a ''cultural revolution,'' an attempt to roll back the clock to the time of the 1979 revolution, when the newly formed Islamic Republic combined religious zeal and anti-imperialist rhetoric to try to assert itself as a regional leader. 
 Equally noteworthy is how little has been permitted to be discussed in the Iranian news media. Instead, attention has been strategically focused on Mr. Ahmadinejad's political enemies, like the former president, Mohammad Khatami, and the controversy over whether he violated Islamic morals by deliberately shaking hands with an unfamiliar woman after he gave a speech in Rome. 
 Mr. Khatami, the lost hope of Iran's reform movement, felt compelled to rebut the accusation because such a handshake is religiously suspect, but contended that the crowd seeking to congratulate him for his speech was so tumultuous that he could not distinguish between the hands of men and women. Naturally a video clip emerged, showing the cleric in his typical gregarious style bounding over to the first woman who addressed him on the orderly sidewalk, shaking her hand and chatting amicably. 
 The dispute over the handshake occurred during a particularly fierce round of the factional fighting that has hamstrung the country since the 1979 revolution. Far more harsh examples abound. 
 The country's police chief boasted that 150,000 people -- a number far larger than usual -- were detained in the annual spring sweep against any clothing considered not Islamic. More than 30 women's rights advocates were arrested in one day in March, according to Human Rights Watch, five of whom have since been sentenced to prison terms of up to four years. They were charged with endangering national security for organizing an Internet campaign to collect more than a million signatures supporting the removal of all laws that discriminate against women. 
 Eight student leaders at Tehran's Amir Kabir University, the site of one of the few public protests against Mr. Ahmadinejad, disappeared into Evin Prison starting in early May. Student newspapers had published articles suggesting that no humans were infallible, including the Prophet Muhammad and Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 
 The National Security Council sent a stern three-page warning to all the country's newspaper editors detailing banned topics, including the rise in gasoline prices or other economic woes like possible new international sanctions, negotiations with the United States over the future of Iraq, civil society movements and the Iranian-American arrests. 
 The entire campaign is ''a strong message by Ahmadinejad's government, security and intelligence forces that they are in control of the domestic situation,'' said Hadi Ghaemi, an Iran analyst for Human Rights Watch. ''But it's really a sign of weakness and insecurity.''
 At least three prominent nongovernment organizations that pushed for broader legal rights or civil society have been shuttered outright, while hundreds more have been forced underground. A recent article on the Baztab Web site said that about 8,000 nongovernment organizations were in jeopardy, forced to prove their innocence, basically because the government suspects all of them of being potential conduits for some $75 million the United States has earmarked to promote a change in government. 
 Professors have been warned against attending overseas conferences or having any contact with foreign governments, lest they be recruited as spies. The Iranian-Americans are all being detained basically on the grounds that they were either recruiting or somehow abetting an American attempt to achieve a ''velvet revolution'' in Iran. 
 Analysts trace the broadening crackdown to a March speech by Ayatollah Khamenei, whose pronouncements carry the weight of law. He warned that no one should damage national unity when the West was waging psychological war on Iran. The country has been under fire, particularly from the United States, which accuses it of trying to develop nuclear weapons and fomenting violence in Iraq. 
 President Ahmadinejad and other senior officials have dismissed all the criticism as carping. The president blames the previous administration for inflation or calls it media exaggeration, while Tehran's chief prosecutor, Said Mortazavi, said Iranians who oppose the Islamic Republic look for an excuse to criticize it. 
 After a meeting of senior police and judiciary officials in Tehran on June 19 to review what was described as ''the public security drive,'' the Iranian Labor News Agency quoted Mr. Mortazavi as saying that if the state did not protect public security, then ''louts'' and criminals ''would be safe in society.
 The three Iranian-Americans are being held in the notorious Section 209 of Evin Prison, the wing controlled by the Intelligence Ministry, and have been denied visits by their lawyers or relatives. Iran recognizes only their Iranian nationality and has dismissed any diplomatic efforts to intervene. A rally to demand their release is set for Wednesday outside the United Nations. 
 The three are Haleh Esfandiari, the director of the Middle East program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars; Kian Tajbakhsh, an urban planning consultant with the Open Society Institute; and Ali Shakeri, of the Center for Citizen Peacebuilding at the University of California, Irvine. A fourth, Parnaz Azima, a journalist who works for Radio Farda, an American-financed station based in Europe, has been barred from leaving the country.
 ''People don't want to come to conferences, they don't even want to talk on the phone,'' said Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian studies program at Stanford University. ''The regime has created an atmosphere of absolute terror.''
 To the political crackdown, Mr. Ahmadinejad adds a messianic fervor, Mr. Milani noted, telling students in Qom this month that the Muslim savior would soon return. 
 The appeal of such a message may be limited, however. Iran's sophisticated middle class wants to be connected to the world, and grumbles that the country's only friends are Syria, Belarus, Venezuela and Cuba. But it might play well with Mr. Ahmadinejad's main constituency. 
 ''They are the poor, the rural,'' said Vali Nasr of the Council on Foreign Relations. ''They don't travel abroad, they don't go to conferences. He is trying to undermine the social and political position of his rivals in order to consolidate his own people.'' 
 Most ascribe Mr. Ahmadinejad's motives to blocking what could become a formidable alliance between the camps of Mr. Khatami and Hashemi Rafsanjani, both former presidents. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for early next year, and the next presidential vote in 2009. 
 ''Having toface a single pragmatic conservative and reform block is extremely threatening,'' Mr. Nasr said, hence the intimidation of all possible supporters. 
 Not that everyone has been intimidated. More than 50 leading economists published a harshly worded, open letter to the president saying his policies were bringing economic ruin. High unemployment persists, there has been little foreign investment and inflation is galloping, with gasoline alone jumping 25 percent this spring. 
 Gasoline rationing is expected within a month, with consumers so anxious about it, reported the Web site Ruz, financed by the Dutch government, that skirmishes broke out in long lines at some pumps on June 17.
 Iran can prove a difficult country to separate into black and white. Amid all the recent oppression, for example, last week the public stoning of a couple -- the punishment for adultery -- was called off. Women's rights advocates had been agitating against it. 
 Also, two recent movies touched off controversy as too racy. One depicted an extramarital affair, and the hero of the second was an abortion doctor who drank and gambled, and yet was so beloved of the patients he had seduced that they sent him bouquets on his wedding night. 
 In an attempt to deflect criticism that its standards had grown loose, the Ministry of Islamic Guidance, which vets all books, movies and gallery exhibits, issued a statement noting that both scripts had been approved under the former administration of Mr. Khatami.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 25, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday described a crackdown in Iran that has included the jailing of three Iranian-Americans, repression or intimidation of nongovernment organizations pressing for broader legal rights, warnings to newspaper editors against articles on banned topics, arrests of advocates for women's rights and of student leaders, and the detention of 150,000 people for wearing clothing considered not Islamic. 
 The headline over the article said that Iran was cracking down on dissent and ''parading examples'' in the streets, and one paragraph in the article also said that young men detained for wearing tight T-shirts or western-style haircuts had been ''paraded bleeding through Tehran's streets by uniformed police officers.'' The Times caption on an official Iranian news agency photograph that ran with the article said that it showed a police officer punishing a young man in public for wearing un-Islamic clothing by forcing him to suck on a plastic container normally used for intimate hygiene, a punishment the article also asserted was for that offense. 
 But the man in the photograph, according to widespread Iranian news reports, was one of more than 100 people arrested recently on charges of being part of a gang that had committed rapes, robberies, forgeries and other crimes. The caption published on the Web site of the news agency, Fars, had said only that the man was being punished as part of a roundup of ''thugs'' in a Tehran neighborhood. 
 The current repression has made reporting in Iran difficult. In this case, The Times relied on an interview with a researcher for a nongovernment agency that no longer operates within Iran who said the photograph was evidence of a more visible police role in public crackdowns on what the authorities consider immoral behavior. The reporter then wrongly interpreted what the researcher said as applying to a crackdown on dress, and incorporated the erroneous interpretation into the body of the article, without giving any indication of the source for it.
 These errors could have been avoided with more rigorous editing. The article should not have said that young men had been paraded through the streets for wearing un-Islamic dress, and the headline over it should not have said that dissenters were being paraded as part of the crackdown.

 BODY:
THE SNORING BIRD 
 My Family's Journey 
 Through a Century of Biology.
 By Bernd Heinrich.
 Illustrated. 461 pp. 
 Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers. $29.95.
The curious title of Bernd Heinrich's sprawling memoir, as he discloses straightaway in his preface, is a ''direct heist'' from an obscure volume published in 1932 in German (''Der Vogel Schnarch''), the chronicle of an Indonesian zoological expedition in quest of an elusive species of jungle rail. Its author was none other than Gerd Heinrich, his ''Papa.'' Why not call the book an hommage, then? It is ultimately that too, yet the whiff of theft in the air is the first clue that what follows will be no ordinary account of a son following in his father's footsteps. This particular gene pool turns out to be something of a fever swamp, and thereby hangs a tale of two naturalists that reads like a cross between a Darwinian parable and a Nabokov novel: an absorbing scientific saga rife with uncanny twists and fraught with quandaries over the primordial tussle between nature and nurture. 
 The purloined rubric, for all that, smacks somewhat of a diverting wrinkle. Prize catch though it was, the secretive rail with the rumbling call (Aramidopsis plateni) that Papa Heinrich bagged on the island of Celebes has only a bit part in this ancestral odyssey, and birds of every feather played second fiddle to Gerd's lifelong ruling passion: collecting and classifying specimens of the prodigious family of parasitical ichneumon wasps. It soon becomes clear that the rarest birds on display here are the Heinrichs themselves -- conceivably the most redoubtable father and son in their field since the pioneering Bartrams (John and William) botanized up and down the Eastern Seaboard back in the days of Franklin and Jefferson. 
 Heinrich fils, a professor emeritus of biology at the University of Vermont, is best known for his groundbreaking books on raven intelligence (''Ravens in Winter'' and ''Mind of the Raven'') and for his study of physiological stamina based on his exploits as an ultramarathoner (''Why We Run''). He first made his name, however, as a bug guy. ''Bumblebee Economics,'' a layman's guide to insect sociobiology that grew out of his doctoral dissertation, was nominated for a 1979 American Book Award, cementing his reputation as an uncommonly enlightening nature writer for popular audiences.
 So was it old-fashioned filial devotion that spawned this stellar body of work in modern research biology? Not exactly. Heinrich's penchant for entomology plainly owed much to his father's indomitable presence (he was dragooned into snaring wasps when he was practically a grub himself), and his yen for field studies blossomed during his adolescence in upcountry Maine after his immediate family emigrated from Germany in 1951. Even so, father and son never really saw eye to eye: although Papa Heinrich's own checkered history as a ''freeman of zoology'' with no secure institutional ties left him skeptical that his offspring would have a future in the profession, he was nonetheless stung that the son he nicknamed ''Pise,'' after the charismatic species Protichneumon pisorius, felt no obligation to carry on the family trade. ''He made no secret of the fact that he hoped I would one day take over his collection, but I had no interest or intention of fulfilling that hope,'' Heinrich writes. ''Later I did go on to study biology, though not his sort of biology.''
 The ensuing narrative -- unfolding under the epic headings ''The Old World'' and ''The New World,'' and drawing extensively on Gerd's surviving letters and journals -- is a labor of love on a grand scale. Part eulogy and part apologia, Heinrich's painstaking effort to reconstruct his clan's ''journey through a century of biology'' obliges him to grapple with the thorny human element that's bound up in his intellectual heritage, giving a whole new meaning to the proposition that biology is destiny.
 Born in Berlin in 1896, Gerd grew up on a bucolic Polish estate called Borowke that proved to be a vital wellspring for a baptism in nature. It was there he acquired his zeal for wasps before being conscripted as a German infantryman and then a fighter pilot in the Great War -- and where, some 30 years on, he buried his cherished hoard of specimens in a strongbox before narrowly escaping the advancing Red Army in 1945. ''The ichneumoninae,'' he later wrote with a touch of waspish wit, ''have disciplined my time and energy, excepting the interruptions of wars, a revolution, invasion, expulsion, starvation and emigration.''
 Bernd spent his early childhood at Borowke as well, born to a Polish mother in 1940, on the anniversary of Darwin's death. When the Iron Curtain fell, his parents spirited him and his younger sister out of harm's way and for the next six years eked out a hand-to-mouth existence in a forest cabin near the Elbe River, until Gerd wrangled a passage to America. The recollection of that formative interlude sparks some of Heinrich's most lyrical writing -- a portrait of the future scientist as a footloose nature boy.
 The action flags a bit in the second half of the book: in recounting his coming-of-age in the brave new world of molecular biology, Heinrich only intermittently strikes a happy balance between technical and anecdotal rumination. But things pick up again in the closing chapters, where he steps back to reflect on what his late father's life's work reveals about the essential nature of the naturalist's calling. As a diehard taxonomist in the classic Linnaean mold, was Papa Heinrich a vestige of a bygone age -- engaged in mere ''stamp collecting,'' in Isaac Asimov's withering phrase? That's one way of looking at it, but his son would also have us see him as a touchstone figure even in the era of the genome: a paragon of the empirical discipline that's the foundation of the scientific enterprise. It's a testament to the younger Heinrich's heartfelt humanism and hard-won historical perspective that father and son emerge as exemplary kindred spirits, bonded by an abiding fascination for living things that he hails as nothing less than ''a prime phenotype of love.''

 BODY:
The stones at Machu Picchu seem almost alive. They may be alive, if you credit the religious beliefs of the ruler Pachacuti Yupanqui, whose subjects in the early 15th century constructed the granite Inca complex, high above a curling river and nestled among jagged green peaks. To honor the spirits that take form as mountains, the Inca stoneworkers carved rock outcrops to replicate their shapes. Doorways and windows of sublimely precise masonry frame exquisite views. But this extraordinary marriage of setting and architecture only partly explains the fame of Machu Picchu today. Just as important is the romantic history, both of the people who built it in this remote place and of the explorer who brought it to the attention of the world. The Inca succumbed to Spanish conquest in the 16th century; and the explorer Hiram Bingham III, whose long life lasted almost as many years as the Inca empire, died in 1956. Like the stones of Machu Picchu, however, the voices of the Inca ruler and the American explorer continue to resonate. 
Imposingly tall and strong-minded, Bingham was the grandson of a famous missionary who took Christianity to the Hawaiian islanders. In his efforts to locate lost places of legend, the younger Bingham proved to be as resourceful. Bolstered by the fortune of his wife, who was a Tiffany heiress, and a faculty position at Yale University, where he taught South American history, Bingham traveled to Peru in 1911 in hopes of finding Vilcabamba, the redoubt in the Andean highlands where the last Inca resistance forces retreated from the Spanish conquerors. Instead he stumbled upon Machu Picchu. With the joint support of Yale and the National Geographic Society, Bingham returned twice to conduct archeological digs in Peru. In 1912, he and his team excavated Machu Picchu and shipped nearly 5,000 artifacts back to Yale. Two years later, he staged a final expedition to explore sites near Machu Picchu in the Sacred Valley.
 If you have visited Machu Picchu, you will probably find Bingham's excavated artifacts at the Yale Peabody Museum in New Haven to be a bit of a letdown. Mostly, the pieces are bones, in varying stages of decomposition, or pots, many of them in fragments. Unsurpassed as stonemasons, engineers and architects, the Incas thought more prosaically when it came to ceramics. Leaving aside unfair comparisons to the jaw-dropping Machu Picchu site itself, the pottery of the Inca, even when intact, lacks the drama and artistry of the ceramics of earlier civilizations of Peru like the Moche and Nazca. Everyone agrees that the Machu Picchu artifacts at Yale are modest in appearance. That has not prevented, however, a bare-knuckled disagreement from developing over their rightful ownership. Peru says the Bingham objects were sent to Yale on loan and their return is long overdue. Yale demurs.
 In many ways, the dispute between Yale and Peru is unlike the headline-making investigations that have impelled the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the Getty Museum in Los Angeles and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston to repatriate ancient artifacts to their countries of origin. It does not revolve around criminal allegations of surreptitious tomb-raiding and black-market antiquities deals. But if the circumstances are unique, the background sentiments are not. Other countries as well as Peru are demanding the recovery of cultural treasures removed by more powerful nations many years ago. The Greeks want the Parthenon marbles returned to Athens from the British Museum; the Egyptians want the same museum to surrender the Rosetta Stone and, on top of that, seek to spirit away the bust of Nefertiti from the Egyptian Museum in Berlin. Where might it all end? One clue comes in a sweeping request from China. As a way of combating plunder of the present as well as the past, the Chinese government has asked the United States to ban the import of all Chinese art objects made before 1911. The State Department has been reviewing the Chinese request for more than two years.
 The movement for the repatriation of ''cultural patrimony'' by nations whose ancient past is typically more glorious than their recent history provides the framework for the dispute between Peru and Yale. To the scholars and administrators of Yale, the bones, ceramics and metalwork are best conserved at the university, where ongoing research is gleaning new knowledge of the civilization at Machu Picchu under the Inca. Outside Yale, most everyone I talked to wants the collection to go back to Peru, but many of them are far from disinterested arbiters. In the end, if the case winds up in the United States courts, its disposition may be determined by narrowly legalistic interpretations of specific Peruvian laws and proclamations. Yet the passions that ignite it are part of a broad global phenomenon. ''My opinion reflects the opinion of most Peruvians,'' Hilda Vidal, a curator at the National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History of Peru in Lima, told me. ''In general, anything that is patrimony of the cultures of the world, whether in museums in Asia or Europe or the United States, came to be there during the times when our governments were weak and the laws were weak, or during the Roman conquest or our conquest by the Spanish. Now that the world is more civilized, these countries should reflect on this issue. It saddens us Peruvians to go to museums abroad and see a Paracas textile. I am hopeful that in the future all the cultural patrimony of the world will return to its country of origin.'' Behind her words, I could imagine a gigantic sucking whoosh, as the display cases in the British Museum, the Smithsonian, the Louvre and the other great universal museums of the world were cleansed of their contents, leaving behind the clattering of a few Wedgwood bowls and SA<8>vres teacups.
 Richard Burger's office at Yale is dowdily decorated with modern Peruvian handicrafts, sculptures and fabrics. Although Burger, a professor of anthropology, has devoted his professional career to Peruvian archaeology, everything he excavates remains in Peru, as required by law. With his wife, Lucy Salazar, a native of Lima whom he met while she was studying archaeology at San Marcos University there, Burger organized an exhibition, ''Machu Picchu: Unveiling the Mystery of the Incas,'' which, in 2003 and 2004, toured the United States and displayed many of the objects that Bingham sent back to Yale.
 When Burger and Salazar came to Yale in 1981, most of the Inca artifacts were in storage. ''We didn't know if the collection would support an exhibition,'' Burger told me. ''It was scattered in different rooms of the Peabody. There had been fires and floods. Some of it desperately needed conservation work -- it was deteriorating because it wasn't climate-controlled.'' Their notion was to create an exhibition in cooperation with the government of Peru, a prospect that the Peruvian tourist authority greeted with enthusiasm but no financing. Since Yale would provide only seed money, they had to come up with financing -- slightly more than $1 million -- to conserve the objects and bankroll the exhibition.
 Never relinquishing hope that Peru might be a sponsor of the show, they were encouraged by a change of administration. The authoritarian Alberto Fujimori regime fell in a human rights and corruption scandal in 2000; following a brief transitional government, Alejandro Toledo was elected in 2001 as the first ethnically indigenous president of the country. Toledo has an inspiring personal story. Growing up as an impoverished shoeshine boy in a small town, he caught the eye of a Peace Corps volunteer, who arranged to have him study in California at the University of San Francisco. Toledo went on to do graduate work at Stanford University, where he met his future wife: Eliane Karp, a French-born student of anthropology and linguistics who was preparing a Ph.D. dissertation on the Latin American indigenous-culture movement and its relationship to Europe in the early 20th century. A gifted linguist, she speaks the native Andean language of Quechua. (Her husband does not.) At the suggestion of a friend who was advising the Toledo campaign, Burger and Salazar met with Karp-Toledo in her temporary office in August 2001, just after the new administration took power. The meeting went well. ''We were very optimistic,'' Burger told me. ''This is a guy with a degree from Stanford, and his wife speaks Quechua and is interested in anthropology. We thought maybe Yale and Peru could have an educational initiative together.'' Karp-Toledo told them she would like to learn more.
 ''She said, 'Send me a proposal, not to my office but to my house, and I'll show it to my husband,' '' Salazar recalled.
 ''So we wrote up a proposal that involved an educational mission,'' Burger said. ''We sent it to them. When we went to Peru the following year, they said, 'Why don't we meet in the palace?' ''
 Before being admitted to see Karp-Toledo on that morning in August 2002, Burger and Salazar were kept waiting for an hour and a half while she conferred with an anthropologist, Luis Lumbreras, who was well known to the Yale couple. A charismatic Marxist, Lumbreras was one of Salazar's professors at San Marcos. He is an expert on pre-Inca Peruvian cultures, and is best known academically for his pioneering excavations of an ancient ceremonial capital, ChavAn de Huantar. Burger later worked at the same site and published studies that discredited many of Lumbreras's conclusions. Scholars can be as jealously territorial as nations when it comes to the proprietorship of cultural patrimony. Entering Karp-Toledo's office, Burger and Salazar discovered with mild consternation that Lumbreras would be participating in the discussion. Soon after, the president himself appeared.
 ''During the meeting, Toledo came in and gave his opinion,'' Burger said.
 ''It was the first time we saw him,'' Salazar continued. ''He said: 'I saw the proposal, it's great. When can I sign? I want to be at the opening of the exhibition.' ''
 After Toledo made his exuberant offer to travel to New Haven, there was an uneasy silence. Then his wife reprimanded him.
 ''Eliane raised her finger and said, 'You're not going anywhere,' '' Salazar continued. ''That moment was embarrassing, for me as a Peruvian.''
 ''For me as a man it was embarrassing,'' Burger said.
 ''He started to fix his tie,'' Salazar went on.
 ''He said, 'I have to go back to my cabinet meeting, I have left all cultural matters in Eliane's hands,' '' Burger recalled.
 Once Toledo departed, Karp-Toledo expressed herself clearly.
 ''It was very uncomfortable,'' Burger said. ''She said she wanted everything back. It was a question of legal repatriation.''
 ''She said, 'This is a proposal that you have written, not that we have written,' '' Salazar said.
 ''Lumbreras began to give a history of Machu Picchu that was completely wrong,'' Burger said. ''He was saying that all of the material should have been returned in six months.'' Evidently, Karp-Toledo was guided by his counsel.
 ''Eliane is a child of the '60s, of Paris and Berkeley, of the rights of indigenous people,'' Burger told me. ''For her, meeting Lumbreras is like meeting the reincarnation of Che Guevara, the embodiment of the Latin American revolution.''
 The meeting at the presidential palace limped on for an hour and a half before it adjourned awkwardly.
 Karp-Toledo is a slim woman with long, wavy reddish blond hair and a fondness for fashionable versions of Andean woolens and ethnic jewelry. She left Peru in July 2006, two weeks before the inauguration of her husband's successor, Alan GarcAa, a former president whom Toledo defeated in the previous election. (In Peru, presidents are barred from serving consecutive terms, so Toledo could not run for re-election.) Karp-Toledo's enemies say she skipped out to avoid arrest on charges of financial chicanery. When I visited her at Stanford University in January, she pooh-poohed the suggestion. ''I didn't want to see Alan GarcAa inaugurated,'' she told me. ''It is very sad for Peru.'' Stanford, where she studied for a doctorate without completing her dissertation, welcomed her back, along with her husband.
 In a graduate seminar in anthropology, Karp-Toledo was explaining to her students that much of our knowledge of the isolated Inca culture, which lacked a written language, comes from the chronicles of the Spanish conquerors. What the Spaniards didn't comprehend was that their Inca informants viewed past events as a malleable clay to be fashioned into a pleasing form. Today some scholars assert that the practices of the 21st-century descendants of the Incas provide a corrective to the accounts in the chronicles. In the south Andean highlands around the former capital of Cuzco, the peasant farmers may pour a glass of CusqueA$(1$)a beer instead of the corn beverage chicha on the floor for the earth goddess, Pachamama, but the old ways survive. Like Bingham, Karp-Toledo is fascinated by the final stronghold of the Inca and the archaeological remains that have been uncovered there, but her interest is not that of a romantic explorer. For her, the power of cultural patrimony lies in its potential to motivate the living. She argues that the ruins of the last independent Inca capital can inspire Peru's indigenous people to free themselves politically of domination by the Peruvian elite, which is largely of Spanish ancestry. ''The last Inca retreated after losing Ollantaytambo, deeper to Vicabamba, which is now jungle, then to Vilcabamba,'' she told her students. ''The resistance lasted about 40 years in a society organized into several cities. The last resistance, with the farmers or campesinos, still is existing today. And it is very interesting to see today how these architectural symbols help to keep the resistance going.''
 As first lady, Karp-Toledo devoted much of her energy to recalibrating such potent symbols of Peru's past. I had been told that she banished from the Plaza Mayor in Lima the statue of Francisco Pizarro, the conquistador who held hostage and then executed Atahualpa, the hapless son and successor of the last great Inca, Huayna Capac. When we talked outside the classroom, Karp-Toledo smilingly told me that the story was untrue. ''It is often associated with me, but I had no part in the decision,'' she said. She credited the mayor of Lima with removing the monument, but allowed that during the campaign she gave a newspaper interview in which she discussed it. ''I said, 'I don't know too many people in the world who have a statue of their conqueror in the plaza and are worshiping him and honoring him,' '' she recalled. ''I think the guy is a genocide and has no place in the plaza.'' Still, she acknowledged that in Lima, the criollos, who are descendants of the Spanish, see the past differently. ''The Peruvian elites looked at Pizarro as a civilizer, which we know is not so,'' she told me. ''I took down a huge painting of him, armed and everything, at the top of the staircase of the Presidential Palace. I didn't want to see it every day.'' The Toledo administration also flew the rainbow Inca pennant alongside the modern Peruvian flag on top of the palace. ''I'm sure Alan GarcAa took it down,'' she told me. ''He's so criollo, and we are so totally different.'' Even though it is her husband who is a cholo, or indigenous Peruvian, Karp-Toledo far outdoes him in her ardor for the native customs and religious beliefs. Because she is of European origin, she was derided by her many enemies as la gringa and dismissed as the particular sort of gringa who latches onto indigenous styles in a sentimental and condescending way. 
 The day after Toledo was inaugurated in Lima as president in July 2001, a second oath-taking ceremony was held at Machu Picchu. ''We decided that we would go to be inaugurated in a place that we know and care about and that is part of Alejandro's heritage,'' Karp-Toledo explained. ''Machu Picchu is such a symbol. There was a Pachamama offering and an offering to the high mountains, the apus, who are the main custodial gods of Cuzco. There are quite a few apus where Machu Picchu is located.'' 
 Unlike most other great Inca settlements, Machu Picchu was overlooked and untouched by the Spanish, and the sensibility of its creators palpably survives. The manifest care and sensitivity of the construction -- the way the avenues were laid out, the buildings and altars were sited and the stones were cut and joined -- all testify to a reverence for the natural world that to us seems otherworldly. Of course, feeling the spiritual tug of Machu Picchu doesn't necessarily lead to a conversion to Inca religious practices. According to Jorge Flores Ochoa, a prominent professor of anthropology at the University of Cuzco, the American-educated Toledo hung back from the televised religious ceremony of the burning of a sacred packet at his inaugural festivities as Karp-Toledo joined in enthusiastically.
 Among the many foreign guests who attended Toledo's inauguration at Machu Picchu was Terry Garcia, an executive vice president of the National Geographic Society. He represented an organization with a long relationship with the site. The 1911 expedition in which Bingham first saw Machu Picchu was sponsored solely by Yale, but the explorer's two subsequent research trips to Peru -- in 1912 and 1914-15 -- were jointly backed by Yale and the National Geographic Society. Indeed, Bingham's Machu Picchu excavation of 1912 was the first archaeological dig that National Geographic supported. When Bingham's riveting account of his finds appeared in 1913, an entire issue of the magazine was devoted to the article. ''We're always going to have an interest in this,'' Garcia told me. ''It's part of our history.'' Peru, with its natural and archaeological treasures, remained an important place for the society.
 Prompted by an outside inquiry, Garcia began an intensive education in the role of National Geographic and Yale at Machu Picchu not long after he started in his job. He says that after reviewing the legal record he became convinced that Peru was entitled to have back the objects that Bingham brought out. The agreement was especially clear-cut on the last expedition, of 1914-15. Because a change of political leadership in Peru had weakened his standing in the country, Bingham did not receive permission to dig again at Machu Picchu, but only at nearby sites; and he was forced to agree to return whatever research materials he took to Yale within 18 months, a period that was later extended. According to Yale (though not Peru), all the artifacts that Bingham exported in the third expedition were repatriated in 1921. But that is a coda to the earlier dig, the one that is laden with symbolism and has provoked the uproar. A clause in the agreement authorizing the historic 1912 excavation, while not time-specific, states that Peru ''reserves the right of requiring of Yale University and the National Geographic Society of the United States the restitution of single and duplicate artifacts that might be extracted and have been extracted,'' as well as copies of all research papers and reports. ''Title wasn't ever meant to be transferred,'' Garcia says. ''It was a loan.'' From his perspective, any dispute over the Bingham collection could only damage the position of the National Geographic Society in Peru -- ''a very rich country in terms of its natural and cultural resources'' -- and limit the society's access to Peru's cultural patrimony for future magazine articles, museum exhibits and television programs. 
 At the end of 2000, Garcia met two well-connected men at a dinner party at the Greek Embassy in Washington: Jose Koechlin, a Lima-based travel-company owner and conservationist, and Barton Lewis, an American friend of Koechlin's who worked in the Peruvian tourism industry. It was Koechlin, upon learning of a planned Peruvian magazine article on Bingham's failure to return the Machu Picchu artifacts, who had asked Lewis to call friends at National Geographic, thereby triggering Garcia's interest in the case. In the Peruvian business community, which is ruled by relationships, Koechlin stood to benefit from a connection with the famous National Geographic. He also had a potential interest in seeing the artifacts return to Peru. Koechlin's flagship property is the Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel, a luxurious boutique hotel in Aguas Calientes, the tourist town that grew up around the Machu Picchu train station and is a 20-minute bus ride from the archaeological site. The sole attraction in unlovely Aguas Calientes is a Machu Picchu museum at the other end of town from the Inkaterra Pueblo. Few tourists are even aware of it. If the museum could be enhanced with the Yale holdings, or if a new ''interpretive center'' could be constructed with the National Geographic Society's assistance, there would be another reason for affluent tourists to stay an extra night in Aguas Calientes, aside from the hummingbirds and high-thread-count bedsheets at the Inkaterra Pueblo. Koechlin told me there was nothing to this line of talk, which I had heard propounded several times in Lima, a city where the rumors roll in as thick as the winter fog. He said that he chose to become involved as a patriotic Peruvian.
 The influential Koechlin arranged for Lewis and Garcia to attend the Toledo inauguration festivities at Machu Picchu. In the throng, they began talking with a small group of civic-minded Cuzco residents and some Peruvian officials -- including Lumbreras, who was then serving as director of the National Museum of Archaeology. Not surprisingly, the conversation turned to the Bingham artifacts. What was said, however, surprised Lumbreras greatly. ''Up until that point, we believed it was the responsibility of Yale, and Peruvians thought they had no right to reclaim it,'' Lumbreras told me. ''After this meeting, we began to investigate.'' 
 Until then, the repatriation fight would have looked to the hardheaded Lumbreras like the quirky one-woman crusade of a freelance historian, the eccentric Mariana Mould de Pease. Over the last decade, she has been the most persistent proponent of legally recovering the Yale objects. When I visited her house in the comfortable Miraflores district of Lima, Mould de Pease laid out many copies of documents and old maps on her dining-room table. A woman subject to bursts of fluttery, birdlike excitement, she was wearing on a silver chain around her neck a large pendant with a photograph of her late husband, Franklin Pease, a distinguished historian of pre-Conquest and early colonial Peru. Nineteenth-century portraits of her family, which is partly of English descent on her side and partly American on Pease's, stared down at us from the walls.
 A LimeA$(1$)a of European ancestry, Mould de Pease nonetheless vehemently supports the indigenous claims on Machu Picchu, a back-burner issue in Lima but a heated topic in Cuzco. In the minds of the CuzqueA$(1$)os, who inhabit the place that the Inca called ''the navel of the world,'' their compatriots in Lima, the imperial capital that the Spanish established on the coast, are greedily selling off the national patrimony. Even in Bingham's day, Mould de Pease told me, there were CuzqueA$(1$)os who tried to block the trains from Machu Picchu that were loaded with artifacts bound for Lima and then for New Haven. Because Machu Picchu is by far the most important tourist attraction in the country, it has become a pawn in the never-ending power struggle between the LimeA$(1$)os and the CuzqueA$(1$)os. People in Cuzco would tell me that Machu Picchu is a sacred place that must be protected from commercialization and excessive tourism. When I said that to people in Lima, they would insist that there is no fault line between the two cities. Koechlin, for instance, told me that Peru is a Catholic country, both in the highlands and on the coast, and that the ''elitist'' criticisms of mass tourism in Machu Picchu originated with foreigners, not CuzqueA$(1$)os. ''Pablo Neruda came to Machu Picchu and said, 'I want to walk and be alone,' '' Koechlin said. ''That is very elitist. Then in the 1990s, HernAn Crespo of Unesco said he goes to Machu Picchu to be alone. That is elitist. It is not a sacred religious place like Americans have sacred sites. It's more a poetic thing.'' I repeated Koechlin's remarks in Cuzco to Fernando Astete, an archaeologist and the director of the Machu Picchu park, who was telling me that the Yale collection could not be shared (though many of the pieces were found as duplicates in the tombs) because the Andean people feel they need pairs of objects for their ceremonies even today, to express the male-female duality of the universe. ''He is an ignoramus,'' Astete said angrily. ''He lives in Lima, which is a Western city. Lima is Lima. All they care about is money.''
 The political conflict over Machu Picchu has as many dramatic episodes as a telenovela. In the 1990s, the Fujimori government caused an uproar when it proposed leasing the archeological parks, including Machu Picchu, to private concessions and building a cable car that would take visitors directly to the Machu Picchu site. Replacing the present bus ride or long, steep walk from the train station, the cable car could have doubled or tripled the number of visitors. Mould was among those outraged. ''They were trying to use Machu Picchu as a place just for entertainment,'' she told me. Hotel and train magnates, including Koechlin, supported the scheme, which was eventually defeated by a coalition of Cuzco students, international scholars, New Age believers in spiritual energy and the holders of the Aguas Calientes bus monopoly. ''They were going to destroy the area with the number of people,'' says David Ugarte, an anthropology professor at the University of Cuzco who led the student protests. ''And the cable car was a cultural aggression, because Machu Picchu was built by Pachacuti as a place for religious purposes and resting. What the Western people call mountains were divinities for the Andean people. They were going to make holes in the divinities.''
 Mould's participation in the cable-car protests was merely a sideline to her research and writing, which increasingly focused on the role of Hiram Bingham. In November 1999, her husband died unexpectedly of pancreatic cancer. ''I was shocked,'' she told me. ''I was 56. What would I do with my life? I need an anchor.'' She resolved that she would ''tell the Peruvian version'' of the Bingham expeditions. In the process of stripping away the reputation of the celebrated Yalie -- ''this dashing man, so handsome, so Western, so Caucasian'' -- she came across presidential decrees that authorized Bingham's excavations and seemed to reserve Peru's rights to recover objects that he removed. In the spring of 2000, Koechlin got advance word of an article that Mould was preparing. This is how, through Lewis, he came to raise the issue with the National Geographic Society and how the matter reached Lumbreras's attention at the inaugural ceremony the following year. 
 Lumbreras says that when he returned from Machu Picchu, he ordered a search at the National Museum of Archaeology for Yale's restitutional shipments. He found some boxes returned in 1921, but of course nothing from the historic 1912 Machu Picchu expedition. ''They had returned boxes of animal bones and human bones that were not from Machu Picchu,'' he said. ''This was an insult. The boxes were more valuable than their contents.'' He asked Mould to compile information for him on the legal decrees that governed Bingham's excavations, and he brought the file to Eliane Karp-Toledo. He told me that the first lady was ''particularly interested'' in Machu Picchu. ''It was in her line of interest, the defense of the indigenous world,'' he explained. ''She said she was a CuzqueA$(1$)a.'' I looked at him quizzically and said, ''She did?'' He shrugged and smiled. Although he could not recall when he delivered Mould's documentation, it would have happened sometime between Burger and Salazar's first meeting with Karp-Toledo, which had been so encouraging, and the second meeting at the Presidential Palace, which went so badly.
 Lumbreras concluded from the inquiry that Yale had made ''a serious promise that was not fulfilled.'' To him, the case is important not for the objects themselves. ''Inca pottery is nothing special,'' he said. ''The pieces are important because they are of a particular historical context. And besides being from Machu Picchu, they are important because they represent the first time the Peruvian government took steps to protect its cultural heritage. The goal is the recovery of our legal rights.'' He expressed no desire to establish a new museum. ''Nobody goes to Machu Picchu to see a museum, much less to see if there are any pots,'' he said. ''You need a lot of time to see the site, they don't want to waste time to see a museum. Besides, they're not fabulous collections.'' He said that, no matter what Karp-Toledo believed, he foresaw no significant benefits for the indigenous people in the recovery of these artifacts. ''Machu Picchu belongs to multinational companies -- the train companies, the hotel chains -- like all world patrimony,'' he said. Yet, unsentimental as that sounds, he said he shares the Peruvian attachment to these ancient indigenous cultures, some of them extinguished far more totally than the Incas. ''There is a relation between Peruvian places like Machu Picchu, ChavAn and Chan Chan,'' he said. ''We think it is part of the same story. I have a completely criollo education and background. I am closer to Aristotle than to Huayna Capac, maybe, in my way of thinking and speaking. Nevertheless, I feel very closely tied to this patrimony we have inherited. It is not an ethnic issue, much less a racial one. Racially, I am mixed indigenous with a very Western brain. Ideologically, I am an atheist, so I don't have anything to do with the indigenous religion. But because Machu Picchu is from here, people say, 'It is mine.' That is the way people see things.''
 At this point, the cultural-patrimony dispute between Peru and Yale began to resemble one of those bitter custody battles in which the adoptive parents painstakingly document how they have provided the child with a superior home while the birth parents, insisting that they never intended to give up their progeny permanently, seek recourse in the courts. In some ways, Peru's claim against Yale mirrored the more famous bickering between the British Museum, which maintains that Lord Elgin rescued the Parthenon frieze from target practice and souvenir seekers, and the Greek government, which argues that a central treasure of its history was illegitimately seized while the country was under the colonial domination of the Ottoman Empire. The Peruvian case, however, featured a legal paper trail of documents.
 By late 2001, Burger and Salazar had rounded up their financing and were proceeding at full speed on their show. They dispatched a photographer to Machu Picchu. They made a latex mold of a palace wall to demonstrate the masterful masonry and constructed dioramas of an Inca ruler conferring with an emissary and of Bingham entering the burial caves. They exhumed Bingham's diaries from the archives and cameras from storage to be placed in a display case. They also sought pieces that would be more impressive than the mostly humdrum things that Bingham had sent back to Yale. They told me that Peru canceled a promised loan of Inca gold at the last minute, but they obtained substitutes from a private American collection. The show -- which was the first traveling exhibition organized by the Peabody -- was a success, visiting six American museums and attracting more than a million visitors.
 Unusually intact and well cataloged, the Bingham collection has great value to scholars of Inca life. In the '90s, Yale researchers and visiting scholars began to apply up-to-date analytical techniques to artifacts that had been neglected since 1930. From ceramic styles and dental examination, they concluded that most of the people living at Machu Picchu originally hailed from other regions of the empire. Carbon isotopes in human bones revealed that corn, rather than the expected potato, formed the staple diet. The most newsworthy revisionist finding emerged from the study of human bones by John Verano, an expert at Tulane University. Back in 1916, Bingham's osteologist, George Eaton, reported a 4-to-1 preponderance of women over men in the human remains at Machu Picchu. Largely on that basis, Bingham arrived at his famous conjecture that Machu Picchu was a place for sequestering ''chosen women,'' those females of exceptional grace and beauty who, according to the Spanish chronicles, were destined to be virgin priestesses or royal concubines. Verano discovered that Eaton was mistaken: there was no such sex disparity. So much for the ''chosen women'' hypothesis. 
 Scholarly consensus has disproved as well Bingham's hunch that Machu Picchu was the place where the Inca empire originated and then, after the Spanish invasion, retreated. Instead, it seems that it was a winter resort in the warmer valley where Pachacuti Yupanqui could escape the harsh Cuzco climate. This theory partly derived from a close reading of a 16th-century Spanish document. In the scientific studies that Burger and Salazar organized on the Bingham artifacts, they gathered archaeological evidence to support the idea that Machu Picchu was, as Salazar puts it, ''a kind of Camp David'' for a culture in which the ruler indulged himself by fasting while gazing at the mountains, rather than, say, by clearing brush and jogging. Pachacuti was the leader who consolidated the Inca realm; along with his military and civic accomplishments, he had a taste for smooth stone courses and gateways that frame views. The famous Inca architecture in Cuzco, Pisac and Ollantaytambo, as well as Machu Picchu, is attributed to his patronage. ''Pachacuti is still considered as a mythic figure to be the best ruler of Peru,'' Karp-Toledo told me. For many Peruvians, the connection of Machu Picchu to Pachacuti that was corroborated by the Yale research added emotional weight to the campaign to recover the objects.
 Viewed from New Haven, however, the ongoing conservation work and study of the Bingham collection reinforced the argument that Machu Picchu was part of the cultural patrimony of humanity, not of one nation. Even Peruvian partisans usually praise Yale's stewardship especially when compared with Peru's record in safeguarding archaeological treasures, which is spotted with the traces of disappearing objects. Twenty-two gold Inca pieces virtually all of the gold in the collection were stolen from the Museo Inka in Cuzco in 1993. Three pre-Inca textiles vanished from a museum in Ica in 2004. Most spectacularly, hundreds of pieces were found to be missing from the National Museum of Archaeology in 1979, forcing the resignations of Lumbreras, in his first stint there as director, and of the museum's curator of metal objects, who eventually became his second wife. When I inquired, Lumbreras said that most of the thefts predated his administration. He agreed, however, that ''it is terrible and true'' that Peru has failed to safeguard its patrimony. Whether the solution is to cede guardianship to other countries is a separate question. ''The argument is that the developed countries have more money to put in a security system,'' Karp-Toledo told me. ''Why don't they help us put in a better security system?'' Or, as Flores Ochoa scathingly said, ''This is the argument that all the museums that have taken objects from other countries use that the countries don't take care of these objects. That is what the big countries have to ease their guilty conscience.''
 Garcia, the National Geographic official, agreed. Even before Toledo took office, he offered to broker an arrangement between Peru and Yale. He suggested a collaboration of all three parties on an ''interpretive center-slash-museum near Machu Picchu'' to house some of the Bingham objects, either in the town of Aguas Calientes or alongside the archaeological site. For a year, beginning in July 2001, he and other National Geographic representatives (with the active interest of Koechlin and Lewis) pursued that project. ''We thought it was reasonable,'' Garcia says. ''Yale expressed very little interest in the proposal. Frankly, the attitude they took was, 'Keep your nose out of our business.' That probably is still their attitude.'' Garcia, however, had his own business reasons to see the dispute resolved: the Peruvian cultural authorities, lumping the National Geographic Society with Yale because of its historic partnership in the Bingham expedition, were threatening to withhold promised loans of Inca mummy textiles for a National Geographic show. This was an ominous portent. If Yale persisted in opposing Peru's claims, Garcia wanted to make it clear that the National Geographic did not support the university.
 By the time of Karp-Toledo's hostile session with Burger and Salazar in August 2002, positions were hardening. A month afterward, Garcia, Koechlin and Lewis organized a meeting with Lumbreras; Burger told me that when he heard about it through the Lima rumor network, he ''couldn't believe that this was happening behind Yale's back,'' and, from that point, he was disinclined to collaborate with the National Geographic Society because it was ''undermining what we were doing.'' For his part, Garcia was losing patience with Yale. ''It's so patronizing of them to suggest that you can't return these objects to Peru because they can't take care of them -- that a country like Peru doesn't have competent archaeologists or museums,'' he says. ''Maybe if you were a colonial power in the 19th century you could rationalize that statement. I don't see how you could make it today. Why not acknowledge that the title belongs to the Peruvian people and work out an agreement with Peru? You get out from under this horrible controversy with Peru and you are still able to conduct scholarly work.''
 But it was not quite that simple. Granting Peru ownership of the collection would have binding implications. Under Peruvian law, antiquities cannot stay outside the country for more than two years before they must be returned. This statute, designed to protect the national patrimony, was to Yale's thinking an obstacle to repatriating the collection. ''Part of our concern with the materials we have here not the museum-quality objects but the study collection, the small sherds and pieces of things is that we are very concerned about scientific research and ongoing analysis,'' Barbara Shailor, who is Yale's deputy provost for the arts, told me. ''If objects must be returned in two years, what does that mean in terms of scholarly research?'' 
 At the Peruvian Embassy in Washington, President Richard Levin of Yale met with Eduardo Ferrero, the ambassador at the time. ''He said he would study the issue, and we agreed to have another meeting,'' Ferrero told me. ''It didn't happen. He began to take more and more time.'' Levin told me that ''universities don't move very quickly.'' But as months passed, Ferrero came to believe that Yale was stalling. He retained an American lawyer and formally requested the return of the collection. In late 2005, he became more aggressive, leading to his announcement of a deadline and an ultimatum. When Yale did not comply, he broke off negotiations in March 2006 and declared that Peru would take its case to the courts. He says that Yale knew very well that a new government would take office in Lima that summer. ''They didn't act according to the principles of good faith,'' he told me. ''I think they wanted to gain time. They thought that with a change of government, the new government would not give so much importance to the issue.''
 The Toledo administration left without filing a lawsuit. As many people told me, Yale is far more affluent than Peru, and lawsuits are expensive. When the administration of Alan GarcAa took office in July 2006, a commission (established in Toledo's last months, but with the membership now changed) placed the matter under review. The ubiquitous Koechlin is on the commission as well. Last March, I asked Santiago Marcovich, the Foreign Ministry official who then headed the commission, if the GarcAa government would be as adamant as Toledo's in pursuing the claim. ''I don't know,'' he said. ''I don't think so. I don't know. It's a different way of tackling the problem. We cannot be so conflictive. Or maybe yes. It depends on the action of Yale. It is action-reaction. Peruvian law doesn't allow us to make any concession on matters of cultural heritage.''
 Choosing to be more conciliatory toward a government that might be open to compromise, Yale last month extended a new proposal to the GarcAa administration. The university showed me two letters sent to Peruvian officials in which Yale offered to send back ''the museum-quality (that is, whole) objects excavated by Bingham at Machu Picchu'' for display in a ''state-of-the-art museum exclusively dedicated to Machu Picchu'' that would be opened in Cuzco in collaboration with Yale on the centennial anniversary of Bingham's 1911 discovery of the site. To help raise money for the museum, Yale would resurrect its touring exhibition, which -- including dioramas and ceramics -- would end up permanently in Cuzco. This represents a significant concession over Yale's past proposal to divide possession of the approximately 300 display-worthy objects. The research collection, however, would continue to reside in New Haven. ''The museum-quality pieces are the ones that people will want to see,'' Shailor, the deputy provost, told me. ''I don't think they will want to see the end of a little finger or five dog bones, but these are extraordinarily valuable from a research perspective.'' When I spoke with him in early May, Levin said that Yale is prepared to concede Peruvian title to the entire collection, but only after the ultimate physical allocation of the objects has been negotiated. In other words, Peru's pride will be assuaged if Yale's research needs can be met. Whether Peru will consent to those terms -- indeed, whether the GarcAa government is at liberty to do so, legally or politically -- is uncertain; but earlier this month, Peru told Yale that it was prepared to resume talks, with Housing Minister HernAn Garrido-Lecca, a former investment banker who did postgraduate work at Harvard and M.I.T., as its lead negotiator. ''We have clearly stated that we would like to proceed in these negotiations, but first we would like a complete list of the pieces that were taken by Hiram Bingham in his expeditions to Peru,'' Garrido-Lecca told me. ''We want to have a friendly negotiation. In the end, we would like to have every piece in Peru, of course. But we would like to have a long-term relationship with Yale. We have a totally different attitude toward this matter than the previous administration.''
 Burger and Salazar say they acknowledge the return of the museum-quality objects to Peru as a painful inevitability. (Salazar winced when I mentioned an attractive pair of dishes decorated with butterflies.) For both of them, but especially for Salazar, who is currently conducting an inventory, the Bingham collection has provided an outstanding career opportunity. If the dispute is amicably resolved, their hope is that Yale and Peru will collaborate on educational and scientific programs in the future. Yale officials would also like to borrow, for display on a rotating basis in the Peabody museum, objects that Bingham excavated at Machu Picchu. ''We would want to continue some presence, because it is an important part of the Peabody's history,'' Shailor told me. ''Hiram Bingham is such an extraordinary figure.'' She paused almost imperceptibly, and added, ''For his age.''
 Many of the Peruvians who are clamoring for the return of the Yale collection belittle Bingham's achievement. ''It is increasingly evident that Bingham did not 'discover' Machu Picchu,'' Flores, the Cuzco anthropologist, told me. ''The place was not too far away from Cuzco. It is within a known farm, Cutija. Machu Picchu was always known by the CuzqueA$(1$)os, especially by farmers of that area.'' Flores speaks with authority. He comes from a leading Cuzco family, and his maternal grandfather acquired the farm opposite Cutija in 1890. Flores says that the rector of the University of Cuzco informed Bingham of the whereabouts of Machu Picchu. And, obviously, the local farmers knew of it: the child of one farmer escorted Bingham to the site, where the American explorer, far from being in terra incognita, photographed graffiti that had been scrawled by another farmer. ''Because we are getting close to the centenary of the discovery, it has brought up a debate on who really discovered Machu Picchu,'' Flores continued. ''After the people see that CuzqueA$(1$)os knew about it, they say: 'Who is Bingham? He didn't discover the pieces. He was told. And why does Yale have it? They should give it back. Because he did not discover Machu Picchu. On the contrary, he was someone who took things from Machu Picchu.' ''
 The notion that Bingham did not really discover Machu Picchu is set forth at the Machu Picchu site museum, where the wall labels pointedly state that ''this place was not unknown to the local inhabitants.'' Fernando Astete, an archaeologist who has worked at the Machu Picchu park since 1978 and been director of it since 2001, wants the Bingham collection to be exhibited at the site's museum. When I spoke with him in Cuzco, he said: ''I am happy with the museum. It has temperature control and humidity control and guards.'' But when I visited the site museum, which is located about a mile and a half from the Aguas Calientes train station, I found evidence of none of those amenities. The doors were open to the air, which was moist from the nearby river, and the sole official was a caretaker who sold tickets and then exited the building. On display in the attractive (if unguarded) museum are the finds that Peruvian archaeologists have made at Machu Picchu in the years since Bingham's excavations. ''In the last 30 years, we have found a good collection -- ceramics, metal, stone, spondylus shells, very few textiles,'' Astete said. ''We also have found tombs that Bingham didn't find.'' The Machu Picchu museum contains fewer intact ceramics than are at the Yale Peabody. There is, however, one unique object: a gold bracelet found in 1995, the only gold ever uncovered at the site. It was located in the loose-fill foundation of a plaza, most likely placed there as an offering during construction.
 Burger and other scholars believe there was no gold for Bingham to find at Machu Picchu because the royal family would take precious objects back to Cuzco when they left the estate. During his lifetime, however, Bingham was plagued by rumors that he had smuggled gold out of Machu Picchu through Bolivia. Those rumors persist. I heard them myself in Peru, from people who told me that their grandparents witnessed Bingham's caravans laden with mysterious material, heading east for the border to evade export controls.
 Such gossip is wishful thinking. By the time Bingham came to Peru, there was very little Inca gold remaining anywhere in the world. It vanished centuries earlier. When Francisco Pizarro seized Atahualpa in 1532 and held him hostage, the Inca ordered his subjects to collect a ransom. The obedient populace stripped the enormous gleaming panels and other lavish embellishments from the Temple of the Sun in Cuzco, which were a legacy of Pachacuti. They dismantled an artificial garden of sculptures of corn, flowers and birds, all realistically made with precious metals. They conveyed vases, idols, drums, pots, altars, fountains, masks and other creations of the finest goldsmiths -- the tribute that this great and isolated civilization had paid to its gods and rulers. The chronicles record the steady arrival of prodigious quantities of gold, which the conquerors stored alongside their prisoner. All for naught. The Spanish executed Atahualpa anyway and melted down the treasure to ship home. As I talked to people in Peru about the Bingham collection, this tragic history was always flickering in the background. The Spanish ships heavy with plunder sailed from Peru long ago. The patrimony is irretrievable, the Spaniards unaccountable. Yet the drama continues to play out, like a recurring nightmare or a neurotic repetition compulsion, within Peru today. Precious objects that remain in Peru -- things far more beautiful than the Machu Picchu crockery -- are still being extracted at a horrifying rate. In many parts of the country, especially along the coast, tomb-robbing is a major industry: the huaqueros sell the plundered antiquities to middlemen for placement with rich collectors in Lima or abroad. The dispute with Yale is a sideshow.
 Historic relics have pragmatic value: politically, for purposes of national pride and partisan advantage; economically, for display to tourists, museumgoers, magazine readers and TV-program watchers; scientifically, as research material for scholars pursuing academic careers; and, most nakedly, as merchandise for dealers in antiquities. In comparing the arguments and motivations of the different claimants to the Yale collection, I often identified with historians of the Inca trying to untangle those Spanish chronicles that were spun from the tales of native informants with their own purposes. The people at Yale say that they have preserved the collection as a legacy of a great civilization and they want to continue to study these artifacts to learn more about that culture. They are also paying tribute to one of the most colorful and glamorous figures in the university's history. The Peruvians celebrate their own legendary ancestor when they describe the urgency of their case, but they also have very down-to-earth political and commercial uses for the collection. ''Cultural patrimony'' -- the phrase sounds so otherworldly. Bingham and Pachacuti were both very practical men. They would not have been fooled for a minute.

HEADLINE: My Time as a Hostage, And I'm a Business Reporter

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
 AS an American journalist based in China, I knew there was a good chance that at some point I'd be detained for pursuing a story. I just never thought I'd be held hostage by a toy factory.
 That's what happened last Monday, when for nine hours I was held, along with a translator and a photographer, by the suppliers of the popular Thomas & Friends toy rail sets.
 ''You've intruded on our property,'' one factory boss shouted at me. ''Tell me, what exactly is the purpose of this visit?'' When I answered that I had come to meet the maker of a toy that had recently been recalled in the United States because it contained lead paint, he suggested I was really a commercial spy intent on stealing the secrets to the factory's toy manufacturing process.
 ''How do I know you're really from The New York Times?'' he said. ''Anyone can fake a name card.'' 
 Thus began our interrogation, which was followed by hours of negotiations, the partial closing of the factory complex and the arrival of several police cars, a handful of helmet-wearing security officers and some government officials, all trying to free an American journalist and his colleagues from a toy factory.
 Factory bosses, I would discover, can overrule the police, and Chinese government officials are not as powerful as you might suspect in a country addicted to foreign investment.
 I shouldn't have been surprised by the reception. The last time I arrived at a factory under suspicion for selling contaminated goods (toothpaste), they quickly locked the gate and ran. A month earlier, I walked into the headquarters of a company that sold tainted pet food to the United States, and the receptionist insisted the owner was not in. When my translator called the owner, we heard his cellphone ring in the adjoining room. I peeked in and saw the boss scamper out the backdoor. 
 For American journalists, there's a tradition of showing up at a crime scene, or visiting a place that has made news. But in China, where press freedoms are weak, such visits can be dangerous.
 Last year, a young man working for a Chinese newspaper was beaten to death after he tried to meet the owners of an illegal coal mine. Local officials later insisted he was trying to extort money.
 My colleagues at The Times have been detained several times. And one of our Chinese research assistants is now serving a three-year prison term for fraud. He originally had been accused of passing state secrets to The Times, a charge this paper has denied.
 But life in China is generally much easier for business reporters like me. Usually, I'm welcomed at factories. State-owned companies often treat me like a visiting dignitary. I'm seated in a kind of royal chair next to the chairman. We drink tea and the chairman makes welcoming remarks while the company's official photographer snaps our picture.
 On the walls of many of the factories I visit are portraits of the powerful: Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao and others whose images signal to anyone visiting that a factory is ''connected'' and has the blessing of the Communist Party.
 But my toy factory visit made me wonder: who really holds the balance of the power in that relationship these days?
 Many experts have told me that one of the most serious problems in China is that the government lacks the power to control the nation's Wild West entrepreneurs, deal makers and connected factory owners.
 Bribery is rampant, and government corruption widespread. Just a few weeks ago, the top food and drug regulator was sentenced to death for taking huge bribes from pharmaceutical companies. But it's not clear that strong messages like that will stop the anarchy.
 ''China effectively has no oversight over anything,'' said Oded Shenkar, a business professor at Ohio State University and author of ''The Chinese Century: The Rising Chinese Economy and Its Impact on the Global Economy, the Balance of Power and Your Job.'' 
 ''People have this idea they are Big Brother and everyone is under watch,'' Mr. Shenkar said. ''But this is not China. In China, local authorities often turn a blind eye to problems because maybe they're invested in it.''
 Indeed, the impotence of local officials was clear to me from my visit to the RC2 Industrial Park in the city of Dongguan, which is thought to be the largest toy manufacturing center in the world.
 The private plant is the main supplier to the RC2 Corporation, an Illinois company. And the Hong Kong or Chinese entrepreneurs who run the facility seemed to hold great sway over the government.
 We had no problem entering the complex or looking around until we met ''Mr. Zhong,'' a rough-looking factory complex supervisor. He scolded us for entering the grounds and taking photographs, and then invited us to a small villa on the campus, a stylish house filled with luxurious rooms, black leather chairs, a giant-screen TV, a huge stock of Cuban cigars, even a massage parlor.
 This would be our prison. (Business correspondents are a more fortunate breed than war reporters.) Mr. Zhong offered an interview and a tour. But he later changed his mind and issued an ultimatum: hand over the pictures or we call the police.
 Confident we had signed in properly with the security guards, who had allowed us onto the campus, we opted for the police. After over an hour, the police failed to show up, and we tried to leave, only to be nearly tackled by the factory's ragtag army of security officers.
 My translator then called the police.
 The scene was farcical. We were locked inside the factory gate, surrounded by 16 security guards and 4 or 5 factory bosses. All trucks trying to bring supplies in or out of the complex were rerouted. Inside, large crowds of factory workers in blue uniforms were gawking. A crowd had also gathered outside the gates.
 The police arrived an hour later, listened to both sides and then stood around. More police officers came. And more police officers stood around. It was clear they had no power to intervene.
 So we called government officials, who suggested other government officials, who offered up more.
 Finally, after hours of waiting, a higher-level government official arrived to settle the dispute.
 He was a friendly man who admitted that he could not release us, that he didn't have the power. We should negotiate, he said. For the next five hours, he shuttled between rooms in the villa trying to negotiate a settlement. There were shouting matches. There were demands that pictures be turned over. 
 After hours of squabbling, Mr. Zhong demanded we write a confession saying we had trespassed. He settled for a few sentences explaining why I had come and that I had not asked his permission to take any pictures.
 The fight between government and factory during our detainment seemed to underscore the dysfunctional relationship the Chinese government has with industry. 
 In the endless back and forth, it was apparent that the government I often imagined as being all powerful and all seeing could be powerless and conflicted when it came to local businessmen and factory owners. 
 When we were released early Tuesday from a local police station, where we were sent to fill out a report, we noticed that while our translator was giving an account of the day to the police, the factory bosses were laughing and dining in another room, making the nexus of power in these parts and in this age ever more clear.

HEADLINE: The Inequality Conundrum

 BODY:
Roger Lowenstein's article was interesting and provocative because he writes about income inequality but avoids demonizing the market economy. 
However, his argument that it is irrelevant if those at the top income (like the baseball star Roger Clemens) are earning 100 times or 200 times what he earns is plain wrong. Continuing with his example, it is worth noting that Clemens works for an association that has a virtual monopoly on professional baseball and that a few dozen megacorporations and their major shareholders effectively control the viewing rights to ballgames, the teams, the stadiums, advertising space during games and most other major profit opportunities associated with it. In fact, it is arguably the nonmarket orientation (monopoly characteristics) of professional baseball that has sent players' earnings, team owners' profits and companies' market valuations (and dividends) into the stratosphere. Regular working people pay for all of this. 
 Another way in which extravagantly high earnings are relevant to the rest of us is this: In a capitalist economy, superrich athletes like Clemens have the means to bid up the prices of everything from the best doctors and lawyers to a good education and rental cottages on Cape Cod. And bid them up beyond affordability.

HEADLINE: Don't Count on Running Into the Neighbors

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW

 BODY:
THE gambrel-roofed Alstede's Country Market, set alongside rolling farmland on Morris County Route 513 in Chester Township, is more reminiscent of a toy barn than a working farm building. Kurt Alstede, who grows 200 crops on the 500 acres he farms here, ascribes his success to ''parents and grandparents who want to give children the experience of picking their own fruits and vegetables.'' 
 ''Few places in this country could support our business, which survives by combining fresh produce and agritourism,'' he said. 
 One big attraction for those agritourists is the bucolic landscape, which Chester Township is clearly committed to preserving. A ''doughnut'' municipality surrounding the more urban 1.45-square-mile Chester Borough, the township has 2,400 houses served by private septic systems and wells, which require building lots of two to five acres. There is no municipal lighting -- little to remind a passer-by of the proximity of urban life. 
 Cindy Kennington, who with her husband, John, bought a five-acre horse farm on State Park Road two years ago, says she has fallen in love with the serenity. ''Living without sidewalks and streetlights makes it very quiet and brings you a lot of peace,'' she said.
 Of the township's 29.8 square miles, 42 percent, or about 12 square miles, is permanently protected from development. There are nature reserves and parkland, but also agricultural property that is deed restricted under the state Farmland Preservation Program, which buys the development rights while allowing the farmer to retain title and continue working the land. 
 Eighty-four percent of the township lies in the New Jersey Highlands, an environmentally sensitive area that supplies drinking water to two-thirds of the state's residents. Three years ago, the state passed the Highlands Preservation Act, which limits development on the most sensitive Highlands areas, some of which are in Chester, to one house per 20 acres.
 ''Two years ago, 27 new homes were built,'' Mayor William Cogger said. ''Last year, there were just 16 new homes.'' 
 Last month, Mr. Cogger was elected to succeed Mayor Benjamin L. Spinelli, who in nine years gained a reputation for accumulating open space and was named director general of the state Office of Smart Growth. Before leaving office, Mr. Spinelli approved the township's purchase of 45 acres on Parker Road, near the municipal building, from a local developer.
 The $2.5 million acquisition, financed by an 80 percent grant from Morris County and $500,000 from local open space funds raised through a tax of 2 cents per $100 of assessed real estate valuation, will be turned into ball fields, Mr. Cogger said.
 ''The developer would have put 17 homes on the land, and each of those households would have had two school-aged children,'' he said. ''In just two years, we save our half-million on schooling costs alone.''
 One subdivision being developed is the 27-home Brittny Estates on the Old Chester-Gladstone Road. ''I think that will be the last major subdivision in Chester,'' said Barry G. Salmon, a builder and owner of Salmon Realtors on Route 24 in Chester.
 What You'll Find
 There are fewer than a dozen businesses in the township, including a Quick Check, a couple of small restaurants, a gas station, a few farm markets like Mr. Alstede's, and the Chester Antique Mall (on Morris County Route 510), owned by Mayor Cogger. 
 Most residents shop in the borough, which has a ShopRite supermarket and a new mall called the Streets of Chester. Main Street in the borough is a mix of strip malls and quaint craft stores, restaurants and specialty shops like the Taylor's Ice Cream Parlor or the Black River Candy Shoppe.
 The township is horse-friendly, which is what attracted the Kenningtons. They paid ''just below a million'' for their property, with a three-bedroom, two-bath Cape Cod-style house, and have just finished installing post-and-rail fencing to prevent their pony and horse from wandering onto the road. Last May, Kaela, the eldest of their three daughters, and her show pony Uptown Girl won 15th place in the United States Equestrian Federation Large Pony Finals in Lexington, Ky. 
 Like many other newer residents, Mr. Kennington works as an executive in New Jersey. His employer is based in Somerset, a 25-mile westward drive. Mrs. Kennington, a former telephone company executive, hopes to turn the farm into a business raising horses. Township zoning allows one horse per unimproved acre, meaning that the Kenningtons could keep three horses on their property, after the two-acre standard building lot is subtracted from their total acreage. 
 Owing to the open space, many of the roads in the area cut through dense forests of maple, poplar, ash and hemlock trees. Everyone seems to have a story about a deer that ran into a car. Muskrats, turkey, pheasant, mink, foxes, herons, coyotes, bear and endangered bog turtles are often sighted along side streets. 
 ''The residents ask us not to fix these streets to preserve their privacy,'' Mr. Cogger said, noting that the actor James Gandolfini, of ''The Sopranos,'' lived down one of the township's bumpy lanes not long ago.
 What You'll Pay
 At the beginning of June, 98 houses were on the market, said Kenneth Caro, a former mayor who is a sales associate at Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in the borough. Prices range from $349,000 for a two-bedroom, one-bath house on 1.9 acres to $3.425 million for a sprawling 15-room colonial on 3.5 acres with five bedrooms, four full baths, two half baths and a view over the lush Somerset Hills. The median price for a single-family home, according to Mr. Caro, is about $800,000. Annual taxes on the median are about $12,000.
 Because smaller, older homes near the roads are interspersed with new 5,000-plus-square-foot brick- or stone-fronted houses set back more than 200 feet, and because nearly all of the new construction is custom, Mr. Caro says it is difficult to generalize about prices.
 But houses on the southern and eastern sides of town, bordering the wealthy communities of Mendham Township, Peapack-Gladstone and Bedminster, seem to command about 10 percent more than similar homes elsewhere in the township.
 What to Do
 ''You can walk the 14-mile length of Chester Township, from Roxbury Township in the north, down to Bedminster in the south, and not leave public parkland,'' Mayor Cogger said recently. The largest park is the 3,020-acre state-owned Black River Wildlife Management Area, where the river slices through hemlock gorges, providing a sun-dappled setting for canoeing, hunting, kayaking and cross-country skiing. There is also hiking along the abandoned bed of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad track, now part of Patriot's Path, a 45-mile Morris County hiking trail. 
 The Black River feeds into the 890-acre Hacklebarney State Park, one of the richest trout-fishing areas in New Jersey. (The Chester Township historian, Leonard Taylor, says that according to local lore, the name may stem from the heckling suffered by a quick-tempered foreman at one of the many 19th-century iron mines -- a man named Barney Tracey.) 
 Among the other state parks are the 1826 Cooper Mill, the oldest working grist mill in Morris County, and the 100-acre Bamboo Brook Outdoor Education Center, including gardens developed by the early-20th-century landscape architect Martha Brooks Hutcheson.
 Of the eight municipal parks, the 85-acre Chubb Park on Route 24 west of Route 206 is the most widely used. It has nine ball fields, a pair of tennis courts, a sledding hill, a skating pond and event show grounds. 
 The Schools
 Chester Township shares its 1,385-student kindergarten-through-Grade-8 system with Chester Borough. It has three schools: Dickerson Elementary School, for kindergarten through Grade 2; Bragg Intermediate School, for Grades 3 through 5; and Black River Middle School, which runs Grade 6 through Grade 8.
 Last year, the district spent an average of $12,735 per student; statewide, the figure was $11,641. The average class size is 18.5, versus 19.2 for the state. On the 2006 Grade Eight Proficiency Assessment tests, 90 percent of Black River students were proficient or advanced in math, compared with 64 percent statewide. In language, 94 percent were proficient, versus 74 percent statewide.
 From Black River Middle School, students go on to West Morris Mendham High School in nearby Mendham Borough, which has an enrollment of about 1,200. It is one of two schools in the West Morris Regional High School District.
 On the 2006 SATs, West Morris Mendham students averaged 569 on the math, 564 on the verbal and 566 on the essay portion, versus 516, 494 and 493 statewide. The school offers 18 Advanced Placement courses, in history, design, languages, sciences, psychology, music, math, government, English and economics. Of last year's graduating class, school officials say, 85 percent went on to four-year colleges and 10 percent to two-year colleges. 
 The Commute
 The quickest way to get to Midtown Manhattan is via the New Jersey Transit train from the Peapack station to Pennsylvania Station. The rush-hour commute takes 90 minutes, with a change at either Newark Broad Street or Summit. The fare is $11.75 one way.
 The History
 At the intersection of two Lenape Indian trails, Chester was first settled by Europeans in the early 18th century. According to a local history, deeds date to 1713, but the first settlers were the Rogerenes, a Quaker offshoot that arrived in 1730.
 Over the next century and a half, the area became known for agricultural products like flax, wool, cattle and applejack.
 In 1875, the discovery of iron sparked a 15-year boom, with the development of 35 mines and a blast furnace. It ended when more easily accessible iron deposits were discovered in Minnesota.
 For most of the 20th century, Chester remained a farming community, just far enough west of New York City to be bypassed by the housing booms that brought huge condominium subdivisions to nearby towns. 
 Going Forward
 Because so much of the township is protected open space, a century from now Chester could very well look and feel as it does today: a bedroom community of large houses on estate-sized properties, coexisting with a farming industry focused on the local market.

HEADLINE: Taming the Runaway Wedding Planner

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI and JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

 BODY:
SAYING ''I do'' to a wedding planner can be the second most important vow a newly engaged couple makes. 
 With people marrying later, more women working and weddings growing ever splashier, many couples are hiring planners to help sort through the dizzying choices concerning the location, invitations, flowers, photographers, color schemes, D.J.'s, bands, lighting, place cards, centerpieces, cakes and fog machines, to name a dozen. 
 But as the wedding planning field expands, some couples are finding that planners, like a broken engagement, can cause heartache. 
 David Mandel of Los Angeles, an executive producer of the HBO program ''Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' and his bride, Dr. Rebecca Whitney, hired and dismissed two consultants because they were ''planzillas.'' 
 ''It was like we had this mutual enemy -- our wedding planner,'' Mr. Mandel recalled. ''We were not sleeping well. It was beyond miserable.'' 
 The first, who Mr. Mandel said was ''very well known in Los Angeles,'' dropped out of sight for a month after the first meeting with the couple. The second tried to steer them to a hotel in Palm Springs with which she frequently did business. 
 The proposed wedding approached $1 million, ''hundreds of thousands of dollars more than we originally thought,'' Mr. Mandel said. ''She was getting 20 percent of whatever our wedding was going to cost, so she was negotiating in her best interest, not ours.'' 
 Finally, Mr. Mandel and his bride, a pediatrician, found a third planner they liked. They were happily wed last New Year's Eve in New York, at Cipriani 42nd Street.
 The couple's experience was not all that rare, as even some wedding planners acknowledge. 
 ''I've been doing this my whole life, long enough to know that some of us in this business are a little full of ourselves,'' said Marcy Blum, a New York planner who got in on the ground floor of the field in 1986, when the number of planners nationwide was fewer than a thousand. 
 ''In fact,'' she said, ''a lot of wedding planners are entering the field with no training, so buyer beware.''
 The average cost of a wedding is now $27,852, Conde Nast Bridal Media says. Typically, the planner -- there are about 10,000 in the United States, according to Gerard J. Monaghan, a founder of the Association of Bridal Consultants -- receives about 20 percent of the total. Others charge a flat fee, from several hundred dollars to as much as $100,000.
 Selecting a planner, or as they often prefer to be called, a wedding coordinator, can be tricky, especially if just what she or he can bring to the banquet table is not spelled out.
 ''A couple should sit down with a planner before hiring that person and ask a lot of questions,'' said Leslie Price, an owner of In Any Event in New York. ''Both sides need to fully understand each other's expectations.''
 Many couples use planners because they want to avoid the headache of directing an event that can quickly metamorphose into something along the lines of a major awards show. 
 Jacqueline C. Gordon, a homemaker in Derwood, Md., grew tired of the ''checking and re-checking'' of ''every little thing'' when her first daughter married. So, for her second daughter's wedding, she hired a planner, and, as a result, she said, ''I basically showed up.''
 But the experience of Jennifer Rudin and Glen Pearson was far different. ''We just didn't connect with our planner on any level,'' said the bride, the director of casting and talent development at Disney Theatrical Productions in New York.
 The couple, who were married in September 2005 at the Ritz-Carlton, Huntington Hotel and Spa in Pasadena, Calif., said the hotel required a planner, and recommended one. The couple say they sat with her in a bar at the hotel and flicked through photos of other people's weddings, while she pitched themes (Hawaiian? Italian?), colored margaritas and her brother, the fantastic wedding photographer.
 ''It was always about her,'' Ms. Rudin Pearson said, ''never about us.'' In the end they dropped that planner and chose one of their own. 
 Jill Hilts, the director of catering sales at the Ritz, said that she ''is not aware of anybody who has ever had a complaint'' about a planner on its recommended list. She said that the Ritz is vast, with 23 acres of gardens where weddings take place, and therefore, she said: ''It is not possible for one individual to properly service a wedding here. It takes a team of professionals to assist one of our coordinators.''
 Wedding experts say that planners are playing an increasingly large role in the marital-industrial complex.
 ''The idea of wedding planning has really existed for over 100 years,'' said Maria McBride, the wedding style director for Brides magazine. ''Affluent families always hired a social director to plan all of their affairs.
 ''We saw the wedding planner trend emerge again in the 1980s when the stock market and economy were soaring. By 1992, the wedding planner had exploded into its own niche business.'' 
 Wedding planners say that their clients are vulnerable. They are often starry-eyed, eager to impress, young and clueless about the business.
 That is why, industry experts say, couples need to enlist the help of planners who work for a flat fee and excel in negotiating contracts with event spaces of the couple's own choosing. Antonia van der Meer, the editor in chief of Modern Bride magazine, said, ''Good planners should pay for themselves.''
 Laura Chavis, a planner in New York, said she deals with the managers of 50 wedding sites across the metropolitan area, including castles, lofts, bars and country clubs.
 She passes all discounts to her clients, she said, and never accepts a finder's fee. But not all planners work like that.
 Mr. Monaghan of the consultants association, a trade group with 3,800 members (up from one in 1981) based in New Milford, Conn., said his organization ejected a woman a few years ago for taking kickbacks from a limousine driver.
 ''That's a no-no,'' he said.
 One wedding trend is enlisting the help of a ''day-of''' planner, which costs much less than a full-scale coordinator, usually a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. The couple makes all the arrangements and then deputizes the planner to run everything on the actual wedding day, like checking traffic reports, alphabetizing escort cards and making sure the band doesn't play ''Louie, Louie,'' or at least not too loudly.
 BUSINESSES like Wedding One are another option. It is a one-stop wedding shop that opened in Flushing, Queens, 12 years ago, mostly serving Korean-American couples. Wedding One has a dress shop, beauty salon, floral studio, photo studio and consultants who can book D.J.'s, videographers and just about anything else. Branches now operate in SoHo, Fort Lee, N.J., and Los Angeles.
 ''My needs were pretty simple and everything was in one place,'' said Dina Lim, a child psychiatrist in San Diego who married with the help of Wedding One in June 2005 in Central Park. ''I didn't want to complicate things with a planner.''
 Neither did David Mandel.
 ''Weddings are a stressful enough time,'' he said. ''So my advice to people getting married is to find a planner who wants to put together your wedding, not theirs.''

HEADLINE: In Tacoma, Recreating Public Housing

BYLINE: By LINDA BAKER

 BODY:
WHEN Wendy and Michael Dinon decided to buy their first home, they focused on new construction near downtown Tacoma, Wash., where Mr. Dinon works as an index analyst for the Russell Investment Group. Last October, the couple, who have a 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Milly, found what they were looking for: an affordable three-bedroom house in the Salishan neighborhood, two miles east of downtown.
 ''Price is what drew us,'' said Ms. Dinon, whose 1,700-square-foot house cost $226,000, the market rate for Salishan but about 20 percent less than comparable properties in other neighborhoods. Her husband's 10-minute commute was also a factor. But Ms. Dinon said they also liked Salishan's diverse population, which includes Cambodian, Vietnamese and Russian immigrants. ''Had we purchased regular tract housing, there wouldn't be such a sense of community,'' she said. ''There is so much knowledge to be gained from all the different people here.'' 
 Until a few years ago, Salishan presented a different image. Its previous incarnation, as a public housing project, 855 barrack-style homes built in the 1940s, was notorious for its high crime rate. Then, in 2004, the Tacoma Housing Authority began to demolish the project and move its 3,000 tenants to other public housing or subsidized rental units. 
 The new Salishan is a Hope VI development, a program of the Department of Housing and Urban Development that converts distressed public housing into mixed-income communities. The developments continue to serve poor residents but also provide market-rate homes for sale.
 Late last year, the first phase of the Hope VI neighborhood opened to new as well as former residents -- 30 percent of whom have so far decided to return. 
 Phase 1 consists of 90 market-rate houses, 40 below-market-rate houses for sale to buyers with incomes less than 60 percent of $49,584, the city's median, and about 300 subsidized rental units -- town houses and apartments in multifamily buildings. 
 When the 188-acre development is completed in 2009, it will have about 250 market-rate houses, 100 below-market-rate houses and 815 subsidized rentals. Financing for the project includes a $35 million federal Hope VI grant, $9 million from the Washington State Housing Trust Fund, and about $60 million in private funds generated from the sale of low-income tax credits.
 Salishan recently won a housing award from the American Institute of Architects and a neighborhood design award from the Congress for the New Urbanism. Its New Urbanist-style neighborhood includes single-family houses and Craftsman-style town homes, with porches, that sit amid pocket parks and playgrounds. Michael Mirra, the executive director of the Tacoma Housing Authority, said that the multifaceted community has raised local property values, has catalyzed new development and is ''building large scale equity'' in the city of Tacoma.
 Salishan also embodies the aspirations of a city that has historically languished in the shadow of Seattle, 36 miles to the north. Situated on Puget Sound, Tacoma (population 200,000) has a reputation as a gritty metropolis. It was an image perpetuated by industrial pollution in Commencement Bay and a string of high-profile crimes, including a murder-suicide committed by the city's police chief in 2003. 
 ''Tacoma does have that stigma,'' said Beau Towne, a local real estate agent. But, Mr. Towne said, the city is undergoing a renaissance. He cited the expansion of the University of Washington's local campus; a thriving artists' colony that is linked to the Museum of Glass; and the proliferation of mixed-use developments along the Foss Waterway downtown. 
 ''Tacoma is a regional city,'' Mr. Mirra said. ''We count Salishan as part of our effort to provide high-quality affordable housing for families with children.'' The median housing price in Tacoma is $274,000. In Seattle, it is $430,000.
 Like Tacoma itself, the old Salishan was famous more for its seediness than its assets. In 1990, there were 331 violent crimes reported there. ''It was a nightmare,'' Mr. Towne said. ''You just didn't go there.''
 But the former reputation did not keep the new buyers away. Salishan's market-rate homes sold out on release, according to the builder, Quadrant Homes. About half of the 40 below-market-rate homes -- priced at $130,000 to $219,000 -- were sold to families who had lived in the old public housing project. Quadrant sold some of the below-market-rate homes on a first-come, first-serve basis. The Tacoma Housing Authority also sold some and gave priority to residents living in subsidized housing, who were put in a lottery.
 Kristen Pleasant, a preschool teacher who grew up in Tacoma, said that when she told her parents about buying a house in the neighborhood, her mother responded: '' 'Salishan? What? You're not going there with all those shootings.' '' 
 Today, the community should be recognized for its ubiquitous barbecues, said Ms. Pleasant, who with her husband, Sabian, bought a market-rate three-bedroom home for $202,000. ''When friends come over, they say: 'You know what? This is a really nice place.' '' 
 Susan Boyer, a teacher who with her husband, Justin, an aircraft technician at the McChord Air Force Base, bought a 2,000-square-foot market-rate home for $228,000, said that ''revitalizing a community was an added perk.''
 Ms. Boyer is one of four homeowners and two renters on the Salishan Development Committee, a neighborhood outreach group. The committee recently organized a youth forum to discuss the need for teen spaces like skate parks.
 Residents have filed 32 complaints with the police in the last month; most have been about graffiti and abandoned vehicles, according to Kim Murillo, a community relations coordinator for the authority. But no violent crimes have been reported, she said. 
 Salishan is designed to promote inclusiveness, said Thomas Gallas, the president of Torti Gallas & Partners, the architecture firm that developed the neighborhood master plan. ''We wanted to weave the homeownership with the rental community,'' he said, ''to create an inextricable relationship between people that rent and people that own.'' 
 Many of the homes and rentals face one another on the same block. They also front on shared green spaces. Neatly mowed front lawns, maintained by a single landscaping company, enhance the visual continuity between public housing units and owner-occupied homes. A wildlife gulch divides Phase 1 and Phase 2, and a ''Salishan Shine'' community group is planning a pedestrian bridge through a tree canopy.
 On a recent Monday afternoon, an elderly Cambodian man tended to his vegetable garden, while another man sat in a car listening to a Russian radio station. Dozens of young children rode bikes and pulled one another in wagons. A group of African-American and Russian-American teens played Hacky Sack. 
 The nearby neighborhood is also changing. Three housing developments are under construction in East Tacoma, where Salishan is situated. A 1,900-square-foot house in one, the Applewood development, is selling for $299,000.
 Nationwide, 65 Hope VI developments have been completed since the program's inception in 1993. Susan Popkin, a principal research associate at the Washington-based Urban Institute who has written several reports on Hope VI, said that the projects have generally improved living conditions for residents, revitalized blighted neighborhoods and attracted development. ''They are remarkably successful,'' she said.
 But Elizabeth Brusco, a professor of anthropology at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, who is one of several researchers evaluating the project, said that the goals and values of Salishan's new middle-class residents may disrupt the original tenants' support networks and sense of community.
 Ms. Dinon said there is tension between the homeowners and renters, whose interests do not always coincide. And language barriers can complicate efforts to produce newsletters and hold neighborhood meetings. ''Interpreters are really expensive,'' she said. 
 Still, many residents say they are lucky to live in a safe and affordable neighborhood in a gentrifying city. ''Now people come from outside who used to live in better neighborhoods,'' said Nadia Smirnova, who lived in the old Salishan for 12 years before buying a below-market-rate home in November. ''They like to keep it quiet. It's a good difference.''

HEADLINE: A Rocky Start For British REITs

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
AFTER much fanfare, legislation creating real estate investment trusts in Britain, one of Europe's biggest property markets, took effect on Jan. 1. Almost immediately, nine of the country's largest real estate companies converted to REITs, while five others made the switch soon after and a handful more plan to follow suit by year-end. 
 In the months leading up to the big debut, expectations ran high, with the hope that Britain's already-strong commercial real estate industry would further flourish. A REIT market, after all, could attract more investors globally and make it easier for the local companies to raise capital. (The corporate structure gives real estate investment trusts favorable tax treatment in exchange for disbursing most of their income to shareholders as dividends.)
 But all of that enthusiasm has since turned into disappointment. British REITs are among the worst-performing real estate investments so far this year, according to industry analysts, with sinking share prices and dividends that are comparatively lower than those of their global peers. 
 ''Here's a U.K. REIT that says, 'Buy me, I yield 2.5 percent,' '' said Jeremy M. Anagnos, the co-chief investment officer of CB Richard Ellis Global Real Estate Securities. ''But here you have a very astute property investment base, and they know what they could get elsewhere.'' 
 The average dividend yield on REITs worldwide, in fact, is roughly 4 percent, versus around 2.5 percent for British REITs, according to Mr. Anagnos. In the United States, the dividend yield is around 4.3 percent, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. 
 Although some money managers are steering clear of the nascent British market for now, others say they are finding value in some of its shares. Many REITs now trade on the London Stock Exchange at deep discounts -- from 5 to nearly 15 percent below net asset value, according to Eric N. Roseman, the president of ENR Asset Management in Montreal -- perhaps making some of them ripe for takeovers. By contrast, most REITs globally tend to trade at a premium relative to the value of the properties they own, Mr. Roseman said.
 During a visit to New York City early this month for REIT Week, an annual conference sponsored by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Liz Peace, the chief executive of the British Property Federation, urged investors in the United States and elsewhere to be patient. 
 ''The message,'' she said, ''is this: Don't write off the British market; we've only been around for a few months.'' 
 In recent years, Britain's overall commercial real estate market has had a solid track record, with shares of real estate companies returning 33 percent, annualized, in the three years through 2006, and 48 percent last year alone, according to Ms. Peace, who attended the conference with a contingent of British REIT executives. 
 The president and chief executive of the American REIT association, Steven A. Wechsler, said that ''to a large extent the market there had already factored in the conversion to REITs,'' and he offered his own support. ''I don't think there is anything particularly important in terms of what happens in the first few months,'' he said. ''REITs are a long-term investment.''
 Some managers of mutual funds -- through which average investors in the United States can gain exposure to global property markets -- say they think that it may take a while for Britain's REIT market to gain its bearing, as it has for recently established REIT markets elsewhere. 
 ''A few years ago, they never even heard of the 'REIT' term,'' Mr. Anagnos said. Now, more than two dozen countries worldwide have public REIT markets or legislation in place or under consideration to create them.
 ''France has had four modifications of the REIT model in the last five or seven years,'' said Samuel A. Lieber, the manager of the Alpine International Real Estate Equity fund, which has 11 percent of its holdings in British property companies. 
 In Britain, Mr. Lieber said, ''it will take five years or more for companies to rebalance and orient themselves toward cash-flow generation as opposed to net asset value growth.'' 
 It is that focus on asset growth, he and others have said, that is partly responsible for the low dividends. ''British companies historically have not been focused on cash flow,'' Mr. Lieber said. ''REITs in general are excellent distributors of real estate cash flow.''
 The British market has also been adversely affected by higher interest rates, Mr. Roseman said. He noted that last month, the Bank of England again raised its base rate, to 5.5 percent, to help keep inflation in check. ''You don't want to buy anything that's interest-rate sensitive,'' he said.
 But Mr. Roseman said, ''there probably are some cherry-picking opportunities'' amid the British correction, and others agreed.
 Even though REIT share prices are down around 14 percent, on average, from the beginning of the year through the middle of last week, ''the underlying real estate fundamentals are very solid,'' said Scott Crowe, the global strategist and a manager of Cohen & Steers' global and international real estate portfolios, which have about 20 percent of their holdings in British properties. 
 At Brixton, a British REIT specializing in industrial and warehouse space, ''the demand is strong,'' said Tim Wheeler, its chief executive, who attended the REIT convention in New York. He notes that 30 percent of his country's tenants are American companies.
 Also at the convention was Harry Hyman, the managing director of the Primary Health Properties, another British REIT. ''We've seen a massive rental growth in London,'' he said. ''I don't have any vacancies in my portfolios.'' 
 Mr. Anagnos agreed that the British commercial market was essentially healthy, with rental growth and higher occupancy rates, though he expressed concern about the impact that new developments might have, particularly in London. ''There is a supply pipeline looming on the market,'' he said, with big developments due for completion by 2010. 
 Many money managers are bullish about the office markets in the West End of London, where, they say, space is especially limited. 
 Mr. Wheeler says that this is one area where Brixton has focused, and that new developments from his company are expected to come on line within the next 18 months. 
 Among the other companies with exposure to the West End of London, according to Mr. Anagnos, are Great Portland Estates and the Land Securities Group, both REITs, and Derwent London, which is expected to convert to REIT status this summer.
 ''We really like that company,'' Mr. Crowe said of Derwent. ''It's trading at a 20 percent discount.''
 American investors, who can also buy shares of individual British REITs directly through their brokers, can learn more about the companies at the Web sites of the British Property Federation (www.bpf.org.uk/) and of the London-based organization Reita (www.reita.org).
 Most of the interest so far has come from large institutional investors, though that could gradually change as the market becomes more established.
 ''What's most appealing is that this is a specialization, a niche,'' Mr. Wheeler said. ''You don't have to go to Europe or America to grow the business.''

HEADLINE: How Bernanke Made Them Believe

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 ALMOST nobody said it publicly, but when Ben S. Bernanke took over as chairman of the Federal Reserve a little more than one year ago, there was an undercurrent of speculation that he might be a little green.
 Unlike his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke had spent almost all his adult life as an academic economist at Princeton. Except for two years as a Fed governor, and a year as a top academic adviser to President Bush, he had never had to make economic forecasts or to set policy with real money on the line. And even then, most of the real power was in Mr. Greenspan's hands.
 Mr. Bernanke also seemed detached. He thrived on econometric models. He was skeptical about relying on individual intuition and discretion, both hallmarks of Mr. Greenspan. And less than three months into the job, Mr. Bernanke looked naive when he set off a market frenzy by chatting informally with Maria Bartiromo of CNBC and telling her that the markets had misread the Fed's intentions. 
 Could an Ivy League academic like this ever have Street credibility? But as Mr. Bernanke meets with Fed policy makers this week to set interest rates, the answer is clear: yes, yes and yes again.
 If anybody has had to learn on the job, it has been Fed watchers and investors rather than Mr. Bernanke. 
 The news out of the Fed's meeting on Thursday will not be that it kept the overnight Federal funds rate at 5.25 percent. Investors have assumed that for weeks now, just as they assume that the Fed will reiterate that inflation is a bigger risk than slower growth.
 The real news is that financial markets now accept the Fed's view of the economy and are no longer betting against it. 
 That is a significant change. In May 2006, bond investors were convinced that inflation was not going to slow the way Mr. Bernanke thought. But since then, measures of core inflation, which exclude the volatile ups and downs of food and energy, have been edging back down to the top of the Fed's unofficial target of 2 percent a year.
 In February, when economic growth had weakened, many investors became convinced that a serious slowdown was at hand and that the Federal Reserve would feel compelled to reduce interest rates by June.
 Few believe that anymore. The evidence suggests that economic growth in the second quarter this year could hit an annual pace of 3 percent. Despite the protracted plunge in housing and the exploding problems of subprime mortgage lenders, the economy still looks poised to bump along only slightly below its long-term trend rate of about 3 percent a year. 
 Put another way, the economy today is pretty much exactly where Mr. Bernanke hoped it would be one year ago. Economic growth has slowed slightly, gradually reducing inflationary pressures. And while job creation has slowed, unemployment remains low, at 4.5 percent.
 Brian Sack, a senior economist in Washington at Macroeconomic Advisers, said one of Mr. Bernanke's most-criticized moves now appears to have been providential.
 In April 2006, Mr. Bernanke kicked off a bond market sell-off by telling a Congressional hearing that the Fed might pause in its campaign to raise rates even if the risks of inflation and slower growth ''are not entirely balanced.''
 Investors took that as a sign that Mr. Bernanke was soft on inflation, because consumer prices were ticking up noticeably at the time. 
 As it happened, the Fed kept raising rates through June. Stopping even then seemed a bit early, because inflation was running above the Fed's comfort level. But the Fed was betting that the impact of previous rate increases, combined with the slowdown in housing, would complete much of the remaining work without the need for higher rates.
 That bet proved to be correct.
 ''In hindsight, it was a masterful move,'' Mr. Sack said. ''It allowed the economy to weather a massive downturn in housing without a broader slowdown.''
 Perhaps more revealing, Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials never wavered when confronted with the inevitable noise of contrary economic indicators. Steadiness is no virtue if the course turns out to be wrong. But the Fed's steadiness under Mr. Bernanke has thus far been largely validated by events in the real world.
 To be sure, the ''soft landing'' did not come about in the way Mr. Bernanke and the Fed's own forecasters had expected. He predicted in early 2006 that housing would experience a ''gradual cooling'' that would probably not last terribly long.
 What actually occurred was a severe plunge in home building, a ballooning inventory of unsold houses and an implosion in the market for subprime mortgages for people with weak credit. 
 The other surprise was that unemployment remained lower than the Fed had expected. The central bank's forecast last year anticipated that unemployment would hover from 4.75 percent to 5 percent in both 2006 and 2007. Instead, it has averaged about 4.5 percent since September. 
 Neither of those surprises has derailed the Fed's game plan so far, but they still could. The Fed is far from infallible, and policy makers are ultimately making educated guesses. 
 If the housing downturn endures or becomes worse, it could have ripple effects on nonresidential investment and consumer spending. On the other hand, low unemployment could drive up wages faster than productivity and rekindle inflation pressures. 
 BUT for the moment, financial markets have stopped second-guessing the Fed's outlook. The federal funds futures market now indicates that investors are not expecting the Fed to cut rates this year. That is consistent with what Fed officials have been implying for quite a long time now.
 ''The markets have repriced to an economic and monetary policy outlook that is very much aligned with the Fed's thinking,'' said Richard Berner, North American economist at Morgan Stanley. 
 It is always possible that both the Fed and the markets are wrong; agreement is not the same thing as being right. But if nothing else, it suggests that Mr. Bernanke has attained his Street credibility.

HEADLINE: Crossing the Gold Line

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
IF Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan to charge motorists to drive below 86th Street in Manhattan is approved, it may do more than simply reduce traffic, noise and pollution in the Manhattan business districts. Brokers say that it could add an extra sense of exclusivity to what is already some of the most expensive residential real estate in the country.
 ''Reduced congestion could be a selling point,'' said Sharon E. Baum, a broker at the Corcoran Group, who has sold hundreds of co-ops, condominiums and town houses, mostly on the Upper East Side and Upper West Side. ''It could make a high-rent district an even higher-rent district.'' 
 Mayor Bloomberg's plan for what he calls ''congestion pricing'' would impose fees of up to $8 a day for cars and $21 a day for trucks driving below 86th Street between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on weekdays. 
 But the boundary for the plan was set not at the northernmost edge of Midtown Manhattan, but more than a mile to the north, at 86th Street. It lassoed in hundreds of residential buildings where some of the most affluent New Yorkers live, including Mr. Bloomberg, whose own town house is on East 79th Street and who bought a building for his charitable foundation last fall for $45 million on East 78th Street and Madison Avenue.
 The boundary excludes the less affluent but rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods to the north, where residents are worried about an influx of idling trucks and out-of-towners cruising for parking spaces to beat the toll. 
 The mayor's office said the boundary was set to make the plan work better, but was not strictly based on a scientific study. Rohit T. Aggarwala, the director of the city's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, said the idea was to reduce traffic tie-ups that often extend north of the Midtown business district and to make it harder for motorists to drive to Manhattan and then park and take the subway.
 Yet the effect of the change -- what might be called the gold-lining of these neighborhoods -- might be more than just the sum of its parts. The very idea of living in a residential neighborhood where other people have to pay to enter may have a powerful symbolic value over time. 
 ''A halo effect?'' asked Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm. ''I think there might be one in the long term.''
 According to figures compiled by Mr. Miller, the average two-bedroom apartment sold for $1.55 million on the Upper East Side during the first quarter of 2007, while the average three-bedroom on the Upper West Side sold for $3.9 million. The Upper East Side is home to the highest co-op and town house prices in New York.
 Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, was skeptical that the boundary of a toll area could make a difference. After all, he said, a toll is a toll.
 But Ms. Baum has come to believe that government-defined boundaries can make a difference in status and self-esteem. The Postal Service is in the process of dividing the long-cherished Upper East Side ZIP code 10021 into three ZIP codes, and she lives on the wrong side of a new boundary on Park Avenue.
 In any event, much of the real estate industry emphatically supports the mayor's plan. Frank Marino, a spokesman for the Real Estate Board of New York, which represents major commercial and residential building owners and developers, said the board spent an amount in the ''six figures'' to broadcast advertisements supporting the proposal.
 City officials said computer simulations suggest that the streets north of 86th Street will not be inundated with traffic. This study may be of some comfort to Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, who lives on West 91st Street, just outside the proposed congestion pricing zone.
 Going for a PG Rating
 DOES sex no longer sell New Yorkers on real estate? That is the question one might ask at the William Beaver House, a condominium under construction at 15 William Street, on the corner of Beaver Street in Lower Manhattan, that has been using images of scantily clad women in its promotional materials and spoke of a shower ''big enough for three.''
 The sexy marketing campaign appeared to catch on with foreign buyers much more than with jaded New Yorkers. So the developers of the 320-unit condominium are softening their approach and have now dropped the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, the lead marketing firm, after they said the firm had failed to attract enough buyers from in and around New York. 
 Instead, the developers expanded the role of Prodigy International Network, a marketing company based in Miami, which was initially hired to promote sales in South America and in Europe. For Prodigy, however, it appears that the racy approach worked abroad; the company has brought in most of the buyers to date.
 ''We find they are positioning it to the kind of sophisticated cosmopolitan buyer we had in mind,'' said Andre Balazs, the well-known hotelier, who was brought in by the developers -- S. Lawrence Davis and Alex Sapir -- to help create a stylish image for the building. 
 Mr. Balazs said that since sales began in January, about 35 percent of the building had been sold, with an average sale price of around $1,380 a square foot, a level that is higher than most sales in other downtown condos, which are mainly conversions of older office buildings. He said Corcoran was dropped because Prodigy had 80 percent of the sales to date, in total contract value.
 Another New York company, the Core Marketing Group, headed by Shaun Osher, has been brought in to represent the building as well, he said. 
 James Lansill, a senior managing director of Corcoran Sunshine Marketing, declined to discuss the details of the marketing campaign. ''We have mutually decided to part ways,'' he said. ''We believe that we helped them create a wonderful product and wish them the best of luck in selling the remainder of the building.''
 Mr. Balazs said the campaign was being recalibrated. And as the downtown condo market has matured, attracting more families, Mr. Balazs said, finishes in kitchens and bathrooms are being upgraded to strengthen the appeal to a broader range of buyers.
 Luxury Market Heats Up
 AS the march of the hedge fund millionaires continues through the Manhattan luxury real estate market, prices remain strong, brokers say, and are likely to show an increase in the second quarter, when quarterly sales reports are released in early July.
 A preliminary tabulation of sales filed with the city's Department of Finance during the last few months shows that both co-op and condominium prices are rising, with condo prices moving up faster than co-ops, as apartments at some expensive condominiums close and are reported in the public records.
 In the last few months, 14 condominiums at 40 Mercer Street, a new SoHo condominium designed by Jean Nouvel, and developed by Andre Balazs, closed for more than $4 million, the records show. The highest was $12.5 million, a sale to Christopher Rokos, a London-based hedge fund manager.
 Of course, there are also non-hedge fund buyers in this luxury market. Dr. Paul A. Marks, the former president of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, paid $6.1 million for a co-op at 825 Fifth Avenue at 64th Street. And Robert C. Lieber, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, paid $7.25 million for a 2,100-square-foot apartment on the 39th floor of 1 Central Park West, the Trump International Hotel and Tower.
 Mr. Lieber also owns a slightly smaller apartment one floor up, as well as a house in Scarsdale, but he said he was looking to upgrade, not combine units. His apartment on the 40th floor, which was listed for saleat $4.5 million, is now under contract.

HEADLINE: Don't Privatize Our Spies

BYLINE: By PATRICK RADDEN KEEFE. 
Patrick Radden Keefe, a fellow at the Century Foundation, is the author of ''Chatter: Dispatches From the Secret World of Global Eavesdropping.''

 BODY:
SHORTLY after 9/11, Senator Bob Graham, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for ''a symbiotic relationship between the intelligence community and the private sector.'' They say you should be careful what you wish for. 
 In the intervening years a huge espionage-industrial complex has developed, as government spymasters outsourced everything from designing surveillance technology to managing case officers overseas. Today less than half of the staff at the National Counterterrorism Center in Washington are actual government employees, The Los Angeles Times reports; at the C.I.A. station in Islamabad, Pakistan, contractors sometimes outnumber employees by three to one.
 So just how much of the intelligence budget goes to private contracts? Because that budget is highly classified, and many intelligence contracts are allocated without oversight or competitive bidding, it seemed we would never know. Until last month, that is: a procurement executive from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence gave a PowerPoint presentation at a conference in Colorado and let slip a staggering statistic -- private contracts now account for 70 percent of the intelligence budget. 
 Of course, our spies always relied on private sector expertise. But in the decade after the cold war the intelligence community's budget was cut by 40 percent. On 9/11, our spies found themselves shorthanded -- untrained in the languages spoken by terrorists, unable to crack new communications technologies, generally lagging behind their counterparts outside the government. The privatization boom emerged out of sheer necessity. As one slide at the Colorado briefing had it, ''We can't spy ... if we can't buy!''
 As it happened, the dot-com bubble had burst shortly before 9/11, cutting loose a generation of technology entrepreneurs who, when the government came calling, were only too happy to start developing new data-mining algorithms and biometric identification programs. New startups began sprouting in the suburbs around Washington. The number of ''contractor facilities'' cleared by the National Security Agency grew from 41 in 2002 to 1,265 in 2006. It was a gold rush, a national security bubble. 
 Seeing this emerging market, the traditional Beltway Bandits -- military-industrial giants like Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman -- established intelligence and homeland security divisions. At Booz Allen Hamilton, a consulting firm one former C.I.A. official called ''the shadow intelligence community,'' revenue has doubled since 2000. 
 There is nothing inherently wrong with all this. We want our spies to have access to the best technology and expertise, and if that means they have to look outside the building -- and pay top dollar -- then so be it. The problem is that the ''symbiotic relationship'' has turned decidedly dysfunctional, if not downright exploitative. 
 Take, for example, one (very big) contractor, and one (very big) contract. In 2002, Science Applications International Corporation, a San Diego behemoth with more than 40,000 employees and $8 billion in annual revenue, received a $280 million contract from the National Security Agency to modernize its systems for sifting through the vast flows of information it intercepts. The project was called Trailblazer. By 2005, costs had ballooned to over $1 billion and the system had still not gotten off the ground. One C.I.A. veteran familiar with the program has declared it ''a complete and abject failure.''
 Trailblazer was a notorious boondoggle, but it wasn't the biggest. That prize goes to the Future Imagery Architecture, a contract Boeing won before 9/11, in 1999, to develop a new generation of spy satellites that could photograph targets from space. 
 Inexperienced at building satellites with optical lenses, Boeing started missing deadlines and exceeding cost estimates almost immediately. By the time the Pentagon took the program away from Boeing in 2005, it was five years behind schedule and had cost $10 billion, including $4 billion in cost overruns. For contractors, this sort of failure is seldom punished -- it's often rewarded. Many contracts are ''cost plus,'' meaning there will be no penalty if a contractor wildly exceeds the initial projection. Better still, a contractor can break something, then bid for the job of putting it back together. When the N.S.A. wanted to create another program, ExecuteLocus, to replace Science Applications International's failed Trailblazer, it needed a contractor to build it. Who got the job? Science Applications.
 The orthodoxy of privatization -- that it's the government that's mired by inefficiency and a lack of competition -- has been turned on its head in the intelligence industry. However patriotic, contractors must ultimately answer to their shareholders and the bottom line. There's more than one way to read Lockheed Martin's recent advertising slogan: ''We never forget who we're working for.''
 It's not just the money that flows out the door, either: it's also the people, as the companies offer hefty raises to government employees who join their ranks. A recent report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence found that ''contractors recruit our own employees, already cleared and trained at government expense, and then 'lease' them back to us at considerably greater expense.'' 
 This process -- called ''bidding back'' -- has created a brain drain. Two-thirds of the Department of Homeland Security's senior officials and experts have departed for private industry. Michael Hayden, the C.I.A. director, worries that his agency has become ''a farm team for these contractors.'' 
 The revolving door helps firms score more contracts. Federal law prohibits executive branch officials from lobbying former colleagues after leaving public office -- but just for the first year. Can a government acquisitions officer who might someday like a job at a contractor really evaluate the contractor's bid objectively? 
 William Black Jr. left the National Security Agency in 1997, after a 38-year career, to become a vice president at Science Applications. He returned to the agency as deputy director in 2000, and shortly thereafter the Trailblazer contract was awarded to his former employer. Nothing illegal here, but is there not at least the appearance of a conflict of interest? The good news is that Congress seems to have finally caught on to the scale of the problem. The intelligence authorization bill that passed the House last month included an amendment that would require the director of national intelligence to submit a report on the functions performed by contractors, the ways contracts are vetted, and the savings associated with outsourcing. The Senate Intelligence Committee explicitly chided the spy agencies earlier this month for ''increasing reliance on contractors.'' In response, the C.I.A. announced that it would pare the number of contractors by 10 percent. 
 These are promising first steps. But the inspectors general of America's intelligence agencies must become more aggressive in policing how contracts are awarded -- and in halting cost overruns before they reach the billions. The intelligence community should limit the parasitic practice of bidding back, perhaps by limiting contracts with firms that poach too many federal employees. It should also fine companies -- or at least stop rewarding them -- when they fail to deliver on time and on budget. 
 Congress should enact more comprehensive legislation, establishing oversight procedures to govern the many conflicts of interest that arise when agencies and industry are this close. If our spy agencies are truly going to protect us, they must learn how to develop -- and retain -- their own in-house expertise.

HEADLINE: Japan Adapts to Tuna Shortage: Waiter, There's Deer in My Sushi

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO, June 24 -- Sushi made with deer meat, anyone? How about a slice of raw horse on that rice?
 These are some of the most extreme alternatives being considered by Japanese chefs as shortages of tuna threaten to remove it from Japan's sushi menus -- something as unthinkable here as baseball without hot dogs or Texas without barbecue.
 In this seafood-crazed country, tuna is king. From maguro to otoro, the Japanese seem to have almost as many words for tuna and its edible parts as the French have names for cheese. So when global fishing bodies recently began lowering the limits on catches in the world's rapidly depleting tuna fisheries, Japan fell into a national panic. 
 Nightly news programs ran in-depth reports of how higher prices were driving top-grade tuna off supermarket shelves and the revolving conveyer belts at sushi chain stores. At nicer restaurants, sushi chefs began experimenting with substitutes, from cheaper varieties of fish to terrestrial alternatives and even, heaven forbid, American sushi variations like avocado rolls.
 ''It's like America running out of steak,'' said Tadashi Yamagata, vice chairman of Japan's national union of sushi chefs. ''Sushi without tuna just would not be sushi.''
 The problem is the growing appetite for sushi and sashimi outside Japan, not only in the United States but also in countries with new wealth, like Russia, South Korea and China. And the problem will not go away. Fishing experts say that the shortages and rising prices will only become more severe as the population of bluefin tuna -- the big, slow-maturing type most favored in sushi -- fails to keep up with worldwide demand.
 Last year, dozens of nations responded by agreeing to reduce annual tuna catches in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean oceans by 20 percent in an effort to stabilize populations. But the decision only seemed to crystallize growing fears in Japan about tuna shortages, helping to push up prices of the three species of bluefin -- northern, Pacific and southern -- that are considered the best tuna to eat raw.
 Since the start of last year, the average price of imported frozen northern and Pacific bluefin has risen more than a third, to $13 a pound, according to Japan's Fisheries Agency.
 Wholesalers say that competition from foreign fishing fleets and buyers has made the top-quality tuna increasingly hard to come by here. Tadashi Oono, who sells big red slabs of tuna from a stall in the sprawling Tsukiji fish market of Tokyo, said that three years ago, he routinely sold two or three top-grade bluefin every day. This year, he said, he sometimes finds only two or three tuna of that quality to sell in a month.
 Some culinary enthusiasts say the anguish over tuna shortages may also reflect deeper anxieties in Japan about its recent economic decline, especially when compared with neighboring China.
 After World War II, tuna became a symbol of the economic might that allowed Japan to dominate the buying of tuna on world markets from Boston to Cape Town. Japan now consumes about 60,000 tons a year of the three bluefin species, or more than three-quarters of the world's annual catch, according to the Fisheries Agency.
 But as more top-grade tuna ends up in other countries, there are concerns that Japan could one day lose its status as global tuna superpower.
 ''Fish that would have gone to Tokyo are now ending up in New York or Shanghai,'' said Sasha Issenberg, the author of ''The Sushi Economy'' (Gotham, 2007). ''This has been devastating to Japan's national esteem.''
 The tuna shortage is also having a more concrete effect on menus at Japanese sushi bars. Fukuzushi, a midpriced restaurant in a residential neighborhood in Tokyo, is having a tougher time finding high-quality fish at reasonable prices.
 The restaurant's owner, Shigekazu Ozoe, 56, said the current situation reminded him of the last time he had no tuna to sell -- in 1973, during a scare over mercury poisoning in oceans when customers refused to buy it. At that time, he tried to find other red-colored substitutes like smoked deer meat and raw horse, a local delicacy in some parts of Japan.
 ''We tasted it, and horse sushi was pretty good,'' he recalled. ''It was soft, easy to bite off, had no smell.''
 If worse comes to worst, he said, he could always try horse and deer again. The only drawback he remembered was customers objecting to red meat in the glass display case on the counter of his sushi bar.
 ''One customer pointed and said: 'You have something four-legged in your fish case? That's eerie!' ''
 So far, top sushi restaurants have avoided the shortages by paying top yen for premium bluefin caught off domestic ports like Ouma in northern Japan. 
 ''The prices of top-name tuna like Ouma are already as high as they can go,'' said Yosuke Imada, owner of Kyubey in the upscale Ginza district of Tokyo. ''What will happen is that the prices of lower grades of tuna will rise to catch up.''
 That prospect worries Mr. Yamagata of the union of sushi chefs.
 Mr. Yamagata, 59, has been experimenting with more creative tuna alternatives at Miyakozushi, a restaurant catering to the business lunch crowd that has been in his family for four generations. He said his most successful substitutes were ideas he ''reverse imported'' from the United States, like smoked duck with mayonnaise and crushed daikon with sea urchin. He said he now made annual visits to sushi restaurants in New York and Washington for inspiration.
 ''We can learn from American sushi chefs,'' Mr. Yamagata said. ''Sushi has to evolve to keep up with the times.''

HEADLINE: Can They Really Call the Chainsaw Eco-Friendly?

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- Home Depot sent a note a few months ago to the companies that supply the 176,000 products it sells, inviting them to make a pitch to have their products included in its new Eco Options marketing campaign.
 More than 60,000 products -- far more than obvious candidates like organic gardening products and high-efficiency lightbulbs -- suddenly developed environmental star power.
 Plastic-handled paint brushes were touted as nature-friendly because they were not made of wood. Wood-handled paint brushes were promoted as better for the planet because they were not made of plastic.
 An electric chainsaw? Green, because it was not gas-powered. A bug zapper? Ditto, because it was not a poisonous spray. Manufacturers of paint thinners, electrical screwdrivers and interior overhead lights claimed similar bragging rights simply because their plastic or cardboard packaging was recyclable. 
 ''In somebody's mind, the products they were selling us were environmentally friendly,'' said Ron Jarvis, a Home Depot senior vice president who oversees the Eco Options program. 
 But not in his mind. 
 ''Most of what you see today in the green movement is voodoo marketing,'' he added. ''If they say their product makes the sky bluer and the grass greener, that's just not good enough.''
 By the standards of Mr. Jarvis -- who fertilizes his own home garden with a liquefied worm waste product packaged in recycled soda bottles and fills his swimming pool with salt water to avoid putting chlorine into the environment -- only 2,500 of the products made the cut.
 Even at that number, some environmentalists say that Home Depot is being too inclusive. In the process, they say, it is engaging in its own kind of overstated marketing, posing as green even as it continues to sell powerful pesticides and polluting lawnmowers.
 Green, after all, has become the new ''new and improved,'' a label so widely used that many environmental groups, while lauding the heightened interest of consumers, now dismiss many of the efforts as greenwash.
 ''Everybody is in a mad scramble to say how green they are,'' said Jim O'Donnell, manager of the Sierra Club Stock Fund, which handles $50 million in a portfolio of companies it considers environmentally friendly. He added that he was hopeful the product greening would become more meaningful over time.
 One reason for the scramble is that there are few verifiable or certified standards to substantiate claims. Crest has introduced a toothpaste containing green tea extract and natural mint, sold under the ''Nature's Expressions'' label, even though it contains artificial ingredients like most toothpastes. Raid sells a wasp and hornet killer in a green can marked ''Green Options'' with ''Natural Clove Scent.''
 ''You almost have to be a scientist with a lab to decipher the dizzying array of claims,'' said Robyn Griggs Lawrence, editor in chief for Natural Home magazine. ''It's hard to get information on what makes a product green.'' 
 Few people know that better than Mr. Jarvis of Home Depot, the nation's second-largest retailer behind Wal-Mart.
 The products he has accepted for the Eco Options promotion include solar-powered landscape lighting, biodegradable peat pots and paints that discharge fewer pollutants.
 But he has often gone back to suppliers and independent testers for clarification and new testing on products. Sometimes he requests product improvements, since Home Depot ultimately wants to sell about 6,000 products under the Eco Options program. (The suppliers have an incentive to meet his requests: sales of products in the Eco Options program have gone up an average of about 10 percent since the program began in April.)
 Home Depot executives acknowledge that they are navigating largely uncharted waters because the government and private-company certifications that do exist on environmental impact tend to be narrowly focused.
 It took weeks, for instance, to choose among a multitude of paint toxicity standards that local governments have set around the country. (Home Depot said it chose the strictest standard, set in Southern California.) 
 For now, most Eco Options products rely on independent certifications like Energy Star, which measure energy efficiency and is run by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy.
 Even though Energy Star is a widely accepted barometer for how much electricity a refrigerator or washing machine uses, it does not measure other factors, like how much energy was used to make the appliance in the first place or whether the manufacturer used recycled materials and encouraged its product to be recycled at the end of its life.
 Home Depot is working with Scientific Certification Systems, a private company based in Emeryville, Calif., that audits and certifies company claims, to develop new broad-based standards. They will grade a product based on its environmental record over its entire life cycle -- including the sustainability of its production process, its efficiency and longevity and how it can be recycled when it is no longer useful.
 But until some kind of standard can be worked out, Mr. Jarvis and his team are forced to work their way through the thicket of claims.
 They are currently considering a rug that is made out of corn fiber instead of nylon, one that the manufacturer is heralding as a natural, earth-friendly product. Corn is natural, Mr. Jarvis acknowledged, but he said he was concerned about the buildup of phosphates in the Gulf of Mexico coming off the Mississippi River from corn farming, as well as the fuel it takes to run the tractors in corn fields and to transport the corn. 
 ''When you look at the entire life cycle, nylon could have less of an environmental impact,'' he said. 
 Teimeiko Fletcher, an environmental marketing manager at Home Depot, walked into Mr. Jarvis's office on a recent day with a thick folder of products that manufacturers wanted to be included in the Eco Options program. 
 Mr. Jarvis liked a dimmer made by Lutron that promised 5 percent energy savings, but asked that the Environmental Protection Agency be consulted for verification. He was impressed by a claim by E-3 that a spark plug for lawn and garden products would lower carbon dioxide emissions by 7 percent, but he asked Ms. Fletcher to find out if other spark plugs on the market could do better.
 One manufacturer said its asphalt roofing was environmentally friendly because it could be placed over existing roofing, thereby limiting overloading of landfills.
 Mr. Jarvis said he was not impressed, even though Home Depot already sells the product. ''Wood shingles would be better, as long as it comes from sustainable forestry,'' he noted.
 Skeptics say Home Depot is also attempting to give itself a green patina, endorsing products that may not be all they are cracked up to be while continuing to sell lawnmowers, toxic pesticides and inefficient light bulbs.
 Urvashi Rangan, a senior environmental health scientist at Consumer Reports, complained of one store where Eco Options signs were placed haphazardly around toxic bee and hornet insecticides.
 ''If they really wanted to promote sustainability, they would discontinue their products with the least green attributes,'' said Garvin Jabusch, a partner at Green Alfa Advisors, which directs investors on how to invest in a sustainable economy. ''Manufacturers would stop making them on the spot.''
 Mr. Jarvis says many manufacturers have expressed a willingness to work with Home Depot to improve their products to earn the Eco Options label. ''The manufacturers are seeing the green ship leave the port,'' he said ''and they don't want to be left on the dock.''

HEADLINE: Some Errors Defy Fixes: A Typo in Wikipedia's Logo Fractures the Sanskrit

BYLINE: By NOAM COHEN

 BODY:
The symbolism is not exactly ideal. Those on the lookout for errors at Wikipedia have flagged a few more -- this time, however, they are not examples of vandalism at the user-created site but typographical errors in Wikipedia's own logo.
 In postings on internal mailing groups, users of Wikipedia have described obvious mistakes in the design, a globelike jigsaw puzzle with characters from various languages on the pieces. Two of the characters -- one in Japanese and one in Devanagari, the script used in Sanskrit and several modern Indian languages -- are meaningless because of minor slips. 
 Jimmy Wales, a founder of Wikipedia, says the symbolism may not be so unfortunate. ''The nature of Wikipedia is such that because it is written by everyone, there are errors,'' he said. But he added that it was the nature of the project that errors would be noticed and corrected.
 Paul Stansifer, 21, of Somerville, Mass., who came up with the globe design as part of a contest among Wikipedia users, shares that sentiment. He wrote by e-mail that by showing an incomplete jigsaw puzzle, Wikipedia was, ''as far as I know, the only Web site whose logo is a disclaimer ('This Web site is a work in progress.')''
 The contest was in 2003, when Wikipedia was still a rather obscure Web site with the dream of creating ''a free encyclopedia for everyone on the planet.'' Yet others thought that Mr. Stansifer's execution left something to be desired. 
 David Friedland, who describes himself as ''one of those people who hated it,'' set out to improve the design. Using ''what little aesthetic sense I had'' as well as a software program to create a 3-D effect, Mr. Friedland said he made the puzzle pieces more subtle -- with indentations rather than dark lines -- and used single characters rather than words, which he thought had cluttered up the design.
 But in the process, Mr. Friedland, who has a degree in computer science and linguistics, introduced the errors. He said he tried to pick characters that were from a wide range of languages (including Klingon in the far upper right) that looked interesting and generally represented a W sound. The Devanagari error was caused by a computer glitch, he said, which swapped the order of two parts of the character; the Japanese error was simply carelessness.
 Though the errors have been discussed among cognoscenti for more than two years, they have not been fixed, mainly because Mr. Friedland says he lost the original computer file and is too busy to start from scratch. ''I can't find the settings I used to make it,'' he said. ''Three years ago I was unemployed, in my room all day, finishing my degree.''
 Now a software developer for a Microsoft subsidiary, Tellme, Mr. Friedland said he had moved on and wanted to hand off responsibility.
 ''I have tried to reconstruct it, but it never looks right,'' he said. ''The whole thing should be redrawn by a professional illustrator.''
 A user named Kizu Naoko, 39, who lives near Osaka, Japan, said that most Japanese users favored making the fix. But in an e-mail message, she added: ''It could be an option to leave them as they are. Most people don't take it serious and think the graphical logo is a sort of pot-au-feu of various letters without meaning.'' NOAM COHEN

HEADLINE: High-Tech Titans Strike Out on Immigration Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR. 
Laurie J. Flynn contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24 

 BODY:
Bill Gates and Steven A. Ballmer of Microsoft have led a parade of high-tech executives to Capitol Hill, urging lawmakers to provide more visas for temporary foreign workers and permanent immigrants who can fill critical jobs.
 Google has reminded senators that one of its founders, Sergey Brin, came from the Soviet Union as a young boy. To stay competitive in a ''knowledge-based economy,'' company officials have said, Google needs to hire many more immigrants as software engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists. 
 The top executives of these and other high-tech companies have been making a huge effort to reshape the Senate immigration bill to meet their demand for more foreign workers. But they have had only limited success, as is often the case when strong-willed corporate leaders confront powerful members of Congress. 
 The Senate plans to resume work on the bill this week. Much of the debate will focus on proposals for granting legal status to illegal immigrants. But the sections of the bill affecting high-tech industries could prove to be very important as well. 
 High-tech companies want to be able to hire larger numbers of well-educated, foreign-born professionals who, they say, can help them succeed in the global economy. For these scientists and engineers, they seek permanent-residence visas, known as green cards, and H-1B visas. The H-1B program provides temporary work visas for people who have university degrees or the equivalent to fill jobs in specialty occupations including health care and technology. The Senate bill would expand the number of work visas for skilled professionals, but high-tech companies say the proposed increase is not nearly enough. Several provisions of the Senate bill are meant to enhance protections for American workers and to prevent visa fraud and abuse.
 High-tech companies were surprised and upset by the bill that emerged last month from secret Senate negotiations. E. John Krumholtz, director of federal affairs at Microsoft, said the bill was ''worse than the status quo, and the status quo is a disaster.''
 In the last two weeks, these businesses have quietly negotiated for changes to meet some of their needs. But the bill still falls far short of what they want, an outcome suggesting that their political clout does not match their economic strength.
 Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a co-author of a treatise on immigration law, said: ''High-tech companies are very organized. They have numerous lobby groups. When Bill Gates advocates more H-1B visas and green cards for tech workers, everyone listens.
 ''But that supposed influence has not translated into legislative results,'' Mr. Yale-Loehr, who teaches at Cornell Law School, continued. ''High-tech companies have been lobbying unsuccessfully since 2003 for more H-1B visas. It's hard to get anything through Congress these days. In addition, anti-immigrant groups are well organized. U.S. computer programmers are constantly arguing that H-1B workers undercut their wages.''
 The Republican architects of the Senate bill, like Senators Jon Kyl of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, thought they were doing a favor for high-tech companies when they proposed a ''point system'' to evaluate immigrants seeking green cards. The point system would reward people who have advanced degrees and job skills needed in the United States.
 But the high-tech companies were upset because the bill would have stripped them of the ability to sponsor specific immigrants for particular jobs.
 The companies flooded Senate offices with letters, telephone calls and e-mail messages seeking changes to the bill. Mr. Ballmer, the blunt-spoken chief executive of Microsoft, Craig R. Barrett, the chairman of Intel, and other executives pressed their concerns in person. 
 These advocates have made some gains, which are embodied in an amendment to be proposed by Mr. Kyl and Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington.
 Edward J. Sweeney, senior vice president of National Semiconductor, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said, ''I've spent many hours in Washington talking with senators to get their support on this amendment.''
 Likewise, William D. Watkins, the chief executive of Seagate Technology, the world's largest maker of computer disk drives, said he met with five or six senators two weeks ago.
 Under the Kyl-Cantwell proposal, 20,000 green cards would be set aside each year for immigrants of extraordinary ability, outstanding professors and researchers and certain managers and executives of multinational corporations. The original bill would have eliminated the existing preference for such workers.
 In addition, the amendment would give employers five years to adjust their hiring practices to the new ''merit-based'' point system for obtaining green cards.
 ''For the first five years, employers would still have a say,'' Ms. Cantwell said in an interview. ''They could recruit the best and the brightest.''
 The number of green cards for employer-sponsored immigrants would gradually decline, to 44,000 in the fifth year from 115,000 in each of the first two years. No green cards would be set aside for employer-sponsored immigrants after that.
 Many high-tech companies bring in foreign professionals on temporary H-1B visas. The government is swamped with petitions. On the first two days of the application period in April, it received more than 123,000 petitions for 65,000 slots.
 The Senate bill would raise the cap to 115,000 in 2008, with a possible increase to 180,000 in later years, based on labor market needs.
 Many high-tech businesses want to hire foreign students who obtain advanced degrees from American universities, and many of the students want to work here, but cannot get visas.
 Under current law, up to 20,000 foreigners who earn a master's degree or higher from an American university are generally exempt from the annual limit on new H-1B visas. The Kyl-Cantwell proposal would double the number.
 The amendment would also establish a new exemption, providing 20,000 additional H-1B visas for people who have earned advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering or mathematics from a university outside the United States.
 The technology companies face a serious challenge from a different direction, as lawmakers of both parties worry about possible abuses in the H-1B program. 
 Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip, and Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, have a proposal that would overhaul the H-1 B program and give priority to American workers. Their proposal would also define, in great detail, the wages that must be paid to workers who have H-1B visas.
 Mr. Durbin contended that some companies have used foreign workers to undercut the wages of American workers. And in some cases, he said, foreign workers come to this country for a few years of training, then return home ''to populate businesses competing with the United States.''
 ''The H-1B visa program is being abused by foreign companies to deprive qualified Americans of good jobs,'' Mr. Durbin said. ''Some companies are so brazen, they say 'no Americans need apply' in their job advertisements.''
 High-tech companies said that the wage standards in the Durbin-Grassley proposal would, in effect, require them to pay some H-1B employees more than some equally qualified American workers who are performing the same duties. 
 The Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said that thousands of H-1B workers have been paid less than the prevailing wage. 
 One company, Patni Computer Systems, agreed this month to pay more than $2.4 million to 607 workers with visas after Labor Department investigators found that they had not been paid the wages required by federal law. The company's global headquarters are in Mumbai, India, and its American operations are based in Cambridge, Mass.

HEADLINE: Congestion Pricing Deadline

 BODY:
New Yorkers, and anyone else who rides public transportation in and around the city, should mark July 16 on their calendars. By that date, if state lawmakers do their jobs, they will have paved the way to ensuring billions of dollars of new cash to maintain and expand mass transit. If not, the current $2 fare for a bus or subway ride can be expected to increase at least 20 percent and maybe as much as 50 percent. The choice is that stark, and riders, who will pay the price if legislators fail, will know exactly where to direct their pique. 
 New York is a candidate for as much as $500 million in federal money to help pay for Mayor Michael Bloomberg's plan for congestion pricing, which would charge a fee to drivers on Manhattan's busiest streets. The federal Department of Transportation has said New York is unlikely to qualify if it misses the deadline to authorize a plan.
 Washington correctly sees traffic gridlock as a drain on local economies, and relieving it as a worthy investment. Congestion pricing works. It cut tailpipe emissions and cleared clogged streets in London and Stockholm. Commuting times were pared down and business deliveries were faster. The revenues pumped up public transportation to handle the riders who gave up driving to work.
 Mr. Bloomberg's dilemma is that the city's ridiculously limited home rule requires him to get Albany's approval. He accepted that condition, pressing for congestion pricing in the Capitol. But the issue -- and the pile of federal money -- was left hanging last week as legislators raced to begin vacation.
 Congestion pricing raises the hackles of some legislators from the city, especially those from Brooklyn and Queens, whose constituents do more driving. Their concerns should dissipate if the plan front-loads hundreds of millions of dollars to improve access to transit and add express bus lines and ferries to ease longer commutes -- something that City Comptroller William Thompson proposes.
 Gov. Eliot Spitzer, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, can redeem themselves by coming back for a special July session and allowing enough time to hammer out a congestion pricing agreement that is acceptable to Washington. They were tantalizingly on the verge of doing that when lawmakers took a powder.

HEADLINE: Their Reward for Imagining What New York City Can Be

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In 1958, a promising but obscure writer for an architectural magazine applied to the Rockefeller Foundation for a research grant.
 ''Most city planning and rebuilding today is based, fundamentally, on rejection of the city,'' she wrote. ''I am convinced that any good that is going to come of planning for the city is going to have to foster the city's diversity instead of obstructing it.''
 The grant was approved, and ultimately grew to $18,000. The research helped produce Jane Jacobs's landmark book, ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities.'' 
 Nearly a half-century later, the Rockefeller Foundation is inaugurating the Jane Jacobs Medals, accompanied by a $100,000 prize. 
 Barry Benepe, the 79-year-old founder of Greenmarket, will receive the first medal for ''lifetime leadership.'' Omar Freilla, the 33-year-old founder of Green Worker Cooperatives in the Bronx, was named the winner of the first medal for ''new ideas and activism.''
 The medals, voted by a 12-member jury from hundreds of entries, will be presented in September in conjunction with the opening by the Municipal Art Society of an exhibit titled ''Jane Jacobs and the Future of New York.''
 ''We're experiencing in New York the kind of civic conversation Jane would have loved,'' said Judith Rodin, the Rockefeller Foundation's president. 
 Miss Jacobs, who championed density, dynamism and diversity in America's cities, died last year at the age of 89. The Rockefeller Foundation awards will be given in her name annually. 
 The celebration of her life and legacy follows months of retrospection about her nemesis, Robert Moses, in a new book and in exhibitions that ended last month at the Museum of the City of New York and the Queens Museum of Art.
 Mr. Benepe, an architect, planner and bicyclist whose son Adrian is the city's parks commissioner, founded Greenmarket in 1975. In more than 30 neighborhoods, the organization has demonstrated how temporary farmers' markets can revitalize empty lots and vacant parks.
 Mr. Benepe, who first met Miss Jacobs at a demonstration in City Hall Park, hailed her ''microcosmic'' view of the city. He said he intends to share a portion of his prize money with other nonprofit groups.
 Mr. Freilla, who was born in the South Bronx and returned there after earning a master's degree in environmental science, founded Green Worker Cooperatives in 2003. 
 In keeping with Miss Jacobs's vision, he said, one of the group's goals was to open a center in the Bronx to transform construction waste ''to create a new alternative economy that is community based, empowers workers and is green.'' Workers would salvage used and surplus materials from demolition and construction sites for reuse. 
 Mr. Freilla is donating his prize money to the Green Worker Cooperatives, which has now raised all but $75,000 of its $900,000 goal for the center. 
 Describing its project on Miss Jacobs, the Municipal Art Society said that in contrast to the 1950s, recent development in the city has been incremental ''but almost as powerful in the aggregate.''
 ''The texture of the city -- the tangible and intangible components that create its character, the elements that comprise its soul -- is eroding under a steady stream of luxury condominiums and national chain stores,'' the society said.
 ''As the debate about the growth and the development of the city continues,'' said Kent Barwick, the society's president, ''I keep thinking to myself: 'What would Jane say?' ''

HEADLINE: The N.B.A. and China Hope They've Found the Next Yao

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS. 
Xu Guangming contributed reporting from Shanghai.

 BODY:
Yi Jianlian's cellphone was singing. 
 During a telephone interview from Los Angeles, where Yi, a spry 7-footer from China, was preparing for Thursday's N.B.A. draft, an R&B song burst into the air.
 ''Tanya,'' he said in English, when asked about his ring tone. ''I downloaded it from the Internet.''
 And with that, Yi (pronounced Ee) continued talking about the increasing popularity of basketball in China -- through an interpreter on a party line.
 Call it Generation Yi. 
 Listening to hip-hop, now wearing Seven jeans and Sean John shirts and growing up playing pickup basketball in Shenzhen, Yi stands as a symbol of discovery that is rippling through the country.
 He comes to the United States at a time when the N.B.A., its players, agents and multiple shoe companies are trying to stake their claim in China's growing economy as the nation prepares for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. 
 Yi played on China's 2004 Olympic team, which finished eighth at Athens. He also played five years with his professional team, the Guangdong Tigers, before Chinese basketball officials approved his entering the draft. Yi is projected as a lottery pick, anywhere from the 3rd to 12th spot. 
 ''This fellow has a great touch,'' said Del Harris, the former Dallas assistant who coached the Chinese team in Athens and caused controversy in the traditionalist culture by starting Yi as a rookie. ''He's got a really good 17-, 18-foot shot. He runs really well, can jump and has good timing. His shot-blocking is excellent.'' 
 While Yi's physical, low-post game has been questioned, his athleticism as a power forward distinguishes him from the three previous Chinese imports, centers Wang Zhizhi, Mengke Bateer, and Yao Ming, Houston's No. 1 pick (first over all) in 2002. 
 ''I expect a lot of Yi Jianlian,'' said Xun Tianqu, 20, a Fudan University law student. ''Although he is not as tall as Yao Ming, he is more active and much quicker.''
 Yi, sponsored by Nike since 2005, has a campaign starting today in China called ''Doubt and Believe.'' Although teams have scouted him in China, Yi is still a bit of a mystery in a draft headlined by college stars, Greg Oden and Kevin Durant. 
 The N.B.A. and the Chinese Basketball Association list his birthday as Oct. 27, 1987, making him 19. Basketball federations, though, have been known to change birthdates to keep players eligible for junior tournaments. 
 ''I was born that year and that date,'' Yi said through his interpreter, Roy Lu, an agent with the William Morris Agency, which is handling Yi's marketing. ''There is nothing else to say.''
 Yi did not attend the predraft camp in Orlando, Fla., although another Chinese national team member, Sun Yue, a 6-9 swingman and potential second-round pick, did. 
 Yi's agent, Dan Fegan, limited teams' access to Yi's private workouts in Los Angeles. Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, the Lakers, the Clippers, Sacramento, Golden State and Philadelphia participated. Memphis, Milwaukee and Minnesota, with three of the top seven picks, did not.
 The Bucks' general manager, Larry Harris, said Friday that his team was considering taking Yi with the sixth pick despite potential objections from Chinese basketball officials. They want Yi to play in a city with a large Chinese population and for him not to languish on the bench. 
 Hai To Chan, the owner of the Guangdong Tigers, arrived in Los Angeles last week to oversee the draft. 
 ''We are happy to see our players to go out,'' said Li Yuanwei, executive vice president and secretary general of the Chinese Basketball Association. ''We don't oppose it. The question though, is how to keep it in an orderly way. We don't want our men to just sit there without access to opportunities of training and gaming.''
 For the N.B.A., the success of players like Yi is critical to the international growth of the game. 
 The N.B.A. estimates 300 million people play organized basketball in China. With 1.3 billion people and a growing middle class, N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern wants to capitalize. He said that the N.B.A. was discussing forming a league with the Chinese Basketball Association after the Beijing Olympics. 
 ''It was time for us to be making a greater investment in China,'' Stern said last week. ''It was time to take advantage of the opportunities -- from marketing, to new media, to retail, to merchandise, to television.''
 Currently, the N.B.A. is in discussions with the Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC and ESPN, to secure equity to incorporate its entities under the umbrella NBA China, according to a person with knowledge of negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because no deal had been finalized. Deals are already being made. The players union signed a partnership with Citic Guoan Group, China's largest state-run investment firm, to help players secure endorsements.
 Last week, Jeff Schwartz and his agency Excel Sports Management signed with Infront, a Swiss-based marketing company that represents the Chinese Basketball Association and China's national team. Schwartz, who represented Wang, hopes his partnership will help him sign players and spur opportunities for his American clients like Jason Kidd and Paul Pierce. 
 ''Is it going to be one player every year or a couple of players every year? You don't know where it's going,'' Schwartz said. ''But it's all happening now, and with coaches from America coming over, it's only getting to a higher level.''
 Yao's success has been the catalyst for players like Yi to develop, commercially and on the court.
 Unlike with Yao, the Chinese Basketball Association allowed Yi to come to the United States two months before the draft to acclimate. Yi had daily English lessons between workouts, interviews and appearances at movie premieres. 
 Yi had already been in the United States for the 2002 Adidas ABCD Camp in New Jersey and the Pete Newell Big Man's camp in Las Vegas in 2003. 
 In China, people hope his Americanization helps the sport grow. Xu Jicheng, an analyst for the state-run CCTV said, ''Yi's success will make China's basketball more professional.'' 
 Yi played down his influence on a new generation. ''I wish I had the capability to do that,'' he said. ''In any case, if I either play in China or in the United States, I don't want to let the fans down.''

HEADLINE: Absence of Major Disaster in '06 Affected Giving, Report Says

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Although 2006 was heralded as the dawn of a golden age of philanthropy after Warren Buffett pledged his multibillion-dollar fortune to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, charitable giving was almost flat last year.
 Individuals and institutions gave away an estimated $295 billion last year, a 1 percent increase on an inflation-adjusted basis over the prior year.
 ''Given the media and nonprofit sector buzz around what we're calling the megagifts made last year, it is maybe a little surprising that giving did not increase more dramatically,'' said Patrick M. Rooney, director of research at the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. ''I think what we're seeing is philanthropy growing in a steadier, more linear way, when everyone has been hoping for a pattern more like the roaring 1990s.'' 
 The Giving USA Foundation, which produces an annual report on giving together with the center, attributed the lackluster growth in giving to the absence of major disasters.
 Donations to help disaster victims accounted for an estimated 3 percent of total contributions in 2005, skewing comparisons. One tax incentive intended to support charitable giving after Hurricane Katrina, for instance, produced an estimated $11 billion in gifts.
 When donations for disaster relief are excluded from the calculations, giving rose 5.7 percent on an inflation-adjusted basis last year. 
 ''When you take the large figure for disaster giving out, it changes the picture,'' said Richard T. Jolly, chairman of the Giving USA Foundation.
 Several large gifts helped pump up giving in 2006: the initial installment of Mr. Buffett's gift added $1.9 billion to the total, or more than half a percent. Such gifts accounted for 1.3 percent of total giving, or about $3.9 billion.
 ''These megagifts are beginning to show up in a way they haven't before,'' Mr. Jolly said.
 Congress also temporarily allowed donors to transfer money from their individual retirement accounts to charities without incurring taxes, an incentive many wealthy individuals used.
 Some 59 percent of the more than 850 charities that responded to the Giving USA survey reported increases in charitable gifts, while nearly one-third reported declines.
 Giving to religious organizations, which rose 1.2 percent on an inflation-adjusted basis, accounted for 32.8 percent of total giving.
 Universities, private schools and other educational institutions, which have some of the largest and most sophisticated fund-raising operations, saw the biggest gains. Donors gave $40.98 billion to educational charities in 2006, a 6.4 percent gain on an inflation-adjusted basis.
 But perhaps the most surprising winners last year were arts organizations. Contributions to groups working in the arts, culture and the humanities rose 6.5 percent on an inflation-adjusted basis to $12.51 billion, or 4.3 percent of the estimated total.
 Not surprisingly, organizations devoted to international affairs, which includes those involved in disaster relief, were the biggest losers. They raised an estimated $11.34 billion, a drop of 12 percent on an inflation-adjusted basis.
 They shared that distinction with human services organizations, which do more traditional charitable work like providing housing for the homeless and food for the hungry. Gifts to those charities also dropped 12 percent on an inflation-adjusted basis, to $29.56 billion.
 Since 2002, the percentage of overall giving to human services charities has been declining. The exception was 2005, when gifts increased, perhaps as a result of the overall increase driven by disaster giving.

HEADLINE: Sales of Existing Homes Fall To Lowest Level in 4 Years

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, June 25 (AP) -- Reflecting further housing troubles, sales of existing homes fell in May to the lowest level in four years while the median home price dropped for a record 10th consecutive month. 
 The National Association of Realtors reported Monday that sales of existing single-family homes and condominiums dropped by 0.3 percent to 5.99 million units in May, the slowest sales pace since June 2003.
 The median price of a home sold last month dropped to $223,700, down 2.1 percent from a year ago. It was the 10th straight price decline compared with a year ago, the longest stretch of weakness on record.
 The sales decline reflected weakness in the South, where sales dropped by 3.4 percent, and the West, where sales were down by 0.8 percent. Sales actually showed strength in the Northeast, rising by 5.8 percent, and the Midwest, where they were up 0.7 percent.
 In a troubling sign for the future, the inventory of unsold homes rose by 5 percent, to 4.43 million units in May, a level that would take 8.9 months to clear at the May sales pace. That is the highest inventory level since the last deep slump in housing in 1992.
 Analysts said housing was currently being hurt by high inventories and the recent crisis in subprime mortgages, which has caused lenders to tighten their standards, making it harder for potential buyers to qualify for loans.
 They said that all of the housing troubles seemed to be causing a crisis of confidence, leading people to delay decisions to buy homes.
 ''I think psychological factors are currently the biggest drag on the housing market, in addition to a disruption from tighter credit for subprime borrowers,'' said Lawrence Yun, senior economist with the Realtors association.
 ''Household formation has slowed dramatically since late 2006, implying that many people are doubling up,'' he said. ''They're adding roommates or moving in with parents.''
 The current slump in housing is the worst since the 1989-92 downturn. It is occurring after a prolonged boom in which sales of new and existing homes set records for five consecutive years.
 Analysts believe that the median home price, the point at which half the homes sold for more and half for less, will continue falling until builders further cut back on production of new homes coming to market.
 The drop in sales was in line with expectations, providing relief on Wall Street where analysts had been braced for an even worse showing. 
 The Realtors association is predicting that the median home price will decline by 1.3 percent this year while sales are forecast to drop by 4.6 percent. It would be the first annual price decline in four decades of record keeping by the group.

HEADLINE: On Fringe of Forests, Homes and Wildfires Meet

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY and KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: COLEVILLE, Calif. 

 BODY:
Lori and Don Morris had just started unpacking the boxes this month in their new dream house -- four acres, national forest view, wide open land at their doorstep -- when a wildfire raced down the stark bluffs over this high-desert town near the Nevada border.
 More than 300 federal firefighters from as far away as Montana arrived, battling heat, 60-mile-an-hour wind gusts and flames bolting through 1,100 acres of bone-dry sagebrush and juniper. The Morrises, along with 200 other residents, watched helplessly as, miraculously, their homes were spared.
 ''Both of us were aware that these things happen,'' said Ms. Morris, 47, as she looked out the window to the charred hillside. ''We just didn't think it would happen this fast.'' 
 A new generation of Americans like the Morrises, in moving to places perched on the edge of vast, undeveloped government lands in the West, are living out a dangerous experiment, many of them ignorant of the risk. 
 Their migration -- more than 8.6 million new homes in the West within 30 miles of a national forest since 1982, according to research at the University of Wisconsin -- has coincided with profound environmental changes that have worsened the fire hazard, including years of drought, record-setting heat and forest management policies that have allowed brush and dead trees to build up.
 ''It's like a tsunami, this big wave of development that's rolling toward the public lands,'' said Volker C. Radeloff, a professor of forest ecology and management at the University of Wisconsin. ''And the number of fires keeps going up.''
 But now federal agencies at the front lines of defending these new communities from peril are starting to say enough is enough. The constellation of federally owned parks, forests and arid sagebrush fiefs in the lower 48 states is collectively about three-fourths the size of all the land east of the Mississippi River, and is becoming too expensive to protect with so many people pushing up against the fringes.
 This spring, the United States Forest Service began warning state and local officials across the West that they would need to pick up more of the tab from the federal government, and do more to make homes less vulnerable to fire. About 45 percent of the Forest Service's proposed budget for 2008 is designated for firefighting, compared with 13 percent in 1991. Last year, the agency spent $2.5 billion, a record, thinning fuels and fighting fires that burned 9.9 million acres, also a record. 
 ''A lot of people are saying, 'If you're not going to do your part, we're not going to risk our lives,' '' said Stuart McMorrow, a forest-fuels expert with the North Tahoe Fire Protection District, which covers 31 square miles near Lake Tahoe.
 ''It's coming to a head,'' Mr. McMorrow said, ''this notion that people move out to the woods and put themselves in dangerous situations.''
 The Costs
 Costs are also spiraling up like smoke for states and other federal agencies.
 Wyoming budgeted $1.2 million for its 2006 fire season, then ended up spending $30 million. California, braced for what fire officials have said could be one of the worst seasons in history this year, has set aside $850 million for wildfire suppression.
 The Department of Interior, which includes the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management, the country's largest landlord, spent $424 million fighting fire last year. Early season firefights have cost $215 million already this year even before the traditionally worst months arrive.
 The insurance industry, in the aftermath of disasters like Hurricane Katrina, has also begun taking a much harder look at the places where people and trees meet, and is less willing to write policies for homeowners who do not meet a ''wildfire checklist'' by taking measures to protect their homes. 
 ''Fire has emerged as more and more a megacatastrophic risk like we saw with Katrina,'' said Carole Walker, the executive director of Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Association. ''The financial exposure is huge, well into the billions.''
 The result is a new tough-love approach from fire officials, where the soft and fuzzy reminders from Smokey Bear have given way to blunter assessments. The new rural Westerners, fire officials say and insurers increasingly demand, will have to start thinking more like the self-reliant Westerners of old. 
 That means clearing defensible spaces around homes and inspecting roofs and vents through which flying cinders can descend. Those measures protect homes, but also firefighters, since structures cleared of fuels are less dangerous to defend.
 All the while, federally owned public lands continue to attract more people as they evolve into something they were never intended to be: a real-estate amenity. As golf courses were to a past development wave, wild and scenic is to this one. 
 In Lake Tahoe, for example, glossy home magazines are filled with advertisements including cheery phrases like ''adjacent to Forest Service land'' and no mention of the fire risks. 
 ''It's like ocean frontage,'' said Larry Swanson, an economist at the University of Montana in Missoula who studies public lands. ''You would not have these high private property values without the public lands nearby, and the public lands are a huge part of the package that is driving the growth trends.''
 Usually a summertime phenomenon, fire season has come early this year in many parts of the country, including Florida and Georgia. But it is in the West, where acres have always outnumbered humans, that the scale is greatest and the threat most acute.
 Forests in the West are more prone to catastrophic fires than are Eastern ones, said David M. Theobald, a professor at Colorado State University who has analyzed population growth and fire patterns. 
 That puts a higher percentage of the new housing areas in severe-fire zones -- more than 50 percent in California and Colorado, 47 percent in Montana and more than 65 percent in Washington and Oregon, according to a soon-to-be published paper by Mr. Theobald and a colleague, William Romme. In the 37 states east of the Rockies, only about 10 percent of the new rural housing areas are in so-called high-fire zones.
 Drought and the possible effects of climate change on the seasons have added their own vehement kick. In California, Nevada, Idaho and Montana, officials are prepared for a devastating fire year. Wildfires erupted throughout the winter. 
 ''We had fires every month,'' said Joe DuRosseau, division chief of special operations for the fire department in Reno, Nev., which fought a 750-acre fire west of town during the last week of May. ''It's a very dry year, and the fuels are extremely dry.'' 
 In California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has asked for additional firefighting personnel, and officials worry that this summer could rival 2003, when fires caused more than $2 billion in damage, including 5,000 homes that burned in San Diego County.
 Set for Battle
 People like Robert A. Harrington, Montana's state forester at the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, are haunted by the possibility of a year like 1910, when devastating fires in the northern Rockies could be not stopped. There are similar fears in more heavily populated areas like Lake Tahoe.
 On Monday, in Lake Tahoe firefighters battled a fire that had destroyed 160 homes.
 ''On a good weekend there's a couple million people in and around the Tahoe area, with ingress and egress along Interstate 80, essentially one way in and out,'' said George D. Gentry, the executive officer of California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection. ''Imagine a conflagration starts and we have to evacuate people.''
 North of the lake, where second homes pepper the 1.2 million acres of often remote wilderness, Forest Service firefighters train on roads, where turning a fire engine around is tricky even on a good day. 
 Jeanne Pincha-Tulley, a fire management officer there, said new housing in the far-flung fringe had made her job infinitely more challenging. 
 ''There's a housing area going up where the 80 and Highway 20 come together, with one-acre plots going at $1 million each,'' Ms. Pincha-Tulley said. ''I thought, 'Oh great, this is just what I need.' '' 
 Some residents in the high-risk areas worry that the federal government will be tempted to pass the problem along to local governments or homeowners.
 ''The federal government is there to protect the community from disasters,'' said Ron Ehli, 50, a volunteer fire chief in Hamilton, Mont., an increasingly popular getaway in the Bitterroot Valley south of Missoula. 
 ''Where Florida might have hurricanes, or California earthquakes, we have wildfires,'' Mr. Ehli said. ''And the federal government should be there to protect us.''
 Truth be told, the nation's founders would probably be shocked that the government was still in the land or firefighting business. Land, as the early framers of the republic saw it, through legislation like the Homestead Act, was for settlement and farming, and especially for private ownership.
 But much of the western half of the United States did not cooperate. It was too steep, wooded, wild and dry to be tamed the way land was in the East. So hundreds of millions of acres became and remained public land, owned by the government.For most of the past century, the government's policy of fighting fires on that land was single-minded: if it burns, put it out and figure the costs later.
 So the natural fire cycle that cleans out the undergrowth and dying trees broke down, and combustibles began to mount. At the same time, the timber industry paid huge fees to the Forest Service to allow cutting of valuable forest sections that kept the firefighting budget afloat.
 But that has changed. The timber money has slowed to a trickle in many national forests as companies have moved operations to places where trees grow faster, like the South, or gotten into the real estate business themselves, like the giant Plum Creek Timber Company in Montana, which owns hundreds of thousands of acres in the state.
 Still, some Forest Service critics say the agency remains too dependent on timber sales and firefighting money from Congress. Together, suggest the critics -- an odd-bedfellows coalition that includes local environmental groups like the Friends of the Bitterroot and free-market libertarians from the Cato Institute -- the financing sources have skewed wildfire policy. 
 ''We have now turned the fundamental function of the Forest Service into the fire service,'' said Representative Raul M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona and chairman of the House Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands. 
 Mr. Grijalva said the knowledge by Forest Service administrators that Congress would pay for firefighting in defense of the nation's public lands had led to a ''self-fulfilling prophecy'' of more and more money for firefighting. 
 Cuts in Spending
 The surge in fire costs has in turn forced spending cuts in recent years in many other Forest Service programs, including campground maintenance, research, road repair and backcountry wilderness management.
 ''They've shifted the priorities,'' Mr. Grijalva said. ''And that puts property and people at risk, no question about it.''
 Forest Service officials say they are used to being blamed. ''Neither our strategy nor our priorities have changed,'' said Mark E. Rey, under secretary for natural resources and the environment at the Department of Agriculture. 
 Safety of firefighters comes first, Mr. Rey said, then safety of residents, protection of structures and protection of resources.
 What has changed, he said, is growth in the number of people living in harm's way. That has bumped up costs because defending structures, Mr. Rey said, is more expensive than wilderness firefighting. At the same time, the knowledge of the woods and their dangers are fading as rural residents age and newcomers move in.
 Ravalli County, Mont., for example, around the town of Hamilton, grew by 25 percent, to about 40,000 people, from 1995 to 2005. In the 2000 census, almost one-third of the residents said they had lived somewhere else five years earlier.
 ''I personally feel if they're stupid enough to build their house with trees and stuff all around, it's their dumb luck,'' said Nancy Garness, 53, a baker at the Coffee Cup Cafe in Hamilton, who came to the area with her parents in the late 1950s when she was 4. 
 Insurance professionals say much the same thing.
 ''We all went through a period of, 'write the policy and take the money,' '' said Barry Whitmore, a State Farm Insurance agent in Hamilton. ''Now we've got a wildfire checklist, and based on the answers, a home is either insurable or not insurable.''
 In Coleville, a town of 400 people in the eastern Sierra Nevada, Ms. Morris and her husband are leaving little to chance.
 Not much more than a wide spot in the road about 200 miles east of San Francisco, Coleville is showing signs of discovery, with a handful of new houses and real estate signs along the main road, which is also lined with cottonwoods and scrub brush. 
 Ms. Morris said it was love at first sight when she discovered the town a few months ago. The Morris abutsland owned by the Bureau of Land Management.
 ''There's hundreds of miles of forests,'' she said. ''The beauty of it. We have every kind of tree you can imagine right out the backyard.''
 Now, after the fire, many of those trees are charred and blackened, and soot and ash fill the air every time the wind kicks up. Still, Ms. Morris says she is not going anywhere; instead, she is joining the local volunteer fire department.

HEADLINE: Enjoy Your Green Stay

BYLINE: By MARTHA C. WHITE

 BODY:
Remember when all a hotel had to do to show its concern for the environment was to ask its guests to reuse their towels? 
 Hotels now are rolling out all sorts of green programs, in part because their business guests in particular are demanding it, and in part because the hotels are finding that going green saves money. 
 ''Environmental issues are one of the hottest issues within the travel industry right now,'' said Bill Connors, the executive director of the National Business Travel Association. The association is addressing the topic of eco-friendly elements in hotel design and operations for the first time at its annual convention in July. 
 Mr. Connors's view is borne out by the rise in hotels registering to be certified under the United States Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program, a commercial-building rating system. ''I think it's a really noticeable trend,'' said Max Zahniser, a program manager. 
 There are currently two certified hotels in the United States -- a Marriott in Maryland and a Hilton in Washington -- and several more are on the way. ''At least three-quarters of the projects that have registered are in the last year or two,'' Mr. Zahniser said. 
 This is good news to Josh Rachlis, an advertising copywriter based in Toronto who travels throughout the United States for up to two weeks at a time. ''When I'm at a hotel, I always look to see if they use compact fluorescent bulbs, and I try to use as few towels as possible,'' he said. ''Ideally, I'd be looking for a green roof, and if a hotel had recycling facilities, that would be great. I'd be more than happy to take my business there.''
 Mr. Rachlis is far from alone in seeking out hotels with earth-friendly practices. In a 2005 survey, Kimpton Hotels and Restaurants found that 16 percent of guests choose their properties because of the company's environmental practices. The chain's housekeepers use nontoxic cleaning agents, there are in-room recycling bins and the hotels plan to switch all light bulbs to compact fluorescents within the next 12 to 18 months.
 ''I get a lot of unsolicited letters from guests and I'm a little surprised by how many mention our green programs,'' said Michael Depatie, the president and chief executive of the Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group. ''We've been doing this for a while, but it seems like it's suddenly at a tipping point.''
 Other hotel officials also say evidence of eco-friendliness is driving demand. At the Crowne Plaza Hotel Atlanta-Perimeter Northwest, Hugh Anderson, the general manager, said bookings had soared for a boardroom renovated two years ago with bamboo flooring. 
 ''It's highly requested and is booked constantly, which is unusual,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''It's something that's important to the traveler. They certainly have positive thoughts about using a facility that's environmentally friendly.'' 
 Some hotels have used energy-saving measures for years. ''Fairmont's been doing it since before eco-chic was a word, and the one thing I've found about our environmental program is that a lot of our guests are unaware of it,'' said Michelle White, director of environmental affairs for Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. All front-desk computers at Fairmont's North American properties run on wind power bought from a sustainable energy cooperative, and several of its golf courses are irrigated with recycled water. 
 At the boutique hotel Greenhouse 26, set to open next year in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, the elevator will capture energy generated when it stops, in much the same way a hybrid car recycles energy released when the brakes engage. In addition, heating and cooling will be conducted via an energy-saving geothermal system, and water from sinks and showers will be recycled for use in toilets.
 Hospitality executives and consultants point to the marketing potential of a green designation.
 ''It's a great branding claim, and it helps them differentiate themselves,'' said Danny Seo, who described himself as an environmental lifestyle expert. He said he had worked with Kimpton on the chain's green promotions.
 Bjorn Hanson, head lodging consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers, noted that 30 hotel brands had been started in the United States in the last 30 months. ''The challenge is to find distinctions, and some have clearly targeted a green orientation,'' he said. Environmental friendliness is a high priority particularly for younger consumers, who make up a growing percentage of business travelers, he said. 
 Kirsten Cluthe, an events marketing specialist whose job frequently takes her on the road, said her peers were concerned about the environment. ''A lot of people that are my age are first-time parents now, and they're concerned about what kind of a world their kids are going to grow up in.'' Ms. Cluthe said she makes a point of asking about the sustainability policies of hotels where she stays on business trips.
 Another reason behind the green push is economics. There are financial benefits to installing light bulbs that use less energy or bathroom fixtures that limit water flow. ''In many cases, environmentally friendly is also business friendly,'' Mr. Hanson said. With the cost of fuel inching steadily upward, some hotels are finding that conservation measures, once viewed as expensive, are now considered smart investments. 
 An example comes from the Westin Convention Center Pittsburgh. Four years ago, it installed a key card system to regulate the use of power in guest rooms. Common in hotels overseas, the units are activated when guests enter their key cards into a wall slot, which then turns on the lights, electrical outlets and climate controls. The general manager, Joe Kane, says the $120,000 cost was recouped after only 15 months. 
 Mr. Connors, from the National Business Travel Association, said the group's hotel committee is planning to add environmental questions to the standard request form used by the association's thousands of members when selecting preferred properties. 
 By some accounts, this is already happening. ''We're starting to see requests for green information in requests for proposal and that's driving bookings,'' Ms. White of Fairmont said. ''We're seeing corporate accounts coming to us with questionnaires and surveys.'' She said she now filled out one or two every week. 
 Gregory Papajohn, a spokesman for American Express Business Travel, agreed. ''Big picture, there is interest in ecologically sensitive corporate travel programs,'' he said. ''We're seeing an increase in requests for ecological views and credentials and capabilities.''
 Mr. Anderson of the Crowne Plaza in Atlanta said that with global warming at the back of everyone's mind, ''It's just an awareness thing,'' adding, ''It's the environment we live in.''

HEADLINE: Closing the Justice Gap

 BODY:
Here's another way the rich are different from the poor: They have lawyers. Poor people can count on free legal aid in criminal cases, but in civil proceedings -- battles with landlords, employers, government bureaucracies -- justice costs money, which means lots of people have to do without it. 
 The excellent news is that Gov. Eliot Spitzer is adding tens of millions of dollars in new spending for civil legal services. He has done it through a simple regulatory change. It will take New York's main source of money for civil legal services -- the interest earned in special accounts that law firms use to temporarily hold clients' fees -- and quintuple it, by requiring banks to pay competitive interest rates.
 Mr. Spitzer has also broken with past practice by including money for civil legal services in his executive budget and working with the Legislature to ensure that legal services have a reliable source of financing. This is especially important at a time when federal support for civil legal services has lagged. Kudos should also go to the largest of the 80 banks that participate in the program, JPMorgan Chase, which agreed to comply with the new interest-rate rules before they take effect. 
 For the nonprofit legal agencies that help thousands of poor New Yorkers, the money will be a godsend. Organizations like Legal Services of the Hudson Valley, which stretches its thin budget over seven counties, will no longer have to turn away about half the people who come to it for help -- a typical ratio in this line of work. In sparsely served areas upstate, the money will help traveling lawyers, riding a circuit like old-time preachers and peddlers, to bring more people into the civil justice system.
 The benefits are widespread, since each dollar for legal assistance saves many that would be spent on other social services. People unfairly rejected for Medicaid wind up in emergency rooms. Families that can't fight unfair evictions end up in homeless shelters. By finally patching the state's threadbare legal safety net, Mr. Spitzer is doing right by all New Yorkers, poor, rich and in-between.

HEADLINE: Mending Fences at World Bank

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24 

 BODY:
For years, rumors of corruption surrounded an ambitious World Bank project for a system of reservoirs and water tunnels in the mountains of Lesotho in southern Africa. In 2002, the project director was convicted of graft and sent to jail.
 But it took the bank another four years to bar two engineering companies that were convicted on bribery charges from getting future contracts, during which time they collected $14 million in fees from the bank.
 Combating corruption was a signature issue for Paul D. Wolfowitz in his two stormy years as bank president. Last year, he hailed the belated blacklisting of the companies on the Lesotho project as helping to ensure ''that precious public resources go to help the poor, for whom they are intended.''
 But the corruption issue was also a source of anger at the bank that contributed to Mr. Wolfowitz's forced resignation last month amid charges of favoritism toward his girlfriend, who had worked for the bank. Some bank officials fear, and others hope, that with his departure the issue will fade. All indications are, however, that his successor, Robert B. Zoellick, will not let that happen. 
 ''Corruption is a cancer that steals from the poor, eats away at governance and moral fiber and destroys trust,'' Mr. Zoellick said. ''The challenge is how best to clean corruption out. That's what the World Bank must diagnose, determine and execute in concert with developing and developed countries.''
 [On Monday, Mr. Zoellick, 53, was elected president of the World Bank and will formally take over on Sunday.]
 As chief of the bank, which is charged with helping poor nations develop their economies and improve social conditions, Mr. Zoellick will face the challenge of repairing shattered relationships within the institution and between management and the board, which represents the countries that contribute to its operations. He will also need to raise about $30 billion from those countries to rebuild the bank's program of providing interest-free loans to the world's poorest countries. 
 Mr. Zoellick has vowed in private meetings to press an anticorruption agenda but also to avoid Mr. Wolfowitz's mistakes, like cutting off money and punishing poor people dependent on bank programs in countries that happen to be poorly governed, bank officials said.
 Mr. Zoellick, a former top trade envoy and deputy secretary of state under President Bush, said he believed that much of the controversy under Mr. Wolfowitz swirled around the perception that he cared more about corruption than about fighting poverty. In addition, Suzanne Rich Folsom, who was appointed by Mr. Wolfowitz to run the office of institutional integrity, has drawn fire for her management style.
 Under Ms. Folsom's leadership, the department received a 50 percent increase in funding and an expanded mandate to investigate corruption cases. Defenders of Ms. Folsom said that it was inevitable that she would be unpopular, while critics said she had trampled on employee rights and had been selective in her inquiries.
 ''There are definitely tensions in the system,'' Mr. Zoellick said in an interview. ''What I've found is a high degree of distrust over the real purpose of the anticorruption campaign. Our challenge now is to find real guidelines that can restore everyone's trust and assure governments that the bank is not wasting money.''
 How much corruption exists is a matter of conjecture. A former top official, requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, estimated that it might affect as many as 40 percent of bank projects, at least in small ways. Others said the money lost to graft might not be more than a small share of the bank's lending.
 No one disputes that in its 60-year existence, the bank did not do much about corruption until a decade ago, when James D. Wolfensohn, who was then the bank president, made combating it a priority.
 The department of institutional integrity was established only seven years ago. It has barred 148 individuals and 190 companies from doing business with the bank. In an institution that employs 10,000 workers, 74 employees have been cited for cases of fraud and corruption.
 In recent years, the bank has gone beyond specific cases and started investigations into pervasive corruption problems in Vietnam, Indonesia, Kenya, Cambodia and India. 
 In India, for example, the investigation persuaded Mr. Wolfowitz to slow three projects worth nearly $700 million that combated tuberculosis and provided maternal and child health care. The inquiry found bid-rigging in procurement of pharmaceuticals that appeared to have been condoned, or to have involved, top government officials.
 But when Mr. Wolfowitz suspended funding for these programs, some officials in the bank and at the British development office, which was a co-sponsor of the health projects, protested that innocent sick people would suffer. They forced a rewriting of the rules curbing the ability of the bank president to suspend funding unilaterally.
 Mr. Wolfowitz also angered colleagues at the World Bank when he suspended funding for Uzbekistan over allegations of human rights abuses. Some officials said that he was influenced by Uzbekistan's decision to bar American warplanes from its airspace.
 In Vietnam, the bank's integrity division decided to investigate pervasive corruption problems after a scandal last year involving charges of theft, bribery and nepotism in a road-building project. Vietnamese prosecutors charged that road-building money lined the pockets of officials and also went to pay for gambling and prostitutes.
 The institutional integrity reviews, however grounded in realities, have left a legacy of tension between the anticorruption investigators and the rest of the bank. Many officials at the bank said that some of their colleagues believed that minor graft was a small price to pay to speed vitally needed programs for the poor.
 ''Relations between the bank staff and the department have really soured in the last two years,'' said a former top official of the institutional integrity unit. ''There is a lot of pushback from everyone at the bank, because of the us-against-them attitude created by Wolfowitz.''
 Christopher B. Burnham, a former United Nations under secretary general for management, said that Mr. Zoellick must figure out how to enlist suspicious bank officials in his agenda. ''International bodies operate by consensus,'' Mr. Burnham said. ''He has to bring everybody along with him.''
 Mr. Zoellick has not signaled his intentions about Ms. Folsom's office, according to bank officials, other than to say that he has learned of the distrust between her and others. For example, the bank's staff association, which represents the bulk of its employees, has accused her office of trampling on the rights of employees and investigating some unfairly.
 In addition, the bank's 24-member board has raised concerns about what directors say is a backlog of uncompleted investigations and a decline in the number of cases closed.
 In an interview, Ms. Folsom said that in the last two years the department had moved to ''a new level of processing cases,'' overhauling its procedures, including a program for companies and individuals to disclose graft voluntarily to avoid even harsher sanctions.
 Still, she said, ''this department has been unpopular since its creation seven years ago.''
 ''This type of department is always going to be unpopular. There are going to be some people who just don't want to be bothered.''
 Ms. Folsom's defenders include Mr. Wolfensohn, the former bank president, who enlisted her as an adviser long before Mr. Wolfowitz put her in charge of the integrity unit.
 In an interview, Mr. Wolfensohn praised Ms. Folsom as an ''extraordinarily competent'' official who had been ''unnecessarily damaged'' by the controversy surrounding Mr. Wolfowitz.
 ''The fact is, there is corruption in all international aid activities,'' Mr. Wolfensohn said. ''It's not a surprise that in some countries, it becomes excessive and you shouldn't do business with them.''
 The furor over Ms. Folsom, and Mr. Wolfowitz's actions following her findings, led last year to the establishment of an outside review of the anticorruption efforts by a group headed by Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman. The review is to be completed by September, prompting speculation at the bank that it might lead to Ms. Folsom's departure.
 But Mr. Volcker said in an interview that he did not expect the review to single out individual performances.
 ''We'll be drawing some conclusions, but we're not going to point fingers at particular individuals,'' Mr. Volcker said in an interview.
 Mr. Wolfensohn said that he had conferred at length with Mr. Zoellick and that he believed the new president seemed to be going about the issue in the right way.
 ''He is already reaching out,'' Mr. Wolfensohn said. ''He understands that you have to return the bank to its main thrust, which is development on behalf of the poor.
 ''As one of the elements, you want to combat corruption,'' Mr. Wolfensohn added. ''But you can't make the bank into the attorney general of the world.''

HEADLINE: 28-Mile Virtual Fence Is Rising Along the Border

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: SASABE, Ariz., June 21 

 BODY:
If the effort to catch people illegally crossing the border here in the southern Arizona desert is a cat-and-mouse struggle, the Homeland Security Department says it has a smarter cat.
 It comes in the form of nine nearly 100-foot-tall towers with radar, high-definition cameras and other equipment rising from the mesquite and lava fields around this tiny town.
 Known as Project 28, for the 28 miles of border that the towers will scan, the so-called virtual fence forms the backbone of the Secure Border Initiative, known as SBInet, a multibillion-dollar mix of technology, manpower and fencing intended to control illegal border crossings. 
 If successful, hundreds of such towers could dot the 6,000 miles of the Mexican and Canadian borders. 
 But glitches with the radar and cameras have forced the project to miss its June 13 starting date, just as Congress focuses anew on border security in the Senate measure to overhaul immigration law.
 Officials at the Homeland Security Department insist that Boeing, which has a $67 million contract to develop the project and others, will soon put it back on track, though they are not providing a new completion date. 
 Boeing referred requests for comment to the department.
 ''We are making good progress,'' the executive director of the border program, Gregory Giddens, said. 
 Democrats in Congress are questioning why the problems were not disclosed at a hearing on the project on June 7. It was only afterward, in communication to Congressional staff members, that the delays came to light.
 ''The department's failure to be forthcoming and the repeatedly slipping project deadlines not only impede Congress' ability to provide appropriate oversight of the SBInet program, but also undermine the department's credibility with respect to this initiative,'' Representatives Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, and Loretta Sanchez of California, chairwoman of a border subcommittee, both Democrats, wrote in a letter on June 19 to the department. 
 In a report in February, the Government Accountability Office warned that Congress needed to keep a tight rein on the program, because, it said, ''SBInet runs the risk of not delivering promised capabilities and benefits on time and within budget.'' 
 Officials estimate total cost of the initiative through 2011 at $7.6 billion. The accountability office has suggested that figure is too low.
 Boeing won the contract, which includes $20 million for Project 28, in September and has undertaken it with a sense of urgency, Mr. Giddens said, adding that he would prefer a delay over starting the project with malfunctioning equipment.
 Rather than develop new technology, Boeing took existing cameras, sensors, radar and other equipment and bundled them into a system that although not technologically novel is unlike anything the Border Patrol now uses.
 The cameras, set off by radar, are to beam high-quality images of targets miles away to field commanders and agents, making it possible to determine almost instantly whether they are watching a family outing or a group of illegal immigrants. 
 The information is to flow over a high-speed wireless network into laptops in dozens of Border Patrol vehicles that, in theory, would respond quicker and more efficiently to breaches than they do now.
 ''We are living the dividing line between the old Border Patrol and the new patrol of the future,'' said David Aguilar, chief of the Border Patrol.
 ''It will not only detect, but identify what the incursion is,'' Mr. Aguilar added, a step up from the existing ground sensors, fence cameras and footprint tracking that can lead to ''false positives.'' 
 With much of the 2,000-mile-long Mexican border a wilderness of plains, plunging ravines and soaring craggy hills, officials consider virtual fencing a pragmatic improvement to far-flung agents and physical fences -- 88 miles now have primary fencing -- that illegal immigrants knock down, bore through and slip over and under.
 The towers are ringed with a six-foot-tall chain-link fence, and the Border Patrol can warn people away through a loudspeaker. Private guards are at the towers now. 
 On Thursday morning at a tower north of here, a reporter and a photographer walked right up to the tower, observing and photographing it for several minutes with no guard in sight.
 Mr. Aguilar said he was not concerned about such access, speculating that no threat was discerned or the cameras were not turned on then. 
 Residents near the towers have raised concerns, questioning why most towers are miles from the border and whether they will allow unscrupulous agents to peer into their bedrooms.
 ''We don't live in clusters,'' said Roger Beal, who runs a grocery store in the isolated town of Arivaca, the site of a tower and about 10 miles from the border. ''The homes here are not 10 feet apart. People value their privacy here, and we are just not used to being observed. Do it at the border. This isn't it.''
 Mr. Aguilar, the Border Patrol chief, said: ''We are members of the community. We recognize their sensitivity. But we feel confident our officers are going to follow policy and common sense. Can I guarantee you nothing is going to happen? No, we are all human.''
 Although the towers are in a region with heavy traffic in smuggling, Boeing chose to place them close to existing roads and away from the most rugged terrain to help captures.
 Mr. Aguilar said the towers did not need to be right on the border, suggesting that traffickers would find it difficult to move their routes undetected in the rough terrain even if they figured out the locations of the towers. The expected locations have been published in a public environmental assessment. 
 The virtual fence is one piece of a flurry of border enforcement. The Border Patrol said it was on pace to hire thousands of agents, with the goal of a total of 18,000 by the end of 2008, up from just under 12,000 in 2006, when President Bush announced the push. 
 In addition, officials expect to have 370 miles of physical fencing by the end of next year. Drug seizures are increasing, and arrests for illegal immigration have dropped since last summer, when the National Guard arrived to supplement agents. 
 Though scholars say an array of factors, including economic and social trends in Latin America and the vagaries of the drug trade could explain the trends, Mr. Aguilar said they vindicated the stricter enforcement. 
 After the system is fully functioning, he said, ''the net will be very, very tight.''

To the Editor:
 We agree with your June 20 editorial ''China and the Chest Thumpers'' that our domestic practices are significantly to blame for our exploding trade deficit and other imbalances. None of us have ever argued that being tough with China or other trading partners will cure all our economic and budget ills. But making sure that we have up-to-date tools to enforce the rules of the international economy is critical to the strength of American industry and the stability of the global economy. 
 Our country-neutral legislation is consistent with World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund principles. Our bill puts some real teeth back into our currency exchange rate oversight laws to make sure that these principles are respected, particularly on the serious issue of currency misalignment. We are pro-trade. Those who do not play by the global trade rules are the problem. 
 The point of our bipartisan legislation is not to dictate any particular result for any particular country, but to encourage countries that have made particular promises to follow the rules. When major trading partners intervene in the currency market to obtain an unfair advantage, it hurts the United States economy and undermines the support for open international trade.
 We all agree that China is not ready to float its currency overnight. But all of us -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- see the harm of China's current currency practices. We believe that China could speed the pace of reform without disrupting its domestic growth -- and that it has an obligation to do so under the rules that govern the global economy.

HEADLINE: Labor Coalitions Divided On Immigration Overhaul

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Now that President Bush has rallied Republicans to try again to reshape the immigration laws, supporters of the effort have a new worry. When the bill returns to the Senate floor, probably next week, opposition from labor unions could doom the bill's prospects by putting pressure on many Democrats to vote against it.
 The threat that labor poses to the bill has gone largely unrecognized in part because three prominent unions -- the service employees, the farm workers, and the hotel, restaurant and apparel workers -- have backed the legislation. But that support, advocates say, has been outweighed by opposition from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and virtually all other unions, including auto workers, Teamsters, food and commercial workers, and construction unions. 
 ''The labor opposition on this bill is extremely important,'' said Tamar Jacoby, an immigration expert at the conservative Manhattan Institute. ''For this bill to pass, we probably need 80 percent of the Democrats, if not more, to support it, and if unions are what pull them off the bill or make their support soft, that is a serious threat to the bill.''
 The split between the three unions and the rest of labor reflects fundamentally different views of what is best for the future of the labor movement. 
 Supporters of the bill say that the A.F.L.-C.I.O., in opposing the legislation, is focused on protecting the gains that its mostly middle-class members have made in pay and benefits over the decades. To the labor federation, the big worry is that the bill's guest worker provision will pull down wages, take away jobs from Americans and exploit immigrants. 
 The three unions that favor the bill also dislike the guest worker program but are willing to support the bill to pursue a larger goal: a path to legalization for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in this country. The three unions, which represent many janitors, farm laborers and hotel housekeepers, have high percentages of members who are immigrants. They also recognize that it will be far easier to unionize immigrants -- perhaps the most fertile ground for labor's growth -- when illegal immigrants are given legal status.
 The three unions argue that the best strategy to help the nation's immigrants is to push forward with the bill, however flawed, in the hope that it will be improved by the House. ''We think burying the issue and ignoring it would be a terrible mistake for the country and the economy,'' said John W. Wilhelm, president of the hospitality division of Unite Here, which represents hotel, restaurant and apparel workers. ''We don't support the bill in its present form, but we think that the process is best served if the bill passes out of the Senate and the legislative process continues.''
 But the A.F.L.-C.I.O. asserts that the bill is so flawed that it should be killed. 
 ''We really have major concerns, and the concerns increase each day because the bill is getting worse instead of better,'' said John J. Sweeney, the labor federation's president, who called the bill overly punitive. ''The bill's guest worker provisions pit workers against other workers. It creates a new underclass of workers.''
 The federation continues to battle the bill despite amendments proposed to address labor's objections. The Senate voted to halve the guest worker program, to 200,000 workers a year, and to phase it out after five years.
 ''The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s hostility surprises me,'' said Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a liberal group that supports the bill. The service workers' union and Unite Here, Mr. Sharry said, ''are forward looking, they're trying to figure out how do you improve workers' rights in an era of globalization and do more than protect aging members.''
 Labor's split over the bill reflects tensions between the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the breakaway Change to Win labor federation; the three unions backing the bill belong to the rival federation.
 Eliseo Medina, an executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, said the bill would help not only immigrants, but also labor unions. 
 ''We have thousands of members who are undocumented who would have legal status,'' said Mr. Medina, the son of a bracero worker from Mexico. ''Second, it will allow workers who want to organize to do so without the fear of deportation, and that helps unionization drives. It's not just a question of helping us as labor; it helps all workers because if you have a significant number of workers without any rights, that suppresses wages for everybody.''

HEADLINE: Worthy Goal Of Flawed Bill: Aiding Unions

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
In the spring of 1949, the men who ran the steelworkers' union decided to pick a fight over health insurance and pensions.
 The Supreme Court had issued an order in April of that year giving labor unions the right to negotiate over pensions, just as they could negotiate over wages and work rules. Three weeks later, the United Steelworkers union said it was ready to strike if steel companies did not agree to new contracts. 
 At first, steel executives put up a united front. They agreed to contribute some money to pensions, as well as health insurance, but not nearly as much as the workers were demanding. ''The truth of the matter is that American industry alone cannot afford to pay the cost of adequate insurance and pension programs for employees,'' Irving S. Olds, the chairman of United States Steel, said in a speech in Erie, Pa. 
 President Harry S. Truman persuaded the union to delay the strike three times, but on the first day of October -- in a move that is hard to imagine today -- 500,000 steelworkers walked off the job. The Ford Motor Company soon had to announce that it would shut down production by Nov. 15 because of a lack of steel. General Motors, Chrysler and other big manufacturers found themselves in a similar position. 
 And just like that, the steel industry caved. One by one, steel companies began agreeing in early November to much of what the union had demanded: annual pensions of at least $10,000 (in today's dollars) for any retiree with 25 years or more on the job, as well as health insurance for workers. 
 The strike proved to be a turning point for health benefits and pensions. They had existed in limited form for decades, but the new steel contracts helped lay the groundwork for the modern system of workplace benefits. 
 I was inspired to look into this bit of history by the run-up to yesterday's Senate vote on a union organizing bill. For years, union leaders have been pushing for a law that would make it easier for them to organize new members, and with the Democrats back in control of Congress, the House passed such a bill in March. 
 The measure would have increased the penalties against companies that used illegal tactics to keep out unions, and it would have forced arbitration on companies that failed to reach a contract with a new union. Most important, it would have made it easier for a union to be certified. If more than half of the employees at a work site signed cards saying they wanted a union, they would get one. They would no longer have to go through an up-or-down secret ballot election as well.
 This last item is the one that the bill's critics -- business lobbyists, the Bush administration, Republican leaders in Congress -- have focused on. Without the secret ballot, they say, pro-union workers will intimidate others into signing cards. 
 Cleverly, the critics have been passing out a letter that George Miller, a California Democrat who sponsored the bill, wrote in 2001 about a labor dispute in Mexico: ''The secret ballot is absolutely necessary in order to ensure that workers are not intimidated into voting for a union they might not otherwise choose,'' it said.
 I think it's pretty clear that the bill's opponents have the stronger argument here. In the best of worlds, secret ballots are simply fairer. And yesterday, the bill effectively died, when only 51 senators -- every Democrat in attendance plus Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican -- voted to cut off debate and move the bill forward. Sixty votes are needed to do so in the Senate, permitting the opponents to claim victory. 
 ''The current system has been working well for a long time,'' Jason Straczewski, a lobbyist at the National Association of Manufacturers, told me. 
 That, of course, is a much broader argument than the one about secret ballots. It is also a much weaker argument. The fact is, a lot of Americans don't think the economy is working well enough right now. Fewer than half believe that their children will enjoy better living standards than they do, polls show. Over the course of the last 30 years, wages for most workers have grown significantly faster than inflation only once: during the bubbly economy of the late '90s.
 Thanks to a large body of economic research, we can get a sense for how much the decline of unions has to do with these larger economic trends. Unions, the research has shown, do not do much to affect the overall performance of the economy, one way or the other. ''Do unions raise or reduce productivity,'' Richard B. Freeman, a Harvard economist, asked in his recent book, ''America Works,'' an excellent overview of the labor market. ''The evidence is clear: they do not.''
 But if they don't change the size of the economic pie, they do influence how it's divvied up. All else equal, a union worker makes about 15 percent more per hour than a nonunion worker and also gets better benefits. So while there are many reasons inequality has increased over the last three decades -- like technology and global trade -- the decline of unions is certainly one of them. 
 Since 1980, as union membership has dropped sharply, the share of economic output going to corporate profits has more than doubled. The share going to workers' compensation, meanwhile, fell to a 41-year low last year. 
 Yet it can still be tempting to think of labor unions as an antagonistic relic of an industrial economy -- and to forget about their lingering impact. I did exactly this in a column a few months back, when I suggested that the wage freeze of World War II was responsible for the rise of pensions and health insurance. The wage freeze indeed played a role, but, as a reader, John Hoerr, pointed out to me, unions still had to force the issue. World War II had been over for more than four years when the steelworkers went on strike.
 Over the last generation, companies have become far more aggressive about keeping out unions. They have required workers to attend antiunion talks, darkly warned that unions lead to lower pay and lost jobs and, as Wal-Mart Stores has done, sometimes closed entire departments or stores in the wake of unionization drives. In short, companies have been unwilling to let workers make a decision on the merits. 
 Traditional unions, of course, haven't exactly distinguished themselves lately. (I'm in one and can attest to their shortcomings. Filing a health claim sometimes resembles a journey through Wonderland.) As Mr. Freeman argues, the future may lie with nimbler, less confrontational groups, like the worker committees in Australia, Canada, England and elsewhere.
 The problem with the Senate bill was that it tried to solve one problem by creating another. But its larger aim -- cracking down on antiunion attacks -- makes a lot of sense. The playing field between companies and workers is not level today, and the results are plain to see. 
 It is no coincidence that the very things the steelworkers demanded in 1949 -- on-the-job pensions and health insurance -- are slowly going the way of labor unions.

HEADLINE: Delay in Buyout Bond Sale

 BODY:
US Foodservice, the American unit of the Dutch supermarket Royal Ahold, has postponed its sale of $650 million in bonds that were expected to finance the unit's equity buyout, people involved in the transition said yesterday.
Before the decision, US Foodservice had twice scaled back its debt offering to help finance its $7.1 billion buyout by the equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Clayton Dubilier & Rice. The decision comes as investors in the debt that supports these transactions have begun seeking higher interest rates and imposing tougher terms. 
 This week, two other buyouts, the $4.7 billion deal for ServiceMaster and the $6.9 billion sale of Dollar General, are expected to price their bonds.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Falls; So Do Sales of New Homes

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Consumer confidence slid in June amid concern that high gasoline prices and a slumping housing industry might be undermining the job market.
The Conference Board reported yesterday that its consumer confidence index, intended to measure how shoppers feel about the economy and employment, fell to the lowest level in almost a year. 
 In another report, the Commerce Department said that sales of new homes dropped in May for the fourth time in the last five months.
 Both pieces of the economic puzzle fit into a market already concerned about increasing prices, interest rates and economic growth ahead of a two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve that begins today. The Fed is expected to keep the benchmark short-term interest rate steady at 5.25 percent, but investors are watching for clues about future moves.
 The Conference Board, based in New York, said that the consumer confidence index fell almost five points, to 103.9, from a revised 108.5 in May, reaching the lowest level since August 2006, when the reading was 100.2. Analysts had expected a reading of 106.
 Lynn Franco, director of the board's Consumer Research Center, said in a statement, ''A perceived softening in present-day business and employment conditions are the major reasons behind this month's pullback in confidence.'' 
 Another Conference Board gauge, called the present situation, which measures how shoppers feel about economic conditions, fell to 127.9, from 136.1 in May.
 Still another, the expectations index, measuring shoppers' outlook for the next six months, declined to 87.9, from 90.1.
 Economists watch consumer confidence data because such retail spending accounts for a major share of United States economic activity. Retailers have had sluggish sales because of the weaker housing market and the significant rise in gasoline prices.
 ''There are a lot of things weighing on consumer confidence,'' said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons.
 Mr. Thayer said that although consumers were worried about jobs, the employment situation remained healthy. He warned, however, that the longer that gasoline prices remained high and the housing market stayed weak, the more the perception would grow that the job market was shrinking.
 In its report, the Commerce Department said that sales of new single-family homes fell in May by 1.6 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 915,000 units.
 The median price of a new home sold in May was $236,100, down 0.9 percent from the price a year earlier. 
 The slump in sales affected most parts of the country. Sales were down 11 percent in the Northeast, 7.3 percent in the South and 1.9 percent in the West. The only region of the country that reported an increase was the Midwest, where sales jumped 30.8 percent.
 On Monday, the National Association of Realtors said existing-home sales declined in May by 0.3 percent, to 5.99 million units.

HEADLINE: Canada's Policy On Immigrants Brings Backlog

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MASON and JULIA PRESTON. 
Christopher Mason reported from Toronto, and Julia Preston from New York.

DATELINE: TORONTO, June 26 

 BODY:
With an advanced degree in business management from a university in India and impeccable English, Salman Kureishy is precisely the type of foreigner that Canada's merit-based immigration system was designed to attract.
 Yet eight years went by from the time Mr. Kureishy passed his first Canadian immigration test until he moved from India to Canada. Then he had to endure nine months of bureaucratic delays before landing a job in his field in March.
 Mr. Kureishy's experience -- and that of Canada's immigration system -- offers a cautionary tale for the United States. Mr. Kureishy came to this country under a system Canada pioneered in the 1960s that favors highly skilled foreigners, by assigning points for education and work experience and accepting those who earn high scores. 
 A similar point system for the United States is proposed in the immigration bill that bounced back to life on Tuesday, when the Senate reversed a previous stand and brought the bill back to the floor. The vote did not guarantee passage of the bill, which calls for the biggest changes in immigration law in more than 20 years. 
 The point system has helped Canada compete with the United States and other Western powers for highly educated workers, the most coveted immigrants in high-tech and other cutting-edge industries. But in recent years, immigration lawyers and labor market analysts say, the Canadian system has become an immovable beast, with a backlog of more than 800,000 applications and waits of four years or more. 
 The system's bias toward the educated has left some industries crying out for skilled blue-collar workers, especially in western Canada where Alberta's busy oil fields have generated an economic boom. Studies by the Alberta government show the province could be short by as many as 100,000 workers over the next decade.
 In response, some Canadian employers are sidestepping the point system and relying instead on a program initiated in 1998 that allows provincial governments to hand-pick some immigrant workers, and on temporary foreign-worker permits.
 ''The points system is so inflexible,'' said Herman Van Reekum, an immigration consultant in Calgary who helps Alberta employers find workers. ''We need low-skill workers and trades workers here, and those people have no hope under the points system.''
 Canada accepts about 250,000 immigrants each year, more than doubling the per-capita rate of immigration in the United States, census figures from both countries show. Nearly two-thirds of Canada's population growth comes from immigrants, according to the 2006 census, compared with the United States, where about 43 percent of the population growth comes from immigration. Approximately half of Canada's immigrants come through the point system.
 Under Canada's system, 67 points on a 100-point test is a passing score. In addition to education and work experience, aspiring immigrants earn high points for their command of languages and for being between 21 and 49 years old. In the United States, the Senate bill would grant higher points for advanced education, English proficiency and skills in technology and other fields that are in demand. Lower points would be given for the family ties that have been the basic stepping stones of the American immigration system for four decades.
 Part of the backlog in Canada can be traced to a provision in the Canadian system that allows highly skilled foreigners to apply to immigrate even if they do not have a job offer. Similarly, the Senate bill would not require merit system applicants to have job offers in the United States, although it would grant additional points to those who do.
 Without an employment requirement, Canada has been deluged with applications. In testimony in May before an immigration subcommittee of the United States House of Representatives, Howard Greenberg, an immigration lawyer in Toronto, compared the Canadian system to a bathtub with an open faucet and a clogged drain. ''It is not surprising that Canada's bathtub is overflowing,'' Mr. Greenberg said. 
 Since applications are not screened first by employers, the government bears the burden and cost of assessing them. The system is often slow to evaluate the foreign education credentials and work experience of new immigrants and to direct them toward employers who need their skills, said Jeffrey Reitz, professor of immigration studies at the University of Toronto.
 The problem has been acute in regulated professions like medicine, where a professional organization, the Medical Council of Canada, reviews foreign credentials of new immigrants. The group has had difficulty assessing how a degree earned in China or India stacks up against a similar degree from a university in Canada or the United States. Frustrated by delays, some doctors and other highly trained immigrants take jobs outside their fields just to make ends meet.
 The sheer size of the Canadian point system, the complexity of its rules and its backlogs make it slow to adjust to shifts in the labor market, like the oil boom in Alberta.
 ''I am a university professor, and I can barely figure out the points system,'' said Don J. DeVoretz, an economics professor at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia who studies immigration systems. ''Lawyers have books that are three feet thick explaining the system.''
 The rush to develop the oil fields in northern Alberta has attracted oil companies from around the world, unleashing a surge of construction. Contractors say that often the only thing holding them back is a shortage of qualified workers.
 Scott Burns, president of Burnco Rock Products in Calgary, a construction materials company with about 1,000 employees, said he had been able to meet his labor needs only by using temporary work permits. Mr. Burns hired 39 Filipinos for jobs in his concrete plants and plans to hire more. He said that many of the temporary workers had critically needed skills, but that they had no hope of immigrating permanently under the federal point system.
 ''The system is very much broken,'' Mr. Burns said. 
 Mr. Kureishy, the immigrant from India, said he was drawn to Canada late in his career by its open society and what appeared to be strong interest in his professional abilities. But even though he waited eight years to immigrate, the equivalent of a doctoral degree in human resources development that he earned from Xavier Labor Relations Institute in India was not evaluated in Canada until he arrived here. During his first six months, Canadian employers had no formal comparison of his credentials to guide them. 
 Eventually, Mr. Kureishy, 55, found full-time work in his field, as a program manager assisting foreign professionals at Ryerson University in Toronto. ''It was a long process, but I look at myself as fairly resilient,'' Mr. Kureishy said.
 He criticized Canada as providing little support to immigrants after they arrived. 
 ''If you advertised for professors and one comes over and is driving a taxi,'' he said, ''that's a problem.''

HEADLINE: Paving the Way for Hotels in Hell's Kitchen

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
The pioneering San Francisco-based Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group, which worked its way eastward, is looking west again -- this time to Hell's Kitchen.
An originator of the boutique hotel concept, Kimpton manages two hotels in Manhattan: 70 Park Avenue and the Muse, at 130 West 46th Street. Next spring, it will open a new $125 million hotel with 222 guest rooms at 653 11th Avenue, entering an area of the Far West Side of Manhattan that is distant from any existing hotels.
 Converting a 1930's printing plant on the west side of the avenue between 47th Street and 48th Streets and adding three floors, Kimpton will create the Vu, called that because of its 360-degree unobstructed vistas of the Hudson River and New Jersey, facing west, and the Midtown Manhattan skyline, facing east. 
 Owned by Horizen Global, a Manhattan developer of residential buildings, the Vu is the first new Midtown hotel going up far to the west of Times Square. If it is successful -- as many industry executives predict it will be -- it could pave the way for other hotels in the neighborhood. 
 In fact, the Rockrose Development Corporation, which owns a 216,000-square-foot three-story industrial building at 660 12th Avenue, one block northwest of the Vu, which is now a Federal Express sorting center, has been talking to hotel developers for the last six months about leasing the 257,000 square feet of air rights above the building for construction of a hotel, said Patricia Dunphy, vice president.
 The Vu is the latest step in Kimpton's expansion plans. Founded by Bill Kimpton in 1981 with one hotel in San Francisco, it has gradually expanded eastward and into Canada, and today operates 43 hotels in 17 cities.
 The company's chief executive, Michael A. Depatie, has said he wants to double the company's hotels by 2012, and increase its hotels in the New York market to 20 by 2017. In addition to the Vu, it will also manage a new 290-room hotel in a 50-story mixed-use tower at 839 Avenue of the Americas, at 30th Street. As yet unnamed, this hotel will be developed by the JD Carlisle Group and is to open in 2009.
 According to Troy Furbay, Kimpton's senior vice president for acquisitions and development, the company considers the New York metropolitan area ''five, six or seven different markets.'' He added: ''We're trying to put a hotel in every area. We've looked at Brooklyn a bit, maybe Hoboken and the Jersey City area.''
 Although Mr. Furbay said Kimpton initially found Hell's Kitchen ''an odd location'' for a hotel, he said it was won over by what it believes is its growth potential. He said that in recent years the neighborhood has attracted not only residential real estate development, but also grocery stores, bars and restaurants, migrating westward from Ninth Avenue.
 Regret is another factor, he admitted. He said Kimpton looked at a site in what was then the remote meatpacking district five years ago, but decided against going in there; this later became the successful Gansevoort Hotel, at Ninth Avenue and 13th Street.
 On the Far West Side of Midtown, ''we were worried we'd make the same mistake twice,'' he said. ''We didn't want to overlook an area where it wasn't immediately obvious why there was no hotel there.'' 
 The designer of the Vu's interior is the Rockwell Group, which has worked on other Manhattan hotels -- like the W New York and Carlton -- but has never collaborated with Kimpton.
 Rockwell is designing a hotel that will take advantage of the site and the configuration of the existing industrial building, which has oversize windows and high ceilings.
 A three-story addition by the architect Carlos Zapata that is approximately half the size of the roof of the original building is being built atop the existing structure.
 The new 15th floor will hold an 1,800-square-foot glass-enclosed bar -- with 360-degree views of Manhattan and New Jersey and doors that can open in fair weather -- as well as a 230-square-foot rectangular Jacuzzi for guests and decorative reflecting pool. A new 16th floor will contain six guest rooms, including a presidential suite, which will itself be connected by stairs to a new 17th-floor roof deck, with another, smaller Jacuzzi and views.
 Ed Bakos, a principal of the Rockwell Group overseeing the Vu project, said 30 percent of the guest rooms will be junior-suite lofts; these will measure 40 feet long, which he said is eight feet longer than most New York hotel guest rooms, 11 1/2-feet wide and more than 11 feet high. Nine-feet-high windows will be covered by sheer shades, also affording expansive views. 
 Kimpton executives are bullish about the Vu's prospects, pointing to the strength of the overall New York hotel market -- occupancies in the five boroughs in 2005 and 2006 were 85.9 percent and 85.1 percent, respectively, and are projected to rise to 86 percent this year -- and of the Times Square area in particular.
 A number of other new hotels will open in the next few years near Times Square, including two being built in Hell's Kitchen by the McSam Hotel Group: a 198-room Holiday Inn Express at 505 West 43rd Street, and a 144-room hotel at 506 West 44th Street, both opening between 10th and 11th Avenues in the second or third quarter of 2009. 
 Donna Keren, vice president for policy and research for NYC & Company, the tourism marketing organization, is also upbeat about the Vu's prospects.
 She believes it will attract guests attending conventions at the enlarged space for midsize trade shows at Piers 92 and 94, between West 52nd Street and West 54th Street along the Hudson River, being redeveloped by the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
 Already popular for design and fashion shows, this space will be a good fit with Kimpton, Ms. Keren suggested, since the company is known for being ''stylish and cutting-edge.''

HEADLINE: Scant Drug Benefits Called Costly to Employers

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Health penny wise, medical pound foolish?
Employers that shift too much of the cost of drugs to workers in their company health plans could wind up losing more than they save, through absenteeism and lost productivity, according to a study by health policy researchers. 
 The three-year study, to be released today, looked at the medical histories of several thousand workers with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. The condition is a painful and incurable disease of the joints, but patients can keep it at bay by taking a special class of drugs. 
 The cost, as much as $18,000 a year, can be a big expense for employer health plans. Still, putting too much of the cost burden on the employee can evidently backfire.
 Among the 17 employers in the study, conducted by the nonprofit Integrated Benefits Institute, more than half the workers with rheumatoid arthritis were not taking their drugs -- in many cases because they considered the out-of-pocket co-payments too high. 
 As a result, the institute's study found, the employers incurred $17.2 million in costs from lost productivity, 26 percent more than the estimate of what they would have spent if the workers had taken their arthritis drugs. 
 The workers' co-payments were relatively low, averaging $26 for a 30-day supply, indicating a fairly low threshold before out-of-pocket costs prompted workers to forgo medication.
 ''This is an important study,'' said Michael Chernew, a health policy economist at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the arthritis study. ''The basic message is very consistent with all the work we have done: co-pays go up, people use their medications less, and bad things happen.''
 The Integrated Benefits Institute is supported by insurers, drug companies and employers. The information on drug use came from health and disability claims data provided by UnitedHealth Group's Ingenix unit, which did not identify the 17 companies in the study.
 The researchers looked at the number of claims for short-term disability, lasting from a week to six months. Employees who were taking the arthritis pills or injected medications ''were less likely to file a claim,'' said Kimberly Jinnett, research director of the Integrated Benefits Institute who directed the study.
 She said the institute's study would be submitted for publication to a peer-reviewed journal. 
 The arthritis study supports and expands on earlier research that looked at employees of Pitney Bowes, the business services company, and the city government of Asheville, N.C. Those studies found improved productivity and lower medical costs after drug co-payments were reduced or eliminated for diabetes, asthma and heart-related problems. 
 A growing number of large employers are beginning to consider overall costs, by adding productivity measures to their financial calculus for health care. 
 ''The evidence is compelling that we should be looking at the total health care outcomes picture,'' said Dr. Pamela Hymel, the global medical director at the information technology company Cisco Systems, a member of the Integrated Benefits Institute. She said that in her own company's case, studying employees' overall health records had alerted Cisco to costly conditions like depression and muscular and skeletal problems affecting some workers' productivity. The affected employees were encouraged to seek advice from health coaches and to seek treatment, Dr. Hymel said. 
 Chris McSwain, the compensation and benefits director of another institute member, the Scana Corporation, an electric and gas utility company based in Columbia, S.C., said his company was also mining its health claims data. 
 Last fall, he said, Scana began combining all its data, including health and medical, pharmacy and disability costs, as well as information from employees' health questionnaires and programs that manage diseases like diabetes.

HEADLINE: Another Trim in Spending for '07

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
A LEADING forecaster of advertising spending has again lowered his estimate for growth in the United States this year, joining other experts who have also reduced their predictions.
The forecaster, Robert J. Coen, said at a presentation yesterday that he had been overly optimistic about the growth prospects for the American economy in 2007 and the ensuing demand by marketers for commercial time and ad space.
 ''I can't deny it any more; things are pretty bad,'' said Mr. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann in New York, part of the McCann Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. 
 No one ''made me eat the apple,'' he joked. ''It was my own fault.''
 There was a glimmer of brighter days ahead, however, as Mr. Coen forecast a somewhat stronger growth rate in 2008.
 The forecasts from Mr. Coen are closely tracked on Madison Avenue because he has been following spending trends for more than five decades. He typically makes predictions twice a year, revising previous estimates as well as looking ahead.
 In June 2006, Mr. Coen predicted that ad spending in 2007 would total $303 billion. He reduced that figure to $298.8 billion in December. At his presentation yesterday at the McCann Worldgroup office in Midtown Manhattan, he trimmed it further, to $290.3 billion.
 ''The biggest problems are on the local level,'' Mr. Coen said, rather than in spending for ads appearing in national media.
 Mr. Coen attributed that to the shrinking numbers of local retailers like pharmacies and hardware stores as they are bought out or put out of business by big national chains, which is ''eliminating a lot of customers that media sell to locally.''
 Another reason for the slowing local growth, Mr. Coen said, is the migration of local classified advertising to Web sites from newspapers.
 Although some of those Web sites are owned by newspapers, he added, the lower price of online ads means the gains ''are not enough to offset what they're losing'' from higher-priced print ads.
 The shift in classified ads is evidence of decisions by marketers to spend money in new media rather than traditional media. The medium that will enjoy the most robust growth rate this year, according to Mr. Coen's forecast, is the Internet, where he expects spending to be up 17 percent from 2006.
 An Interpublic colleague of Mr. Coen's, Brian Wieser, followed him with a presentation on emerging media, which includes online video, social networking, online game playing, mobile marketing and video-on-demand.
 Although ad spending for those alternative media is now ''de minimis,'' said Mr. Wieser, senior vice president and director for industry analysis at the Magna Global unit of Interpublic, many are growing by double- or even triple-digit percentages.
 For example, spending on ads on social networks like Facebook and MySpace is expected to increase 148.2 percent this year, Mr. Wieser said, to $685 million, from $276 million in 2006.
 That trend may be contributing to indications that growth in ad spending is slowing, because some expenditures in new media are incompletely counted, or missed altogether, by the data-tracking services whose numbers are relied upon by forecasters.
 For example, money spent for search-engine marketing, a fast-growing category in the new media, is not tracked by TNS Media Intelligence, a company whose data Mr. Coen uses.
 Earlier this month, TNS, part of Taylor Nelson Sofres, reduced its forecast for growth in ad spending this year, trimming its estimate to a gain of 1.7 percent, from a 2.6 percent gain forecast in January. TNS executives attributed the revision to a more sluggish economy, cutbacks in spending plans by large advertisers and the hastening shift of ad dollars to more inexpensive media like the Internet. 
 Jon Swallen, research director at TNS in New York, said ''the new digital media are siphoning off money from the traditional media,'' but he added that it was difficult to determine whether that accounted for all of the flow of dollars away from traditional media, or just a portion of it.
 If the new media enable advertisers to run customized ads that work more efficiently and effectively, Mr. Swallen said, ''that may give them a better fix on return on investment.''
 He added: ''And that may translate into them saying, 'We can afford to cut our marketing budget and bring those dollars to the bottom line without hurting our sales goals.' ''
 If Mr. Coen's newest forecast for 2007 of $290.3 billion proves accurate, it would represent an increase in ad spending of 3.1 percent from 2006.
 Last December, Mr. Coen predicted a growth rate for 2007 of 4.8 percent. That was partly predicated on a total for 2006 of $285.1 billion, which he revised downward yesterday to $281.6 billion after further reviewing data from last year.
 In his first forecast for 2008, Mr. Coen estimated that American ad spending would total $305 billion, or 5 percent more than his current estimate for this year.
 The stimulating effects of ad campaigns tied to the Summer Olympics next year, as well as the money to be spent on ads related to the presidential and Congressional elections, should help accelerate growth again, he said.
 Mr. Coen said growth in overseas ad spending would continue to outpace the rate in the United States, as it has since 2003. He predicted that ad spending abroad this year would total $339.8 billion, up 5.2 percent from his final revised figure of $323 billion for 2006.
 In contrast to the United States, Mr. Coen revised upward his overseas figure for last year, reflecting robust growth in countries like Brazil, China and India. 
 In his initial forecast for overseas ad spending next year, Mr. Coen said he expected an increase of 5.9 percent from 2007, to $360 billion.
 The combined revised predictions for 2007 from Mr. Coen are for worldwide ad spending of $630.1 billion, up 4.2 percent from $604.6 billion last year. That was the first time worldwide ad spending has topped $600 billion -- only two years after it passed the $500 billion level.
 Mr. Coen's estimates for 2008 represent worldwide ad spending of $665 billion, which would mean a gain of 5.5 percent from his newest forecasts for 2007.

He also readjusted his final figure for 2006, lowering it to $281.6 billion from an estimate he gave in December of $285.1 billion. (Source by Universal McCann)

HEADLINE: In Silicon Valley, Steady but Cautious Growth Returns

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

DATELINE: REDWOOD CITY, Calif. 

 BODY:
A glittery blue office tower in downtown San Jose may well be the perfect symbol for Silicon Valley's resurgence.
Finished in late 2001, after the technology sector imploded, the building, which cost about $100 million to build, never could find a tenant for its 17 floors. Deals to lure technology companies crumbled. A plan to move San Jose's city hall to the site didn't pan out. And as recently as November, the graphics chip maker Nvidia backed out of a deal to move in.
 It started to look as if the Sobrato Development Companies, the tower's owner, might never find a tenant. But that all changed in February. BEA Systems, a San Jose-based software company that had scrapped plans for building its own campus, bought the tower for $135 million. It expects to move in the first half of next year after it has built out the interior of the glass shell at a cost estimated by Sobrato at $20 million to $25 million.
 ''It was a smarter way to grow,'' said Diana Wong, a spokeswoman for BEA Systems. 
 BEA is not the only company investing in real estate in Silicon Valley, an area extending south from just below San Francisco to San Jose.
 In the last year, Google, Yahoo and Apple have together invested more than $400 million in large blocks of land or buildings where they hope to erect future campuses. Companies like Cisco Systems, which scuttled ambitious plans to erect a 6.6-million-square-foot campus when the area's economy soured, are signing leases for vast amounts of space, some for the first time since the tech bubble burst, as they add employees. 
 The office vacancy rate across the valley stood at 10.1 percent as of March 31, the lowest rate since 2000, according to NAI BT Commercial, a real estate firm.
 Silicon Valley's economy, notorious for its booms and busts as it rode each new wave of technology, is on the upswing again. Led by a variety of industries, including clean energy, biotechnology and new media, the regional economy, this time more sober than speculative, is adding jobs. Last year, the number of new jobs rose by 23,000, the most since 2001, according to the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy.
 Thomson Financial says venture capital investments in Silicon Valley rose to $10.5 billion last year, the highest level since 2001.
 ''I really like the valley now because they're more fundamentally focused on making money than hype,'' said William D. Watkins, chief executive of Seagate Technology, a disk maker in Scotts Valley, Calif.
 Although the economy has improved, it is not back to the level of seven years ago. Around 200,000 jobs, or 20 percent, were eliminated in the valley during the bust, according to the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. Only 50,000 jobs have returned, and most of those have been created in the last two years.
 ''You can see it on the streets and in the restaurants -- there's no question things are up,'' said Stephen Levy, the center's director. ''But it's not 2000.''
 Still, there is no doubt that there is a renewed sense of excitement. Companies are hiring again, restaurants are filling up, and traffic, long considered the bellwether for the local economy, is worsening. 
 Condominium towers are planned or under construction in downtown San Jose; a Four Seasons hotel opened last year in East Palo Alto, an area once known for high crime; and cities like Cupertino are flush again with tax revenue.
 It's a drastic change from 2000, when the tech bubble popped and forced companies to scale back or go under. Thousands of square feet of office space went back on the market, rents dropped and construction dried up. Within a year, the vacancy rate nearly quadrupled, to 12.9 percent, in Silicon Valley, according to NAI BT. It hit a high of 17.5 percent four years ago.
 ''Everything looked good; we built all these buildings and then nobody moved in,'' said Drew Arvay, a managing partner at NAI BT in San Jose.
 Now, however, real estate investors are once again buying, pointing to strong job growth, a lower vacancy rate and higher rents as reasons for their moves. (Rent averages $2.46 a square foot a month in the valley, though it can rise as high as $5.80 in places.)
 One investor, Rreef, Deutsche Bank's property fund manager, made local headlines last year when it paid $1.1 billion for 5.3 million square feet of office space in different areas of the region. The deal, real estate brokers say, was one of the largest in the valley's history.
 ''We think long term that Silicon Valley will be a significant generator of jobs, and that's what we want to see when we invest,'' said James N. Carbone, a partner at Rreef's San Francisco office. The purchase increased Rreef's portfolio by more than 50 percent.
 After sitting on the sidelines for the last few years, developers are starting to build without signed tenants.
 The Jay Paul Company, a private real estate firm in San Francisco, sold half of its portfolio in the last two years so it could buy land and buildings. It used some of that money to start construction on the largest speculative office complex in the valley since the dot-com collapse, Moffett Towers. When complete, Moffett Towers in Sunnyvale will have three eight-story office buildings and four seven-story buildings, totaling 1.8 million square feet. The first two buildings will be ready early next year, and although Jay Paul does not yet have any tenants, that doesn't faze the company.
 ''So many companies got burnt with pre-leases, no one wants to hear about them now,'' said Matt Lituchy, chief investment officer at Jay Paul. At the turn of the century, many companies signed leases in anticipation of growth. But when the dot-com boom ended, the tenants were stuck with space they no longer needed.
 Now, however, Mr. Lituchy said, ''company boards say to their executives, 'Tell us when people are sitting on top of each other, and then we'll talk,' ''
 Jay Paul's gamble is likely to pay off, real estate brokers say, because there are not many large blocks of ultramodern Class A office space available, and there is fierce competition for what exists. It is one reason that Yahoo and Apple have bought significant tracts of land in the last year and have yet to begin construction. In the last two years, Sobrato, which owns nine million square feet of office and research and development space, leased all of its Class A office space, said John Michael Sobrato, a managing partner.
 Nevertheless, persistent problems of transportation, affordable housing, education and difficulty in finding employees could harm the valley's long-term growth if they are not addressed.
 The Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a collection of 210 companies, has been trying to help fix some of those problems through a $32 million private housing trust, a fellowship program for teachers and a lobbying effort for light rail. This year, the organization introduced a program with Intel to provide more advanced training for middle school math teachers to help improve test scores.
 ''Ultimately, if we don't solve these problems, the next waves of technology will be compromised,'' said William Coleman, the group's former chairman as well as chief executive of the Cassatt Corporation, a San Jose software maker. ''If you transfer your competitive advantage somewhere else, you can't ever get it back.''

HEADLINE: 2 Oil Firms Are Defiant In Venezuela

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO and CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON, June 26 -- ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil refused on Tuesday to meet Venezuela's deadline to reach an agreement on ceding control of their major oil production ventures, in what could be their imminent separation from billions of dollars in investments. 
 The possible rupture with the two companies was viewed by oil analysts as a sign that President Hugo Chavez was pressing ahead with efforts to assert greater authority over some of the most coveted oil reserves in the Western Hemisphere. It came after months of negotiations in which several of the world's largest private oil companies tried to salvage some kind of minority ownership role in Venezuela, one of the largest sources of oil for the United States. 
 The possible exit of two major American oil companies from Venezuela may not have an immediate impact on American energy supplies, but any increase in oil prices that does result will only help Mr. Chavez finance his broadening government social policies. 
 A possible vacuum in expertise could eventually be filled by Chinese, Iranian or other state oil companies. In any case, most energy experts believe that the Venezuelan state oil company will be hard pressed to sustain production levels without American expertise. 
 Rafael Ramirez, the Venezuelan energy minister, made the announcement in Caracas. He concluded that the companies had not met the government's deadline to agree to terms under which the government oil company would take majority control over Conoco's investments of about $3.5 billion and Exxon's investments, valued at $800 million.
 Venezuelan officials said that some foreign companies, including Chevron, BP, Total and Statoil, had agreed to cede controlling stakes in their oil ventures to Petroleos de Venezuela, the country's government-owned energy concern. The projects included in the talks are in the Orinoco Belt, an area south of Caracas that is one of the most valued deposits of heavy oil. 
 ''The partners who signed are betting on a secure future in our fatherland,'' Mr. Ramirez told reporters. 
 Still, these companies' acceptance of the new rules in Venezuela and the potential exit of Conoco and Exxon point to concern that developments in Venezuela may influence negotiations over oil and natural gas projects in other countries, from rising African oil producers like Angola to longtime members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries like Iran. 
 ''What happens in Venezuela is something the Russians will look at, and may have bearing on places like Iran, Nigeria and other countries,'' said Amy Myers Jaffe, an oil analyst at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy of Rice University. 
 Oil is at the heart of a broader nationalization push that also includes large telecommunications and electricity companies. Mr. Chavez is trying to give his government a stronger hand in Venezuela's economy even as the oil industry, by far the country's largest source of revenue, struggles to maintain anemic production levels. 
 Michael J. Economides, an oil consultant in Houston, said Venezuela could benefit in the short term if fears over production translate into higher global oil prices. ''If he produces 1 percent less,'' Mr. Economides said in reference to Mr. Chavez, ''the world market responds to that and he gets 20 percent more revenue over a period of time.''
 Industry analysts put Venezuela's output at about 2.3 million barrels a days, including more than 400,000 barrels a day from the heavy oil projects. Venezuela's government says overall production is closer to 3.2 million barrels a day. 
 But with public spending surging under Mr. Chavez and with oil companies from Brazil, China and India hesitant to make major investments in Venezuela while legal uncertainty persists, energy analysts have cautioned that Venezuela's government risks allowing prized reserves to remain underdeveloped. 
 ''The Venezuelans have increased the cost of developing this resource,'' said Roger Tissot, director for Latin America at PFC Energy, a consulting firm, in Washington. ''At the end of the day, the Venezuelan people will pay the price for these decisions.'' 
 Michael S. Goldberg, head of the international dispute resolution group at Baker Botts, a law firm here that represents major oil companies internationally, said he did not think Tuesday's actions were ''necessarily the end of the story.'' He added, ''The prospects of a deal are never over until a sale is made or an arbitrator reaches a decision.'' 
 The investments at stake are large by any measure, with values ranging from $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion for Conoco if Venezuela takes ownership of its heavy oil projects. Exxon stands to lose about $800 million. More than $6 billion may be lost by other private companies, depending on how they are compensated. 
 ''Although the company is hopeful that the negotiations will be successful, it has preserved all legal rights, including international arbitration,'' Conoco said. Exxon also expressed hope that an agreement could be reached that would permit it to continue operating in an ownership role. 
 ''Exxon Mobil is disappointed that we have been unable to reach an agreement on the terms for migration to a mixed enterprise structure,'' the company said. ''However, we continue discussions with the Venezuelan government on a way forward.''
 Should the American companies leave, some of the other multinational companies that remain could eventually take their place. The Venezuelan government has been talking to government-controlled companies from China and other countries about creating new ventures to extract and refine Venezuelan oil. 
 ''Venezuela is now free to find other partners,'' said Mazhar al-Shereidah, a petroleum economist in Caracas. ''I don't think Petroleos de Venezuela can cover all the technical and financial demands of these ventures, but this doesn't constitute a dramatic situation.'' 
 Conoco's shares fell 2.9 percent on Tuesday to $75.80 as investors reacted to the announcements from Caracas. Exxon, which relies less on Venezuela as a portion of its overall output, fell 0.7 percent to $81.82.

HEADLINE: The End of an Era at Bellevue and a Nearby Church

BYLINE: By Jim Dwyer

 BODY:
For 17 years, his feet have hit the sidewalk at 5 a.m., always ahead of the first dash of daylight. Then Philip Marani walks the few blocks from his home on East 28th Street to First Avenue, into Bellevue Hospital Center.
The city is filled with invisible tribes that control hidden, vital trades, and Philip Marani belongs to one of them: an order of Catholic priests known as the Carmelites, who have been chaplains at Bellevue in an unbroken chain since 1889. 
 Like the Mohawk Indian ironworkers who, far from public view, swung high steel to build skyscrapers, the Carmelites at Bellevue have walked jagged peaks of mortality.
 That line slams to a stop this week. The Carmelites have, politely but firmly, been kicked out of their home in the rectory of Our Lady of the Scapular and St. Stephen's on 28th Street as of the end of June. 
 Their eviction is the result of shifting economics in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York that will actually make their old parish quite wealthy. Cardinal Edward Egan has installed a new pastor at Our Lady of the Scapular who is unaffiliated with a religious order and will be directly answerable to the archdiocese, unlike the Carmelites.
 Besides the end of their work at Bellevue, their departure brings to a close a rich and rarely told chapter of the city's history. In the early 20th century, the Carmelite friars in Manhattan sheltered Irish revolutionaries on the run from British authorities, including Eamon de Valera, who became the first prime minister of the Irish republic. In the basement of the priory -- then at 338 East 29th Street -- the Carmelites stashed part of a cache of 600 Thompson submachine guns, wrapped in burlap sacks and bound for Ireland during the war for independence, according to Alfred Isacsson, a Carmelite priest and historian. In June 1921, the guns were brought by launch to a steamship, the East Side, that was docked in Hoboken, N.J., but were seized by federal authorities. 
 For Father Marani, 68, the escapades of Irish partisans held only passing interest. An Italian-American who was born and raised on 28th Street, he attended the parish school run by the Carmelites, found his religious calling on that street, and fully expected to live out his years there. ''I thought I would retire here in four years,'' he said. ''You don't have to worry about a car, you just get on a subway, go where you want.''
 All this week, he has been traipsing across 28th Street for the last few times, unsure who will take up the work at Bellevue that he and other Carmelites have done for 118 years. 
 ''One of my big fears is that whoever comes in after me will eliminate the Sunday Mass in Psychiatry,'' he said. ''Lots of guys are afraid to go up there. One thing, you can't ask rhetorical questions in your homily -- they're going to give you an answer.''
 The news of his departure raced across the hospital grapevine. As the sole Catholic chaplain, he has worked 13-hour days since another Carmelite priest retired, and so is known in every corner. In the intensive-care unit, a nurse approached him earlier this week, eyes brimming. 
 ''I don't know who I'll turn to now,'' she said. ''I'll never forget how you helped.''
 Father Marani tried to soothe her. 
 Later, he noted: ''I'm thinking to myself, 'What did I do for her?' Statistics, on the books, show there's a lot of stress on hospital workers. Whatever that means. Many of them are certainly stressed out.''
 He says daily Mass at 6:30 and at noon. Time is at a premium for hospital workers. ''I try to bring it in at 22 minutes,'' he said. 
 Father Marani visits the intensive-care floor, the neonatal unit, the surgical ward. ''Some people say, 'Get the hell out,' but that's life,'' he said. Many others want to talk or pray or be anointed. The Bellevue emergency room sees 100,000 patients a year; 26,000 people are admitted to beds. It is the oldest public hospital in the country, a cornerstone of New York life, a teeming empire all its own. 
 The chaplain who broke in Father Marani in 1990 had already been at Bellevue for 12 years. His predecessor had been there for 30 years, and it is only a few more Carmelite chaplains back to the 19th century.
 Father Marani visits with families struggling to decide about continuing life support for gravely ill relatives who have no hope of recovery and no ability to survive without mechanical aid like ventilators. ''Vents are a very big issue,'' he said.
 After a patient has died, he will sit with relatives, say a prayer, then suggest that they make their goodbyes. 
 ''I'd see some people throw themselves screaming on the floor, or on top of the body,'' he said. ''I thought I had to save everybody from that. Now I let them grieve whatever way they want.''
 In the emergency room, another nurse spots him.
 ''I have that for you,'' she said.
 ''You really don't need to,'' Father Marani said.
 The nurse made a face, dashed into another room and handed him a bottle wrapped up in a bag.
 He shook his head, gave his thanks. The nurse scooted back into the emergency room. 
 ''Sangria,'' he explained. ''From Spain.''
 The end of the Carmelites at Bellevue has a few parallels to the beginning. The order was brought to New York from Ireland in 1889 after a brutal public schism in which one of the city's most popular priests, the Rev. Dr. Edward McGlynn, rector of St. Stephen's Church, was excommunicated. He had supported Henry George, a Socialist candidate for mayor. The archbishop sent for the Carmelites, in large measure to calm the Irish immigrants who were devoted to McGlynn. His old parish, St. Stephen's, was eventually incorporated into Our Lady of the Scapular, run by the Carmelites. 
 During the last two years, the archdiocese has shut churches where attendance has dwindled. By canon law, when those properties are sold, the proceeds follow the parishioners to their new home. With other nearby churches being closed, ''there is no question that the archdiocese will be putting a good deal of money into St. Stephen's,'' said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese. ''We would also like to have one of our priests, one of our most respected pastors, oversee that. I believe this was an amicable change.''
 The Carmelites do not seem to agree. The five who live on 28th Street will be dispersed to other parishes in the region, with two being assigned to a church on the Upper East Side. At a recent Mass to mark the departure of the Carmelites, the Rev. Michael Kissane, the provincial general of the Carmelites in the New York area, gave no sign that it had been a friendly decision. 
 ''What can I tell you when our anger shakes us to the core and tempts us to despise some of our brothers in Christ?'' he asked, going on to urge the parishioners to support the new pastor.
 The archdiocese will assign another priest to serve as Bellevue's chaplain, Mr. Zwilling said. As for Father Marani, he will be moving to a Carmelite parish in Tarrytown, N.Y. He already knows that an express train will get him into Midtown in less than 40 minutes. He still has Bellevue on the brain and frets over the success of any priest who will follow him and a century-long line of Carmelites along life's jagged peaks at the hospital.
 ''This can't be seen as a job,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Residents Returning, but Blaze Is Stubborn

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY. 
Kathryn Reed contributed reporting.

DATELINE: SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif., June 26 

 BODY:
As residents began to trickle back to their homes to inspect the damage caused by a weekend wildfire near here, two Forest Service firefighters were trapped for nearly an hour on Tuesday after the stubborn blaze jumped a defensive fire line and threatened two neighborhoods on this town's western edge.
 Both firefighters managed to escape uninjured, but the breach in the fire line and the prospect of four days of high winds starting Wednesday led fire officials here to back off earlier predictions that the fire could be completely contained by Sunday. 
 ''Whenever we have strong winds, nature tends to rule over the firefighter,'' said Rich Hawkins, the Forest Service's incident commander. 
 About 400 people were advised to evacuate as the wind kicked up after about 36 hours of only light breezes. Sirens and speeding emergency vehicles filled the streets, as a large, dark cloud of smoke suddenly billowed skyward.
 All told, hundreds of houses and businesses remained in danger, emergency officials said, and the mood was tense. More than 3,000 acres had burned by Tuesday, but there were no deaths and only two minor injuries reported. 
 It could have been worse, after embers from a burned fire line set a tree on fire about 2 p.m. The tree ''crowned out,'' with flames burning through the treetop, spreading even more embers and trapping the two firefighters, Mr. Hawkins said. Both men sought shelter in small protective tents, generally the last resort for safety. ''They followed their training and they survived,'' Mr. Hawkins said. 
 The state's Office of Emergency Services put the number of burned homes at 176, with an additional 75 structures also destroyed. Most of that damage occurred in Meyers, a small town just south of here, where residential areas abut federal forests and sometimes snake into them. One house caught fire inside of South Lake Tahoe during Tuesday's flareup, but was extinguished. 
 By dusk on Tuesday, firefighters had contained about 44 percent of the blaze, whose cause is still under investigation. It erupted Sunday afternoon near a small pond popular with fishermen and quickly tore north, fed by dry timber and gusting winds. In areas in the fire's path, little was spared. 
 ''All our stuff is gone,'' said 12-year-old Samantha Cohn, whose mother's house was destroyed. ''Our beds, our trampoline, all our toys, presents we gave our mom for Mother's Day.'' Four friends had also lost homes, she said.
 Estimates on property damage were unavailable, though assessment teams were on the scene. 
 For many, sadness and shock had also started to give way to anger. At a community meeting on Monday night, one particular target for people's frustration was the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, a California and Nevada planning and regulatory body, which some here say has been too strict with rules about protecting trees and wildlands. 
 But on Tuesday, Julie Regan, the agency's communications chief, said there had been a ''great deal of misunderstanding'' about the agency's rules. 
 ''There's no restriction on a homeowner for creating defensible space,'' Ms. Regan said, referring the brush-and-tree free areas carved out around homes. ''If a tree is dead, there's no restriction. And if a tree's living, all they have to do is call their local fire district.''
 United States Forest Service officials said about 20 percent of the burned-out land had been prepped for just such a fire, with machines and people removing trees, brush and other flammables, a laborious and often expensive process. Some of those acres had been cleared as recently as last month, but those safeguards were overwhelmed by the blaze's intensity in its early hours, said Dave Marlow, a staff officer with the Forest Service's Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit, which manages about 165,000 acres around the lake. 
 ''In the areas where we did treatments, we did see some moderating fire behaviors, and it reduced the potential loss,'' Mr. Marlow said. ''But it was not a very good situation.''
 That sort of prevention effort will continue. The Forest Service announced in April that it would spend $100 million over the next 10 years to thin an additional 35,000 acres. 
 As the fire sits on the edge of this town and the scenic, tourist-friendly lake that gives this town its name and most of its economy, the more immediate concern is the prediction of a strong southerly wind and gusts of 40 miles an hour that could push the fire to the lake's edge, Mr. Hawkins said, a prospect that worries many who cherish the famously clear lake. 
 Chief among the culprits in the fire is the extreme drought which has racked the Sierra Nevada. ''This is the driest I've seen the Sierra Nevadas, and I've been in them for 40 years,'' said Mr. Hawkins, who added that he still hoped for containment by next Tuesday, just before the usually lucrative Independence Day holiday. ''We need to be on our toes.''

HEADLINE: Film Portrays Stifling of Speech, but One College's Struggle Reflects a Nuanced Reality

BYLINE: By Joseph Berger

DATELINE: POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
A new documentary is making the rounds that argues, with vivid examples, that the nation's colleges are squelching freedom of expression and are no longer free marketplaces of ideas.
 The film carries the striking title ''Indoctrinate U,'' and was made by Evan Coyne Maloney, who describes himself as a libertarian and is looking for a national distributor. 
 The film borrows the technique of ambush interviews from an ideological opposite, Michael Moore, and tells how at California Polytechnic State University, a student underwent a daylong disciplinary hearing for posting a flier publicizing a black speaker whose talk was titled, ''It's O.K. to Leave the Plantation.'' 
 A white student at Michigan State University recalls a dressing-down by her professor for questioning why her adopted Hispanic brother should benefit from racial preferences. Marx, the film contends, is taught, but not Adam Smith.
 Does the film offer a fair picture of campus life in 2007, or is it just a pastiche of notorious events? One answer might be found here at Vassar, which faced its own dispute over what some called hate speech and others ''political correctness,'' and emerged with its integrity more or less intact.
 The Imperialist, a publication of the school's Moderate, Independent and Conservative Student Alliance, published a contributor's article in 2005 that criticized social centers for minority and gay students. The article called such centers ''ghettos'' and said they turned Vassar into a ''zoological preserve.''
 Students complained that the language was insulting and called for banning The Imperialist. For weeks, the issue was debated by the student association, which finances the publication. Ultimately, the group withheld its money for one year and publication was suspended. 
 Students like Victor Monterrosa, a son of Salvadoran immigrants who recently graduated, still thinks that the question of whether students should be clustered by race or sexual orientation does not deserve a forum since Vassar ''is supposed to protect diversity'' and ''these discussions ended up making us more polarized.''
 ''There are students who feel comfortable putting us on the back burner who ended up fighting for free speech on campus,'' he said.
 Others, like Randall Stuebner, a senior who describes himself as a Republican who votes Democratic, feel speech should be unfettered. ''It's my duty to be as provocative as possible,'' he said.
 What was notable was that Vassar, a college of 2,360 students founded in the 19th century on progressive ideals -- and a place where conservatives remain a distinct minority -- hashed out the matter without violence and did not trash or burn newspapers as has happened at other campuses. 
 The Imperialist is publishing once again. Vassar seems to have made a distinction between forbidding publication of an idea and not allowing gratuitous racial insults to be hurled while examining that idea.
 ''Ultimately, free speech was respected,'' said Mark Goreczny, 20, a student. ''There was a dialogue, polarized as it may have been.''
 A spectrum of professors, administrators and students say the national picture is far more complicated than that pictured in ''Indoctrinate U,'' a point the dust-up at Vassar illustrates. Yes, periodically there are embarrassing incidents, like the disruption of speakers at Columbia last October who opposed illegal immigration. But most colleges are still places where unorthodox ideas are explored and debated. 
 Free speech groups like the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a campus watchdog, and individuals like Peter Salovey, dean of Yale College, contend that offensive speech should be answered with counterpoint speech, not the Vassar-like suspension of publication. 
 ''One goes down a very slippery slope when one tries to define certain kinds of speech as able to be banned,'' he said.
 Still, Vassar deserves credit because, as students explained, the dispute was not focused on whether The Imperialist could argue that a center exclusively for minority students fragmented the community; it was over whether the language used to express the idea was offensive.
 The wider society, after all, has not resolved the issue of abusive language. Limits are evident in hate crime laws, the firing of Don Imus and this week's Supreme Court ruling against a high school student who displayed a ''Bong Hits 4 Jesus'' banner.
 GREG LUKIANOFF, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, acknowledged that campus freedom of expression has improved since the low points of the 1990s. One such nadir, free speech advocates say, was in '97, when administrators at Cornell defended as a ''symbolic'' protest the burning of conservative newspapers that printed a provocative cartoon. 
 Some academics think campuses are still too repressive. John McWhorter, a linguist and frequent speaker against affirmative action, chronicled a number of visits in which he had been treated with less than hospitality. 
 ''When I give a talk on race,'' said Mr. McWhorter, who is black, ''I don't know of any more intolerant environment than a university. There is a bitterly indignant conviction that there is only one way of looking at race.''
 Amy Wax, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who specializes in social welfare law, said there is still a lingering reluctance on campus to grapple with certain subjects. Undergraduates, she finds, are taught about the economic roots of poverty, but not about debatable cultural causes like single motherhood. She said her students' ignorance of such ideas leads her to believe they received a ''skewed education.'' 
 At liberal Vassar, Peter Leonard, director of the school's field work programs, admitted that some students and faculty members are uneasy taking unpopular positions on delicate questions like race or the war in Iraq. ''You would have to be not completely awake not to realize that there's a social disinclination to voice a conservative opinion,'' he said. But he said the reluctance results from social pressures of ''going against the grain'' rather than an administrative prohibition. 
 That's why a view stated by Jessica Belasco, a student active in rights for the disabled, is so reassuring. She observed how appalling she finds the ideas of Peter Singer, a professor of bioethics at Princeton who justifies euthanasia for severely disabled infants. 
 Nevertheless, she said, ''I have trouble saying he's not allowed to say it.''

HEADLINE: Six of the Best and Brightest, Poised to Take the Next Step on the Long Road

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
They are the children of immigrants, or the latest in a long line of siblings to graduate from public schools. These are the valedictorians of New York City. Some will enroll at the City University of New York, others are off to colleges in California and Texas and Maine. They are violin players, dancers, singers and student government leaders. They aspire to be engineers or writers or architects. Many are the first in their family to graduate from high school.
 Whether they set out to maintain the best average or not, these are students who have spent high school bent over their textbooks, often commuting hours to get to class. In all, there are some 270 valedictorians -- one for each graduating class. Some will graduate with a straight A average, while others are at the top of their classes with mostly B's. All will be invited to a barbecue held by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg at Gracie Mansion this week. And dozens attended a reception with Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein, meant for students who beat the odds. 
 As they graduate this week, they will deliver the traditional valedictory speech. Here are portraits of a few of the city's top students; in a system as vast as New York's there are hundreds more like them. 
 A Chance to Start Over
 When Fareed Mohammed arrived in Queens from Trinidad three years ago, he was told he did not have enough credits to enter the 10th grade with other students his age at John Adams High School in Ozone Park. ''They said I was new to the country and I had to start over,'' he said.
 Fareed saw it as a challenge. ''I love competition,'' he said. So he attended classes whenever the school offered them, not just during the regular school day but in the evenings and on Saturdays, not quite earning credits so much as gobbling them up.
 And three years later, he is not only graduating on time but as the John Adams valedictorian, with a 98 average. He narrowly edged out his main competitor, Kulwinder Kaur, thanks to three Advanced Placement courses, whose grades carry more weight.
 Fareed's father works for a moving company. His mother is a full-time baby sitter. They came to New York to give Fareed, now 18, and his sister, 16, a better life, and Fareed has every intention of getting one. He plans to study mechanical engineering at City College, then get a master's degree in physics.
 He is a shy, lanky, bright-eyed young man, whose soft voice, barely above a whisper, belies a fierce competitive streak. In his college-level Spanish course, he was the only nonnative Spanish speaker. He put his greatest effort this year into a world history course, but his strongest subject is math, and after graduation this week he is headed to Oklahoma City for the national high school mathematics championships.
 On weekends, he works 12-hour days for a vendor of household goods at the Aqueduct Flea Market, saving money to pay his own tuition at City College next year. He said his parents had never pressured him about doing well in school and were not surprised to hear that he had finished first in his class.
 ''They were expecting it,'' he said. ''I was telling them all along, I wanted to be No. 1.'' DAVID M. HERSZENHORN
 One Last Time
 Tianna Jeter calls her graduating class ''the big bang'' because the roughly 250 students will be the last seniors to earn their diplomas from the school -- Thomas Jefferson High School in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn. 
 Everything was big at Jefferson -- the classes, the hallways, the lunch room. So big, in fact, that the Department of Education moved to shut the school and replace it with several smaller ones in the building. It is part of the Bloomberg administration's overhaul of the school system.
 Tianna understood the basic politics, she said, when she heard the news during her freshman year. She had heard horror stories about the school from other students -- gangs running the school and threats from older students. 
 ''It really did scare me,'' she said, thinking back to her first day at Jefferson. ''Nobody wants to go to school and not feel safe.'' 
 By the end of her first week, Tianna's fears had dissipated. Her honors classes in English, history and math had about a dozen students each. The teachers were encouraging. Nobody, she said, had even thrown a punch in the hallways. 
 ''It was nothing like everyone said it would be,'' she said. 
 Tianna stuck mostly to her friends in the honors classes, but met other students in the dance club and choir. By her senior year, she had friends at the smaller schools that have already opened in her building, but she maintained loyalty to Jefferson.
 ''The Big Bang Theory was a gigantic explosion of an atom, which is an accepted explanation to the creation of the universe,'' she wrote in a letter to her fellow graduates published in the school yearbook. ''Everything we have done this school year was done in a big way.'' 
 Then Tianna signed off with this: ''Just because we were not students who attended one of the specialized high schools does not mean that we were not as smart as them. We had the ability to do anything they could do or even better and guess what -- WE DID!'' JENNIFER MEDINA
 It Pays to Start Early
 Marina Shuster knew that to succeed at Brooklyn Technical High School, one of the city's most elite public institutions, it would not hurt to be an early riser. 
 So Marina, 18, typically woke up at 4 a.m. to study each day, then squeezed in what she called ''about three hours of normal studying into a half-hour'' on her N train ride, from her home in Gravesend, Brooklyn, to the Brooklyn Tech campus in Fort Greene. 
 Marina named anatomy, genetics and organic chemistry among her favorite subjects in school, and plans to attend Princeton in the fall, major in molecular biology and eventually become an obstetrician. ''I can't imagine doing anything else,'' she said of medicine. ''I call it my high.''
 She immigrated from Ukraine at 4 with her parents and grandparents, who had careers in engineering and education in their native country. In the United States, they are working their way up again, Marina said, with her mother taking jobs as a dental hygienist and her father working as a housepainter. 
 ''We had a pretty decent life in Ukraine, but they knew that I wouldn't have the opportunity to have a great future there,'' Marina said. ''My own motivation has been to show them that it was worth something.'' JULIE BOSMAN
 A Winner of Lotteries
 When Charles Oduro was 8 and living in the New Koforidua village in Ghana, his mother told the family one day that they had won a lottery for a car. The fact that nobody in the family knew how to drive was irrelevant; the prize made Charles instantly popular with his classmates.
 ''It was a big status thing,'' said Charles, now 17 and the valedictorian at Fordham Leadership Academy in the Bronx. ''I went around telling everyone.''
 But the car was only in his mother's imagination. A few weeks later, Charles learned of the family's real prize, won in an immigration lottery: a chance to come to the United States. His older brother and sister stayed behind, but Charles came with his mother and younger sister. They landed in New York, bouncing around in several different homes in the Bronx. 
 By the time Charles enrolled at the leadership academy, his older brother had become a priest in Ghana. Meanwhile, Charles, who excelled in math and science classes in middle and high school, tried to find a way to help his childhood friends back in his village. When he earned an internship at North Fork Bank last summer, he used the money to buy cows and land near the village that his friends could work on to earn more money. 
 ''That way they could earn things on their own,'' he said matter of factly. 
 This year, Charles focused his energies on the school's Robotics Club, leading his team to build the winning model -- in the form of a car -- at the citywide competition in robotics. 
 ''My mother was very proud of the car,'' he said. ''But she still can't drive. I can't, either, but I think I will learn after this summer.''
 Charles plans to attend the State University of New York at Stony Brook in the fall. JENNIFER MEDINA
 Coming Back for More
 There is at least one valedictorian who is not graduating this year. To secure his diploma, Lucio Ramirez, 18, will return to Aviation High School in Queens next fall to take an economics and government class. But it is an honor, rather than a failure, to come back for a fifth year at his school. 
 Students who complete four years at the school receive a license from the Federal Aviation Administration to repair airplanes. Students in the top third of the class are invited for a fifth year to receive a second license, which qualifies them for working for major airlines. Many students -- both after the fourth or fifth year -- go on to college. 
 Lucio heard about the school from a few older friends in the neighborhood, who had attended and had jobs at Kennedy Airport. They told him he could do the same if he attended Aviation, he said. 
 In shop classes, Lucio sat at the front of his classes, often asking questions more often than anyone else, he said. At times, he felt like the only one who didn't understand the mechanics of the planes. But the younger teachers, many of them Aviation alumni themselves, took time to explain it all and kept prodding him to work even harder. 
 ''I was never rushing to leave this school,'' he said, explaining that on most days he would not get home from classes until after dark. Lucio lives with his parents and two younger brothers in the Elmhurst section of Queens. Lucio decided to earn a second license rather than go right to college.
 ''Why not just do it now,'' Lucio said. ''There's really no reason to wait.'' 
 He plans to go to college after that, and eventually come back to the school as a teacher. He has already begun recruiting new students; his younger brother, Juan Carlos, will begin as a freshman there next fall. JENNIFER MEDINA
 Not Telling Her Father
 Victoria Chernow still won't show her father the essay that got her into Harvard. ''It's too flowery,'' she said, fingering her long blond braid. ''He thinks I take after Jane Austen.'' 
 Victoria, who maintained a 97.8 percent average at the Bronx High School of Science, often rolls her eyes when talking about her own achievements. She plans to spend her summer reading the classics and developing a firmer set of political opinions before moving to Cambridge.
 ''I need to figure out where I stand,'' she said.
 Raised in Jamaica, Queens, Victoria grew up speaking Russian with her parents, who immigrated to New York in the late 1970s. She thinks they secretly want her to go into medicine -- for the summer, she is an intern at the American Museum of Natural History, studying jaguars -- but she also finds herself drawn to history.
 It troubles her that she hasn't yet decided on her fall courses. A painter, salsa dancer and tennis player, she fights the impulse to ''be in a continual state of preparing,'' she says, shaking her head. But, she added, ''I guess I'm one of those people who can never really be happy with what they've just achieved.'' RACHEL AVIV

HEADLINE: Hollywood Scrambles As Strike Looms

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 26 

 BODY:
In Hollywood's upper reaches this week, few are bothering to count past two. As in Adam Sandler has already booked his two ''pre-strike'' pictures, so let's try Vince Vaughn.
 Though it's unclear whether the forthcoming contract expirations of the entertainment industry's writers, actors and directors will lead to a work stoppage over the next year, Hollywood is nonetheless frantically hedging its bets. 
 Producers, executives, agents and filmmakers are aware that even a hard-working star can most likely squeeze in no more than two movies before June 30 of next year, when the last of the deals end. After that date no studio wants to be caught with filming on its schedule, especially under expensive ''pay or play'' deals. (Such arrangements require companies to pay actors or others even if the movie isn't made.)
 And that has turned moviedom's midsummer months into an unusually tense season. Deal makers are frantically trying to line up top actors for their presumed two-picture limit, even as they try to avoid thinking about the inevitable vacuum that will come after the contract expiration dates, with or without a strike, because no films are being set to shoot next July. 
 ''We're trying to do in six months what we usually do in 12,'' said Patrick Whitesell, a partner with the Endeavor agency, which represents Mr. Sandler and others caught up in the chase. 
 Mr. Sandler, as it happens, is supposed to start ''You Don't Mess With the Zohan'' for Sony Pictures soon, and is probably locked up on ''Bedtime Stories'' for Disney after that. Mr. Vaughn, meanwhile, has been mentioned in connection with a half-dozen projects, but his plans are complicated by the prospect of a heavy promotional schedule for the comedy ''Fred Claus,'' already shot and awaiting release by Warner Brothers in the fall.
 The squeeze can be particularly painful for directors, who can easily invest 18 months in preparing, shooting and refining a picture, and may find themselves out of work for a year or more if they do not pin down studio, star and script in the next few weeks.
 In one go-round, Paul Greengrass, finished with this August's ''Bourne Ultimatum,'' with Matt Damon, a client of Mr. Whitesell's, has been trying to round up that star to shoot ''Imperial Life in the Emerald City'' for Universal and Working Title Films. But Mr. Damon is also looking at ''The Informant,'' a conspiracy thriller to be directed by Steven Soderbergh for Warner Brothers.
 If Mr. Damon commits to both, and everything falls into place with the studios, that would mean a long delay for ''The Fighter,'' a Paramount boxing film that is being lined up as a possible project for him with the director Darren Aronofsky. For that one, however, Mr. Damon would have to contend with weight fluctuations that would be difficult to control on a tight schedule. (Mr. Aronofsky is simultaneously developing another project for Universal, a spokeswoman for him said.)
 In another closely watched decision, Jim Carrey, who is represented by the Creative Artists Agency, has been juggling at least three contenders for his presumed two slots. One, ''Believe It or Not!,'' would come from Paramount, with the director Tim Burton. Another, ''I Love You Phillip Morris,'' would be independently financed, with the directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (who were writers of ''Bad Santa''). Yet another, ''Me Time,'' might come from Fox, but no director has yet been named. And still other projects could come into the mix. 
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Carrey declined to comment. In the Rube Goldberg exercise of Hollywood scheduling, little can be done without a final script. So the heat has been turned up lately on film writers to deliver the goods, even as their television-writing brethren are facing a different sort of pressure, to deliver extra episodes of television shows that will become a network bulwark against a possible writers' strike this fall. (The writers' contracts expire in October, while those of actors and directors end next June.)
 ''What we're seeing is a stockpiling'' of dramatic episodes and an increase in strike-resistant reality programming, said Steven Katleman, a lawyer with the Greenberg Traurig firm, which represents a number of television actors, writers and producers. Mr. Katleman pointed, for instance, to a recent outsize order for 30 episodes of the NBC series ''Heroes.''
 The studios' eagerness to book films that will be seen in late 2008 or the summer of 2009 has been particularly intense, given the unusual alignment of contract expirations and a broad expectation that writers and actors are bent on playing hardball on issues related to compensation for new forms of digital distribution.
 ''It's a pretty lethal combination,'' said Jack Kyser, senior vice president and chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. Whether or not a real walkout occurs, Mr. Kyser said, the insistence that no film or television show be scheduled to shoot after next June will almost certainly cause a ''de facto'' strike. 
 A similar situation occurred in 2001, when studios shot extra shows and movies in the first two quarters of the year in advance of a negotiation with actors. Work then fell to a third of that level for the next several quarters, as measured by a count of filming days at locations around Los Angeles.
 Things are even more complicated now, because actors, by accident of timing, are actually negotiating eight separate contracts over the next year, including those covering commercials and interactive work. Executives of the Screen Actors Guild declined to be interviewed about the scheduling of their various talks.
 Asked about the rush to production, Barbara Brogliatti, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents entertainment companies, said, ''As we enter these negotiations, we are hoping for the best, but we have a fiduciary duty to prepare for the worst.''
 Given that major feature films require months of preproduction and may require 16 weeks or more in front of the camera, the ''be prepared'' spirit means that most big casting choices for the next two years' film schedule will soon have been made.
 And Hollywood won't have much to talk about come spring, except labor negotiations, politics and the weather.
 ''Next year at Cannes, it's going to be dead,'' said Mr. Whitesell, referring to the telephone action that usually connects Hollywood festivalgoers with business at home. ''I mean dead.''

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Criticize Spitzer On Upstate Restoration Plan

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: BOLTON LANDING, N.Y., June 26 

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer, born and raised in New York City, made restoring upstate a central campaign theme last year.
Six months into his term, some leaders in the region say that they have seen no real change. Moreover, the governor's plan for the region has gotten tied up in his continued feuding with legislative leaders, stalling much of his agenda. 
 The state is mired by a high tax burden, which particularly affects distressed regions upstate, and while the governor's team has announced a number of development deals to draw jobs upstate, critics say Mr. Spitzer has lacked a transformative vision to reinvigorate Buffalo and other battered areas upstate. 
 Now, the Republican-led Senate, which is dominated by upstate lawmakers, is holding up approval of the governor's top economic development nominees amid a growing feud. Among other things, they are upset that the governor's new upstate economic policy director, Daniel Gundersen, has chosen to live in Saratoga Springs, one of the rare thriving locales upstate, instead of Buffalo or other points west. 
 Tensions flared anew on Tuesday as Mr. Spitzer, a Democrat, visited this resort town on Lake George to deliver a withering assessment, with a PowerPoint presentation, of the Senate's recalcitrance. 
 In a speech to the New York State Broadcasters Association, he blamed the Republican senators for leaving Albany last week with a number of issues still on the negotiating table. He blamed them for balking at his proposal to overhaul the state's campaign finance laws. And he chided them for passing a bill to set up a commission to approve raises for lawmakers. 
 ''They're getting paid, they're on vacation, they gave themselves a pay raise, they haven't done the people's business,'' the governor said. 
 The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, was not pleased. Mr. Bruno, an upstate Republican, has said that the governor is ''obsessed'' with campaign finance reform and that he made it a higher priority than upstate development. 
 In a statement issued shortly after the governor's speech, he said, ''There was a rare sighting of Governor Spitzer in upstate New York,'' adding that Mr. Spitzer had ''delivered more empty political rhetoric'' instead of ''hope that he might actually deliver on his campaign promises to create jobs upstate.''
 In an interview shortly thereafter, Mr. Spitzer said the Senate's ''positions are posturing, politics and pablum.''
 Mr. Bruno, in a transcript of an interview being broadcast Tuesday night on NY1 News, said the governor ''ought to understand that we're not in a third world country where he is a dictator'' and asked him to ''stop wandering around this state, having a tantrum like a big overgrown rich kid.''
 The sniping, which has been nearly constant between the two men in recent months, has not helped get things done. That said, no governor could be expected to make much headway right away on a region that has been struggling for decades. 
 Any number of statistics can be cited to show the exodus of jobs and decline in prosperity upstate. In the last three decades, the upstate population drain has contributed to New York's loss of Congressional seats, to 29 today from 42. The population of 20- to 34-year-olds upstate decreased by 22 percent in the 1990s, according to state figures. And Buffalo, with its finances in disarray, is now overseen by a state control board.
 Both the governor and the Senate have their own competing, and sometimes overlapping, upstate economic development plans. 
 Both sides agreed in budget negotiations to cut the corporate tax rate to 7.1 percent from 7.5 percent, which they hoped would ease the burden on businesses in the region. In addition, they agreed to $1.3 billion in property tax relief -- a major concern for upstate voters -- and agreed to overhaul the state's workers' compensation system, which was particularly burdensome for small businesses. They also sent $200 million in new aid to distressed cities. 
 The governor wants to take further steps to reduce the cost of doing business upstate, including overhauling the Wicks Law, which requires multiple contractors for public construction projects, and approving Article X, which would allow the expedited siting of power plants; the high cost of energy is a major complaint of businesses in the region. Both measures were held up in disputes with the Senate last week.
 The Senate has proposed granting further business tax cuts, extending additional property tax relief to small businesses and even creating high-speed rail links between upstate cities. It would also make it easier for small businesses to buy state-funded health insurance.
 The Legislature is expected to return for a special session next month, but it is not clear whether action will be taken on any of those proposals.
 Some hoped for a more cooperative approach. ''It isn't rocket science, and the ideas aren't protected by patents, so there's a fair amount of overlap,'' said Kenneth Adams, president of the Business Council of New York State. 
 Senator Thomas W. Libous, Republican of Binghamton, said: ''The governor has been working case by case, the Senate is looking at an overall plan that affects the state. Somehow we need to blend those together. This should not be confrontational.''
 But things had become so fractured that an announced agreement on an overhaul of the Wicks Law fell apart at the end of the session. 
 Critics say one of upstate's biggest problems is a lack of fiscal discipline in Albany, which they say continues to drive up business costs in the area. This year's budget increased overall state spending by more than four times the inflation rate. 
 E. J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative group, said the Legislature also passed two dozen pension sweeteners, including measures making it easier for public employees to claim early disability retirement because of heart disease. 
 ''I don't think anyone is seriously talking about addressing the causes of high taxes,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Our Gas Guzzlers, Their Lives

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
BUJUMBURA, Burundi
 If we need any more proof that life is unfair, it is that subsistence villagers here in Africa will pay with their lives for our refusal to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
 When we think of climate change, we tend to focus on Alaskan villages or New Orleans hurricanes. But the people who will suffer the worst will be those living in countries like this, even though they don't contribute at all to global warming.
 My win-a-trip journey with a student and a teacher has taken us to Burundi, which the World Bank's latest report shows to be the poorest country in the world. People in Burundi have an annual average income of $100, nearly one child in five dies before the age of five, and life expectancy is 45. 
 Against that grim backdrop, changing weather patterns in recent years have already caused crop failures -- and when the crops fail here, people starve. In short, our greenhouse gases are killing people here.
 ''If the harvest fails in the West, then you have stocks and can get by,'' said Gerard Rusuku, an agriculture scientist here who has been studying the impact of global warming in Africa. ''Here, we're much more vulnerable. If climate change causes a crop failure here, there's famine.''
 Guillaume Foliot of the World Food Program notes that farmers here overwhelmingly agree that the weather has already become more erratic, leading to lost crops. And any visitor can see that something is amiss: Africa's ''great lakes'' are shrinking.
 Burundi is on Lake Tanganyika, which is still a vast expanse of water. But the shoreline has retreated 50 feet in the last four years, and ships can no longer reach the port.
 ''Even the hippos are unhappy,'' said Alexander Mbarubukeye, a fisherman on the lake, referring to the hippos that occasionally waddled into town before the lake retreated.
 The biggest of Africa's great lakes, Lake Victoria, was dropping by a vertical half-inch a day for much of last year. And far to the north, once enormous Lake Chad has nearly vanished. The reasons for the dipping lake levels seem to include climate change.
 Greenhouse gases actually have the greatest impact at high latitudes -- the Arctic and Antarctica. But the impact there isn't all bad (Canada will gain a northwest passage), and the countries there are rich enough to absorb the shocks.
 In contrast, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned this year that the consequences for Africa will be particularly harsh because of the region's poverty and vulnerability. It foresees water shortages and crop failures in much of Africa.
 ''Projected reductions in yield in some countries could be as much as 50 percent by 2020, and crop net revenues could fall as much as 90 percent,'' the panel warned. It also cautioned that warming temperatures could lead malaria to spread to highland areas. Another concern is that scarcities of food and water will trigger wars. More than five million lives have already been lost since 1994 in wars in Rwanda, Burundi and Congo, and one factor was competition for scarce resources. 
 ''It seems to me rather like pouring petrol onto a burning fire,'' Jock Stirrup, the chief of the British defense staff, told a meeting in London this month. He noted that climate change could cause weak states to collapse.
 Yoweri Museveni, Uganda's president, describes climate change as ''the latest form of aggression'' by rich countries against Africa. He has a point. Charles Ehrhart, a Care staff member in Kenya who works full time on climate-change issues, says that the negative impact of the West's carbon emissions will overwhelm the positive effects of aid. 
 ''It's at the least disastrous and quite possibly catastrophic,'' Mr. Ehrhart said of the climate effects on Africa. ''Life was difficult, but with climate change it turns deadly.''
 ''That's what hits the alarm bells for an organization like Care,'' he added. ''How can we ever achieve our mission in this situation?''
 All this makes it utterly reckless that we fail to institute a carbon tax or at least a cap-and-trade system for emissions. The cost of our environmental irresponsibility will be measured in thousands of children dying of hunger, malaria and war.

HEADLINE: Reader Responses

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
The following are excerpts from reader responses to David Leonhardt's June 27 column on labor unions:
 I noticed you referred to the steel worker strike in 1949 several times throughout the piece as a positive event in U.S. history that benefited workers. How is that you also failed to mention the fact that just about every U.S. steel company went through one or more bankruptcy restructurings in the mid-1970s? Certainly the increased wage, fringe, and pension costs resulting from the 1949 strike had an impact on these bankruptcies, with shareholders losing millions in equity in these failed steel companies. 
 You write that Irving S. Olds, chairman of United States Steel, said in a speech presumably in 1949 in Erie, Pa., ''The truth of the matter is that American industry alone cannot afford to pay the cost of adequate insurance and pension programs for employees.'' It appears Mr. Olds was quite prophetic in this regard.
 -- Andrew Wellinghoff 
 I'll leave it to others to argue with you on the merits of card check. I'll only throw in that the option to use this would have been voluntary by those workers conducting the drive. Thus, if they preferred a more ''democratic'' election drive they were free to do so. Also: having business run a campaign where they worry about the fairness to workers in such a drive seems a bit disingenuous, to say the least.
 What I really wanted to call to your attention is some more data beyond what you showed in your accompanying graphs. I did a similar analysis using almost the same data, but correlated the decline in union membership with middle- and working-class wage gains. I also did a comparison between the degree of unionization and wealth inequality across countries.
 If one assumes just the simple maxim ''might makes right'' it is easy to explain why the working class has lost out over the past 40 years.
 --Robert D. Feinman
 Your citation in support of your statement that unions don't hurt productivity (''they do not'') by a single author wasn't authoritative, and seems so flimsy -- for a key point you were making -- that I felt I was reading homework for a grade school kid, not an article in a newspaper. 
 -- Jeff Brauer
 Below is the full passage from Richard Freeman's book, ''America Works.'' Mr. Freeman is an economics professor at Harvard and a researcher at the National Bureau of Economic Research. He's been studying labor unions for more than 20 years. He writes:
 ''Do unions raise or reduce productivity? To many economists, this is the $64 million question. Since anything that reduces productivity is prima facie bad, one of the major charges against unions has been that they reduce productivity. The evidence is clear: they do not. We know this with some certainty because researchers have used meta-statistical methods to collapse the results from a large number of studies into summary statistics. Meta-statistics is widely used in medical research to combine the results from small trials of medicines by doctors to give the appropriate statistical summary of all the studies taken together. In the union case, these analyses show that unions have slight positive impacts on productivity, but with wide variation among sectors.''
 If you're aware of similar evidence with a different result, I'm all ears. -- David Leonhardt
 I mainly wanted to thank you for trying to present an even-handed view of unions in an opinion column. I don't understand why there is such antipathy towards trade unions in the newspaper-writer profession (and among economists). 
 I also want to point out that ''secret ballots are simply fairer'' -- while an admirable idea in a democratic country -- is an oversimplification. When an election is called, the employer's mission changes from trying to steer employee mindset to negotiating and drawing clear pictures for the largest and least-committed bargaining unit to participate in the election. If they can get enough casual workers, or people who know that the union will not end up taking them in (for reasonable or for bad reasons, like that they were not in the vanguard of the organizing effort ...), those people will vote against representation.
 -- Tim Buchman
 Does your sentence ''the future may lie with nimbler, less confrontational groups, like the worker committees in Australia, Canada, England and elsewhere'' mean that you're tiptoeing up to the point of saying that it's time to give Section 8 (a)(2) the heave-ho? [Note: Section 8 (a)(2) restricts employers from becoming involved in employee organizations.]
 The prevailing ideology of the American labor movement remains that of (1) organize an entire North American industry, (2) then standardize work rules and pay across that industry in such a way as to minimize work, freeze that minimal effort into legalistic work rules and raise pay to as much as can be obtained. National unions, enabled by the National Labor Relations Act, kill flexibility and prevent change across entire industries.
 Isn't it ironic that, out of the wreckage of those companies that the U.A.W. has bargained with over the past half-century, the only enterprise that still indisputably No. 1 globally is Caterpillar, the one place where management prevailed over the U.A.W. in a prolonged strike? Would a greater number of Rust Belt companies have survived in good shape had they been able to pursue unique labor strategies in partnership with enterprise unions over the past several decades, as the economy gradually globalized? 
 When a system looks broken, it's time to reconsider basic assumptions. I wonder what union membership levels would be, today, if there had never been a Section 8(a)(2)? What would unions do? Who would they represent? Likewise, what would U.S. industry look like? 
 -- Chuck Chambers
 Why is helping unions necessarily a ''worthy goal''? This is not rhetoric but a question that flows naturally from the lead-in to your article, relating the anecdote about the steel unions in Truman's day forcing through an annual pension. Your story fails to scratch the surface perhaps because the depths of the outcome are rather uncomfortable: in the few years after the strike, American steel companies one by one went under, unable to compete. As a result, there are far fewer unionized jobs in the steel industry today. It is no coincidence that the same thing is occurring now, before our eyes, to the American auto industry. This industry, as you know, represents the last private sector bastion of unions.
 I do not mean to enter a debate over globalization. I merely observe that it is here, for better or worse, and it is clear from declining union membership (a decline that Delphi just accelerated) that unions in the private sector are becoming relics. Our population surges, our G.D.P. grows, yet union membership in the private sector dwindles, and no amount of senatorial alchemy can change this fact. Of course, unions survive, indeed flourish, in the public sector for the obvious reason that government is a monopoly unburdened by the challenges of competition. We shall therefore always have unions as long as we have large governments -- but as an issue for Americans in the private sector, which is to say, most Americans, unions have become about as relevant as Prohibition.
 -- John Rogitz
 Thanks for the thought-provoking note. So if unions are disappearing -- and you may well be right that they are, even if employers have to play fairly -- what does that mean? Is it possible for middle-class workers to get really solid wage gains without a larger union presence? Maybe it is. It happened in the late 90s. But it does seem like an open question. Those solid gains don't seem to be happening right now. -- David Leonhardt

HEADLINE: An iPod Has Global Value. Ask the (Many) Countries That Make It.

BYLINE: By HAL R. VARIAN

 BODY:
Who makes the Apple iPod? Here's a hint: It is not Apple. The company outsources the entire manufacture of the device to a number of Asian enterprises, among them Asustek, Inventec Appliances and Foxconn.
 But this list of companies isn't a satisfactory answer either: They only do final assembly. What about the 451 parts that go into the iPod? Where are they made and by whom?
 Three researchers at the University of California, Irvine -- Greg Linden, Kenneth L. Kraemer and Jason Dedrick -- applied some investigative cost accounting to this question, using a report from Portelligent Inc. that examined all the parts that went into the iPod. 
 Their study, sponsored by the Sloan Foundation, offers a fascinating illustration of the complexity of the global economy, and how difficult it is to understand that complexity by using only conventional trade statistics.
 The retail value of the 30-gigabyte video iPod that the authors examined was $299. The most expensive component in it was the hard drive, which was manufactured by Toshiba and costs about $73. The next most costly components were the display module (about $20), the video/multimedia processor chip ($8) and the controller chip ($5). They estimated that the final assembly, done in China, cost only about $4 a unit. 
 One approach to tracing supply chain geography might be to attribute the cost of each component to the country of origin of its maker. So $73 of the cost of the iPod would be attributed to Japan since Toshiba is a Japanese company, and the $13 cost of the two chips would be attributed to the United States, since the suppliers, Broadcom and PortalPlayer, are American companies, and so on.
 But this method hides some of the most important details. Toshiba may be a Japanese company, but it makes most of its hard drives in the Philippines and China. So perhaps we should also allocate part of the cost of that hard drive to one of those countries. The same problem arises regarding the Broadcom chips, with most of them manufactured in Taiwan. So how can one distribute the costs of the iPod components across the countries where they are manufactured in a meaningful way?
 To answer this question, let us look at the production process as a sequence of steps, each possibly performed by a different company operating in a different country. At each step, inputs like computer chips and a bare circuit board are converted into outputs like an assembled circuit board. The difference between the cost of the inputs and the value of the outputs is the ''value added'' at that step, which can then be attributed to the country where that value was added.
 The profit margin on generic parts like nuts and bolts is very low, since these items are produced in intensely competitive industries and can be manufactured anywhere. Hence, they add little to the final value of the iPod. More specialized parts, like the hard drives and controller chips, have much higher value added.
 According to the authors' estimates, the $73 Toshiba hard drive in the iPod contains about $54 in parts and labor. So the value that Toshiba added to the hard drive was $19 plus its own direct labor costs. This $19 is attributed to Japan since Toshiba is a Japanese company.
 Continuing in this way, the researchers examined the major components of the iPod and tried to calculate the value added at different stages of the production process and then assigned that value added to the country where the value was created. This isn't an easy task, but even based on their initial examination, it is quite clear that the largest share of the value added in the iPod goes to enterprises in the United States, particularly for units sold here.
 The researchers estimated that $163 of the iPod's $299 retail value in the United States was captured by American companies and workers, breaking it down to $75 for distribution and retail costs, $80 to Apple, and $8 to various domestic component makers. Japan contributed about $26 to the value added (mostly via the Toshiba disk drive), while Korea contributed less than $1.
 The unaccounted-for parts and labor costs involved in making the iPod came to about $110. The authors hope to assign those labor costs to the appropriate countries, but as the hard drive example illustrates, that's not so easy to do.
 This value added calculation illustrates the futility of summarizing such a complex manufacturing process by using conventional trade statistics. Even though Chinese workers contribute only about 1 percent of the value of the iPod, the export of a finished iPod to the United States directly contributes about $150 to our bilateral trade deficit with the Chinese.
 Ultimately, there is no simple answer to who makes the iPod or where it is made. The iPod, like many other products, is made in several countries by dozens of companies, with each stage of production contributing a different amount to the final value. 
 The real value of the iPod doesn't lie in its parts or even in putting those parts together. The bulk of the iPod's value is in the conception and design of the iPod. That is why Apple gets $80 for each of these video iPods it sells, which is by far the largest piece of value added in the entire supply chain.
 Those clever folks at Apple figured out how to combine 451 mostly generic parts into a valuable product. They may not make the iPod, but they created it. In the end, that's what really matters.

HEADLINE: Shares Climb on Takeovers and Earnings

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street rallied yesterday, reversing the Dow Jones industrial average's three-day losing streak, but investors still appeared skittish ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision.
 Stocks initially dropped after the Commerce Department said that orders for durable goods plunged 2.8 percent in May after three months of increases. Later, the market shrugged off the report and clawed its way back up, lifted by some takeover deals and strong earnings reports, particularly from ConAgra Foods and the software maker Oracle.
 Given the market's turbulence in the last few weeks because of soaring bond yields, investors will be looking for any clues from the central bank today about policy makers' views on growth and inflation. 
 The Fed -- which is expected to keep the benchmark rate at 5.25 percent after its two-day meeting ends today -- has stated recently that it expects the economy to recover from a weak first quarter despite difficulties in the housing market, and that inflation remains a major concern.
 ''We'd like to hear a Fed that's much closer to the center, because they're still pretty hawkish. They sound closer to tightening than to easing,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. Rate increases tend to slow down business and can dampen corporate profits.
 The Dow rose 90.07 points, or 0.7 percent, to 13,427.73. The blue-chip index lost a total of 208 points in the previous three sessions.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 13.45 points, or 0.90 percent, to 1,506.34, and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 31.19 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,605.35. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 12.33 points, or 1.5 percent, to 838.46.
 The price of the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 95 17/32. Its yield remained at 5.08 percent.
 The bulk of second-quarter earnings results arrive in mid-July. So far, earnings news has been mostly positive.
 Oracle rose 53 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $19.69, after saying late Tuesday that its profit in the most recent quarter rose 23 percent and that sales in the current quarter could beat estimates.
 ConAgra, whose brands include Healthy Choice and Chef Boyardee, yesterday reported a surge in its quarterly profit, despite the continuing costs of recalling its Peter Pan peanut butter. The company's stock rose $1.14, or 4.5 percent, to $26.70.
 Though some investors are concerned that rising bond yields could translate to higher rates and dampen buyout activity, deal-making continued yesterday.
 Guitar Center, the largest United States musical instrument retailer, said its board had accepted a $1.9 billion cash buyout offer from the private equity firm Bain Capital Partners. Guitar Center soared $9.92, or 19.8 percent, to $59.98.
 The banking company People's United Financial agreed to buy Chittenden, which operates banks in New England, for $1.9 billion in cash and stock. Chittenden rose $6.91, or 24.5 percent, to $35.15, while People's United Financial fell 54 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $18.17.
 Crude oil futures for August delivery rose $1.20 to $68.97 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the government said United States gasoline inventories dropped last week.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of five-year notes.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo Gives Next Chief an Early Start

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
The Wells Fargo stagecoach has a new driver.
 John G. Stumpf, Wells Fargo's chief operating officer, has become chief executive a year and a half earlier than expected, immediately succeeding Richard M. Kovacevich, who will remain chairman.
 The move comes as Wells Fargo navigates a slowdown in the American economy and myriad problems in the mortgage market, where it is a major housing lender. 
 But analysts said the choice of a well-respected insider like Mr. Stumpf signaled that the bank would probably continue to focus on increasing sales in its core markets in the West rather than merging with an East Coast partner like Wachovia or SunTrust, as many on Wall Street have advocated for years. 
 ''What is Wells's appetite to go outside of that strategy and do a larger transformational deal?'' Mr. Stumpf said, anticipating the question in a brief interview yesterday. ''We never say never because you never know what will happen. But I view it as highly unlikely.''
 Mr. Stumpf, 53, a top lieutenant to Mr. Kovacevich for years, had long been considered the heir apparent. 
 Wells's emphasis on branch banking and putting more bank products into the hands of its existing customers is now widely imitated by its larger rivals, whose growth was traditionally fed by merging and then cutting costs. 
 But the timing came as a surprise to many in the financial services industry. Mr. Kovacevich, widely considered among the best chief executives in banking, previously said he would retire by the end of 2008, when he turns age 65. 
 Mr. Stumpf said the two would ''be working shoulder to shoulder'' for the next year and a half. 
 Mr. Kovacevich was not available for comment. But Mr. Stumpf said the decision to accelerate the handoff was made at a board meeting yesterday, after the directors and Mr. Kovacevich determined the time was right. He dismissed any notion that health concerns played a role or that the change signaled a potential management shake-up or shift in strategy. 
 ''If we would have changed the strategy,'' Mr. Stumpf said, ''we would have done it yesterday.'' 
 Mr. Stumpf said he planned to leave Wells's retail orientation intact but find ways to improve it. 
 He said bolstering customer service and loyalty would be a top priority. 
 But he said he also saw growth opportunities in selling insurance as well as catering to the needs of small- business customers -- an area that many big banks see as a lucrative and largely untapped niche. 
 While he all but ruled out making a major deal outside the bank's geographic markets, he was bullish on making ''smaller, lower-risk deals'' where the bank already operates. 
 ''We love those kinds of transactions,'' he said. Mr. Stumpf, who spent much of his childhood working alongside his 11 brothers and sisters on a family farm outside Minneapolis, joined the loan administration department of Norwest Bank in 1992. His rise through the management ranks included stints as head of the Colorado, Arizona and Texas regions.
 After Norwest bought Wells Fargo and took its name in 1998, Mr. Stumpf led the company's Southwestern banking group. He was named president and chief operating officer in 2005 and held a seat on the Wells Fargo board.
 An avid baker (his mother's caramel rolls are his favorite recipe) and a bridge enthusiast, Mr. Stumpf has already warmed to Wells Fargo's largest shareholder, Warren E. Buffett, against whom he has regularly played bridge for years. 
 ''I like to tell people that I take one for the team, but Warren can beat me at will,'' Mr. Stumpf said.

HEADLINE: Treasury Secretary Announces Broad Review of U.S. Markets

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. announced yesterday that the Bush administration would start a formal review of how the United States regulates financial markets and hedge funds amid concerns over competition from overseas trading capitals. 
 Any substantive changes to the regulatory structure would have to be vetted by Congress, where Republicans lost their majority in last year's election. Mr. Paulson and his top finance aide have repeatedly said their goal is to frame the debate for their successors.
 ''To maintain our capital markets' leadership, we need a modern regulatory structure complemented by market leaders embracing best practices,'' Mr. Paulson said. 
 The initiatives are the latest effort by Mr. Paulson and Robert K. Steel, under secretary of the Treasury, both formerly of Goldman Sachs, to streamline capital markets regulation.
 Mr. Paulson said yesterday that rising interest rates and increased volatility in financial markets were a ''wake-up call.'' Prolonged low borrowing costs and limited volatility have led to excesses, he said, including looseness in loans to finance buyouts and ''mispriced'' risk in the market for bonds backed by subprime mortgages.
 The Treasury will release by early next year a report suggesting changes in the regulatory system for all financial services providers, the department said. In addition to five bank regulators, American financial markets are overseen by agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
 Mr. Paulson's announcement was greeted with skepticism by some. ''The chances of anything happening under this administration is somewhere between remote and nonexistent,'' said Barbara Roper, director of the investment program at the Consumer Federation of America in Washington. ''We can't even get a merger between the S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C., where there is great overlap.''
 But Mr. Paulson said at a conference in New York that he was optimistic that the Treasury's efforts would lead to action. 
 Yesterday's announcement was the second stage of Mr. Paulson's efforts on capital markets. Last month, he named a former S.E.C. chairman, Arthur Levitt, and Donald T. Nicolaisen, a former S.E.C. chief accountant, to lead a panel to examine how to strengthen the accounting industry.
 The Treasury also plans to review how it manages its cash and debt, the department said.
 Since Mr. Paulson listed the competitiveness of American capital markets as a top priority in a Nov. 20 keynote speech in New York, his moves have mostly consisted of convening panels. Last week, he announced an easing of the burden on small banks in submitting reports aimed at thwarting terrorist financing and money laundering.
 He also endorsed changes at the S.E.C., which last week moved to scrap a requirement that foreign companies reconcile their financial statements with United States accounting rules.

HEADLINE: Southwest to Slow Growth

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 27 

 BODY:
Southwest Airlines will add fewer planes to its fleet than it had planned and will tweak its flight schedule in several cities as it grapples with a slowing American economy and high fuel costs, the company's chief executive, Gary C. Kelly, said Wednesday. 
 Instead of adding 34 aircraft by 2008, Southwest will add 19 for a total of 539 by the end of next year, Mr. Kelly said in a meeting with analysts and investors in New York.
 By early next month, Southwest will eliminate 39 round-trip flights, including its two daily nonstop routes between Philadelphia and Los Angeles, while adding 45 flights between cities including New Orleans and Birmingham, Ala.
 The changes are intended to restore profit growth, which Mr. Kelly said was expected to slow to 6 percent, down from 8 percent. He maintained a revenue goal of $1 billion by 2010.
 ''In this economic environment, we simply need to take less risk and grow more slowly,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Study Sees Climate Change Impact on Alaska

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
Many of Alaska's roads, runways, railroads and water and sewer systems will wear out more quickly and cost more to repair or replace because of climate change, according to a study released yesterday. 
 Higher temperatures, melting permafrost, a reduction in polar ice and increased flooding are expected to raise the repair and replacement cost of thousands of infrastructure projects as much as $6.1 billion for a total of nearly $40 billion -- about a 20 percent increase -- from now to 2030, according to the study, by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska Anchorage. 
 The cost estimates are based on the needs of nearly 16,000 pieces of public infrastructure, including airports and small segments of roads. 
 The researchers speculated that in the distant future the costs would level off as the agencies adapted their practices to the warmer climate.
 Temperatures have risen by an average of two to five degrees in different parts of the state in recent decades, and the changes have already been linked to problems like coastal erosion in remote Alaskan villages and wildfires. The researchers who wrote the report said their estimates for increased costs were based on ''middle-of-the-road'' forecasts for warming in a place where projects were designed to endure the cold.
 ''We assume warming temperatures mean infrastructure has to be replaced more often,'' the report said. ''It's also possible the changing climate could actually increase the life of some structures, but we haven't so far identified any such exceptions.''
 The study is the first of its kind in Alaska, and its authors emphasize that it does not project costs for things like moving villages, protecting the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, fighting wildfires or protecting private property that may be affected.
 ''There are a million other issues related to climate change,'' said Peter Larsen, a natural resource economist at the Institute for Social and Economic Research and the lead researcher for the report. ''This is just one component, but it's a critical piece because this is where all the goods and services come through the state's economy, is through the infrastructure.''
 Mr. Larsen said the most vulnerable places in the state were probably those built heavily on permafrost, the permanently frozen subsoil, whose average temperature is projected to rise above freezing in the future, potentially making the ground unstable.
 ''Those structures need to be investigated further,'' he said. ''What happens to costs when you cross that freezing point threshold?''
 With no simple template for how to measure increased infrastructure costs from climate change, Mr. Larsen said he and other researchers had settled on studying how higher temperatures and precipitation changes affect the life span of materials. Then they combined that data with forecasts for higher temperatures and climate change in Alaska.
 ''There are other places that have done studies,'' he said, ''but Alaska is warming more quickly than any other place on the planet right now. There was nothing to this extent.''
 He said he had begun the research ''from scratch,'' calling various state agencies. ''I'd say something like 'Can you tell me how much the changing climate over the last 50 years has changed this piece of infrastructure?' '' he said. ''On more than one occasion I had people laugh at me on the phone.''

HEADLINE: Biggest Urban Growth Is in South and West

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Newark, for four decades a symbol of America's urban decay, is growing faster than any major city in the Northeast, according to census figures released yesterday. 
 Newark's population, which had been declining for 50 years, has increased 3.3 percent since 2000, including a 0.5 percent increase from 2005 to 2006. The city's population now stands at 281,402.
 According to figures from the Census Bureau, the biggest population growth nationwide occurred in urban hubs in the South and the West -- now home to 7 of the 10 most populous cities -- and especially in the metropolitan suburbs of those regions. 
 Phoenix, with a population of 1.5 million, officially edged out Philadelphia to become the nation's fifth most-populous city, after New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston. 
 Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Rochester and other cities in the Rust Belt and upstate New York recorded population losses of more than 5 percent since 2000. But, except for Cleveland, these older cities recorded smaller losses since 2005, suggesting that their population declines may have been stanched. Columbus, Ohio, and Indianapolis gained population in the latest one-year period.
 New York, the nation's largest city, with more than 8.2 million people, recorded virtually no growth since 2005. But city officials said that the population was undercounted and that they would challenge the census figures, as they have done successfully in recent years. 
 ''The July 1, 2006, number will likely be higher than it is now, indicating continued growth,'' said Joseph J. Salvo, director of the City Planning Department's population division.
 Among cities of 100,000 or more, North Las Vegas, a suburb with a population of 197,567, recorded the fastest growth rate. It ballooned by 11.9 percent from 2005 to 2006. 
 Three cities in metropolitan Dallas -- McKinney (which nearly doubled in population since 2000), Grand Prairie and Denton -- also ranked in the top 10 fastest-growing cities of 100,000 or more. Two cities in metropolitan Phoenix and two cities in Florida were also in the top 10, along with one city in North Carolina and one in California. 
 While Phoenix grew more than any other city, adding 43,000 residents since 2005, five Texas cities (San Antonio, Fort Worth, Houston, Austin and Dallas) were also among the top numerical gainers.
 The hurricane-ravaged New Orleans lost 51 percent of its population from July 1, 2005, to July 1, 2006. 
 William H. Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, said he had detected a surge of small city growth, especially in the West. Of the 25 cities in the South and the West with populations over 500,000, he said, all but three showed gains this decade.
 ''Small Western cities, with populations below 250,000, grew by 11 percent in the first six years in this decade, substantially more than larger cities in the region,'' Mr. Frey said.
 Boston showed annual population gains from 2002 to 2005 but registered a 1 percent loss since 2005. 
 Since 2000, only two cities outside the South and the West -- Joliet, Ill., and Olathe, Kan. -- were among the 25 fastest-growing in the nation. 
 The gains in the West and the South demonstrate how the nation's population has shifted over a century. Only 3 of the 10 most populous cities in 1910 -- New York, Chicago and Philadelphia -- remain on the latest list of the top 10. Three of the latest top 10 -- Phoenix; San Jose, Calif.; and San Diego -- were not even among the 100 most populous in 1910.

HEADLINE: 2 Iranian Gas Stations Burned in Protests Over Rationing

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, June 27 

 BODY:
Angry drivers set fire to at least two gas stations overnight in Tehran after the government announced that gasoline rationing would begin Wednesday just after midnight. 
 The state television news said Wednesday that ''several gas stations and public places had been attacked by vandals.'' While there were some reports that a large number of gas stations had been set on fire, only two fires were confirmed. 
 The government had been planning for a year to put rationing into effect but held off because of concerns that it could cause unrest. Some officials indicated it might have been started now because of the threat of stronger economic sanctions by the United Nations over Iran's nuclear program.
 Iran contends that its nuclear enrichment program is for civilian energy purposes, while the United States and some other Western nations contend that Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons. 
 Under the new regulations announced by the Oil Ministry on Tuesday evening, private cars will be able to buy a maximum of 26 gallons of gasoline a month at the subsidized price of 34 cents per gallon. Taxis will be allowed 211 gallons a month. Parliament would have to determine whether individuals would be allowed to buy more at market rates. 
 There were long lines at gas stations in Tehran on Wednesday, causing traffic jams, and the police moved in to control the lines. 
 Iran is OPEC's second-largest exporter of oil. But it needs to import half of its gasoline -- at a cost of $5 billion a year -- because of high consumption and low refining capabilities. 
 Inflation in Iran had already been high, as a result of a combination of economic factors and government decisions. The price of dairy products like milk, butter and yogurt increased this week by at least 20 percent.
 Analysts had warned that the decision could have a direct impact on inflation. 
 It was unclear what would happen to many unemployed people who use their private cars as taxis. 
 The daily Ham-Mihan, a reformist newspaper, wrote on Wednesday that because of the many ambiguities in the new regulations, the decision could have a major effect on the economy and on people's lives. 
 Parliament met behind closed doors with the ministers of oil and intelligence on Wednesday to examine the consequences of the decision.
 The speaker of Parliament, Gholamali Hadad Adel, told reporters after the meeting that Parliament was determined to back the government. 
 ''The rationing can help reduce consumption,'' he said, according to Parliament's Web site. ''It can also make us more independent and become less vulnerable in the international community against world powers.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Faces More Distrust From World, Poll Shows

BYLINE: By MEG BORTIN

DATELINE: PARIS, June 27 

 BODY:
Distrust of the United States has intensified across the world, but overall views of America remain very or somewhat favorable among majorities in 25 of 46 countries and the Palestinian territories surveyed in an international poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, in results reported Wednesday. 
 ''Anti-Americanism since 2002 has deepened, but it hasn't really widened,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Global Attitudes Project. ''It has worsened among America's European allies and is very, very bad in the Muslim world. But there is still a favorable view of the United States in many African countries, as well as in 'New Europe' and the Far East.''
 Nonetheless, majorities in many countries reject the main planks of current United States foreign policy and express distaste for American-style democracy, the survey found.
 Respondents worldwide not only want the United States to pull its troops out of Iraq ''as soon as possible,'' but also seek a rapid end to the American and NATO military intervention in Afghanistan, now in its sixth year. The poll found growing wariness toward other major powers as well. Concerns over China's economic and military might have tarnished its image in many nations, the poll found, and confidence in President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has dropped sharply. 
 The survey was conducted in April and May in the Palestinian territories and in 46 countries in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and the Americas, and includes more than 45,000 respondents. It found that concern about global warming has soared in the last five years. Most respondents agree that the environment is in trouble and most blame the United States and, to a much more limited degree, China, according to the survey. 
 Negative views of Iran have intensified, including in some Muslim countries, the survey found, and respondents in almost all countries surveyed expressed overwhelming opposition to acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran.
 This was the first release from this survey, focusing on the perception of the United States. Other information will be released later. 
 Confidence in President Bush, which was already sagging, has dropped further in most countries over the past year. Global distrust of American leadership is reflected in increasing disapproval of the cornerstones of United States foreign policy, according to the survey report. Most of those surveyed want a quick withdrawal of American troops from Iraq, including 56 percent in the United States. The exceptions are respondents in Ghana, Israel, Kenya and Nigeria. There is also strong support for quickly removing American and North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops from Afghanistan. 
 Pew surveyed 45,239 people from April 6 to May 29. The surveys were conducted nationwide except in eight countries that were disproportionately or exclusively urban. The margin of sampling error ranges from plus or minus two to four percentage points. Interviews were conducted by telephone or in person by local survey firms.

HEADLINE: Day of Campaigning for a G.O.P. Noncandidate

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., June 27 

 BODY:
Former Senator Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee delivered a pep talk to his fellow Republicans here Wednesday, reminding voters in this early primary state about what he called the virtue of conservative ideals. 
 Over lunch in a hotel ballroom, he paid homage to Ronald Reagan, low taxes and ''the sanctity of life,'' while lamenting Congress's spending habits and government bureaucracy in general. 
 The speech, replete with folksy humor and anecdotes from Mr. Thompson's life as a Hollywood actor, was as much about the aspirations of the Republican Party as Mr. Thompson, who has yet to declare his candidacy for president officially but is expected to do so in the next few weeks. 
 At no point was Mr. Thompson, 64, so direct as to suggest that he was looking for support. Rather, his intentions were implied -- and judging by the crowd's reactions -- clearly understood. 
 ''A lot of people think our party is on its heels right now, but we're not going to stay there long,'' he said, adding later: ''I think we can be a magnet, form a new coalition. Let's come out the other end stronger and wiser than we were before.''
 Mr. Thompson also talked about the need for more secure national borders and a strong economy. In addition, he sought to portray those Republicans incumbents who were defeated in the midterm elections in 2006 as not being true to the core principals of conservatism.
 ''Some of our folks went to Washington to dry the swamp and made partnership with the alligators,'' he said. ''The question is, What are your underlying principles? What do you believe in?''
 He continued, ''We can aspire to wonderful things.''
 Mr. Thompson's visit to South Carolina was the second stop on a three-state tour this week, and came after a rally and homecoming fund-raiser in Tennessee on Tuesday. On Thursday, he is scheduled to meet with supporters in New Hampshire.
 After his speech, Mr. Thompson spoke briefly with reporters about his decision so far not to announce his candidacy formally.
 ''As I've said a couple of times, it's too late to play by somebody else's rules even if I wanted to, and I don't want to,'' he said, adding later, ''I think the timeframe that I got in is just about right.''
 But some of Mr. Thompson's supporters are getting restless.
 ''We drove an hour and a half to get here, and he didn't say anything new,'' said Jonathan McClellan, who owns an accounting business in Goose Creek and said he wanted to hear more about overhauling the tax code. ''I kind of wish, if he's going to run, announce it. It seems a little bit like a game play. I agree with his conservative stance, but we need specifics.''

HEADLINE: Don't Cry Over rBST Milk

BYLINE: By HENRY I. MILLER. 
Henry I. Miller, a doctor and fellow at the Hoover Institution, headed the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Biotechnology from 1989 to 1993. He is the co-author, most recently, of ''The Frankenfood Myth.''

 BODY:
Stanford, Calif. 
 MILK occupies a special place in our lives and language. It has been dubbed ''nature's most perfect food,'' and we speak sentimentally of the ''land of milk and honey'' and the ''milk of human kindness.''
 But things are turning sour for consumers of milk. The average price of a gallon of milk nationwide is up 37 cents since January, to $3.47. Strong demand and limited ability to increase production quickly are expected to increase prices more, and experts have speculated that the price per gallon could reach a record $5 by year's end. High feed costs associated with the ramping up of American corn-based ethanol production are making it difficult to produce more milk. 
 Worldwide, prices are also at historically high levels. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's price index of traded dairy products has risen 46 percent since last November. 
 One way to ease the shortage and lower the prices is to take greater advantage of a proven 13-year-old biological technology that stimulates milk production in dairy cows -- a protein called recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST), or bovine growth hormone. The protein, produced naturally by a cow's pituitary, is one of the substances that control its milk production. It can be made in large quantities with gene-splicing (recombinant DNA) techniques. The gene-spliced and natural versions are identical.
 Bad-faith efforts by biotechnology opponents to portray rBST as untested or harmful, and to discourage its use, keep society from taking full advantage of a safe and useful product. The opponents' limited success is keeping the price of milk unnecessarily high.
 When rBST is injected into cows, their digestive systems become more efficient at converting feed to milk. It induces the average cow, which produces about eight gallons of milk each day, to make nearly a gallon more. More feed, water, barn space and grazing land are devoted to milk production, rather than other aspects of bovine metabolism, so that you get seven cows' worth of milk from six. 
 This may not seem like a big deal, but when applied widely the effects are profound. For every million cows treated with rBST each year, 6.6 billion gallons of water (enough to supply 26,000 homes) are conserved, according to Monsanto, which makes rBST. With much of the nation enduring a drought and many cities in the West experiencing water shortages, this is a significant benefit. 
 The amount of animal feed consumed each year by those million rBST-supplemented cows is reduced by more than three billion pounds. This helps to keep the lid on corn prices, even as much of the nation's corn harvest is diverted to producing ethanol for cars. And the amount of land required to raise the cattle and grow their food is reduced by more than 417 square miles. 
 At the same time, more than 5.5 million gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel (enough to power 8,800 homes) are saved, greenhouse gas emissions are lowered by 30,000 metric tons (because fewer cows means less methane produced by bovine intestinal tracts), and manure production is decreased by about 3.6 million tons, reducing the chances of runoff getting into waterways and groundwater. 
 Comprehensive studies by academics and government regulatory agencies around the world have found no differences in the composition of milk or meat from rBST-supplemented cows.
 And consumers are apparently happy to drink milk from supplemented cows, in spite of efforts by biotechnology opponents to bamboozle milk processors and retailers into believing that consumers don't want it. In various surveys to ascertain the factors that influence consumers' milk purchasing decisions, the predominant considerations have been: price (80 percent to 99 percent), freshness (60 percent to 97 percent), brand loyalty (30 percent to 60 percent) and a claim of ''organic'' (1 percent to 4 percent). Only the ''organic'' claim is even remotely related to rBST supplementation. Unless prompted, the consumers surveyed didn't mention rBST as a concern.
 Some milk suppliers and food stores have increased the price of milk labeled ''rBST-free,'' even though it is indistinguishable from supplemented milk, and offer only this more expensive option, pre-empting consumers' ability to choose on the basis of price. 
 Activists' purely speculative concerns about rBST -- ranging from the destruction of small family farms to the risk of cancer -- have proven baseless. Before approval by the Food and Drug Administration, rBST underwent the longest and most comprehensive regulatory review of any veterinary product in history. Three years before the F.D.A. approved the marketing of milk from supplemented cows, its scientists, in an article published in the journal Science, summarized more than 120 studies showing that rBST poses no risk to human health.
 Their conclusion was affirmed over the next several years by additional scientific reviews conducted by the National Institutes of Health, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment and the drug-regulatory agencies of Britain, Canada and the European Union, and by an issues audit done by the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general. These reviews noted that traces of BST are found in milk from all cows, supplemented or not. They also pointed out that, like other proteins, rBST is digested in the human gut. Moreover, even if it is injected into the human bloodstream, it has no biological activity. 
 Largely as a result of bullying by several members of Congress, the F.D.A.'s review of rBST took nine years, while the evaluation of an almost identical product for injection into growth hormone-deficient children had taken a mere 18 months.
 Cynical activists have unfairly stigmatized a scientifically proven product that has consistently delivered economic and environmental benefits to dairy farmers and consumers. In a more rational world, they would embrace -- and enlightened consumers would demand -- milk with a label that boasted, ''A Proud Product of rBST-Supplemented Cows.''

HEADLINE: Attracting Private Equity Becomes a National Sport in Europe

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY and JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, June 28 

 BODY:
For most of the last decade, the private equity firms in Germany have argued for preferential tax treatment on the basis of national interest. 
 The breaks are needed, private equity managers said, to help Germany catch up with London and New York, the global centers of the buyout business. 
 These days, the United States and Britain are considering higher taxes on private equity, something that has not gone unnoticed in Berlin. And Rolf Christoph Dienst, head of BVK, the chief lobbying association for German private equity firms, would just as soon distance himself from either country. 
 ''What is happening in the United States and Britain is not helpful,'' Mr. Dienst said, because it is undercutting the industry's message in Germany, particularly toward often hostile politicians on the left. ''The timing is very bad.'' 
 As politicians in Washington begin to schedule hearings on whether to raise the tax rate on private equity, the major private equity markets in Europe -- Britain, France and Germany -- have faced the same issue with fiery debate and quiet lobbying.
 In France, private equity has largely escaped the scrutiny it faces elsewhere; the country passed legislation in the last decade that offers stable tax treatment to private equity, and the conservative pro-business government of President Nicolas Sarkozy, who took office last month, is unlikely to change that. 
 In addition, Eddie Misrahi, director of Apax Partners in France and chairman of that country's industry association, AFIC, said that private equity was continuing a lobbying campaign aimed at cultivating its image among union and government officials.
 ''We have been perhaps slightly more conscious of a possible backlash from these kinds of deals,'' he said. ''Apparently our British and European colleagues have only recently discovered this approach.'' 
 In Britain, Tony Blair, who was succeeded by Gordon Brown as prime minister on Wednesday, has said that it was time to rethink private equity taxation, and he promised a review by fall, when a committee of the British Treasury will issue a report.
 Private equity firms, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, have gone before a House of Commons committee to defend the lower tax rates and have argued that changes could drive parts of the industry out of Britain and into tax havens like Luxembourg.
 At last week's hearing, Philip Yea, chief executive of the 3I Group, a London-based buyout firm, told members of Parliament that a tax increase ''might just mean that people like us might just invest our funds outside the U.K.'' 
 Damon Buffini, the managing partner at Permira, and Dominic Murphy, a partner at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, told the hearing that tax relief for some private equity investments had benefited Britain's economy by encouraging growth of the private equity industry. Committee members were unimpressed and said there was a sense that the industry's executives were ''arrogant'' and ''too rich'' while ''not paying enough tax.'' 
 Yet even as the debate goes on, European politicians are torn. In Germany, when Franz Muntefering, now the labor minister, was chairman of the country's Social Democratic Party, he referred to private equity firms as ''locusts'' who hollow out once-productive companies for their own benefit.
 Yet politicians there have tended to favor venture capitalists who focus on young, growing companies, because they carry the potential for creating jobs. Britain's tax structure, which was developed about 10 years ago, was intended to help small companies and foster a start-up and venture capital culture. Known as the ''taper tax,'' it allowed investors to pay as little as 10 percent on investments, not the normal 40 percent rate on income. 
 German officials this week agreed on a draft law for venture capital that foresees tax incentives for financing of companies worth up to 20 million euros ($27 million) and a new form of incorporation for venture capital funds. But buyout funds, essentially the same concept at much higher valuations, enjoy no such sympathy. 
 ''There is no sense in making special, preferential tax rules for big funds of capital,'' said Joachim Poss, a Social Democratic member of the German Parliament, and a leading voice on financial policy. ''But in our economy we do need new companies, especially in parts of Germany that are underdeveloped.''
 The German private equity industry is determined to lobby hard for a new, more favorable tax.
 At least for the last five years, Germany and other countries on the Continent have watched Britain grab the bulk of European private equity and turn it into a driving force for economic growth. Funds in Britain last year raised 75 billion euros ($100.8 billion), or 67 percent of the total raised in Europe, according to the European Venture Capital Association; 3 percent was raised in Germany. 
 Right now the dominant players in Germany tend to be British and American funds. Terra Firma, an investment firm based in London, and Fortress Investment, based in New York, for example, have done large deals in Germany, but have mitigated this risk by using companies based elsewhere.
 The German industry argues that until German funds can flourish, they cannot win the confidence of the companies they might acquire, many of them family-owned and suspicious of outside financing.
 When it took office in 2005, the coalition that runs Germany -- an unwieldy mix of conservative Christian Democrats and Social Democrats -- promised a comprehensive private equity law. The business-friendly Social Democratic finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, is thought to be sympathetic, but he has already had to wrestle with his party's left wing to push through a broader corporate tax overhaul and new legislation on real estate investment rules.
 Doing a favor for private equity, Mr. Dienst of the German association said, might be beyond Mr. Steinbruck's grasp.

HEADLINE: I.M.F.'s Chief Will Resign 2 Years Early

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Rodrigo de Rato, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, will quit his post in October, two years before his term ends, the fund said yesterday, citing ''personal reasons.'' 
 Mr. de Rato, 58, a former Spanish economy minister who has led the agency, based in Washington, since June 2004, will leave after the annual meetings of the fund and the World Bank, the statement said.
 Without elaborating, Mr. de Rato said he was concerned about his children's education.
 ''I have the highest regard for this institution, its staff, its role in the global economic architecture and its enviable ability to adapt to changing global circumstances to ensure that it can serve its members effectively,'' Mr. de Rato also said.
 His departure means that both the I.M.F. and its sister institution, the World Bank, will have new leadership at a time when some are questioning their relevance and the demand for loans is waning.
 Mr. de Rato championed a bigger role for leading developing nations like China to reflect their fast-growing economies, while some European nations were urged to reduce their voting shares. He helped push through the writing off of as much as $57 billion in debt to the poorest countries. 
 At the World Bank, a new president, Robert B. Zoellick, takes over next week from Paul D. Wolfowitz. Mr. Wolfowitz quit after a revolt from donor governments and employees over a pay raise for his partner.
 European Union finance ministers will select an I.M.F. successor, though none was immediately announced. Under an arrangement that dates to the end of World War II, a European runs the I.M.F. while the United States nominates the head of the World Bank.

HEADLINE: Justices End 96-Year-Old Ban on Price Floors

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28 

 BODY:
Striking down an antitrust rule nearly a century old, the Supreme Court ruled today that it is no longer automatically unlawful for manufacturers and distributors to agree on setting minimum retail prices.
 The decision will give producers significantly more leeway, though not unlimited power, to dictate retail prices and to restrict the flexibility of discounters. 
 Five justices said the new rule could, in some instances, lead to more competition and better service. But four dissenting justices agreed with the submission of 37 states and consumer groups that the abandonment of the old rule would lead to significantly higher prices and less competition for consumer and other goods. 
 The court struck down the 96-year-old rule that resale price maintenance agreements were an automatic, or per se, violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. In its place, the court instructed judges considering such agreements for possible antitrust violations to apply a case-by-case approach, known as a ''rule of reason,'' to assess their impact on competition.
 The decision was the latest in a string of opinions this term to overturn Supreme Court precedents. It marked the latest in a line of Supreme Court victories for big businesses and antitrust defendants. And it was the latest of the court's antitrust decisions in recent years to reject rules that had prohibited various marketing agreements between companies.
 The Bush administration, along with economists of the Chicago school, had argued that the blanket prohibition against resale price maintenance agreements was archaic and counterproductive because, they said, some resale price agreements actually promote competition. 
 For example, they said, such agreements can make it easier for a new producer by assuring retailers that they will be able to recoup their investments in helping to market the product. And they said some distributors could be unfairly harmed by others -- like Internet-based retailers -- that could offer discounts because they would not be incurring the expenses of providing product demonstrations and other specialized consumer services. 
 A majority of the court agreed that the flat ban on price agreements discouraged these and other marketing practices that could be helpful to competition.
 ''In sum, it is a flawed antitrust doctrine that serves the interests of lawyers -- by creating legal distinctions that operate as traps for the unaware -- more than the interests of consumers -- by requiring manufacturers to choose second-best options to achieve sound business objectives,'' the court said in an opinion by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and signed by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.
 But in his dissent, portions of which he read from the bench, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said there was no compelling reason to overturn a century's worth of Supreme Court decisions that had affirmed the prohibition on resale maintenance agreements.
 ''The only safe predictions to make about today's decision are that it will likely raise the price of goods at retail and that it will create considerable legal turbulence as lower courts seek to develop workable principles,'' he wrote. ''I do not believe that the majority has shown new or changed conditions sufficient to warrant overruling a decision of such long standing.''
 During the period from 1937 to 1975 when Congress allowed the states to adopt laws that permitted retail price fixing, economists estimated that such agreements covered about 10 percent of consumer good purchases. In today's dollars, Justice Breyer estimated that the agreements translate to a higher annual average bill for a family of four of roughly $750 to $1,000.
 The dissent was signed by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
 The case involved an appeal of a judgment of $1.2 million against Leegin Creative Leather Products Inc. after it cut off Kay's Kloset, a suburban Dallas shop, for refusing to honor Leegin's no-discount policy. The judgment was automatically tripled under antitrust law.
 Leegin's marketing strategy for finding a niche in the highly competitive world of small leather goods was to sell its ''Brighton'' line of fashion accessories through small boutiques that could offer personalized service. Retailers were required to accept a no-discounting policy.
 After the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, upheld the judgment and said it was bound by Supreme Court precedent, Leegin took the case to the Supreme Court. Unless it is settled, the case, Leegin Creative Leather Products v. PSK Inc., will now be sent down to a lower court to apply the new standard.
 The Supreme Court adopted the flat ban on resale price agreements between manufacturers and retailers in 1911, when it founded that the Dr. Miles Medical Company had violated the Sherman act. The company had sought to sell medicine only to distributors who agreed to resell them at set prices. The court said such agreements benefit only the distributors, not consumers, and set a rule making such agreements unlawful. 
 Justice Kennedy said today that the court was not bound by the 1911 precedent because of the ''widespread agreement'' among economists that resale price maintenance agreements can promote competition.
 ''Vertical agreements establishing minimum resale prices can have either pro-competitive or anticompetitive effects, depending upon the circumstances in which they are formed,'' he wrote.
 But Justice Breyer said in his dissent that the court had failed to justify the overturning of the rule, or that there was significant evidence to show that price agreements would often benefit consumers. He said courts would have a difficult time sorting out the price agreements that help consumers from those that harm them. 
 ''The upshot is, as many economists suggest, sometimes resale price maintenance can prove harmful, sometimes it can bring benefits,'' he wrote. ''But before concluding that courts should consequently apply a rule of reason, I would ask such questions as, how often are harms or benefits likely to occur? How easy is it to separate the beneficial sheep from the antitrust goats?''
 ''My own answer,'' he concluded, ''is not very easily.''

HEADLINE: Don't Mourn Brown v. Board of Education

BYLINE: By JUAN WILLIAMS. 
Juan Williams, a senior correspondent for NPR and a political analyst for Fox News Channel, is the author of ''Enough: The Phony Leaders, Dead-End Movements and Culture of Failure That Are Undermining Black America.''

 BODY:
Washington
 LET us now praise the Brown decision. Let us now bury the Brown decision. 
 With yesterday's Supreme Court ruling ending the use of voluntary schemes to create racial balance among students, it is time to acknowledge that Brown's time has passed. It is worthy of a send-off with fanfare for setting off the civil rights movement and inspiring social progress for women, gays and the poor. But the decision in Brown v. Board of Education that focused on outlawing segregated schools as unconstitutional is now out of step with American political and social realities.
 Desegregation does not speak to dropout rates that hover near 50 percent for black and Hispanic high school students. It does not equip society to address the so-called achievement gap between black and white students that mocks Brown's promise of equal educational opportunity. 
 And the fact is, during the last 20 years, with Brown in full force, America's public schools have been growing more segregated -- even as the nation has become more racially diverse. In 2001, the National Center for Education Statistics reported that the average white student attends a school that is 80 percent white, while 70 percent of black students attend schools where nearly two-thirds of students are black and Hispanic. 
 By the early '90s, support in the federal courts for the central work of Brown -- racial integration of public schools -- began to rapidly expire. In a series of cases in Atlanta, Oklahoma City and Kansas City, Mo., frustrated parents, black and white, appealed to federal judges to stop shifting children from school to school like pieces on a game board. The parents wanted better neighborhood schools and a better education for their children, no matter the racial make-up of the school. In their rulings ending court mandates for school integration, the judges, too, spoke of the futility of using schoolchildren to address social ills caused by adults holding fast to patterns of residential segregation by both class and race.
 The focus of efforts to improve elementary and secondary schools shifted to magnet schools, to allowing parents the choice to move their children out of failing schools and, most recently, to vouchers and charter schools. The federal No Child Left Behind plan has many critics, but there's no denying that it is an effective tool for forcing teachers' unions and school administrators to take responsibility for educating poor and minority students.
 It was an idealistic Supreme Court that in 1954 approved of Brown as a race-conscious policy needed to repair the damage of school segregation and protect every child's 14th-Amendment right to equal treatment under law. In 1971, Chief Justice Warren Burger, writing for a unanimous court still embracing Brown, said local school officials could make racial integration a priority even if it did not improve educational outcomes because it helped ''to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society.'' 
 But today a high court with a conservative majority concludes that any policy based on race -- no matter how well intentioned -- is a violation of every child's 14th-Amendment right to be treated as an individual without regard to race. We've come full circle.
 In 1990, after months of interviews with Justice Thurgood Marshall, who had been the lead lawyer for the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund on the Brown case, I sat in his Supreme Court chambers with a final question. Almost 40 years later, was he satisfied with the outcome of the decision? Outside the courthouse, the failing Washington school system was hypersegregated, with more than 90 percent of its students black and Latino. Schools in the surrounding suburbs, meanwhile, were mostly white and producing some of the top students in the nation.
 Had Mr. Marshall, the lawyer, made a mistake by insisting on racial integration instead of improvement in the quality of schools for black children?
 His response was that seating black children next to white children in school had never been the point. It had been necessary only because all-white school boards were generously financing schools for white children while leaving black students in overcrowded, decrepit buildings with hand-me-down books and underpaid teachers. He had wanted black children to have the right to attend white schools as a point of leverage over the biased spending patterns of the segregationists who ran schools -- both in the 17 states where racially separate schools were required by law and in other states where they were a matter of culture.
 If black children had the right to be in schools with white children, Justice Marshall reasoned, then school board officials would have no choice but to equalize spending to protect the interests of their white children.
 Racial malice is no longer the primary motive in shaping inferior schools for minority children. Many failing big city schools today are operated by black superintendents and mostly black school boards.
 And today the argument that school reform should provide equal opportunity for children, or prepare them to live in a pluralistic society, is spent. The winning argument is that better schools are needed for all children -- black, white, brown and every other hue -- in order to foster a competitive workforce in a global economy.
 Dealing with racism and the bitter fruit of slavery and ''separate but equal'' legal segregation was at the heart of the court's brave decision 53 years ago. With Brown officially relegated to the past, the challenge for brave leaders now is to deliver on the promise of a good education for every child.

 Leegin's marketing strategy for finding a niche in the highly competitive world of small leather goods was to sell its ''Brighton'' line of fashion accessories through small boutiques that could offer personalized service. Retailers were required to accept a no-discounting policy.
 After the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, upheld the judgment and said it was bound by Supreme Court precedent, Leegin took the case to the Supreme Court. Unless it is settled, the case, Leegin Creative Leather Products v. PSK Inc., will now be sent down to a lower court to apply the new standard.
 The Supreme Court adopted the flat ban on resale price agreements between manufacturers and retailers in 1911, when it found that the Dr. Miles Medical Company had violated the Sherman act. The company had sought to sell medicine only to distributors who agreed to resell them at set prices. The court said such agreements benefit only the distributors, not consumers, and set a per se rule making such agreements unlawful. 
 Justice Kennedy said Thursday that the court was not bound by the 1911 precedent because of the ''widespread agreement'' among economists that resale price maintenance agreements can promote competition.
 ''Vertical agreements establishing minimum resale prices can have either pro-competitive or anticompetitive effects, depending upon the circumstances in which they are formed,'' he wrote.
 But Justice Breyer said in his dissent that the court had failed to justify the overturning of the rule, or that there was significant evidence to show that price agreements would often benefit consumers. He said courts would have a difficult time sorting out the price agreements that help consumers from those that harm them. 
 ''The upshot is, as many economists suggest, sometimes resale price maintenance can prove harmful, sometimes it can bring benefits,'' he wrote. ''But before concluding that courts should consequently apply a rule of reason, I would ask such questions as, how often are harms or benefits likely to occur? How easy is it to separate the beneficial sheep from the antitrust goats?''
 ''My own answer,'' he concluded, ''is not very easily.''

HEADLINE: Fed Leaves A Key Rate Unchanged

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve, saying that inflation remains its ''predominant policy concern,'' left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25 percent on Thursday and signaled that it would keep it at that level for some time. 
 The rate decision, which financial markets had already taken as a given, meant that the central bank's ''pause'' in rate increases is now one year old -- a record of sorts for a policy that was originally billed as tentative. 
 In its statement, the Federal Reserve acknowledged that inflation had ''improved modestly'' in recent months, and it dropped its previous description of consumer prices as ''somewhat elevated.''
 But it also warned against any temptation to declare victory. ''A sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated,'' the central bank said. 
 Although analysts and investors had little doubt that policy makers would continue their wait-and-see stance, the Dow Jones industrial average gyrated down and back up after the Fed announcement, then ended the day down 0.04 percent at 13,422.28.
 The biggest question was how policy makers would change the nuances in their description of the economy, and especially how they would react to recent evidence of slowing inflation.
 For the last several years, Fed governors including Ben S. Bernanke have set an unofficial goal of keeping the ''core'' rate of inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, at 1 to 2 percent a year.
 The central bank's favorite measure of core inflation -- the Commerce Department's price index for personal consumer expenditures -- is just slightly above 2 percent compared with one year ago and has eased from about 2.4 percent in March.
 But because energy prices have climbed sharply in the last few months, the overall Consumer Price Index has climbed much faster than the core measure and was up 2.7 percent in May compared with one year earlier. 
 Fed policy makers are in no rush to reduce interest rates. Economic growth, which slowed to a crawl of 0.7 percent in the first three months of this year, appears to have accelerated to an annual pace of about 3 percent in the second quarter of this year. 
 Unemployment, which has hovered at about 4.5 percent for the last several months, remains lower than the central bank had expected and is at levels that many economists equate with full employment.
 ''What they are saying is that they're happy with the inflation readings of the last couple of months, and that if we get the same readings over the next few months, then we're finished with raising rates,'' said Ethan Harris, an economist at Lehman Brothers.
 But Mr. Harris cautioned that the inflation readings in the months ahead might be less encouraging.
 Shortly before the Fed announcement, the Commerce Department raised its previous estimates of growth and nudged up its estimate of core inflation in the first quarter to 2.4 percent from 2.2 percent. 
 That was not a big change in itself, but it is likely to have the mathematical effect of pushing up measures of year-over-year price changes for May, which the government will report on Friday.
 As it has said in previous months, the Fed cautioned that inflation could also be pushed higher by the nation's ''high level of resource utilization'' -- a reference to the low unemployment rate and fairly low levels of spare factory capacity.
 Though some analysts had speculated that the policy makers were putting a new emphasis on the overall inflation rate, which includes food and energy prices, the Fed's statement did not mention that issue directly.
 Mr. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has long argued that energy and food prices are too erratic to provide a reliable guide to the underlying rate of inflation. 
 But Fed officials may well be worried that high ''headline'' measures of inflation will lead to higher inflation expectations among consumers and workers bargaining over wages.
 Thus far, the two basic indicators of inflation expectations have remained fairly stable. One is the spread between yields on inflation-protected Treasury securities and regular Treasuries. The current spread on 10-year Treasury bonds, a rough proxy for market assumptions about inflation, is about 2.4 percent. 
 The other big indicator, the University of Michigan's monthly survey of consumers, has also been steady. Inflation expectations for the year ahead jumped in May, which often happens after gasoline prices rise sharply. But expectations for the next five years have not moved much.
 That could change. Richard Yamarone, an economist at Argus Research, said the rising food prices, which have been driven up in part by soaring prices for corn and energy, could jolt consumer assumptions about inflation by the end of this year.

HEADLINE: First-Quarter Economic Growth Was Slowest Since Late 2002

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28 

 BODY:
The economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the first three months of this year, the weakest in more than four years, but a closely watched inflation gauge unexpectedly accelerated, data showed on Thursday. 
 It was the weakest quarterly expansion in the gross domestic product since the fourth quarter of 2002. The slowdown came as businesses sold off inventories even though consumer spending remained strong.
 But a leading inflation gauge favored by the Federal Reserve -- the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy prices -- showed that price pressures were stronger than expected.
 The index was revised up to a 2.4 percent rate from the prior 2.2 percent estimate. Economists expected the core index to remain at 2.2 percent.
 ''The higher inflation is what folks are focusing on. It's a little disconcerting,'' said Mark Vitner, an economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
 A separate report from the Labor Department showed stable labor market conditions as the number of workers applying for jobless benefits fell by 13,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 313,000.
 That level was slightly lower than what Wall Street economists were expecting and was taken as a sign the labor market was still strong. But layoffs linked to auto retooling shutdowns typical in the summer months could skew the labor picture in coming weeks, economists said.
 ''We won't have a clear idea of any change in the trend in claims until the end of July,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
 ''For now, though, the message seems to be that while companies have clearly cut back the pace of hiring, they are not significantly increasing layoffs,'' he added.
 The G.D.P. report, the final of three estimates, was slightly better than the government's earlier reading of 0.6 percent during the first quarter but weaker than the 0.8 percent growth economists expected. It was down from 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006.
 Businesses cut inventories at a $4.2 billion annual rate during the quarter, the department said, slightly less than the $4.5 billion annual rate in the previous estimate for the quarter but still big enough to pull growth down during the quarter.
 Imports increased at a 5.5 percent rate during the quarter, slightly lower than the 5.7 percent estimate a month ago, but still a big enough rise to also help slow the G.D.P. growth rate. At the same time, exports advanced at a 0.7 percent rate, a reversal from the 0.6 percent contraction in the previous estimate.

 Previews and Openings
 'XANADU' In previews; opens on July 10. The 1980 cult roller-disco film about a Greek muse sent to earth goes Broadway -- and it's about time (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.
 Broadway
 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 
 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)
 'FROST/NIXON'Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)
 'GREY GARDENS'Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. 
 (Brantley)
 'LES MISERABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 '110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'SPRING AWAKENING' (Tony Award, best musical 2007) Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 
 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. 
 (Brantley)
 Off Broadway
 'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood) 
 'BEYOND GLORY' Stephen Lang is the sole actor in his own adaptation of Larry Smith's book profiling servicemen who have received the Medal of Honor, the United States military's greatest laurel. Sober, straightforward and admirably lacking in histrionics, the show allows us to hear soldiers speaking of their experiences in their own words (1:20). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood) 
 'ESCAPE FROM BELLEVUE' This showcase for the band the Knockout Drops is less a theatrical experience than a slightly uncomfortable hybrid of a stand-up routine and a rock concert. It is also the agreeable if predictable memoir of the lead singer, Christopher John Campion, who narrates his own story -- heavy substance abuse, a couple of trips to Bellevue, a brave new life -- with a knack for anecdote and an ear for dialogue, like a particularly good storyteller at the corner bar. But ultimately, a rock musical, even one as understated as this, rises or falls with its music; fortunately, this band, though a little stolid, is pretty good (1:30). The Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-7171. (Anne Midgette) 
 'EURYDICE' Sarah Ruhl's goofy but tenderhearted comedy focuses not on the much-sung-of Orpheus, but on his bride and the journey into the underworld. Maria Dizzia is a radiant Eurydice in this inexpressibly moving theatrical fable about love, loss and the pleasures and pains of memory. Not to be missed by anyone with an interest in fresh theatrical voices (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Isherwood)
 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'GASLIGHT' The Irish Repertory Theater's revival of Patrick Hamilton's 1938 thriller about a husband intent on driving his wife mad strips away the claustrophobia and ably resists cliched feminist interpretation. As the impish detective who saves the day, Brian Murray is the play's great leavening agent. He prompts the heroine to whiskey drinking, and you want to raise a glass to him (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737.
 (Ginia Bellafante)
 'GONE MISSING' A delightful revival of the Civilians' revue of songs and monologues about lost shoes, cellphones, jewelry and maybe an illusion or two. The sharp young company brings energy and wit to both the collagelike text composed of odd tales of dispossession, and Michael Friedman's eclectic cavalcade of pastiche songs. Brisk, funny, clever -- pretty much perfect summer fare (1:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)
 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 
 'IN A DARK DARK HOUSE'Neil LaBute's latest work, a tale of two badly behaving brothers (played by Frederick Weller and Ron Livingston), is about American adolescence and how it is warped, stolen and willfully extended. Before the double-knotted plot twists take over, it's a cold-eyed, absorbing drama that testifies to its author's very real talents (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)
 'THE J.A.P. SHOW: JEWISH AMERICAN PRINCESSES OF COMEDY' Laughs along with longueurs (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 
 'PLATANOS AND COLLARD GREENS' Set on a virtually unadorned stage, David Lamb's examination of the racial tensions between blacks and Latinos in New York exists as a kind of modern-day ''West Side Story''' by way of the after-school special. With only minimal publicity, the play, however simplistic, has developed a huge following among people who come to see it again and again (2:20). Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Bellafante) 
 'THE RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL' The Mint Theater Company has unearthed this enthralling Edwardian drama by St. John Hankin about a lazy charmer who returns home to blackmail his wealthy family (2:00). The Mint Theater Company, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Jason Zinoman) 
 'ROMEO AND JULIET' Once you get past the water-themed set (which makes no sense), this is a terrifically exciting production, with a Juliet truly to die for in Lauren Ambrose. The director Michael Greif and his cast, including the appealing Oscar Isaac as a spaniel-eyed Romeo, achieve a sense of infectious, instinctive urgency; the production advances with hot-headed speed even when it's standing still. (2:45). Delacorte Theater in Central Park, midpark at 80th Street, (212) 539-8750. (Brantley)
 '10 MILLION MILES' This musical about a road trip, featuring songs by the country cult composer Patty Griffin, feels like a road trip in its mix of tedious stretches and moments of beauty. The show, directed by Michael Mayer (''Spring Awakening''), is merely perfunctory when it talks but often rapturous when it sings. Mare Winningham is terrific in an assortment of supporting roles (1:40). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)
 Off Off Broadway
 'THE BRIG' Serious students of the stage will want to check out the Living Theater's first revival since 1963 of Kenneth H. Brown's docudrama about the soul-shredding grind of daily life in a Marine Corps prison, once again directed by the company co-founder Judith Malina. One of the most celebrated productions in the company's history, ''The Brig'' harks back to an era when theater was at the forefront of both political and artistic radicalism (2:00). Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 
 'I GOOGLE MYSELF' This trashy thriller about a stalker and a pornography star has its guilty pleasures (1:30). Under St. Marks, 94 St. Marks Place, between First Avenue and Avenue A, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Zinoman)
 'THE IRISH PLAY' Tim McGillicuddy's romantic comedy has a promising beginning: a would-be playwright (Zachary Spicer) and a would-be terrorist (the excellent Jonathan P. Judge-Russo) rant and argue about race memory, blood, poetry and what it means to be Irish. But as the plot kicks in, the play becomes more conventional and its characters' choices and motives less organic (2:50). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (914) 963-6222. (Rachel Saltz)
 'TIME FLIES AND OTHERS BY IVES' An amusing collection of comic playlets by David Ives embraces the little guy (1:35). Laurie Beechman Theater, 407 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 
 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates) 
 Long-Running Shows
 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

HEADLINE: Immigrant Bill Dies in Senate; Defeat for Bush

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and CARL HULSE. 
Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28 

 BODY:
President Bush's effort to overhaul the nation's immigration policy, a cornerstone of his domestic agenda, collapsed Thursday in the Senate, with little prospect that it can be revived before Mr. Bush leaves office in 19 months.
 The bill called for the biggest changes to immigration law in more than 20 years, offering legal status to millions of illegal immigrants while trying to secure borders. But the Senate, forming blocs that defied party affiliation, could never unite on the main provisions. 
 Rejecting the president's last-minute pleas, it voted, 53 to 46, to turn back a motion to end debate and move toward final passage. Supporters fell 14 votes short of the 60 needed to close the debate.
 Mr. Bush placed telephone calls to lawmakers throughout the morning. But members of his party abandoned him in droves, with just 12 of the 49 Senate Republicans sticking by him on the important procedural vote that determined the fate of the bill. 
 Nearly one-third of Senate Democrats voted, in effect, to block action on the bill. 
 The vote followed an outpouring of criticism from conservatives and others who called it a form of amnesty for lawbreakers. 
 The outcome was a bitter disappointment for Mr. Bush and other supporters of a comprehensive approach, including Hispanic and church groups and employers who had been seeking greater access to foreign workers.
 Supporters and opponents said the measure was dead for the remainder of the Bush administration, though conceivably individual pieces might be revived. 
 The vote reflected the degree to which Congress and the nation are polarized over immigration. The emotional end to what had been an emotional debate was evident, with a few senior staff members who had invested months in writing the bill near tears. 
 ''The bill now dies,'' said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who helped write the measure.
 The outcome also underscored the challenge that Mr. Bush faces in exerting authority and enacting an agenda as members of his party increasingly break with him and Democrats no longer fear him. Having already given up on other ambitious second-term plans like overhauling Social Security, the administration has little prospect of winning any big new legislative achievements in its final months. 
 The collapse also highlighted the difficulties that the new Democratic leadership in Congress has had in showing that it can address the big problems facing the nation. In this case, Democratic leaders asserted that the failure of the immigration bill reflected on Mr. Bush, and not on their party.
 Senator David Vitter, the Louisiana Republican who helped lead opposition to the bill, said: ''The proponents did not get even a simple majority. The message is crystal clear. The American people want us to start with enforcement at the border and at the workplace and don't want promises. They want action. They want results. They want proof, because they've heard all the promises before.''
 In voting to end the debate, the 12 Republicans were joined by 33 Democrats and one independent. Voting against the motion to end the debate were 15 Democrats, one independent and 37 Republicans, including the minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
 ''I had hoped for a bipartisan accomplishment,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''What we got was a bipartisan defeat.''
 Among the Democrats voting no were several up for re-election next year, including Senators Max Baucus of Montana, Tom Harkin of Iowa and John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia.
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said he spoke to Mr. Bush after the vote and thanked him for his work in support of the bill. 
 But, Mr. Reid said, ''There just was not enough Republican support for the president's approach.''
 Mr. Bush, in Rhode Island for a visit to the Naval War College, said: ''Legal immigration is one of the top concerns of the American people, and Congress's failure to act on it is a disappointment. A lot of us worked hard to see if we couldn't find common ground. It didn't work.''
 In the end, many groups that had supported segments of the bill urged the Senate to pass it in the hope that it could be ''improved'' in the House. 
 Representative Zoe Lofgren, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, said: ''The Senate vote effectively kills comprehensive immigration reform for this Congress. It's a vote for the status quo, which most Americans are not satisfied with.''
 Supporters of the bill agreed with opponents on one point, that many Americans believe that the government lacks the ability to carry out the huge responsibilities it would have had. ''People look out and they see the failures of government, whether it's Hurricane Katrina or the inability to get enough passports out for people, and they say, 'How is the government going to accomplish all of this?' '' Mrs. Feinstein said.
 Opponents of the bill were elated.
 Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, said: ''The American people won today. They care enough for their country to get mad and to fight for it. Americans made phone calls and sent letters and convinced the Senate to stop this bill.''
 Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, a leading opponent of the bill, said talk radio was ''a big factor'' in derailing it.
 Supporters of the bill wanted to pass it quickly, ''before Rush Limbaugh could tell the American people what was in it,'' Mr. Sessions said.
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, chief Democratic architect of the bill, said many senators ''voted their fears, not their hopes.''
 Referring to opponents, Mr. Kennedy said: ''We know what they don't like. What are they for? What are they going to do with the 12 million who are undocumented here? Send them back to countries around the world? Develop a type of Gestapo here to seek out these people that are in the shadows? What's their alternative?''
 Without a new immigration law, Mr. Kennedy said, ''The situation is going to get worse and worse and worse.''
 As the vote was conducted, several House members of Hispanic descent gathered on the Senate floor, and tourists in the gallery listened to the final arguments with rapt attention.
 A bipartisan group of 12 senators working closely with the administration wrote the bill in closed sessions over three months. After two weeks of debate, it appeared to die on June 7, when the Senate voted, 50 to 45, against ending debate. 
 Mr. Reid pulled the bill off the floor, but later agreed to return it under a procedure that bundled 27 proposed amendments into one package.
 Opponents and some supporters said Senate leaders had made a mistake in taking the bill directly to the floor without hearings or review by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
 Not just conservatives voiced reservations. Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine who is running for re-election, said: ''I just don't think the bill struck the right balance. People were troubled by the proposed solution for the 12 million people here illegally. We did not get that part right.''
 Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, a co-author of the bill, said a majority of Americans supported it when told of other provisions like increased money for border security, a new employee verification system, a guest worker program and a new merit-based system to select immigrants.
 But Senator Harkin said, ''The bill, as a whole, has evolved into an unworkable mess, and I cannot support it.'' 
 Guest workers could drive down wages for Americans ''on the lower rungs of the economic ladder,'' Mr. Harkin said, and under the employee verification system, some citizens could have been denied jobs ''because of errors in a government database.''
 Among important early backers who fell away was Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, who said he received two calls from Mr. Bush in recent days. Mr. Domenici said the secrecy surrounding the bill's drafting had left people confused and ''caused it to flop.''
 Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska and another recipient of a call from Mr. Bush, concluded that the bill was beyond repair after having backed efforts to advance it.
 ''This bill is not only hopelessly flawed, it is unsalvageable,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''We have to start over.''
 Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic rights group, predicted that ''the growing and increasingly energized Latino electorate'' would hold lawmakers accountable for failing to pass a comprehensive bill.

HEADLINE: Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan Premier in the 90s, Dies at 87

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Kiichi Miyazawa, who, as prime minister and holder of many other top government posts, helped guide Japan from postwar ruin to economic superpower, died yesterday at his home in Tokyo. He was 87.
 Shigeru Muta, an aide to Mr. Miyazawa's nephew, Yoichi Miyazawa, a Japanese lawmaker, announced the death, The Associated Press reported.
 Mr. Miyazawa emerged from a wealthy and politically powerful family to attain influence as an aide to policy makers who fashioned Japan's immediate postwar recovery and went on to hold important cabinet posts, including that of foreign minister, before becoming prime minister in November 1991. 
 In his two years at the head of the government, he pushed for better ties with Japan's Asian neighbors and was the first Japanese prime minister to acknowledge the involvement of the nation's military in forcing Asian women to serve as sex slaves for soldiers.
 His government passed a watershed law paving the way for Japan to send peacekeeping troops overseas, but resisted more profound changes in the pacifist Constitution. He negotiated a major trade accord with the United States and instituted banking reforms as he battled a gathering economic malaise that would endure for a decade.
 As finance minister in 1986 and 1987, he won popularity with high levels of public works spending, financing some of it through privatization of government companies.
 To Americans he was vividly etched in the public consciousness when in 1992, President Bush fell ill at a banquet during a trip to Japan and vomited on him. The prime minister cradled the head of the flu-stricken president in his lap afterward.
 Mr. Miyazawa was long known as a shrewd backroom operator who seriously contended for the office of prime minister beginning in the late 1970s. 
 He occupied the fuzzy borderline where his Liberal Democratic Party intersected with business interests. His rise was perceived as a return to old-style politics, signifying indifference to reforms being proposed at the time he became prime minister, The New York Times suggested at the time in an analytical article. 
 His career was thought to have ended in December 1988, when he was forced to resign as finance minister because of his involvement in a corporate influence-peddling scandal. In 1993 he was ousted as prime minister after he could not pass political reform bills he had promised. That ended the Liberal Democratic Party's 38 consecutive years of rule.
 In a rare case of a former prime minister's taking a lesser cabinet post, he returned to serve as finance minister at the age of 78 in 1998. He proposed a system of bilateral currency swaps between Asian countries that is still in place today.
 Kiichi Miyazawa was born on Oct. 8, 1919, in Tokyo. His father represented the Hiroshima area in Parliament, and his mother came from a prominent political family. A teacher wrote on his report card, ''He speaks his own mind, and some of his classmates don't like his straightforwardness.''
 He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University, and he attended a conference of American and Japanese students in the United States in 1939. His intellectual prowess allowed him to avoid military service in World War II.
 In 1942 he joined the Finance Ministry and within seven years had become the minister's private secretary. Like many Japanese, he recalled the American postwar occupation with distaste, particularly having to listen to lectures by Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur.
 ''It may be hard for young people today to understand how unpleasant it was to live under the occupation,'' he wrote in his memoirs.
 Mr. Miyazawa was an aide to his country's delegation at the peace conference in San Francisco in 1951. There, 49 nations restored ''full sovereignty'' to Japan while permitting the continuing presence of American troops on Japanese soil. 
 From 1953 to 1965, Mr. Miyazawa served in the largely ceremonial upper house of Parliament. In 1967 he was elected to his father's seat in the lower house. 
 His government posts while a member of the house included general director of the Economic Planning Agency and minister of international trade and industry. He was also chairman of his party's executive council.
 The Japanese government released no information on survivors, but this year's edition of Who's Who said he had a wife and two children. 
 Mr. Miyazawa admired the United States as a student, and his excellent English allowed him to forge warm relationships with Americans. When he concluded a major trade pact with the United States in 1993, he attributed his success to charming President Clinton over a sushi dinner.
 He could also be provocative. As prime minister, he said Japan must show ''compassion'' for social problems like homelessness in the United States, and criticized Americans' work ethic.

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Friday of Kiichi Miyazawa, former prime minister of Japan, rendered incorrectly the name of the American general whose lectures during the occupation of Japan were recalled by Mr. Miyazawa with distaste. He was Gen. Douglas MacArthur; he had no middle name and did not use the initial A (or other initials often ascribed to him, including B, C and S). Five articles in 2005 included the ''A'' (on May 29, June 20, June 28, July 29 and Aug. 26), and it has been used in 19 other articles since 1987.

HEADLINE: U.N. Development Agency Rebuts U.S. Charges of Wasteful Spending in North Korea

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 28 

 BODY:
The deputy chief of the United Nations Development Program has shot back at American accusations that it had squandered millions of dollars in North Korea, saying the amount far surpassed what the program had at its disposal and questioning the authenticity of documents the American mission provided to back up its claims.
 In a confidential letter delivered Thursday evening to Zalmay Khalilzad, the United States ambassador, the official, Ad Melkert, said the money amounts, vendor names and transaction dates supplied by the United States had been examined against his agency's records and ''there is not a single match.''
 He said the volume of payments that the Americans claimed that the program had made to North Korean government entities was ''significantly higher'' than the total that the office had for all purposes in the country. 
 American officials have said their charges stem from internal business records of the program, but Mr. Melkert challenged the veracity of seven supporting documents that the United States mission supplied in a June 15 meeting.
 Those were presented as being files from 2001 and 2002, but he said his office had determined that they had been generated under a computer coding system put into effect in 2004. The documents, he said, ''show U.N.D.P. corporate system codes not in use by U.N.D.P. in those years.''
 Noting that the United States had termed the evidence made available so far ''sample documents,'' Mr. Melkert asked Mr. Khalilzad to furnish all of the documentation substantiating the American claims.
 The letter is the latest in a series of frosty exchanges between Mr. Melkert and American officials in the six months since Mark D. Wallace, the deputy American ambassador for management, accused the program of serving as ''a steady and large source of hard currency'' for the North Korean government.
 The program, Mr. Wallace wrote then, has been ''systematically perverted for the benefit of the Kim Jong-il regime rather than the people of North Korea,'' and he suggested that the United Nations money might have ended up financing North Korea's nuclear program.
 The new letter was made available by an official interested in combating the wide attention that the American allegations had received through briefings by Mr. Wallace for selected news outlets, editorial writers, members of Congress and nations that finance the development program.
 A note sent to participants in a briefing by Mr. Wallace before a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on May 23 promised ''many parallels to the oil-for-food scandal'' and evidence of ''a direct link between U.N. assistance and the North Korean missile programs.''
 Mr. Melkert complained in a previous letter that the briefings failed to mention the rebuttals supplied by his office to each set of allegations.
 Asked Thursday afternoon about the months of charge and countercharge, Mr. Wallace noted that Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Kemal Dervis, the development program's chief, had committed themselves to look into the matter. ''I think the U.S. certainly looks forward to the U.N.D.P.'s constructive and technical inquiry into the program, a program that appears to have lost its way,'' he said. 
 The original January accusation from Mr. Wallace prompted the development program's executive board that same month to order an end to the practice of furnishing payments in hard currency to the North Korean government and to making in-country hiring subject to government approval.
 In March, after North Korea resisted those conditions, the agency announced that it was suspending operations in the country, curtailing 20 programs with an overall budget of $4.4 million. The programs dealt with agricultural recovery and rural energy development, according to the development program's Web site.
 On June 1 a preliminary United Nations audit offered no support for the charge that systematic large-scale diversions to the North Korean government had occurred, but it said the program had broken its own rules by hiring workers selected by the government and paying them in foreign currency.
 Then the United States raised a series of new charges, and program officials responded to each point. 
 To Mr. Wallace's charge that the program had transferred $7 million to its counterpart agency in the North Korean government, the program said that the amount actually had been $175,000 and that most of it had gone for workshops on vegetable growing and seed processing.
 The program reiterated the same $175,000 figure in reply to a second allegation: that an additional $2.8 million in program money had gone to North Korean missions in New York and Europe and had been used to purchase buildings and houses in Britain, France and Canada.
 The agency also turned aside Mr. Wallace's accusations that it had procured equipment for North Korea that could be put to military use. It said the equipment, which included global positioning systems, personal computers and a portable spectrometer, an optical device, had been purchased under a program, common in developing nations, that monitors natural disasters and helps to estimate crop yields.
 Mr. Melkert also denied that his agency had paid $2.7 million to the Zang Lok Trading Company, a banking institution based in Macao that Mr. Wallace said was linked to a North Korean financial agent involved in weapons sales. 
 According to banking records, Mr. Melkert said, the development program's total payments to Zang Lok from 1999 to the present amount to $52,201.95 and went for workshop equipment and computers for Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and for the World Intellectual Property Organization. The development program had no transactions with Zang Lok on its own account, he said.
 Totaling up the charges, Mr. Melkert said in his letter to Mr. Khalilzad that ''the allegation that U.N.D.P. transferred $15 million in cash to the D.P.R.K. government in the period 2001-2005 is not supported as our banking records show that the country office did not have this magnitude of resources at its disposal.'' North Korea's official name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
 Mr. Melkert said that only an average of $2.5 million a year had been available from 2001 to 2005 and that the sum included all payments made by the country office supporting development program operations and some other United Nations functions.
 Mr. Wallace has also cited ''eyewitness accounts'' from unidentified people to support his charges, and he has accused the program of retaliating against one of its employees for revealing information about mismanagement.
 In a letter Tuesday to the secretary general, Senator Norm Coleman, a Minnesota Republican, identified the employee as Artjon Shkurtaj, the program's chief of operations in North Korea in 2005 and 2006.
 David Morrison, the program's spokesman, said Mr. Shkurtaj left North Korea in August 2006 and left the program in March 2007, after fulfilling several short-term contracts. Senator Coleman said he had been let go because of concerns he had raised and should be afforded whistle-blower protection.
 Mr. Melkert said Mr. Shkurtaj had been invited to submit his information to the program's audit office but had declined to do so.

HEADLINE: Defeat Worries Employers Who Rely on Immigrants

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
While the defeat of the Senate immigration bill was a dismaying disappointment to illegal immigrants and the groups that support them, it also created major worries for employers across the country who depend on immigrant workers.
 Employers from food-processing industries and agriculture as well as construction contractors and commercial landscapers were among the most persistent forces pushing for passage of the Senate bill, which failed yesterday when senators voted 53 to 46 not to proceed to a vote. The measure would have provided a path to legal status for millions of illegal immigrants, who make up a significant percentage of workers in many low-wage, labor intensive industries.
 The bill's defeat was hailed yesterday by conservative groups and others who said it would have rewarded law-breaking immigrants and would have wrongly excused the employers who hired them. Now, employers say they face a bleak landscape of intensified raids by the immigration authorities and growing pressure to purge illegal immigrants from their work force, but no new options to bring in temporary foreign workers or help illegal workers become legal. 
 ''It leaves most of our guys in a pretty tough spot,'' said Brewster Bevis, director of legislative affairs for Associated Builders and Contractors, a national organization of construction businesses. ''Most of our members are good actors, they believe the workers they have hired are legal,'' Mr. Bevis said. ''But they wanted this reform so they can sleep better at night and don't have to fear potentially being visited by ICE,'' the federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency.
 Meatpacking employers were especially concerned about the defeat of the bill. Senate conservatives who opposed it, backed by a surge of support from irate voters, said they wanted to secure the nation's borders and crack down on employers of illegal immigrants before considering legalization measures.
 ''Immigration policy is divorced from enforcement, and the American employer, for one, is caught in the middle,'' said Jack Shandley, a vice president at Swift & Company, a meatpacking company in Greeley, Colo. Immigration agents arrested 1,282 Swift workers in raids last December that cost the company more than $45 million in lost production and worker replacement costs.
 Leaders on all sides of the unusual coalition of business groups and immigrant advocate organizations that supported the bill said they would have to hunker down with a status quo they called dysfunctional.
 ''More people are going into hiding,'' said Juan Salgado, president of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, based in Chicago, which works with many illegal immigrants. Mr. Salgado said most illegal immigrants had family ties to legal immigrants and American citizens and would not be likely to return to their home countries despite the heightened risk of deportation.
 ''What it means in practice,'' he said, '' is that every day you get in the car and go to work to feed the children, but you are thinking: I may not come back. If they take me what happens to my family?''
 Immigrant advocates said many illegal immigrants were not acutely disappointed because they had not had high expectations that the bill would pass.
 The setback was more significant for the employers, who were represented by the American Chamber of Commerce and the Essential Worker Immigration Coalition. Supporting the bill was a tricky proposition for many employers, and their advocacy remained muted through the debate. They had to call for legalizing illegal workers without admitting they employed any in their own work sites.
 Business leaders said they were troubled to find themselves on the wrong side of Republican lawmakers who had long been their allies. One of the most active companies behind the bill was Pilgrim's Pride, the nation's largest chicken company, with 56,500 workers, based in Pittsburg, Tex. Senators John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison, both Republicans of Texas, voted to kill the bill.
 Cliff Butler, vice chairman of Pilgrim's Pride, said he was dismayed by calls from the bill's opponents for stepped-up deportation of illegal immigrants. ''I was surprised by how little import was given to the impact of that on millions of good people, and what it would to our economy to remove that labor force,'' Mr. Butler said. ''They just ignored that totally.''
 Farmers and construction contractors said they anticipated labor shortages. They worried that they would have to continue to rely on the existing system for verifying the immigration status of new hires, which is known as Basic Pilot, even though it is error-prone and inefficient. Swift had participated for years in the program before the raids last year.
 Farming and farm worker groups were slightly more optimistic. A proposal for a temporary worker program for agriculture, known as AgJobs, was incorporated into the Senate bill. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said she would seek to revive AgJobs in coming months by attaching it to other legislation.

HEADLINE: Margaret Helfand, 59, Architect; Led Urban Planning Efforts

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Margaret Helfand, a Manhattan architect and urban planner who served as president of the American Institute of Architects' New York chapter, died on June 20. She was 59. 
 The cause was complications of colon cancer, said her husband, Jon Turner. 
 Ms. Helfand helped create the Center for Architecture, a hub for exhibitions in the field and the home of the New York chapter of the institute. 
 She served as the institute's president in 2001. She was a co-chairman of New York New Visions, a civic group that advised government agencies on urban design and planning guidelines for the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan after the destruction of the World Trade Center. 
 Although she worked for big firms like Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Marcel Breuer Associates and spent three years in a smaller partnership -- Helfand Myerberg Guggenheimer -- Ms. Helfand spent the bulk of her career practicing at her own firm, founded in 1981. 
 Her designs emphasized clean elemental forms, the use of natural materials and the integration of her buildings with the surrounding landscape. Her Swarthmore Science Center, for example, was built from local schist stone and included a sunken garden that spilled out toward the woods.
 Her collaboration on a contemporary design for the Automated Trading Desk office complex, in a 22-acre parklike setting in Mount Pleasant, S.C., harnesses the landscape as a contemporary counterpoint to the frenetic activity within. ''Helfand created a headquarters acclaimed for the way individual work places are integrated with the landscape,'' a report in the Architectural Record said. 
 Ms. Helfand also designed interiors like Time Out magazine's 1996 offices in New York. The first phase of her renovations for Friends Seminary School on East 16th Street in Manhattan is now approaching completion.
 Born in Pasadena, Calif., in 1947, she attended Swarthmore College from 1965 to 1968 and completed her undergraduate education at the University of California at Berkeley in 1969. In 1970 she attended the Architectural Association school in London, where she also studied at the International Institute of Design. During this period, she and a group of friends bought a 90-foot-long, three-mast schooner, rebuilt it and sailed to Spain and the Caribbean. 
 In the introduction to ''Margaret Helfand Architects: Essential Architecture,'' Paola Antonelli, a design curator at the Museum of Modern Art, wrote that boating gave Ms. Helfand experience in carpentry and cabinetmaking. 
 Ms. Helfand spoke out frequently on the challenges of rebuilding at ground zero.
 When the work of the eight finalists in the design competition for a World Trade Center Memorial went on view at the World Financial Center in 2003, she was quoted in an article in The New York Times as calling for a higher level of design. 
 ''I yearn for something simple with no moving parts, like a Mayan pyramid,'' she said. ''What did they understand that somehow we don't?'''
 In addition to her husband of 18 years, she is survived by a sister, Judy, of Kenwood, Calif.

HEADLINE: DIY Art: Walk on It, Write on It, Stroke It

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
Rudolf Stingel's show at Daniel Newburg's SoHo gallery in 1991 has always stuck with me. Mr. Stingel was 35 and newly arrived from Italy, and his American debut pulled no punches. He simply covered the gallery's entire floor with plush carpet so deeply orange that the white walls acquired a pinkish glow. The effect was profoundly, disturbingly, subversively optical, a Duchampian ready-made in blatant disregard of Duchamp's injunction against the retinal aspect of art.
 Two years later Mr. Stingel exhibited a similar work at the Venice Biennale, covering an enormous wall in the Arsenale with orange carpet that visitors could roughen and smooth with their hands, leaving transient swirls and marks that suggested giant brush strokes. It was like Etch a Sketch cave painting, and made for terrific impromptu theater. The shock was multiple: Not only was this immense, furry orangeness a painting, it was interactive; you could run your fingers through its color. Yet for all it malleability, the piece remained basically impervious to interference. It was a concrete metaphor for art's ability to be different for each viewer and yet retain its essential integrity. 
 There is, regrettably, no orange carpet in the grandly spare, casually exultant survey of Mr. Stingel's paintings at the Whitney Museum of American Art, but there is still plenty to enthrall and perturb. For nearly 20 years he has made work that seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. Beauty, humor, euphoria, a democratic slant and a resolute sense of economy form the core of Mr. Stingel's art. He combines a love of painting with the postmodern suspicion of it, and often achieves a near-perfect balance between the visual and the conceptual.
 This show stands a good chance of fulfilling that old avant-garde imperative ''epater le bourgeois'' -- shock the bourgeoisie. Some people may walk through it in five minutes, scoffing. But I doubt that anyone can move fast enough to evade its challenges to conventional ideas of painting, taste and progress. 
 For one thing, it has too much jaw-dropping, thought-provoking beauty. Even the most skeptical viewer may be slowed by the gallery where three gold-on-gold paintings with raised brocade patterns (and painted highlights if you look carefully) are reflected in a shimmering mirrored floor. Not only are you part of the painting that is this room, your reflection is too. The ensemble is a Baroque-yet-21st-century retort to Robert Rauschenberg's White Paintings, in which the main images are the viewers' shadows.
 The Whitney show opens with a silvery big bang: a large gallery lined with aluminum foil set aglitter by an immense crystal chandelier hanging from its ceiling. Viewers can mark on the foil, which is actually foam-backed insulation. An idea of what's possible is provided by the already elaborately engraved foil on the upper reaches of the walls. Its exuberant textures, graffiti and carvings are the handiwork of visitors to the show's first incarnation at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, where it was organized by Francesco Bonami, that museum's senior curator. Its strikingly spacious New York presentation has been overseen by Chrissie Iles, a Whitney curator.
 Optical intensity without sentimentality might be Mr. Stingel's motto. He seems to define paintings foremost as flat surfaces that radiate visual power in unfamiliar terms. His art connects to European monochromists like Yves Klein and Piero Manzoni and also to skeptical painters like Albert Oehlen and Christopher Wool, but it may be best understood as an Americanized, Warholian version of Arte Povera; Mr. Stingel often favors cheap materials (Styrofoam, for example), but instead of being distressed they are always brand new, industrial and somehow implicitly American.
 Big, even architectural scale and color are part of the mix, as well as thwarted expectations. Opulence is countered by austerity, spectacle is undercut by banality. All processes are as transparent and simple as possible. Skill is continually reinvented and always less central than thought. Abstraction is less important than physicality. The show includes four big, velvety Photo Realist self-portraits executed in tones of cream and charcoal. One shows Mr. Stingel as a fresh, young military recruit. Three others, in the show's final gallery, depict him looking older, wiser and sadder, and moping about a hotel room.
 The show swings between painting as portable object and as immersive environment. One gallery is devoted to silvery paintings with undertones of red, yellow or blue from 1987 to 1994, and they are the show's earliest works. They compress Mr. Stingel's idea about process, glamour and the ready-made into stubborn nuggets. Made using a large piece of tulle as a stencil according to instructions that Mr. Stingel published in a booklet, these paintings resemble a Minimalist version of Color Field painting. Anyone who bought the booklet could produce a DIY Stingel, and also, as Mr. Bonami notes in his catalog essay, ''a painting for Rudolf Stingel.''
 Mr. Stingel's Styrofoam works poke fun at painting's luxury status. The show includes one made from planks of pink Styrofoam scooped out with a wood-carving tool. Each scoop functions as a grotesquely large brush stroke, while the surface also bears a startling resemblance to strawberry ice cream. Others pieces are made by walking on white Styrofoam in boots dipped in lacquer thinner, which melts the Styrofoam as if it were snow, leaving big slurpy footprints. Jackson Pollock performed a kind of dance while dripping paint onto his horizontal canvases. Ms. Stingel, who grew up in the Italian Alps, simply trudges across the white ground of his work.
 Mr. Stingel is also heir to the uses of chance and silence, or in his case emptiness, encouraged by the composer John Cage. This is perhaps clearest in an expanse of cream-colored wall-to-wall carpet that spent six months on the floor of Mr. Stingel's studio accumulating footprints and splatters, flecks and stains of black paint. Covering an immense wall at the Whitney, it initially resembles a huge swath of ancient parchment. When you recognize it as carpet, the thick familiar texture and the random, delicacy of the marks can create an unusual spatial push-pull. Focus on the marks, and they float in a creamy space. Focus on the carpet, and you may feel that you are doing the floating, looking down on it from above.
 In a sense the alternation between portable and environmental works is resolved in the last gallery, where five enormous canvases form a powerful installation. Two of these are large black-on-black paintings using a brocade pattern like the gold paintings. Here tonal shifts in the black background make it seem as if the pattern is drifting in and out of a black fog that changes as you move; the pattern shifts from black-on-gray to gray-on-black. Across from these are the three dark self-portraits of the mature Mr. Stingel. These paintings set a brooding, romantic, even phlegmatic tone at odds with his usual brisk no-nonsense attitude, but they emphasize several important points: The artist is always at the center of the art, no matter how impersonal it may sometimes appear; art takes a lot of thought and deliberation, no matter how simple it may seem; and indolence has its rewards.
 The implication is that artists in particular should do as little as possible. The sign of a successful artwork is its ability to derive the greatest effect from the least means. Another lesson to be extracted from this elegant show is the oxymoronic nature of the notion of ''empty beauty'' that has been bruited about extensively in the last decade. This show suggests that if art is empty, it is not beautiful and vice versa. If something is beautiful in any sustained way, it contains, at the least, an idea about beauty and usually much more. It is the result of something being worked on and worked out. Beauty is the state of operating at stunning efficiency, a triumph that can't be empty. Mr. Stingel's work makes this perfectly clear.
 ''Rudolf Stingel'' is at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, through Oct. 14, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org.

HEADLINE: Unrest Grows With Gas Lines Amid Rationing in Iran

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI and JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: TEHRAN, June 28 

 BODY:
Unrest spread in Tehran on Thursday, the second day of gasoline rationing in oil-rich Iran, with drivers lining up for miles, gas stations being set on fire and state-run banks and business centers coming under attack.
 Dozens were arrested, and the Tehran police chief, Ismail Ahmadi Moghaddam, complained to reporters that the police had been caught unaware by the decision to ration fuel. 
 The anger posed a keen threat to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was elected two years ago on a platform of bringing income from oil to the nation's households. Instead, even though Iran is one of the world's largest producers of crude oil, it has been forced to import about 40 percent of its gasoline at an annual cost of $5 billion to make up for shortfalls in its archaic refining industry.
 Some analysts said the decision to ration gasoline was intended to prepare for the possibility of more United Nations economic sanctions as a result of concern over Iran's nuclear program.
 Iran has defied a demand by the United Nations Security Council to suspend uranium enrichment activities, and the Council is debating whether to impose tougher sanctions. Iran contends that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. 
 ''Iran's dependence on imported gasoline has been a focus of international debate over future sanctions,'' according to the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultant. ''Rationing will reduce Iran's vulnerability, and Iran's leadership explicitly mentioned this goal in commenting on the measure,'' it said. 
 Saeed Leylaz, an economist and political analyst in Tehran, said, ''The high gasoline consumption has made Iran very vulnerable, and this is a security decision now.'' 
 ''We are importing gasoline from 16 different countries,'' he said. ''The country would be on the verge of collapse if they suddenly decide not to sell us gasoline. The government has to find a way to lower the consumption.'' 
 In Washington on Thursday, leaders of a bipartisan House panel, led by Representative Mark Steven Kirk, Republican of Illinois, and Representative Robert E. Andrews, Democrat of New Jersey, proposed legislation intended to punish any company that provides Iran with gasoline or helps it import gasoline after Dec. 31. Such a company could lose its access to American customers through sanctions.
 The Iranian government had planned for a year to ration gasoline but had postponed the move, fearing unrest. Iran offers the highest subsidies for gasoline in the region, buying foreign gasoline for slightly more than $2 a gallon, according to official figures, and offering it for 34 cents a gallon. 
 ''Iran is in a bind,'' said Vera de Ladoucette, an energy analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris. ''They have acted too late and too harshly.''
 According to Ms. de Ladoucette, Iran is also seeking to increase its gasoline production and has outlined plans to spend $18 billion by 2012 to increase its refining capacity by 1.5 million barrels a day from about 1.6 million. The government's plan is to build four refineries and expand older ones. But, she added, it is unlikely to achieve that goal by 2012. ''The problem will be financing all this,'' she said. 
 Parliament voted last month to increase the price of gasoline to 64 cents a gallon. It said that its studies showed that the move would lead to a decline in the consumption. But Mr. Ahmadinejad rejected the proposal and decided to proceed with rationing. 
 The price of subsidized gasoline was raised by 25 percent last month. The new regulation allows private cars 26 gallons of gasoline a month for 34 cents a gallon. Taxis are allowed 211 gallons a month. 
 Despite a warning to the local news media to avoid reporting the unrest caused by rationing, newspapers continued to criticize the decision. The daily Etemad Melli wrote that public transportation had been insufficient to move stranded people on streets since Wednesday, when rationing took effect. ''The question is if our dear officials enjoy or benefit from causing such unexpected difficulties,'' it wrote. 
 Five gallons of gasoline has been selling for $15 in the black market in Zahedan, in the southeast, the daily Seday-e-Edalat reported. 
 The Web site Norouz reported that riots had erupted in Ilam on the eastern border and that people had attacked a gas station in Shiraz in the south.
 Longstanding discount prices have encouraged gasoline consumption in Iran, where many people believe that the vast oil resources make cheap gasoline a basic right.
 ''There is no reason why we should pay the same price as people outside Iran do,'' said Amir Aram, a carpenter in Tehran. ''We have all this oil beneath our feet and have to wait for hours in line to get our ration.'' 
 Some fear rationing could make inflation worse. Many people are dependent on their vehicles as a source of income, and many jobless people or low income government employees use their private cars as taxis. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad is facing growing discontent over his economic policies and is being blamed for failing to deliver on his promises to improve the economy. He suffered a setback last December when he lost local elections, and he faces crucial parliamentary elections in March.
 ''The government will have to back down or face consequences,'' said Ehsan Mohammadi, 32, who uses his motorcycle to work as a delivery man. ''There are many people like me, and we cannot support our families with rationed gasoline.''

HEADLINE: The Roar of the Herd Is Deafening on the Web

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
Digital utopians have heralded the dawn of an era in which Web 2.0 -- distinguished by a new generation of participatory sites like MySpace.com and YouTube.com, which emphasize user-generated content, social networking and interactive sharing -- ushers in the democratization of the world: more information, more perspectives, more opinions, more everything, and most of it without filters or fees. Yet as the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Andrew Keen points out in his provocative new book, ''The Cult of the Amateur,'' Web 2.0 has a dark side as well.
 Mr. Keen argues that ''what the Web 2.0 revolution is really delivering is superficial observations of the world around us rather than deep analysis, shrill opinion rather than considered judgment.'' In his view Web 2.0 is changing the cultural landscape and not for the better. By undermining mainstream media and intellectual property rights, he says, it is creating a world in which we will ''live to see the bulk of our music coming from amateur garage bands, our movies and television from glorified YouTubes, and our news made up of hyperactive celebrity gossip, served up as mere dressing for advertising.'' This is what happens, he suggests, ''when ignorance meets egoism meets bad taste meets mob rule.'' 
 This book, which grew out of a controversial essay published last year by The Weekly Standard, is a shrewdly argued jeremiad against the digerati effort to dethrone cultural and political gatekeepers and replace experts with the ''wisdom of the crowd.'' Although Mr. Keen wanders off his subject in the later chapters of the book -- to deliver some generic, moralistic rants against Internet evils like online gambling and online pornography -- he writes with acuity and passion about the consequences of a world in which the lines between fact and opinion, informed expertise and amateurish speculation are willfully blurred. 
 For one thing, Mr. Keen says, ''history has proven that the crowd is not often very wise,'' embracing unwise ideas like ''slavery, infanticide, George W. Bush's war in Iraq, Britney Spears.'' The crowd created the tech bubble of the 1990s, just as it created the disastrous Tulipmania that swept the Netherlands in the 17th century. 
 Mr. Keen also points out that Google search results -- which answer ''search queries not with what is most true or most reliable, but merely what is most popular'' -- can be manipulated by ''Google bombing'' (which ''involves simply linking a large number of sites to a certain page'' to ''raise the ranking of any given site in Google's search results''). And he cites a recent Wall Street Journal article reporting that hot lists on social networking Web sites are often shaped by a small number of users: that at Digg.com, which has 900,000 registered users, 30 people were responsible at one point for submitting one-third of the postings on the home page; and at Netscape.com, a single user was behind 217 stories over a two-week period, or 13 percent of all stories that reached the most popular list in that period.
 Because Web 2.0 celebrates the ''noble amateur'' over the expert, and because many search engines and Web sites tout popularity rather than reliability, Mr. Keen notes, it's easy for misinformation and rumors to proliferate in cyberspace. For instance, the online encyclopedia Wikipedia (which relies upon volunteer editors and contributors) gets way more traffic than the Web site run by Encyclopedia Britannica (which relies upon experts and scholars), even though the interactive format employed by Wikipedia opens it to postings that are inaccurate, unverified, even downright fraudulent. This year it was revealed that a contributor using the name Essjay, who had edited thousands of Wikipedia articles and was once one of the few people given the authority to arbitrate disputes between writers, was a 24-year-old named Ryan Jordan, not the tenured professor he claimed to be. 
 Since contributors to Wikipedia and YouTube are frequently anonymous, it's hard for users to be certain of their identity -- or their agendas. Postings about political candidates, for instance, can be made by opponents disguising their motives; and propaganda can be passed off as news or information. For that matter, as Mr. Keen points out, the idea of objectivity is becoming increasingly passe in the relativistic realm of the Web, where bloggers cherry-pick information and promote speculation and spin as fact. Whereas historians and journalists traditionally strived to deliver the best available truth possible, many bloggers revel in their own subjectivity, and many Web 2.0 users simply use the Net, in Mr. Keen's words, to confirm their ''own partisan views and link to others with the same ideologies.'' What's more, as mutually agreed upon facts become more elusive, informed debate about important social and political issues of the day becomes more difficult as well.
 Although Mr. Keen's objections to the publishing and distribution tools the Web provides to aspiring artists and writers sound churlish and elitist -- he calls publish-on-demand services ''just cheaper, more accessible versions of vanity presses where the untalented go to purchase the veneer of publication'' -- he is eloquent on the fallout that free, user-generated materials is having on traditional media.
 Mr. Keen argues that the democratized Web's penchant for mash-ups, remixes and cut-and-paste jobs threaten not just copyright laws but also the very ideas of authorship and intellectual property. He observes that as advertising dollars migrate from newspapers, magazines and television news to the Web, organizations with the expertise and resources to finance investigative and foreign reporting face more and more business challenges. And he suggests that as CD sales fall (in the face of digital piracy and single-song downloads) and the music business becomes increasingly embattled, new artists will discover that Internet fame does not translate into the sort of sales or worldwide recognition enjoyed by earlier generations of musicians. 
 ''What you may not realize is that what is free is actually costing us a fortune,'' Mr. Keen writes. ''The new winners -- Google, YouTube, MySpace, Craigslist, and the hundreds of start-ups hungry for a piece of the Web 2.0 pie -- are unlikely to fill the shoes of the industries they are helping to undermine, in terms of products produced, jobs created, revenue generated or benefits conferred. By stealing away our eyeballs, the blogs and wikis are decimating the publishing, music and news-gathering industries that created the original content those Web sites 'aggregate.' Our culture is essentially cannibalizing its young, destroying the very sources of the content they crave.''

HEADLINE: Domestic Issues Frame Democratic Debate in a Mostly Minority Setting

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28 

 BODY:
For 90 minutes Thursday night, eight Democratic candidates debated before an audience made up largely of one of their party's most reliable and liberal constituencies, African-American voters, and used the stage to urge a revitalization of domestic programs they said had faltered under President Bush.
 They called for spending more on schools in poor neighborhoods to lower class sizes and raising salaries for teachers to prevent a drain of educators from inner-city schools. They called for rolling back tax cuts on the wealthy to pay for expanded health care and provide job training. 
 The debate was held here on the campus of Howard University, a historically black college. It was the third Democratic presidential debate of the campaign, but the first one dedicated largely to domestic issues and particularly the problems facing minorities.
 The foreign policy flash points that had produced conflict between the Democrats at their earlier debates -- in particular, the war in Iraq -- were largely absent as the candidates spoke easily, finishing one another's sentences and offering jokes and compliments. 
 ''Let me finish John's thought because it was an important one,'' Senator Barack Obama said, finishing a response by John Edwards, who was criticizing the White House for the way it responded to Hurricane Katrina. ''There are potential Katrinas all across this country that have been neglected.'' 
 The foreign policy issue of the night was how to end the genocide in Darfur; the candidates generally agreed that the policies of the Bush administration have neglected the crisis there.
 ''Let's face it, if Darfur had a large supply of oil, this administration would be occupying it right now,'' said Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio.
 The forum was restrictive, with each of the eight candidates offered one minute to respond to a question. There was no opportunity for follow-up and the candidates were not able to engage one another. 
 The audience was filled with prominent black leaders, and the candidates -- including a black man, a Latino man and a woman -- did not begin talking until after 14 minutes of speeches and introductions. Tavis Smiley, a host of a PBS talk show devoted to black issues, moderated the debate.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York drew loud applause when she denounced the White House for its response to the AIDS epidemic in black America, moments after Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico complimented Mr. Bush's effort to finance a campaign to curb H.I.V. infection in Africa.
 ''You know, it is hard to disagree with anything that has been said, but let me just put this in perspective,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''If H.I.V./AIDS were the leading cause of death of white women between the ages of 25 and 34, there would be an outraged outcry in this country.''
 ''If we don't begin to take it seriously and address it the way we did back in the '90s, when it was primarily a gay men's disease,'' Mrs. Clinton said, ''we will never get the services and the public education that we need.''
 Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware announced to the audience that he and Mr. Obama had been tested for H.I.V., the virus that caused AIDS. Mr. Obama peered quizzically at Mr. Biden as he shared this information.
 ''I got tested for AIDS, I know Barack got tested for AIDS,'' he said. ''There's no shame in being tested for AIDS. It's an important thing.''
 When it was Mr. Obama's turn to talk he clarified what Mr. Biden had referred to. ''Tavis, Tavis, Tavis, I just got to make clear -- I got tested with Michelle,'' referring to his wife. The test came on a visit last summer to Kenya in which Mr. Obama highlighted the necessity for widespread testing to slow the spread of the disease.
 ''I don't want any confusion here about what's going on,'' Mr. Obama said with a grin.
 Mr. Biden responded: ''And I got tested to save my life, because I had 13 pints of blood transfusion.''
 The forum opened with Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, the state's first black governor, introducing the candidates.
 None of the candidates appeared to stand out, and each of the best-known ones drew relatively similar reactions from the audience.
 The candidates were pressed to respond to a Supreme Court decision earlier in the day that barred public school systems from explicitly using race to achieve or maintain integration. The candidates were unified in denouncing the decision as a setback. 
 Mr. Obama cast himself as a product of the landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision that found school segregation unconstitutional. And he reminded his audience that it was on the Howard campus that the arguments that prevailed in Brown were developed by Thurgood Marshall, then the chief counsel for the N.A.A.C.P., later the first black Supreme Court justice. 
 ''If it hadn't been for them, I would not be standing here today,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And it was their fundamental recognition that for us to achieve racial equality was not simply good for African-Americans, but it was good for America as a whole.''
 Mr. Richardson said: ''Issues of diversity for me -- the first Latino to run for president -- aren't talking points. They are facts of life.''
 On the economy, the candidates were unified in calling for a change in policies that they said had hurt the middle class and poor Americans to favor wealthy ones. 
 ''People who have done well ought to have more responsibility to pay back to the country and to the community and those around them,'' Mr. Edwards said.
 Issues of crime and punishment also were raised, with each of the candidates calling for an end to racial disparities in sentencing laws and policing. ''We'll get better justice with Democrats in the White House,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut.

HEADLINE: AS UNREST RISES, CHINA BROADENS WORKERS' RIGHTS

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN and DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 29 

 BODY:
s legislature passed a sweeping new labor law on Friday that strengthens protections for workers across the booming economy, a response to increasing signs of restiveness among tens of millions of migrant laborers. 
 The law, enacted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress over the objections of foreign investors, requires employers to provide written contracts to their workers, restricts the use of temporary laborers and helps give more employees long-term job security.
 The law, which is to take effect in 2008, also enhances the role of the Communist Party's monopoly union and allows collective bargaining for wages and benefits. 
 It softens some provisions that foreign companies said would hurt China's status as the leading low-wage manufacturing base, but retains others that American multinationals had lobbied vigorously to exclude.
 In the past, workers have had to negotiate wages with their employers individually, and China's state-run union has had almost no involvement in setting wages and benefits. 
 ''This is the biggest change in Chinese labor law in the reform and opening period,'' said Qiu Jie, a labor law expert at People's University in Beijing. ''It gives legal protection to the vast majority of workers, who had no way to protect their rights under the old system.''
 In recent years, President Hu Jintao and other leaders have sought to increase worker protections because discontent among migrant workers has contributed to a surge in social unrest and violent crime.
 But the new measure may not improve conditions for low-wage workers unless it is enforced more rigorously than existing laws, which already offer protections that on paper are similar to those in developed economies.
 Urban workers may also see little change unless the state-run union, which in the past generally represented management over workers, decides to play an active role in defending worker rights, which many analysts consider unlikely.
 Passage of the measure came shortly after officials and the state news media unearthed the widespread use of slave labor in as many as 8,000 brick kilns and small coal mines in Shanxi and Henan Provinces. It was one of the most glaring labor scandals since China began adopting market-style economic policies a quarter century ago.
 The police have freed nearly 600 workers, many of them teenagers, held against their will in factories owned or operated by well-connected businesspeople and local officials.
 Abuses of migrant laborers have been endemic in China, where millions of temporary workers have faced unpaid wages, unsafe working conditions and collusion between factory owners and local officials. 
 Party-run courts and local labor bureaus often fail to enforce the legal rights of migrant workers, many of whom never seek remedies. 
 While the new law will do little to eliminate violations of existing laws, it does require that employers treat migrant workers as they do other employees. All will have to have written employment contracts that comply with minimum wage and safety regulations.
 It also moves China closer to European-style labor regulations that emphasize employment contracts. It requires that employees with short-term contracts become full-time employees with lifetime benefits after a short contract is renewed twice.
 Perhaps most significant, it gives the state-run union and other groups representing employees the power to bargain with employers.
 Many multinational corporations had lobbied against certain provisions in an earlier draft of the new labor law. An early draft gave unions greater powers and made it more difficult to fire workers.
 Companies argued that the rules would substantially increase labor costs and reduce flexibility, and some foreign businesses warned that they would have little choice but to move their operations out of China if the provisions were enacted.
 International labor experts said several of the most delicate clauses had been watered down. But lawyers representing some big global companies complained that the new law still imposed a heavy burden.
 ''It will be more difficult to run a company here,'' said Andreas W. Lauffs, head of Baker & McKenzie's employment law group, which represents many of America's biggest corporations in China.
 The National People's Congress released only a summary of the legislation, and officials did not detail how they had changed it from the many earlier drafts.
 The summary said companies must ''consult'' the state union if they planned layoffs, suggesting a softening from earlier drafts that would have given unions the right to approve or reject layoffs before they could take place.
 But the summary retained language that limits the ''probationary contracts'' that many employers use to deny employees full-time status. It tightens conditions under which an employee can be first, while requiring severance packages for the first time. High salaried workers would face caps of severance, however. 
 Moreover, the law empowers company-based branches of the state-run union or employee representative committees to bargain with employers over salaries, bonuses, training and other benefits and duties.
 The Communist Party's monopoly union, known as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, is a legacy of China's socialist planned economy. It is an official state organization charged with overseeing workers, that in practice has tended either to play no role whatsoever or to help managers monitor and control workers. The state union rarely if ever presses for higher wages or enhanced benefits. It does not permit strikes.
 Workers are not allowed to form independent unions.
 But as Mr. Hu has pressed the state union to take a more active role, it has demanded greater representation in private Chinese and foreign-financed companies. Some foreign company executives say that if the union takes part in wage and layoff negotiations, that could greatly complicate labor relations.
 Foreign executives said they were especially worried about new labor regulations because their companies tended to comply with existing laws more rigorously than some Chinese competitors do. This disadvantage could increase sharply, they said, if the new rules produce fresh burdens that local counterparts ignore.
 Chinese legislative officials said Friday that such concerns were overblown, and that many local governments bent the rules to favor foreign investors over local companies.
 ''If there is some bias in the application of the law, it would tend to be in favor of foreign investors because local governments do so much to attract investment,'' Xin Chunying, deputy chairwoman of the legislature's law committee, said at a news conference announcing the new measures. ''The only people who will suffer under the new law are those who violate the law.''

HEADLINE: Chief Steps Down, and Commerce Bank Agrees to End Business Deals With His Family

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
At investor meetings just two weeks ago, Vernon W. Hill II seemed upbeat about the prospects for Commerce Bancorp, the company he founded nearly 35 years ago -- as well as his own. 
 Mr. Hill and the bank had been through months of regulatory scrutiny into his business dealings with family members and other company insiders. He was humbled, according to someone who met with him then, though determined to reach a settlement and lead the bank's rebound.
 But last Tuesday, Mr. Hill appeared stunned when the board demanded he resign. 
 ''Vernon had expected this to blow over,'' said another person with direct knowledge of the situation. ''This wasn't a summer storm with flashes of lightning. This was a four- or five-force hurricane.''
 Commerce publicly announced yesterday that Mr. Hill, 61, was stepping down immediately as chairman and chief executive. It also said it had reached separate agreements with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Bank in Philadelphia barring all related-party business transactions and imposing several governance reforms. 
 The company named three longtime executives to a new office of the chairman. The agreements may also require the company to add three independent directors to its board. 
 The shake-up came just five months after Commerce said that federal regulators were investigating Mr. Hill's business dealings, and shocked many on Wall Street who believed that he would never be forced out. Commerce stock soared 9.4 percent yesterday, to $36.99, as investors bet Mr. Hill's departure would make the company prime takeover bait.
 ''I have no doubt if they hung the for-sale sign up, you would have a line of buyers down the block,'' said Mark T. Fitzgibbon, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners. He said big national banks, regional players, and private equity firms were all on the prowl. 
 But on a conference call yesterday morning, Commerce executives suggested there were no immediate plans to sell. They said the bank would continue building branches. And with interest rates rising, analysts said they have flexibility to be patient. The bank's profitability is expected to improve, suggesting its market value would rise. 
 ''The plan here is to stay the course; this isn't a company that has run out of gas,'' said Dennis DiFlorio, Commerce's new chairman. Still, he left the door open to potential suitors. ''We'll look at whatever makes good strategic sense for the company.''
 Mr. Hill's next move is similarly unclear. Upon leaving Commerce next month, he may be entitled to a severance package worth as much as $17.3 million, although he and the board are still negotiating the terms. He also holds more than 6.1 million shares of Commerce stock, worth more than $225.6 million. Colleagues say his entrepreneurial streak burns so bright that it is conceivable he may start another business.
 Neither Mr. Hill nor the lawyer representing him could be reached yesterday for comment.
 Analysts say Mr. Hill's departure marked a sad and sudden end to a remarkable career. 
 ''He brought to retail banking what Starbucks brought to coffee,'' said Meredith A. Whitney, an analyst at CIBC in New York. 
 A former real estate developer, Mr. Hill founded Commerce in 1973 when he opened its first branch in Southern New Jersey. But over the next three decades, he turned it into the fastest-growing retail bank in the nation by flouting the industry convention. Today, Commerce, based in Cherry Hill, N.J., has more than 450 branches from New York City to Washington. 
 With a ''Burger King approach'' that standardized the look and feel of Commerce branches, Mr. Hill brought a retail mindset to banking that did not exist before. He focused on collecting deposits rather than making loans and on improving the customer experience rather than offering better interest rates. As rival banks championed the arrival of the cash machine, he opened friendly, spacious branches -- and kept them open seven days a week. 
 ''We believe that this is a retailing business, and we want to drive as many customers into our stores as we can,'' Mr. Hill said in an interview last year. ''My competition sees customers in stores as costs so they do things to drive them out.''
 He was similarly a maverick about his business dealings, giving Commerce the appearance of a piggy bank for insiders instead of a public company.
 While Mr. Hill survived past government inquiries, federal regulators began reviewing those transactions late last year. 
 Critics have long complained about the bank's business ties with firms that are either owned or controlled by Mr. Hill and his wife, Shirley. Most were regularly disclosed in public filings, making him an unlikely target for criminal prosecutors but ripe for regulatory action. Yesterday's agreements did not end the federal investigations, according to a person briefed on the matter. 
 For years, Commerce leased land for bank branches from firms that were owned by Mr. Hill and his family trusts; the firms earned about $1.9 million in annual rent in 2005. Commerce also had agreements with businesses run by members of his family.
 InterArch, a firm owned by Shirley Hill, was paid more than $50 million over the last 10 years to design and decorate the bank's branches. Interstate Commercial Real Estate, where Mr. Hill's brother and son are executives, made more than $1 million in commissions from Commerce-related deals. And the bank spent hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years at Galloway National Golf Club, an 18-hole course near Atlantic City owned by Mr. Hill.
 Under pressure from regulators, Commerce agreed to end those practices this month. But as talks intensified over the last two weeks, the board concluded that Mr. Hill's departure was necessary for the government to reach a final deal, according to another person briefed on the negotiations. Commerce's growth strategy depends on opening branches to feed deposits, but regulators were reluctant to approve new offices until they reached an agreement.

HEADLINE: A Landmark Ruling on Race and the Schools

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Justices, 5-4, Limit Use of Race for School Integration Plans'' (front page, June 29) and ''Resegregation Now'' (editorial, June 29):
 The decision by the majority of justices of the Supreme Court has set true integration in this country back almost three-quarters of a century. 
 All of us who remember those photographs of the brave children entering schools that had been ordered to integrate, facing the angry, loud and hateful crowds, must wonder what this country has become and what other surprises may issue from this rightward or rather backward-looking majority. 
 I do not believe that this present majority sitting on the Supreme Court speaks for me or for the majority of the citizens of this great country. I say, ''Shame, shame on you!'' Ellen Wiest 
 Santa Monica, Calif., June 29, 2007
 To the Editor:
 The Supreme Court's decision to block the use of race for school integration tragically sets the clock as well as the quest for equality back in time. 
 If the next president is a Democrat, he or she will try to undo the damage created by the Bush administration, but will be confronted with a reactionary Supreme Court, just as Franklin D. Roosevelt was in the 1930s. 
 But while a majority of the members of the high court in the '30s were close to retirement age, the conservative members of the present court will doubtless remain on the bench for 20 to 30 more years.
 Roosevelt's attempt to circumvent the high court with his court-packing plan failed. Perhaps the next president will find a better solution to the problem of an obstructionist Supreme Court. 
 James MacGregor Burns
 Susan Dunn
 Williamstown, Mass., June 29, 2007
 The writers teach at Williams College and are co-authors of ''The Three Roosevelts: Patrician Leaders Who Transformed America.''
 To the Editor:
 The decision of the United States Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional the use of race in integrating public schools is in order at this time.
 African-Americans on their own have now progressed in the social and economic life of our nation and need no special benefits today to be admitted to the finest public schools.
 It is about time that in our nation, equal rights can be achieved without setting up artificial qualifications. 
 Harris L. Present
 New York, June 29, 2007
 To the Editor:
 The Supreme Court decision regarding school district attempts to achieve racial diversity may appear on the surface to be a conservative triumph shutting the door on this goal. But it may actually result in the exploration of other avenues to accomplish meaningful integration and an equitable education for all.
 Congress should take charge of the situation and outlaw school financing through property taxes, which provide wealthy districts with greater educational outlays. Congress should mandate that the states immediately begin financing schools on a centralized and equitable basis without regard to a district's wealth.
 Under this format, students may choose what school they wish to attend as is the way currently in New York City. This legislation will provide an equal and diverse education for all students in each individual state. Michael Boyajian
 Fishkill, N.Y., June 29, 2007
 To the Editor:
 The decisions of the United States Supreme Court in the term just ended clearly illustrate the significant damage done to the court by Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. 
 The nominations of the conservative Clarence Thomas, John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr. and their confirmation have now borne the bitter fruit that has been widely predicted as evidenced by the latest hard right turn from the bench.
 As comparatively young men, these justices will determine the future of justice in America for many years to come. 
 The conservative cause may be in shreds because of the war, the failures of the Bush administration and the Washington legislative scandals, but after the ballots are counted in 2008, the decisions of these members of the court will continue to affect all of us.
 It may be a long time before the damage to the court and our justice system can be undone.
 Burton Kreindel
 Newton, Mass., June 29, 2007
 To the Editor:
 As the sponsor of Dr. Kenneth Clark's social science research demonstrating the benefits of integrated education, relied upon by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, the American Jewish Committee was dismayed by the decision on Thursday striking down the Seattle and Louisville school integration programs. 
 The court left woefully little wiggle room going forward for school systems to counteract the segregated housing patterns that create school systems virtually devoid of racial diversity.
 It is undeniable that integrated schools offer children the best possible learning environment in which they can develop the tolerance, respect and understanding necessary to flourish in our democratic and pluralistic society. 
 Unfortunately, the court's ruling will serve only to undermine decades of work to achieve racial equality and diversity in our public educational system and our nation as a whole.
 Jeffrey P. Sinensky
 General Counsel
 American Jewish Committee
 New York, June 29, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Don't Mourn Brown v. Board of Education,'' by Juan Williams (Op-Ed, June 29):
 Thank heaven we have people of all colors who can tell it like it is: the ''diversity'' emperor has long paraded with no clothes. We need to devote real resources to each individual child to help that child attain the best education and the best opportunities for success possible. We don't do that when we shuttle kids around based on race. 
 Decades of social studies have demonstrated that -- public school systems have systematically denied poor kids an equal opportunity, and have left many kids even further behind, despite many well-intentioned but misguided efforts. 
 Bravo for those courageous souls who can now go forth freed of the race-based policy chains of the past.
 Mark Anderson
 Garden Home, Ore., June 29, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Juan Williams's article is a refreshing example of outside-the-box thinking. Instead of having a knee-jerk liberal response to this overly conservative, and perhaps irresponsible, 5-to-4 court, Mr. Williams, and others in many school districts, are already thinking progressively about how to operate in this current world. 
 Unwittingly, perhaps the Roberts court has forced school boards and local governments to use more creative and effective measures, like socioeconomic factors, to create diversity. 
 Brown v. Board of Education was a beacon in the history of social improvement, but progressives should be looking ahead at new ways to improve society, not hanging their hats on a 53-year-old decision that addressed a different problem, Jim Crow, than we have today.

HEADLINE: The Grand Collapse

 BODY:
The defeat of immigration reform in the Senate this week was appalling, not so much because an ambitious bill died, but because of how stubbornly, to the bitter end, the process remained disconnected from reality. The bill crumpled on the Senate floor on Thursday in a procedural vote, with two-thirds of Republicans swarming to kill it. They shrouded their act with the same rhetorical distortions and ritual incantations -- death to amnesty! -- that have polluted the debate all along.
 Two Republicans, Jeff Sessions and Jim DeMint, hailed the demise of an attempt at immigration reform as a victory for the American people. Victory, maybe, if you favor semiporous borders, rotting crops and millions of people growing old overseas as they wait to enter legally. If you want federal officials to keep thimble-dipping the immigrant ocean with raids and detentions that shatter families and cripple businesses, and state and local governments to go on erecting a ramshackle grid of disjointed immigration policies, then this debacle was for you. 
 The bill's defeat also thwarted the possibility of progress on border security, stricter employment laws and an orderly future flow of workers. To top it off, by foreclosing legitimacy for millions of illegal immigrants, Republicans brusquely told Hispanic-Americans what they can do with their votes and hopes.
 There was pretending on the other side, too. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, defending the teetering bill, likened it to the great acts of civil rights days. With respect to Mr. Kennedy and his allies, the bill was not even close. Its good provisions were anchored to bedrock delusions: that fixing immigration is simply a job of building fences and punishing illegal workers. The fishy ''grand bargain'' began to rot as soon as it was unwrapped, as advocates for immigrants kept accepting one bad amendment after another in the hope that this bill -- or any bill, please -- was better than nothing, and that bad things would somehow be removed later. 
 Their desperation showed, and when talk radio got a frenzy going -- Capitol phones crashed as the crucial vote loomed -- nothing good could withstand the hot wind blowing across the Hill.
 What to do now? Pick up pieces. Congress will likely get back to what its dim imagination can handle, building fences. It should expand legal immigration, too, with more visas to clear the backlogs. The pro-immigrant side can try to improve things incrementally, with visas for farm workers and tuition breaks for immigrant children, although without the cover of a comprehensive bill, such modest measures might easily be picked off by right-wing sniping. The House could offer a bill, but the Senate's grim results would dampen anyone's optimism. 
 The debate will surely dominate the presidential campaign, where the odds of reasoned discussion and principled leadership are mighty slim. (Example: Senator Sam Brownback, a Republican candidate, was for keeping the bill alive before he was against it, switching his ''yes'' vote to ''no'' in his eagerness to follow the elephant herd.)
 Reasonable voices on the left and right, like Robert Menendez, Lindsey Graham, Mr. Kennedy and John McCain, must keep pressing for comprehensive reform. The candidates should confront the issue with courage and candor. Everyone could look to Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona, who has survived and thrived as an immigration moderate in a state that comprises the multitudes and hot extremes of the debate -- Anglos and Latinos, day laborers and Minutemen, a surging population and a wide desert border with Mexico. She is a big fan of declarative sentences and of building up from consensus. Are we all in favor of illegal immigration? No. O.K., let's figure out what to do about that.
 It's that crucial turn -- from analysis to action -- that Congress failed to make, as its bloated bill toppled into a ditch like a fat S.U.V. on a curve. At some point it will have to revisit the issue. Its solutions will have to correspond with the complex realities of global economic change, of a workforce that needs immigrants, of immigrants who need and deserve a clear, sure path to citizenship and of a nation that needs to be true to its laws and to its decent, welcoming self. 
 That's the reality, and reality could not care less what Congress does or doesn't do.

HEADLINE: Money, Not Race, Is Fueling New Push to Bolster Schools

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
For several years, two lawyers intent on helping black children do as well in school as white children had a kind of roadshow: Michael A. Rebell would describe the recent successes of state-court litigation, forcing more financing for poor children's schools, as a matter of basic equity. But James Ryan would argue that integration was the best approach. 
 ''We'd do these panels and discussions, and he'd say equity lawsuits were a cop-out, that integration is the only way to address the racial gap,'' said Mr. Rebell, executive director of the Campaign for Educational Equity at Teachers College at Columbia University. ''I'd say funding is important because money matters. It doesn't guarantee good educational outcomes, but without it you can almost guarantee there won't be good outcomes.'' 
 Even before the Supreme Court this week limited districts' options for integrating schools, the push to improve the nation's public schools had turned, increasingly, on money. 
 ''Although a lot of districts talk about racial integration at the local level, I actually think that, at the state and national level, race-mixing was already an antiquated issue,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute. ''At the state and national level, the discussion has to do with money and the achievement gap.''
 Nationwide, minority parents in struggling school districts have skirted the debate over racial integration and pushed instead for more money for their children's schools, in lawsuits demanding that states give poor districts more resources. 
 ''A lot of black folks say, 'Give us the resources, give us the money, we're tired of chasing white folks, and we don't need integrated schools to have good education,' '' said Ted Shaw, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. ''It's hard to tell how much of that is weariness and cynicism with respect to efforts to get racially integrated schools, and I can understand that.'' 
 Experts of every political persuasion agree that the achievement gap -- the disparity between white children and black children's educational achievement -- is the biggest problem in American education. And just about every recent educational innovation, whether vouchers, the No Child Left Behind Act or school-financing lawsuits, was designed with an eye to closing that gap. 
 With Brown v. Board of Education, in 1954, integration was the big hope for equal achievement. But housing in the United States is so racially cloistered that despite the Brown decision, American schools are becoming ever more segregated. And in many urban districts, public schools have so few white students that integration is simply out of the question. 
 So education reformers began going to court to claim that states were violating their own constitutional guarantees of equal protection or skimping on the financing required for an adequate education -- an argument that has become easier to back up with the expansion of state testing and standards. 
 Most recently, some districts have turned to socioeconomic integration, a trend that may be accelerated by the new court ruling, said Mr. Ryan, the University of Virginia law professor Mr. Rebell used to debate. 
 ''Districts that have been worrying about racial integration may think more about economic integration,'' said Mr. Ryan, who remains skeptical that money alone does much to help schools. ''I wouldn't say money is irrelevant, and I understand why people focus on school funding, but until you address the problem of segregation of poor kids, it's wishful thinking to expect the money to translate into accomplishment.'' 
 Since 1973, when the Supreme Court ruled that equal access to education was not a fundamental right under the federal Constitution, such cases have moved to state courts and been heard in almost every state. 
 ''It's turned out to be the most extensive area of constitutional development by the state courts,'' Mr. Rebell said. ''At first, they were equity cases, saying the situation wasn't fair under state constitutions' equal protection clauses. But starting in 1989, they've been adequacy cases, saying the schools weren't delivering funding for the education the state guarantees.''
 In many cases, judges have been impressed with graphic evidence of inadequate facilities for poor students, whether the Alabama students who had to use outhouses or the New York students required to pass a laboratory-science exam to graduate, when their high schools had no functioning laboratory. 
 Most of the suits have been successful, Mr. Rebell said, giving poor schools billions more in state money. Litigation in Kansas brought $755 million in state aid; in Arkansas, it brought $400 million in operating aid and $850 million in capital funds. Next month, New York City will get the first installment of what will ultimately be $3 billion annually in added state educational aid. 
 Fiscal-equity litigation and integration need not be either-or propositions, many parents say, but some say integration is the secondary concern. ''The parents, bottom line, want to make sure these kids get a good education, even if it is in segregated schools because of the areas in which you live,'' said Councilman Robert Jackson of New York City, a plaintiff in New York's fiscal-equity case. 
 As a practical matter, lawyers say, fiscal-equity cases, like the Abbott litigation in New Jersey, are increasingly important as other tools to address racial inequities are cut off. Such cases, said David G. Sciarra, executive director of the Education Law Center, the nonprofit group leading the litigation, are ''literally the primary tool that we have, right now, on the ground.
 ''The minimum we can do,'' he said, ''is make sure that these children in these high-poverty, high-minority schools, which are mostly concentrated in our cities, have at least the resources that our children in our suburban schools get.'' 
 Mr. Shaw said he supported school-financing litigation and the newer efforts for socioeconomic integration of schools -- although neither fully addressed the issues of race. 
 ''If they're sincere, I'll take it, but I do not concede that it is a complete and absolute substitute for addressing the problem of racial segregation,'' he said. ''I continue to believe, apparently against the grain, that if we have a problem with race in this country, as we do, we ought to be able to address it forthrightly.''

HEADLINE: China Vows Food-Safety Changes

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
GUANGZHOU, China, June 29 -- A day after regulators in the United States placed a partial ban on imports of certain types of seafood from China, the Chinese government promised Friday to cooperate in tackling its food safety problems but urged a quick resolution.
 In tones that were at times defiant, China pressed the United States to act promptly and fairly and cautioned that Chinese seafood products should not be ''automatically held and rejected indiscriminately.'' 
 In a statement issued late Friday, China's top quality watchdog, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, acknowledged that there were safety problems with Chinese seafood exports but also said that it had found similar problems in food imported from the United States. 
 ''Just like the U.S. imported food in China, there are quality problems with aquatic products that are exported to the U.S. by some Chinese enterprises,'' the government said in a statement posted on one of its Web sites. ''China has cooperated and handled these problems properly.''
 The statement came after the Food and Drug Administration in the United States said Thursday that it would effectively block the sale of five types of farmed fish, including shrimp and catfish, unless independent testing proved that the goods were free of contamination.
 China's sharp response to the restrictions in the United States sets the stage for what could be a high-stakes trade dispute over seafood, one of the fastest-growing segments of the global food market.
 F.D.A. officials declined to comment on China's response.
 China is already the world's biggest producer and exporter of seafood, and a growing portion of that is sent to the United States, which imports more than 80 percent of its seafood.
 But China also has leverage because it is one of the largest importers of American grain, and its food market is increasingly enticing to big American corporations. Indeed, United States authorities are pressing China to lift a ban on American beef.
 ''If I were the Chinese I would not start a trade war over this,'' said Dermot Hayes, a professor of agricultural economics at Iowa State University. ''They have a huge trade surplus with us, so it'd be like picking a fight with a rich grandmother. This is a problem that can easily be solved by scientists.'' 
 China has an increasingly poor track record of exporting tainted seafood products to the United States. Time and again over the last few years, Chinese seafood has tested positive for carcinogens and excessive antibiotic residues.
 Chinese goods make up about 22 percent of United States seafood imports. But they accounted for about 63 percent of the shipments that were refused by the F.D.A. last year for having animal drug residues.
 And early this year, the F.D.A. said it saw a spike in rejections of Chinese seafood products, particularly catfish, shrimp, eel, basa (which is related to catfish) and dace (which is like carp). Those five farm-fished products are facing new F.D.A. restrictions.
 Growing concerns about tainted seafood have come after a string of recalls involving Chinese products as varied as pet food, toothpaste, toys and tires.
 The recalls have alarmed members of Congress and American consumers and created an ugly side show to already tense trade relations between China and the United States.
 China has insisted that its food is largely safe. But regulators here have also vowed to overhaul the country's food safety regulations and to step up inspections of exports. But American regulators have grown impatient.
 To combat the safety problems involving imported Chinese seafood, the F.D.A. said Thursday that it planned to hold all shipments of the restricted seafood products unless they are proven to be safe. Until now, the F.D.A. has only done spot checks on those and other products, testing only a tiny fraction of food imports from China.
 In its statement Friday, China said it was willing to cooperate with United States regulators and even proposed its own system of testing and certifying the quality of certain food exports.
 Chinese regulators also said that they were ''highly concerned'' about food safety matters and were working to fix the problem involving tainted seafood exports.
 But in striking back at American regulators, China insisted that food products made in the United States also had quality and safety problems. For instance, earlier this week, China rejected batches of orange pulp and apricots from the United Sates, contending that they contained mold, excessive amounts of bacteria and other contaminants.
 Andrew Kaelin, managing director of AIS Aqua Foods, a seafood importer, said he thought that Chinese regulations were generally effective but were simply not enough to control the huge number of aquaculture producers. Consequently, he said, it was up to importers and processors to make sure the shipments were clean.
 ''We test all our shipments before they leave,'' he said, explaining that his company ships primarily Chinese scallops, calamari and tilapia to the United States. He said that Chinese regulators stopped a shipment of his that contained shrimp on Friday until he could provide the testing paperwork.
 Stacey Viera, a spokeswoman for the National Fisheries Institute, which represents the American seafood industry, said that she expected the restricted Chinese seafood would continue to be sold in the United States. She said, however, that there might be a delay while importers set up testing procedures for the seafood, which may create a temporary problem for restaurants and stores.

HEADLINE: A Big Early Climb Turns Into a Loss

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, erasing a 102-point rally in the Dow Jones industrial average, after bomb scares swept London and concern grew that banks face more losses from subprime loans.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posted its first monthly decline since February on speculation that losses on subprime mortgages will deepen after two Bear Stearns hedge funds nearly collapsed.
 Stocks fell to the lows of the day after the police found two cars containing explosive material in London. A rise in oil prices to a 10-month high helped reverse an advance in consumer stocks after a Commerce Department report earlier showed that inflation was cooling. 
 ''We had that terrorist scare in London, so that's got people a little worried,'' said John Carey at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston. ''It's a pretty frightening thing and another sign that danger is still prevalent.''
 The S.& P. 500 lost 2.36 points, or 0.2 percent. The Dow average slipped 13.66 points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,408.62, while the Nasdaq composite index retreated 5.14 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,603.23.
 This week, the S.& P. 500 gained 0.1 percent, the Dow average added 0.4 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 0.6 percent. For the quarter, they climbed 5.8 percent, 8.5 percent and 7.5 percent.
 The Russell 2000 index, a benchmark for smaller companies, slid 0.6 percent, to 833.70.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 0.08 percentage points, to 5.02 percent. The price rose 19/32, to 95 30/32.
 Economic data lifted stocks earlier. Americans spent less than forecast in May and the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge cooled, signs that a consumer slowdown is restraining price pressures. High inflation has prevented the central bank from reducing interest rates.
 The 0.5 percent rise in spending matched the gain in April, the Commerce Department said. Core prices, which exclude food and fuel costs, rose at the slowest pace since March 2004 in the year that ended May 31.
 Bear Stearns declined $4, or 2.8 percent, to $140. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which has started an informal inquiry into the securities firm, asked for documents from the company about the hedge funds, CNBC reported, citing unidentified people.
 Financial shares in the S.& P. 500 slid 0.8 percent this week. Merrill Lynch had the sixth-biggest decline in the S.& P. 500 yesterday, losing $2.44, or 2.8 percent, to $83.58. Lehman Brothers dropped 12 cents to $75.80.
 Office Depot dropped the most in the S.& P. 500. The office-supplies retailer said a weak economy would cause sales at older North American stores to decline as much as 5 percent in the second quarter. The shares fell $1.51, or 4.8 percent, to $30.30. 
 Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry e-mail phone, surged to a record after it reported earnings that topped analysts' estimates. Apple climbed on the day its iPhone went on sale in the United States. AT&T , the iPhone's service provider, rose for a fifth day.
 Research in Motion added $34.40, or 21 percent, to $199.99. Apple was up $1.48, to $122.04. AT&T advanced 76 cents to $41.50.
 Palm lost 54 cents, to $16.02. The maker of the Treo mobile phone said profit fell 43 percent, to $15.4 million, or 15 cents a share, as it spent more on advertising and development to compete with the BlackBerry and the iPhone.
 Commerce Bancorp, New Jersey's biggest bank, jumped $3.18, to $36.99. The company replaced its founder, Vernon Hill, as chief executive after regulators forced the company to stop doing business with firms controlled by his family.
 Oil prices climbed above $70 for the first time since September after an Energy Department report yesterday showed that United States gasoline supplies fell last week as refinery operations rose. Crude for August delivery rose $1.11, or 1.6 percent, to $70.68 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Exxon Mobil climbed 28 cents, to $83.88. Chevron added 6 cents, to $84.24.
 Gold rose in New York after a decline in the value of the dollar against the euro raised gold's appeal as an alternative investment. Gold futures for August delivery rose 50 cents, to $650.90 an ounce, on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, after earlier reaching $655.
 The dollar fell on speculation the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates anytime soon. The dollar fell 0.6 percent, to $1.3536 per euro in late afternoon trading in New York.

HEADLINE: May Spending By Consumers Matched Pace Set in April

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Americans spent less than forecast in May and the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge cooled, signs that a consumer slowdown is restraining price pressures.
 The rise of 0.5 percent in spending matched the gain in April, the Commerce Department said yesterday. As for inflation, core prices, which exclude food and fuel costs, rose at the slowest pace since March 2004 in the year that ended May 31. 
 Separate reports showed that consumer confidence slipped and a Chicago gauge of business activity held close to a two-year high in June.
 The figures may help assuage Fed policy makers, who said Thursday that ''a sustained moderation of inflationary pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.''
 Peter Kretzmer, a senior economist at Banc of America Securities in New York, said, ''The Fed's going to be much more satisfied with the level of inflation as time goes on.''
 ''These are consumer-spending numbers that the Fed is also happy to see'' as it strives for a moderate pace of growth, he said.
 Economists predicted spending would rise 0.7 percent, according to the median of 76 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Estimates ranged from gains of 0.4 percent to 1 percent.
 Consumer sentiment fell to a 10-month low in June, undermined by a drop in home values and by gasoline prices that hovered close to a record high.
 The Reuters/University of Michigan final index of consumer sentiment declined to 85.3, from 88.3 in May. The reading compares with a preliminary June figure of 83.7.
 The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its business barometer fell to 60.2 from 61.7 in May. Readings greater than 50 signal expansion and May's figure matched the highest level since April 2005.
 Businesses also helped fuel an increase in construction spending last month, a Commerce Department report showed. Spending on construction projects jumped 0.9 percent, the biggest gain since February 2006.
 Every category other than residential construction showed an increase, driven by the building of factories and utilities, the Commerce Department report showed.
 Corporate spending is helping to push up economic growth this quarter after inventory reductions and weakness in the housing market weighed on the economy in the first three months of 2007. The Fed yesterday said ''moderate'' economic expansion would probably continue.
 Personal incomes rose 0.4 percent in May after dropping 0.2 percent the previous month. They were forecast to rise 0.6 percent, according to the survey median, after a 0.1 percent decline originally reported for April.
 The consumer spending report's price gauge tied to spending patterns, excluding food and energy costs, rose 0.1 percent in May for a second month, matching economists' forecasts.
 The savings rate declined to minus 1.4 percent, the lowest since August 2006, from minus 1.2 percent a month earlier. A negative rate suggests that consumers are tapping savings to maintain spending.
 Adjusted for inflation, spending rose 0.1 percent in May, after increasing 0.2 percent in April, the report showed.

Chances are you didn't hear it, but on Thursday night Senator Hillary Clinton said, ''If H.I.V./AIDS were the leading cause of death of white women between the ages of 25 and 34, there would be an outraged outcry in this country.''
 Her comment came on the same day that a malevolent majority on the U.S. Supreme Court threw a brick through the window of voluntary school integration efforts. 
 There comes a time when people are supposed to get angry. The rights and interests of black people in the U.S. have been under assault for the longest time, and in the absence of an effective counterforce, that assault has only grown more brutal.
 Have you looked at the public schools lately? Have you looked at the prisons? Have you looked at the legions of unemployed blacks roaming the neighborhoods of big cities across the country? These jobless African-Americans, so many of them men, are so marginal in the view of the wider society, so insignificant, so invisible, they aren't even counted in the government's official jobless statistics.
 And now this new majority on the Supreme Court seems committed to a legal trajectory that would hurl blacks back to the bad old days of the Jim Crow era.
 Where's the outcry? Where's the line in the sand that the prejudiced portion of the population is not allowed to cross?
 Mrs. Clinton's comment was made at a forum of Democratic presidential candidates at Howard University that was put together by Tavis Smiley, the radio and television personality, and broadcast nationally by PBS. The idea was to focus on issues of particular concern to African-Americans.
 It's discouraging that some of the biggest issues confronting blacks -- the spread of AIDS, chronic joblessness and racial discrimination, for example -- are not considered mainstream issues.
 Senator John Edwards offered a disturbingly bleak but accurate picture of the lives of many young blacks: ''When you have young African-American men who are completely convinced that they're either going to die or go to prison and see absolutely no hope in their lives; when they live in an environment where the people around them don't earn a decent wage; when they go to schools that are second-class schools compared to the wealthy suburban areas -- they don't see anything getting better.''
 The difficult lives and often tragic fates of such young men are not much on the minds of so-called mainstream Americans, or the political and corporate elites who run the country. More noise needs to be made. There's something very wrong with a passive acceptance of the degraded state in which so many African-Americans continue to live.
 Mr. Smiley is also organizing a forum of Republican candidates to be held in September. I wholeheartedly applaud his efforts. But if black people were more angry, and if they could channel that anger into political activism -- first and foremost by voting as though their lives and the lives of their children depended on it -- there would not be a need to have separate political forums to address their concerns.
 If black people could find a way to come together in sky-high turnouts on Election Day, if they showed up at polling booths in numbers close to the maximum possible turnout, if they could set the example for all other Americans about the importance of exercising the franchise, the politicians would not dare to ignore their concerns.
 For black people, especially, the current composition of the Supreme Court should be the ultimate lesson in the importance of voting in a presidential election. No branch of the government has been more crucial than the judiciary in securing the rights and improving the lives of blacks over the past five or six decades.
 George W. Bush, in a little more than six years, has tilted the court so radically that it is now, like the administration itself, relentlessly hostile to the interests of black people. That never would have happened if blacks had managed significantly more muscular turnouts in the 2000 and 2004 elections. (The war in Iraq would not have happened, either.)
 There are, of course, many people, black and white, who are working on a vast array of important issues. But much, much more needs to be done. And blacks, in particular, need to intervene more directly in the public policy matters that concern them.
 In the 1960s, there were radicals running around screaming about black power. But the real power in this country has always been the power of the vote. Black Americans have not come close to maximizing that power.
 It's not too late.

HEADLINE: China Passes a Sweeping Labor Law

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN and DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
BEIJING, June 29 -- China's legislature passed a sweeping new labor law today that strengthens protections for workers across its booming economy, rejecting pleas from foreign investors who argued that the measure would reduce China's appeal as a low-wage, business-friendly industrial base.
 The new labor contract law, enacted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, requires employers to provide written contracts to their workers, restricts the use of temporary laborers and makes it harder to lay off employees. 
 The law, which is to take effect in 2008, also enhances the role of the Communist Party's monopoly union and allows collective bargaining for wages and benefits. It softens some provisions that foreign companies said would hurt China's competitiveness, but retained others that American multinationals had lobbied vigorously to exclude.
 The law is the latest step by President Hu Jintao to increase worker protections in a society that, despite its nominal socialist ideology, has emphasized rapid, capitalist-style economic growth over enforcing labor laws or ensuring an equitable distribution of wealth.
 But it may fall short of improving working conditions for the tens of millions of low-wage workers who need the most help unless it is enforced more rigorously than existing laws, which already offer protections that on paper are similar to those in developed economies.
 Passage of the measure came shortly after officials and state media unearthed the widespread use of slave labor in as many as 8,000 brick kilns and small coal mines in Shanxi and Henan provinces, one of the most glaring labor scandals since China began adopting market-style economic policies a quarter century ago.
 Police have freed nearly 600 workers, many of them children, held against their will in factories owned or operated by well-connected businessmen and local officials.
 Abuses of migrant laborers have been endemic in boom-time China, where millions of temporary workers have faced unsafe working conditions, collusion between factory owners and local officials and unpaid wages. Party-run courts often fail to enforce their legal rights.
 Senior leaders in Beijing have grown increasingly concerned about the issue because migrant workers have contributed to a surge in social unrest and violent crime.
 While the new law will do little to eliminate violations of existing laws, it does require that employers treat migrant workers as they do other employees. All employees will have to have written employment contracts that comply with minimum wage and safety regulations.
 It also moves China closer to European-style labor regulations that emphasize fixed- and open-term employment contracts enforceable by law. It requires that employees with short-term contracts become full-time employees with lifetime benefits after a short-term contract is renewed twice.
 Perhaps most significantly, it gives the state-run union and other employee representative groups the power to bargain with employers.
 ''This is the biggest change in Chinese labor law in the reform and opening period,'' said Qiu Jie, a labor law expert at People's University in Beijing. ''It gives legal protection to the vast majority of workers who had no way to protect their rights under the old system.''
 Many multinational corporations had lobbied against provisions in an earlier draft of the labor law. The early draft, circulated widely in business and legal circles, more sharply limited the use of temporary workers and required obtaining approval from the state-controlled union for layoffs.
 Companies argued that the rules would substantially increase labor costs and reduce flexibility, and some foreign businesses warned that they would have little choice but to move their operations out of China if the provisions were enacted unchanged.
 International labor experts said that several of the most delicate clauses had been watered down. But lawyers representing some big global companies doing business here complained today that the new law still imposes a heavy burden.
 ''It will be more difficult to run a company here,'' said Andreas Lauffs, a lawyer at Baker & McKenzie, which represents many of America's biggest corporations in China.
 The National People's Congress released only a summary of the new legislation, not the full text, and officials did not detail how they had changed the final version from multiple drafts that had circulated earlier.
 The summary said companies must ''consult'' the state-backed union if its plans workforce reductions, suggesting a softening from earlier drafts that gave unions the right to approve or reject layoffs before they could take place.
 But the summary retained language that limits ''probationary contracts'' that many employers use to deny employees full-time status. It also states that severance pay will be required for many workers, and tightens the conditions under which an employee can be fired.
 Moreover, the law empowers company-based branches of the state-run union or employee representative committees to bargain with employers over salaries, bonuses, training and other work-related benefits and duties.
 In the past, workers have had to negotiate wages with their employers individually. China's state-run union has had almost no involvement in setting wage and benefit levels.
 The Communist Party's monopoly union, known as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, is a legacy of China's socialist planned economy. It is an official state organization charged with overseeing workers that in practice has tended either to play no role whatsoever or to help managers monitor and control workers.
 Workers are not allowed to form their own, independent unions. The state union rarely if ever presses for higher wages or enhanced benefits. It does not permit strikes.
 But Mr. Hu has pressed the union to take a more active role, and it has demanded greater representation in private Chinese and foreign-invested companies. Some foreign company executives say that if the union participates in wage and layoff negotiations it could begin to greatly complicate labor relations.
 Foreign executives said that they are especially worried about new labor regulations because their companies tend to comply with existing laws more rigorously than some of their Chinese competitors do. Their competitive disadvantage could increase sharply, they said, if the new rules put fresh burdens on foreign companies that their local counterparts ignore.
 Chinese legislative officials said today that such concerns are overblown, and that many local governments bend the rules to favor foreign investors over local companies.
 ''If there is some bias in the application of the law, it would tend to be in favor of foreign investors because local governments do so much to attract investment,'' Xin Chunying, deputy chairwoman of the legislature's law committee, said at a news conference announcing the new measures.
 ''The only people who will suffer under the new law are those who violate the law,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Oil Giant Sees Some Strains In the System

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
As chairman and chief executive of ConocoPhillips, James J. Mulva is steering the third-largest American integrated energy company at a time of great profit but also growing concern over global warming and rising gasoline prices and questions as to whether Big Oil is doing enough to cope with either challenge.
 With large investments in Venezuela, Russia and around Asia and the Middle East, ConocoPhillips should have a broad pipeline of projects coming to fruition in the next few years to make it an even more important global player. But the opportunities bring risks in unstable areas like Venezuela, where the company is poised to pull out and take a $4.5 billion write-off. The risks could affect not only profit but also the amount of energy companies like ConocoPhillips can deliver to drivers. 
 Mr. Mulva, 61, spoke recently about his concerns that Congress and the country in general were not doing enough to meet the public's energy needs. He said action was needed from the government, the oil industry and consumers to protect the environment and energy security. Following are excerpts: 
 Q. You have announced support for a national mandatory framework to address greenhouse gas emissions. Is this a new day for ConocoPhillips and the oil industry or is this simply green marketing? 
 A. It's not a new day nor green marketing for ConocoPhillips or the industry. There is a recognition of the science that is becoming quite compelling. Climate is changing. We are concerned with greenhouse gas emissions, and as a company and as an industry we need to participate in the development of a national policy and framework to address climate change. 
 Q. According to the Department of Energy, the United States will consume 28 percent more oil and 19 percent more natural gas in 2030 than it did in 2005. Where will we find all that oil and gas?
 A. I question whether the supply will be developed to meet those demand expectations. I believe demand is going to be constrained by supply. 
 Q. Drivers are concerned about rising gas prices. What can American drivers expect to pay at the pump in the short term, medium term and long term?
 A. I would like to see gasoline prices decline. However, I believe that is somewhat unrealistic. Energy costs are going to continue to escalate as a result of the cost it takes to add new resources of energy. 
 Q. What would you like to see in the new federal energy legislation that Congress is working on and what would you not like to see?
 A. The legislation that is under consideration does nothing to add supply or encourage investment or encourage conservation or efficient use of energy. Effectively, what we are doing, in a somewhat punitive way, is adding taxation with the unrealistic expectation that we can increase the fiscal take, lower the price of energy and encourage investment to add supply. I would encourage more access to the oil and gas companies, to a substantial amount of acreage onshore and offshore that is not available for drilling. Second, we have no real incentives, and in any case, there is difficulty in achieving permits to make infrastructure investment to add pipelines, transportation, terminals and refining capacity. Third, we need to encourage conservation and increase efficiency in the use of energy. Fourth, we should encourage and allocate far more resources, both as a government and as an industry, to do research to improve our technology to have a more efficient development and use of energy in our country.
 Q. You have a noncontrolling stake in Lukoil at a time when Russia has not been the most friendly country to the United States and market reforms there have been uneven. How are your operations going in Russia?
 A. It's unfortunate that the economic development and particularly energy development between Russia and the United States have not developed more quickly. Because it's logical that Russia, with a great deal of natural resources, and a North American market that needs energy, that we should be working more closely to develop energy investment. For ConocoPhillips, our investment with Lukoil -- as a 20 percent owner of Lukoil -- has been a very good experience. Everything that Lukoil has indicated that they would do, as well as the Russian government, when we made the investment, has come to pass exactly as they have indicated. We look for the opportunities to invest more with Lukoil and Russian companies inside and outside of Russia, both upstream and downstream.

HEADLINE: Backers of the Buyout Boom Seem to Be Backing Out

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL

 BODY:
THE private equity business hit bumps. A deal was struck for a possible Dow Jones sale, and the Supreme Court struck down a longstanding rule on product pricing. 
 BUYOUT TROUBLES On several fronts, things are looking down for the buyout business. The investors who have fueled the boom in recent years have begun to show resistance on some private equity deals as interest rates have risen and banks have insisted on tougher lending terms. Shares of the buyout shop Blackstone Group, which went public last week, sank below their opening price on Tuesday and stayed there all week. Congress, meanwhile, is considering bills that would increase taxes on income earned by private equity managers. 
 Seven deals were reported on Monday, the day of the week that typically has the most merger announcements, down from 43 on the prior Monday and 84 on Monday, June 4, according to Thomson Financial. 
 The rest of the week had similar news. The discount chain Dollar General withdrew part of a debt offering it had planned to help finance its $6.9 billion buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. ServiceMaster may have to pay higher interest rates on loans it is seeking to finance its buyout by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. And U.S. Foodservice, the American division of the big Dutch food outfit Royal Ahold, postponed a bond offering.
 There are several big debt offerings in the works to finance some of the largest buyouts in history, including those of the First Data Corporation, Chrysler and the Texas utility TXU. A pullback by bond investors could spell more trouble for the buyout industry. 
 DOW JONES ACCORD Negotiators on Tuesday reached a tentative accord aimed at protecting the editorial integrity of The Wall Street Journal, opening the way to final negotiations for the News Corporation of Rupert Murdoch to acquire Dow Jones & Company, which owns the newspaper. 
 A person close to the talks provided a copy of the agreement to The New York Times on Friday. Under its terms, an independent, five-member committee would be formed that could block the hiring and firing of top editors, go to court to enforce the agreement, and conduct internal investigations and publish the results on the newspaper's editorial page.
 The Bancroft family, which holds a controlling interest in Dow Jones, has stated that it wants an independent editorial board -- with most of the initial members chosen by the family -- to oversee The Journal's news operations and prevent Mr. Murdoch from exerting his influence on the newspaper. The proposed agreement, according to people who have been briefed on the talks, calls for initial committee members to be chosen jointly by Dow Jones and the News Corporation. Those members would then vote on replacements when vacancies occur. The family has so far not reacted publicly to the tentative deal, which was negotiated by a committee of the Dow Jones board.
 It is still unknown whether the Bancrofts will try for a sale price higher than the $5 billion Mr. Murdoch has offered. Reuters quoted Mr. Murdoch as saying a final agreement would be reached ''in the next two, three weeks' time or not at all.'' And he mused to Time magazine about the possibility of discontinuing the paper version of The Journal and publishing solely online. 
 QUESTIONABLE IMPORTS Pet food, toothpaste, toy trains, tires and now, seafood. Worries over the failure of Chinese imports to meet American health and safety standards were heightened Thursday when the Food and Drug Administration effectively blocked the sale of five types of farm-raised seafood from China because of instances of contamination from unapproved animal drugs and additives. 
 China is the biggest producer of farm-raised fish and the biggest supplier of seafood to the United States. Included in the F.D.A.'s ''import alert'' were shrimp; catfish; eel; basa, which resembles catfish; and dace, which is somewhat like carp. 
 The listed seafood can be sold in the United States only if importers provide independent documentation that it does not contain the contaminants, which are mostly antibacterial and antifungal agents used to prevent disease in fish. 
 Earlier in the week, federal officials ordered a small New Jersey retailer to recall 450,000 radial tires after it was discovered that a Chinese manufacturer had stopped including a safety feature that prevented the treads from separating. 
 Some in Congress called for a federal food-safety agreement with China to protect American consumers.
 SLOW CONNECTIONS As Apple prepared to put the iPhone on the market, the chief executives of both Apple and AT&T defended their decision to use AT&T's Edge wireless data network for the product's Internet connections. Edge is widely accessible, but comparatively slow. Product reviews of the iPhone, which so far have been mostly positive, have noted its slow network connections.
 Apple's chief, Steven P. Jobs, and Randall L. Stephenson, the chief of AT&T, said that the iPhone works well on local Wi-Fi hotspots and that Edge was chosen for cellular connections because it was more widely available, especially in rural areas, than AT&T's faster HSDPA network. 
 Now that the highly anticipated introduction of the iPhone is past, the question is whether demand for the $500 and $600 gadget will meet expectations.
 PRICE PACTS GET AN O.K. The Supreme Court struck down a 96-year-old antitrust rule forbidding manufacturers and distributors to agree on minimum retail prices. The 5-to-4 decision will give manufacturers considerably more power to determine prices and restrict the flexibility of retailers to discount merchandise.
 The old rule held that resale price maintenance agreements violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. The court on Thursday instructed judges to apply a case-by-case approach to assessing the impact on competition of such agreements. Opponents of the old rule said that in many cases it actually stifled competition.
 Critics of the court's decision warn that it could result in significant price increases and less competition for consumer and other goods.

HEADLINE: Newark's Mayor, in Office a Year, Says Major City Job Cuts Are Likely

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 29 

 BODY:
In a news conference heralding the anniversary of his inauguration on Sunday, Mayor Cory A. Booker warned on Friday that the city's looming fiscal crisis could lead to substantial layoffs, shaving as many as one in five people from the 5,000-worker municipal payroll this year. 
 Speaking in the imposing rotunda of City Hall, with the city's business administrator standing grimly by his side, Mr. Booker explained that the early retirement incentives announced this month were not yielding enough takers to chisel away the $180 million budget gap projected for 2008. 
 His face grave, the mayor said that the city would try to avoid large-scale layoffs by extending the buyouts to the police and fire departments, but he added that employees should steel themselves for significant staff cuts in the fall. 
 ''We are spending far more than we have, and the reality is that tomorrow is a year of comeuppance,'' he said. ''I was not elected to push the pain off to another day. We are going to do what needs to be done.''
 Although the event was initially billed as an opportunity to highlight his first-year achievements, Mr. Booker saved a recitation of accomplishments for the tail end of a speech that was mostly freighted with dire news, his only visual aid a bar graph titled, ''Newark's Structural Budget Deficit,'' which showed a $300 million shortfall for 2011 if nothing is done to rein in expenses and increase revenue.
 Mr. Booker, who approved an 8.4 percent property tax increase shortly after taking office last July, said he would not consider raising taxes again to bridge the deficit. 
 It is a problem that has been years in the making. 
 Since 2002, the city has avoided calamity by using a $400 million settlement from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to plug a growing hole in its budget. This year's gap swallowed $120 million of that money, and the well is expected to run dry in 2009. 
 Booker aides say they have saved millions of dollars in the past year by wringing out bureaucratic inefficiencies, freezing most hiring and increasing the city's tax collection rate to 92 percent from 85 percent.
 The mayor said the city had also reduced overtime by $10 million in recent months, observing, ''We used to give away overtime like it was Christmas time.''
 But no amount of thrift will vanquish what the mayor said would be, in the best-case scenario, a $50 million to $80 million gap next year. 
 The 120 employees who have come forward to accept the buyout, officials say, will have a minimal impact on the bottom line. And extending the offer to the police department is expected to yield at most a few dozen more early retirements, but the mayor said he hoped to save money by replacing high-paid veterans with lower-paid rookies.
 In a city of 281,000 residents and an unemployment rate double the state average, many residents fear that laying off as many as 1,000 people could have a troubling impact on the city's frail economy.
 Rahaman Muhammad, a union official who represents municipal workers, said he thought the administration had not exhausted other ways of plugging the gap.
 ''I think it's irresponsible to get rid of Newarkers from their jobs when there are so few jobs in this city,'' Mr. Muhammad said, adding he thought the speech was partly designed to push more employees to take the buyout. ''I think it's unnecessary and wrong to scare people.'' 
 Brigid Harrison, a professor of law and political science at Montclair State University, suggested that Mr. Booker was using a time-honored strategy by tackling the thorniest problems early in his tenure in the hope that voters will forget the pain before election time.
 ''In some ways it's a smart maneuver,'' she said. ''Also, by setting out a worst-case scenario, he comes off pretty good if he can do better and not lay off as many people.'' Mr. Booker's speech was not all gloom. He praised a new police tips line that has led to scores of arrests, the hundreds of jobs Continental Airlines has given to local residents at Newark Liberty International Airport and a municipal law that guarantees city workers a living wage.
