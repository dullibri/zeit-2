HEADLINE: At Work;
An Employee-Rights Minefield

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
Stephen Paskoff leans toward his quarry, one hand balled into a fist in his pocket, the other rolling a Magic Marker as if it were two steel balls and he were a ship's captain.
Chris Joannides, a marketing manager at the Public Service Electric and Gas Company in Newark, looks as if his collar is shrinking by the second, but he stands his ground as he plays his role in the possible sexual harassment scenario before him during a recent training seminar. If a female employee came to him in confidence and complained about unwanted attention from a co-worker, he probably would want to let someone higher up in the public utility know, even though it would place him in a dilemma as a manager. 
 Mr. Paskoff is incredulous: "You would betray her trust, violate her confidence, go against her specific instructions?" He becomes Laurie, the furious employee. "That is totally unacceptable to me. I am leaving now to see my lawyer." Mr. Paskoff pauses to see if Mr. Joannides is wavering. "I will sue," Mr. Paskoff's litigious alter ego threatens. "The idea of someone else knowing makes me so anxious that I might be disabled.' " The prospect of a gazillion-dollar invasion of privacy-disability judgment against P.S.E.& G. is dangled, enticing all but a few of Mr. Joannides's colleagues in the room into agreeing that he is being hard-nosed. Mr. Joannides is apologetic but firm. He will do everything he can to protect her privacy, but someone else must know that such a situation exists. Mr. Paskoff prowls on. His droll smile returns as he elicits what seems to be a more flexible response from a different manager. Fodder, the smile says.
There are plenty of law firms around the country drumming up business with scare stories about the effects of recent civil rights legislation like the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1991. But most of the business takes place under the flocked wallpaper of major hotel meeting rooms, where large audiences of middle managers acquire piles of impenetrable documents and a sense that they are the Light Brigade, minorities and women are the Russians and diversity nothing but cause for a bad day at Balaklava.
As a former Equal Employment Opportunity Commission counsel and a lawyer in private practice, Mr. Paskoff has been both prosecutor and defender in discrimination and harassment cases. He is not a fan of either the siege mentality or the delivery of passive services. His workshops, the principal product of Employment Innovations Inc., the Atlanta-based company he began seven years ago, are visceral, not-always-comfortable trips down a sinuous path that could, if they happened for real, easily lead to the witness dock. A taste of what a good plaintiff's lawyer can do with some fairly typical management practices, Mr. Paskoff tells his workshops, is the best motivation to learn better practices.
And he says he really means better, not more cynical, practices. In a workshop, he cites case law and offers his legal experience, but the words "civility" and "fairness" are heard far more frequently than any "ad hocs," "ad locs" or "quid pro quos."
Gregory M. Thomson, a P.S.E.& G. human resources vice president, invited Mr. Paskoff in "to keep the organization out of trouble and make it more productive," as he told the group assembled at the company's headquarters a week and a half ago. P.S.E.& G.'s 12,500 employees are jittery about the current economic climate, a company "redeployment" or downsizing plan and rapid changes in the once-stable utilities industry. "Managers feel pulled off the job to deal with upsets," Mr. Thomson said.
DEALING with upsets, Mr. Paskoff believes, doesn't require an extensive knowledge of the law. "You minimize risk by treating people with the same degree of courtesy and civility that you naturally extend to customers or members of the public," he says. When his clients, especially those confused by a brave new workplace increasingly populated by women and members of minority groups, ask for guidance on what they can and cannot say, he tells them they are on the wrong track: " 'Where are the boundaries?' is the wrong question. Some behavior doesn't belong at work."
Virtually any reference to sex or race is likely to be a violation of Paskoff's First Commandment and de facto Golden Rule: "Think before you speak or act." "You don't have to 'get it.' You just have to avoid the conduct," he tells the group.
Mr. Joannides, the marketing manager, it seems, intuitively understands Paskoff's Third Commandment, "Consult with others," which has the dual purpose of encouraging managers to seek expert help and protecting them from becoming the lone defendants in a suit. When Mr. Paskoff calls for a show of hands early in the workshop on Mr. Joannides's decision to involve other company officials, only two of Mr. Joannides's colleagues vote with him.
Some managers, Mr. Paskoff points out, feel squeamish about intruding on judging what appears to be personal conduct. But in fact, from a legal standpoint, they have an affirmative duty not to condone objectionable behavior. "Tell me," he says, surveying the room. "If I came in and said I saw someone stealing, would you delay taking action?" By the end of the workshop, Mr. Paskoff says, he hopes everyone will accept his basic premise and begin treating harassment and discrimination like any other workplace hazard.
 
Paskoff's Greatest Hits
 TO managers who complain the workplace has become a minefield of sensitivities and potential lawsuits, Stephen Paskoff offers five simple rules of conduct:
* Guard words and actions. Racial or sexual comments or jokes should be avoided at work. Even if they are "innocent," they can undermine legitimate employment decisions.
* Investigate and document. Look into complaints and keep records of what happened and why decisions were made.
* Get help. The company's human resources department may have handled a similar problem before.
* Be consistent and professional. Don't impose standards on an individual that aren't imposed on everyone.
* Avoid litigation. The no-brainer that companies flub all the time. Remember that the lawyers get paid, whether you win or lose.

After a Decade on the Job, Lotus Chairman Says He's Hitting His Stride

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
AS chairman, chief executive and president of the Lotus Development Corporation, Jim P. Manzi sets strategy for the second-largest company in personal computer software (after the Microsoft Corporation). The flagship of the Cambridge, Mass., company is the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet program, but Mr. Manzi sees the future in an ambitious software program called Notes, a network application that allows individuals and groups of workers to organize and exchange information.
Mr. Manzi began work as a newspaper reporter before moving to the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, where one of his assignments was Lotus. He joined Lotus in 1983. In 1986, Lotus's co-founder, Mitchell D. Kapor, turned the company over to Mr. Manzi. 
 Question: This is your tenth anniversary at Lotus. You had a rough ride early on, in terms of expectations, didn't you?
Answer: This company is blessed by the world's most successful software product ever, still is. To go from $53 million to $157 million to $225 million in revenue on one product is an unusual start. Mitchell's original business plan was $3 million for the first year. When Mitchell was there, he spent all his time in software; I spent all my time on sales, marketing and operations. I spent zero time on development of the organization.
When he left, it was the first time that I actually engaged in that side of the company. It was, to be charitable, a learning experience.
It took a long time to get to a point where we were doing something that was forward-looking. We started developing Notes in '85. We had a lot of fits and starts.
But the company's in great shape now. It's got the highest-rated product in every category we compete in, which is extraordinary. We have an outrageous advantage with Notes, which is unequaled. There's no competitor in the market.
Q: Does your heart belong to Notes now, as against 1-2-3?
A: My personal heart? I have four valves in my heart, you know, like everybody else. My left ventricle is 1-2-3, my right ventricle is Notes, my left auricle is Ami Pro, my right auricle is Freelance. My valves are Organizer and cc:Mail. And then I've got this big artery...
Q: You've got a big heart.
A: I've spent a lot of my skin, my personal energy, on Notes. But the whole strategy is about integrating the desktop applications with the Notes and cc:Mail underpinnings. Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows version 4.0 is the first time we're showing the integration strategy that we've been working on for three years. We're way in front in terms of taking work-group computing and integrating it with spreadsheets.
We've gone from being a single-product company to being a multiproduct company.

HEADLINE: Profile/Peter Munk;
Lucky Gold Strike and Wise Hedging Help Keep His Shareholders Smiling

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
THE irony is he's no gold bug. Peter Munk doesn't flaunt gold rings and chains or twirl gold coins. He doesn't even wear a gold watch.
His 10-year-old company, the American Barrick Resources Corporation, has suddenly vaulted into position as North America's biggest gold enterprise and Canada's seventh-largest publicly traded company. But gold, he says, is merely "a commodity, like cotton or wool." 
 Thanks to the luck of striking the richest lode in years (Goldstrike, along Interstate 80 in northeastern Nevada) and sophisticated hedging that protects against downswings in the market, Mr. Munk and his Barrick shareholders have made money. A lot.
Mr. Munk's salary was a relatively modest $750,000 last year, $700,000 in 1991. But in 1991 he cashed in options for $31.6 million of the fast-rising Barrick stock, making him one of Canada's best remunerated executives. He is a fervent exponent of the philosophy that executive rewards be linked to company performance.
Since 1983, the value of the company's shares has rocketed from $46 million to $6.5 billion, annual production from 34,000 to 1.3 million ounces, and reserves from 322,000 to 27 million ounces. Economies of scale have helped cut costs. Barrick spent $164 to produce an ounce of gold last year, down from $205 in 1991 and $218 in 1990.
Mr. Munk and his stockholders don't need any gold chains to be smiling. One dollar invested in Barrick stock when it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange on Feb. 25, 1987, is now worth nearly $8. One dollar invested in Barrick when it was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange on May 21, 1983, is worth nearly $24.
Mr. Munk did what he set out to do: create a low-cost, large-scale gold mining operation for North America that would fill the void left by declining output in South Africa -- and to moderate the price risk so that it would appeal to conservative investors.
"He's managed to marry a perfect blend of operating aggressiveness and financial conservatism," said Lucille Palermo, portfolio manager of the New York-based Van Eck Gold Resources mutual fund.
Yet gold is only one interest of this 65-year-old Hungarian-born, Toronto-based entrepreneur. His holding company, the Horsham Corporation, has also plunged into a multimillion-dollar industrial park in the former East Berlin, and is reorganizing the 61-year-old Clark Oil and Refining Corporation of St. Louis, which operates two refineries and more than 850 gas stations and convenience stores in the Midwest.
Before Barrick, Mr. Munk formed what became the biggest hotel chain in the Pacific Basin. Before hotels, he headed the Clairtone Sound Corporation, once Canada's leading maker of stereos and now one of its more celebrated corporate shipwrecks.
What links these disparate businesses, according to Peter C. Newman, a former editor of Maclean's magazine and a chronicler of Canadian business, "is Peter Munk's incredible intuition, his sixth sense of knowing when and where and how to move."
THE sharp sense of business may have been inherited from his grandfather, Gabriel Munk, a leading banker in prewar Hungary. During World War II Gabriel Munk helped family members, who were Jewish, flee to Switzerland. Not all made it. Peter Munk's mother spent time in Auschwitz (she survived).
Peter Munk came to Canada after the war, received an electrical engineering degree from the University of Toronto, and co-founded Clairtone.
The company, which made televisions as well as stereo equipment, ran into financial difficulties as Japanese electronics flooded the market. The Nova Scotia government, which owned 72 percent of the company, pulled the plug in the early 1970's.
One shareholder sued Mr. Munk, charging he had sold shares on inside knowledge. The matter was settled out of court for $21,000. Mr. Munk denied liability. He said he paid because litigation would have been lengthy and expensive and could have complicated a planned public offering for the hotel chain.
"Clairtone was the single most formative experience in my life because it was so traumatic," Mr. Munk recalled, sitting in his rather somber, unpretentious office at Barrick headquarters here.
But from the experience he drew an important lesson: the need for more caution in business. An aversion to risks has been a hallmark of Barrick and has helped endear it to the investment community.
Yet nothing could take away from the heady experience of running a company that in its day was at the leading edge of its field.
"I learned how to deal with people, how to deal with banks, how to do issues, but the most important thing was that it gave me self-confidence," Mr. Munk said. "I knew I could do it. I knew I would have no trouble beating Newmont and Placer Dome."
But before taking on those two big North American gold companies, Mr. Munk bought and later sold his chain of more than 50 Pacific Basin hotels, which had offices in Sydney and London.
He said a strong motivation was his five children, whom he wanted raised as Canadians. "I told my wife, Melanie, I'm not going to have my kids grow up like a bunch of nomads," he said. He is today an ultra-proud Canadian who always wears on his left lapel the stylized snowflake of the newly conferred Order of Canada, the country's highest honor.
Barrick started as an oil and gas company. "I got caught up in that fundamental stupidity that oil was going through the roof," he said. "But for three years we couldn't seem to make any headway."
At that time the international market price for gold had already fallen to about $300 an ounce from a high of $850 in January 1980. Mr. Munk noted that many were saying the price was headed to $50, but he believed that the proper hedging tools would allow him to make money even if the market declined.
"I bought oil and gas wrong," he said. "I followed the crowd. I said here's an opportunity to make a major correction. I didn't want to do the normal Canadian thing, which is to keep on drilling for oil and making pennies. So I bought a gold mine."
But, remembering Clairtone, he made hedging a key part of the gold business.
Barrick was just another gold mining company until 1986, when Mr. Munk paid $62 million for Goldstrike, on the northern edge of the Carlin Trend, the richest gold seam outside South Africa. The former owners of Goldstrike estimated that the mine contained 600,000 ounces of easily recoverable gold, vastly underrating the potential. Last year Goldstrike yielded 1.1 million ounces, double the 550,000 of 1991. This year it is expected to produce 1.3 million ounces. Goldstrike's reserves were estimated at 21 million ounces at year-end.
Thanks to Goldstrike, Barrick's reserves are some 20 percent greater than those of the Newmont Mining Company, which had been North America's premier gold company.
Mr. Munk recently turned from bearish to bullish on the international gold price, chiefly because of soaring demand from China as that economy surges. But he's still hedging in the futures and options markets against the risk of price declines.
ALTHOUGH gold has been rising in recent months, it had drifted from a high of $480 an ounce to a low of $330 over the past five years. Despite that decline, Barrick last year realized a price of $422 an ounce on its production, $77 more than the average spot price for the year, thanks to various hedging techniques. In each of the preceding three years, Barrick received at least 10 percent more for its gold than the average market price.
Newmont and Placer Dome also hedge, but not to the extent Barrick does. Other producers, to try to take full advantage of the upside, don't hedge at all. But when prices fall, they are hurt.
Mr. Munk is friendly with George Soros, the New York money manager and a fellow Hungarian who recently acquired $400 million of Newmont shares.
"George tells me I'm a fool because I hedge my gold," Mr. Munk said. "He now believes it's going to $1,000. But George has a different business. He may take a bet on Indian rupees. He doesn't run a business the way I do."
 
Next Venture? German Property
 On an autobahn 12 miles south of the center of Berlin is a 600-acre tract of farm land that belongs to Peter Munk's holding company, the Horsham Corporation.
The tract is the core of what Mr. Munk hopes will be amajor German property-development company in the Berlin area. Horsham's investment so far: $34 million.
Although the land won't be officially inaugurated as the Brandenburg industrial park until June 11, Horsham has already signed one customer, the Coca-Cola Company, which is using 25 acres for a regional office, distribution center and bottling plant.
"On a quick, superficial basis," Mr. Munk said, "it's easy to look at the real estate markets in London, New York and Toronto and decide that real estate is the worst business to be in right now. But everyone knows the three most important factors in real estate -- location, location, location."
And for this Hungarian-born executive, "it would be hard to find a better location" than Berlin, whose population is expected to increase by 50 percent, to 5 million, over the next eight years and which promises to become, as he put it, "one of the major centers of the world."
He derides suggestions that he is entangling Horsham, which holds a 21 percent controlling interest in the American Barrick gold company, in a Canary Wharf-type development. The Reichmann brothers, also of Toronto, sank billions of dollars into that ill-fated London project, a drain that contributed to the collapse of their Olympia & York empire.
"This isn't a gamble," Mr. Munk said. "We're not putting up billions of dollars to see whether it will work. We saw we could buy farm land for $10 an acre and knew that if we were wrong, we would end up with the land, but if we were right, that land would be worth $200 an acre."
 Besides, he said, "It's an investment in my favorite currency. What could be better than the German mark?"

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
They're Like Bonds, but Riskier

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
AT first glance, they look like bonds: investors receive steady interest payments and, at maturity, get back their original investment.
They're called "target term trusts," and with investors scrambling for alternatives to today's low interest rates, it's not surprising that the trusts are selling like hotcakes. Just since 1990, the number of funds has risen seven-fold, to 35. 
 The attraction is this: Investors willing to assume a degree of risk can capture yields of roughly 7 or 8 percent, more than double the yields of money market funds.
Still, measured by their total returns, term trusts ranked in the bottom half in 1992 among 96 bond funds and lagged even more in the first quarter of 1993, accounting for 8 of the 10 worst performers -- leading analysts to question whether the trusts will be able to keep their promises to investors.
"It's a very complicated juggling act, and it's not working," said Thomas J. Herzfeld, in Miami, who specializes in closed-end fund investment and analysis.
Just what are term trusts? In essence, they are closed-end funds that resemble bonds. Unlike mutual funds, closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares, which trade on exchanges like common stock, often at a discount or premium to the value of the securities in their portfolio.
In their short life, term trusts have evolved greatly. At first, they owned securities that would mature, like zero-coupon bonds, or relatively stable investments, like adjustable-rate mortgages, to guarantee return of investors' capital. But in their latest incarnation they are riskier.
They were created by Blackrock Financial Management L.P., in New York, which started the Blackrock Target Term Trust in November 1988. To guarantee repayment of principal, roughly a third of the fund was invested in zero-coupon bonds, with the balance mainly in income-producing bonds.
Over time, though, the zeros account for a larger part of these funds' portfolios (today Blackrock is at 40 percent) as they rise in value. Because the zeros produce no income (zeros are bonds stripped of coupons, or interest payments), fund sponsors have to cut dividends or find other income sources.
To avoid this problem, the second generation of term trusts invested mainly in adjustable-rate mortgages. The theory was that this is a steadier way to meet the investment guarantee because the mortgage income fluctuates with market conditions, stabilizing share prices.
Although adjustable-rate mortgages generate some income, they cannot create 7 or 8 percent yields. So to enhance income, managers use leverage and other sophisticated investing strategies, especially risky new derivative securities.
The third generation of term trusts, not yet a year old, concentrate on managing the funds' "duration." Duration is a measure of how bond prices change in response to shifts in interest rates, taking into account the bond's maturity, coupon rate and other characteristics.
One example is the Blackrock Investment Quality Trust, which owns Government securities, mortgage-backed issues and corporate bonds that are rated A, not much above the junk level.
"You're really depending on the individual manager's ability to manage duration," said Susan Paluch, an analyst with Morningstar Inc., fund researchers in Chicago.
Moreover, investors may misunderstand the trusts, which seem much like bonds. The spiel is: "Give me $10 today. I'll pay you interest and return your $10 in seven years." But the return of the initial investment is a goal, not a guarantee.
Lack of experience adds risk, too. No term trust has yet completed its full term. The first to mature -- the American Adjustable Rate 1995 -- will do so in two years.
In the meantime, some funds have traded above their liquidation prices. While investors may believe they will make up the difference in income, "it's troubling that investors are willing to pay up more than they will get back," Ms. Paluch said.
Betting that dividends won't slip is a fool's game today. With interest rates staying low, term trusts -- like all bond funds -- must cut dividends. Dividends paid by American Adjustable Rate 1995 fell from 89 cents a share in 1991 to 71 cents in 1992.
Dividend cuts are actually good for investors in the long run. They stabilize the trust's share price in two ways: the fund's managers aren't forced to invest in higher-paying but riskier securities, and the fund need not pay "return of capital" dividends, which come out of the original investment.
To keep yields high, many funds use leverage. They can borrow up to 33 percent of their assets -- a technique that can backfire badly when interest rates begin to rise.
Most trusts promise to return the original investment at maturity. So far, most are near or ahead of that target. Of course, this can change as interest rates fluctuate.
One note of caution: don't buy a new issue. Dean Witter brought its TCW/DW Term Trust 2003 to market in a $1 billion offering in April. Because of underwriting costs, investors received only $9.40 of value for each $10 invested. Investors could have bought shares that same week in the Liberty Term Trust 1999 on the secondary market at $8.875, a 5 percent discount to net asset value.

New Coupe Completes Civic's Line

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
IN mystery stories and on television, somebody always seems to be slipping a lock with a credit card. And while my experience with recalcitrant latches is limited, I have been around long enough to discover that this method never works.
Or almost never. I tried it one morning last week on a balky ashtray after a frustrating drive home the night before, tugging and fiddling in the dark and finally opening the moon roof to flick my ashes at the stars. 
 Morning light seemed to do nothing for the ashtray's disposition (which I fully understand), but then I remembered the TV trick. And voila! You'll be pleased to know that Honda's Civic Coupe takes Visa.
Not that you should expect such troubles, of course, but few cars come without a flaw. And some people might even think it a good thing to have an ashtray that insists on staying closed.
In fact, Honda continues to please its buyers with high quality, and it has just been named No. 1 in owner loyalty among all major brands for the third year in a row. The ranking, by R. L. Polk & Company, was based on buyers who purchased new cars of the same make as their previous vehicle.
In 1992, the Polk study shows, 40 percent of Honda owners who were looking for a new car bought another Honda. For the company, that's the good news. The bad news is that sales are down generally so far this year, and that a rising yen has devastated profits.
Sales of the Accord, which had a long run as America's most popular car before it was overtaken in January by Ford's Taurus, are down 23 percent this year. The Accord is due for a redesign, and that may account for some of the lag, but sales of the sporty Prelude, which was all new for '92, have also dropped by almost 33 percent.
The one bright spot in Honda's realm is its range of Civic sedans and hatchbacks, whose sales have soared 43 percent. The line was good before, but now it has been rounded out -- and helped immensely -- by a new coupe, available in DX and EX models.
The DX is the base car, carrying a sticker of $10,750. But the tester with the clean ashtray was the top of the line, a $12,800 EX with an automatic transmission and an option package that brought the bottom line to $14,350. While all Hondas have standard driver-side air bags, the package gave the EX a passenger bag and a killer stereo system.
The aqua EX (Aztec Green Pearl in Hondaspeak) also had most of the bells and whistles found on more expensive automobiles, including the aforementioned moon roof, power windows and locks, cruise control, power disk brakes and a tilt wheel for the power steering.
Outside, the new body is sleek and sporty, with aerodynamic lines that rise from cat's-eye headlights and a low nose to sweep back over acres of glass, culminating in a relatively high tail. Beauty may be subjective, but looks alone will probably sell a lot of these cars.
The trunk is large for a car this small, and the locking rear seatback folds forward to make even more space for cargo. The rear seat itself is surprisingly roomy, and adults can actually sit back there.
Up front, there are the usual supportive buckets, and the car seems better arranged than some other recent Hondas. Controls for the power windows are in the armrests, and the door-pulls have finally been moved forward so they are not directly under one's elbow.
On the road, the Civic is notably tight, quiet, comfortable and thrifty. Further, the coupe is even reasonably quick, at least in EX dress.
While the DX gets its 102-horsepower from a 16-valve 1.5-liter four, the EX pulls 125 horses out of an aluminum engine that is just a hair larger at 1.6 liters. It does that with Honda's variable valve timing, which increases efficiency by changing the lift and timing of the intake valves, depending on speed and throttle position.
In all, the new coupe is a very neat package indeed. And one other nice thing: like the Civic sedans and hatchbacks, it is made in America. Probably by nonsmokers.
 
 
 
FEWER BUYERS SHOP FOR EFFICIENCY
 In this era of environmental consciousness, it is interesting to note that car buyers seem to be increasingly more concerned with their own safety and well-being than with that of the planet.
According to a consumer study by J. D. Power & Associates, only 3 percent of the sampled buyers said fuel economy was the most important element in their choice. Ten years ago, the California consulting firm's survey showed that 10 percent considered mileage to be paramount.
The low percentage in this year's study put economy into a tie with several other attributes and behind five others. Dependability and trouble-free operation led the '93 list, with 34 percent saying it was most important. Price was second at 21 percent, safety third at 10 percent.
In the 1983 study, only 8 percent of the buyers said safety was most important. That year, nearly half of the respondents also said they had shopped for a more fuel-efficient vehicle. This year, only a third were looking for higher efficiency.
One factor in the change, J. D. Power said, may be the general improvement in gas mileage. Another may be that the gas-line hysteria of the early 80's is long past. In any case, the consultant warns manufacturers that dependability, safety and quality should be the new watchwords.
"By any measure," the report says, "fuel economy as a marketing point no longer appears to be a good bet."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
The Art of Ticket Splicing Experiences a 90's Revival

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Since the Tammany machine first nominated a mayoral candidate of Irish descent to appeal to newly enfranchised immigrants nearly a century ago, the balanced ticket has been a tradition in New York. The practice reached its apogee in the 1960's, as the city became increasingly diverse, then fell from favor as reformers and reconfigured machines eliminated slate voting.
This year, though, with party loyalty further eroded, the city racially polarized and the prospect of a close election looming, politicians are playing with blocs again. 
 The announcement Friday that Herman Badillo, the Democratic, Puerto Rico-born former Bronx borough president and congressman, would run for city comptroller on a ticket with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the presumptive Republican-Liberal mayoral nominee, suggests a revival in the science of ticket splicing. Mr. Giuliani has already chosen Susan D. Alter, a Brooklyn City Councilwoman who is Jewish, as his running mate for Public Advocate, the job that is now called Council President.
 
What Badillo Brings
 "It's not that Herman can deliver the Latino vote en masse, but that Giuliani is doing well with Latinos anyway and Herman might be able to pull in older Latino voters," said Angelo Falcon, president of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, a research and advocacy group.
Norman Adler, a political consultant, said: "There is some reason to believe that Herman Badillo, running with no countervailing Puerto Rican candidate, brings a large number of Puerto Rican voters to himself. But would the presence of Badillo on the Republican line bring more Puerto Ricans to Giuliani? I'm very skeptical." Mr. Adler also questioned whether Mr. Badillo's appeal would extend past Puerto Ricans to other Hispanic voters.
Despite Mr. Giuliani's move, monolithic voting by ethnic blocs may not be as reliable as it once was. Intermarriage, assimilation, geography, economic gaps, the role of organized labor, the emergence and erosion of an ideologically liberal Democratic coalition dominated by Jewish voters, and, more recently, commonalities generated by gender and sexual orientation, have transformed once hardwood constituencies into warped planks of plywood that are coming unglued.
"In the anthropology of politics, people vote, eat and pray ethnically," Mr. Adler said. "The church goes first, party second and food goes last."
Moreover, as Nathan Glazer, professor of education and sociology at Harvard, has remarked, ethnicity is thin gruel compared to differences between blacks and whites. Mayor David N. Dinkins's candidacy four years ago altered a dynamic that had prevailed since the late 1960's when conflict was defined in terms of Roman Catholic party regulars against Jewish reformers. The emergence of black and Hispanic politicians created a new fault line grounded in race more than ethnicity.
In the latest New York Times/WCBS-TV News poll, Hispanic New Yorkers split 45 percent for Mr. Dinkins to 44 percent for Mr. Giuliani. If the general election turns out to be a rerun of the race that Mr. Dinkins won four years ago when he defeated Mr. Giuliani by only two percentage points, even a slight shift -- precipitated, perhaps, by an alliance with Mr. Badillo -- could tip the balance and decide the election.
 
Searching for an Italian
 Less than a half-century ago, Democratic leaders sifted through the Green Book, the official city directory, searching for a mayoral candidate with an Italian surname before they found Vincent R. Impellitteri. Political matchmakers recruited candidates to mixed marriages that would guarantee the greatest popular appeal on Election Day, even if the subsequent honeymoon might be abbreviated. Party leaders advanced ethnic succession in politics, but at their own pace and as a means of self-perpetuation rather than as a goal in itself.
For aficionados of ethnic coalitions, 1961 was a banner year in New York. After defeating Levitt-Mackell-DiFede in the Democratic primary, the Wagner-Screvane-Beame ticket faced a Republican slate that led on syllables, if not on lyrics. A Republican campaign ditty that year began:
You'll be safe in the park, even after it's dark
With Lefkowitz, Fino and Gilhooley.
Particularly among Democrats, the decline of the party organization and the advent of fiercely contested primaries all but ended the balanced ticket as a means of admission to City Hall. Republicans, less accustomed to primaries and forced by overwhelmingly Democratic enrollment to forge other alliances, kept the practice alive longer.
In 1965, John V. Lindsay, a Protestant and the last Republican mayor of New York, ran with Timothy W. Costello, a Staten Island Liberal Party member of Irish descent, as a candidate for Council President and with Milton Mollen, a Jewish Democrat from Brooklyn, as a candidate for comptroller.
Only Mr. Lindsay was elected, with the help of Jews, some of whom defected from Abraham D. Beame because they feared the attention that a Jewish mayor would bring them. Eight years later, Mr. Beame became the city's first Jewish mayor. Mr. Costello lost in 1965 to Frank O'Connor. Mr. Mollen was defeated by Mario Procaccino.
Four years later, Mr. Lindsay's Liberal-Fusion ticket included a Jewish candidate, Sanford Garelik, for Council President and an Italian, Fioravante G. Perrotta, for comptroller. Mr. Lindsay and Mr. Garelik won. Mr. Perrotta lost to Mr. Beame. While Mr. Lindsay was nearly defeated because of his perceived favoritism toward minority groups, they turned out in relatively small numbers that year and he might have been able to win without any black or Puerto Rican votes at all.
 
One of Many Variables
 Of course, the ethnic factor is only one variable in a voter's mind. When Geraldine A. Ferraro of Queens was running for Vice President, she appealed more to women voters than to fellow Italian-Americans -- many of whom proved more loyal to the Republican Party and to its presidential candidate.
In the 1985 Democratic primary for mayor, blacks did not turn out in large numbers to support a black, Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., whose candidacy they did not take seriously. They did, though, four years later when Mr. Dinkins emerged as the leading challenger to Mayor Edward I. Koch.
Mr. Koch's earlier popularity among middle-class Hispanic and West Indian voters had suggested a class dimension to his appeal that might surmount racial boundaries, wrote John H. Mollenkopf, a political scientist at the City University of New York Graduate Center, "but Koch allowed the racial dimension of his appeal to carry him far beyond the bounds of electoral rationality" and in 1989 "he reaped what he had sown."
In that year, Mr. Mollenkopf and his colleagues found, "the secret to Dinkins's success in the general election was not that one group, such as Latinos, shifted in his favor, but that major components of all the major non-black ethnic groups, including Italian-American Democrats, backed their party's candidate, even though he was black, against an attractive Republican candidate."
Still, Mr. Mollenkopf concluded, if Jews and Catholics outside Manhattan had been only 20 percent less supportive of Mr. Dinkins, Mr. Giuliani would have won. Which is why Mr. Badillo and Ms. Alter are so attractive this year to Mr. Giuliani.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Future Is Hostage to Here and Now

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THERE was something crazy about last week at the White House. Between the travel office scandals, runway-haircut fallout, back-of-the-envelope budget deals and backpedaling on Bosnia, the place had a certain manic feel to it. Virtually everyone caught up in it -- staff, reporters, lawmakers -- seemed to walk away dazed and exhausted. But the good thing about crises is that they tend to throw things into stark relief, and if you sift through the zany events of last week, you can learn a lot about the current state of three of the most important institutions in Washington: the Congress, the press and the Presidency. 
 No doubt Bill Clinton is the first President in a long time willing to tackle the most fundamental problems facing the country: job creation, the budget deficit and health care. But these require complex solutions involving great sacrifice with a payoff years down the road. They can only be done by a President with a strategy for dealing with two institutions that have shown insatiable appetites for the politics of the immediate: Congress and the press.
The fascinating thing about last week's House vote for the Clinton budget was that the Democrats delivered for their President at a time when he was in free-fall in the polls, raw meat for Jay Leno and essentially admitting that he had governed for four months without a strategy to sell his long-term policies in a city dominated by short-term instincts.
"The President's signal contribution was to push the issue of deficit reduction onto the legislative agenda, but then he dropped the ball," said Thomas Mann, a Congressional expert at the Brookings Institution. "The Congress, instead of bailing out on him, pulled up its socks and delivered in spite of him. The House Democrats took the view that 'We cannot afford to let Clinton fail because it would be the destruction of his Presidency, our party -- not to mention possibly the country.' "
Mr. Clinton, it seems, was saved by the fact that the politics of the immediate has taken on a whole new meaning for many Congressmen.
"There is something going on in Congress that is counter-intuitive," said Representative Howard Berman, a California Democrat. "We have decided, after a good deal of public prodding, that engaging in more gridlock or ignoring the problem have become the most serious sins. What is now our short-term interest is dealing with the long-term problems. It has meant getting over the idea of 'Oh my God, I can't ever raise a tax, cut a program or fire a Federal employee.' "
This public quest for real economic reform seems to have served as a life vest, emboldening Congress and buoying the Clinton Presidency. It has given Mr. Clinton his most important political victory and bought him some time to regroup for a new, tougher fight in the Senate.
Mr. Clinton could start, said Kansas Democrat Rep. Dan Glickman, with a better communications strategy. The House vote, he argued, was a case of the Democrats there rising to the occasion. But the President now has to regain control over the debate over his budget if he has any hope of winning Senate approval for his plan to raise taxes and trim spending by $337 billion over the next five years. Mr. Perot and the Republicans have so effectively painted the Clinton plan as classic Democratic tax-and-spend, said Mr. Glickman, that "many of my constituents didn't even know there were spending cuts in it." Mr. Clinton, he added, has got to provide Senators political cover to vote with him, by clearly articulating to the American public "what we are doing and why we are doing it."
The President moved to remedy just that point Saturday when he stunned Washington, and many of his staff, by announcing that he had hired David Gergen -- the man who helped design President Reagan's successful press strategy -- as his new communications director.
 
Short-Term-itis
 Mr. Clinton seemed to intuitively understand that while the politics of the immediate may have unexpectedly saved him in the House, that will not likely be the case in his dealings with the press. The press, institutionally and instinctively, fixates on short-term judgments. Journalists are not historians; their job is not to wait four years to make their analysis. But if the press makes daily judgment calls while Mr. Clinton has long-term plans, then he needs a communications strategy that bridges the gap. That is, a strategy to use his public appearances to generate stories that validate his long-range legislative goals, while also convincing the public to be patient.
It is precisely such a communications strategy that has been missing at the White House. While the Clinton team regularly criticized the Bush Administration for not understanding the seamless connection between designing policies and selling them, the Clinton White House has fallen into the very same habit.
Worse, Mr. Clinton has actively drawn the attention of the press in precisely the wrong direction for him. He may sincerely believe, as he says, that sending his distant cousin to take over the White House travel office after he dismissed the staff for mismanagement, and getting a $200 haircut that tied up Los Angeles International Airport, were trivial events that the press blew out of proportion.
But the press seized on them with a sustained intensity because they revealed something about the President's values. They demonstrated a gap between who he said he was and how he was actually behaving. That gap is a matter of real public interest. And the way for Mr. Clinton to neutralize the potentially corrosive daily judgments of reporters and commentators on his long-term goals is not by trying to go around reporters, but by going through them with policies consistent with the values he campaigned on. It is he who opened the gap.
Last week highlighted one more gap bedeviling the President. There has always been one area where the President has a degree of freedom of action:foreign policy. It has provided a theater for Presidents to build authority, to demonstrate strong nerves, which they could then turn around and use in the domestic field. By understandably focusing his Presidency on domestic affairs, Mr. Clinton has not been able to draw on foreign policy as a source of strength.
Partly this is because the public just does not care at this moment. For example, Mr. Clinton deftly handled President Boris N. Yeltsin's troubles, and boldly stepped up to the issue of Russian aid, the most important question in American foreign policy today. And he has gotten no credit for it.
 
No Easy Victories
 But partly this is because he has found foreign policy much more complicated than he expected. There are no easy victories any more; American interests are much more ambiguous and, as Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff bluntly acknowledged last week, America does not have the economic resources to lead as it did in the past.
This has quickly produced some gaps between what Mr. Clinton promised on foreign affairs in the campaign and where he has taken the country since. On Bosnia, he has gone from vowing to lead the cavalry to the rescue to looking for any way to avoid engagement. On China, he has gone from lambasting the Bush Administration for "coddling" dictators in Beijing, to announcing last week that he would extend China's favorable trade status -- without linking it to changes in human rights behavior -- because "It's a great opportunity for America there" to do business.
Such gaps are potentially deadly for the President, whether it is the gaps between his politics of the long term and the politics of the immediate, or the chasm between how he has sold himself in foreign policy and how he has behaved in certain areas. Whether he bridges these gaps, or is swallowed by them, whether he defines them or is defined by them, may ultimately determine his success or failure.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Fear of the Serbs Spreads in the South

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: BRUSSELS

 BODY:
BEHIND the fanciful phrasing of NATO defense ministers meeting here last week -- as they talked of Muslim "safe havens" in Bosnia and of military options still somehow "on the table" -- the reality of the situation in the Balkans was clear. With Europe and the United States hiding behind each other, Serbian and Croatian aggressors have been given carte blanche to make good on their gains in Bosnia.
The question now is what implications this Western failure will have for the rest of the region, particularly in the potentially explosive Serbian province of Kosovo, where Serbian nationalism clashes head-on with an Albanian population. Potential conflicts -- among them renewed Serbian-Croatian fighting, or a war in Macedonia -- could confront the West with the same intractable conundrums that it has faced in Bosnia. 
 "Yugoslavia has proved that the West is an orphan of the Soviet Union," said Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French Institute for International Relations. "When there was a clearly defined threat, we were united. But now that has gone and we have the worst possible combination, with a Europe that has no will, that is demonstrably weak, appearing to impose its will to do nothing in Bosnia on the Clinton Administration. As a result, Serbs know they have a free hand to make trouble, especially in Kosovo."
The Clinton Administration explicitly warned Serbia earlier this year not to make trouble in Kosovo, but in Serbian minds the seriousness of that warning now has to be balanced against the demonstrated American unwillingness to get involved on the ground in the Balkans. And the potential for violence is enormous in Kosovo, greater than anywhere else in the region.
 
Rising Tensions
 Because they account for more than 85 percent of Kosovo's 2.1 million people, Albanians now say they must have an independent state. But Serbs regard Kosovo as the cradle of their civilization -- a theme invoked repeatedly by Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, since he used it to gain power in 1987 -- and Serbian determination to retain control is unequivocal.
Tension has been sharply increased by the arrival of Zeljko Raznatovic, a baby-faced bully identified as a suspected war criminal by the United States and wanted for armed robbery in Sweden. Known as Arkan, this Serbian militia leader who wreaked mayhem and murder in Bosnia and Croatia was observed by a recent visitor to Kosovo swaggering around the Grand Hotel in Pristina, followed by gun-toting bodyguards.
The immensely seedy Grand is now Arkan's base of operations -- he was elected to the Serbian Parliament last December as a representative from Pristina -- and his presence suggests that Serbia could open another front in Kosovo whenever this option meets the one criterion President Milosevic has demonstrated for political decision-making: his desire to remain in power.
"Arkan has been intimidating Albanians by saying Kosovo is Serbian land and should be occupied by Serbs," said John Erath, an American diplomat in Kosovo on a fact-finding mission for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. "His presence is a frightening thing."
Over the last four months, police raids, provocations from Arkan's thugs and sorties by Serbian fighter planes screaming low over Pristina have become routine. In the last mass Albanian protests, in October, several hundred people were beaten by the police.
"There can be no question of an independent state in Kosovo," the Yugoslav Prime Minister, Radoje Kontic, said in an interview. "The territory of the federal republic of Yugoslavia is inviolable and will be defended by all available means."
An explosive impasse has thus taken hold. When President Clinton formally repeated the Bush Administration's warning to Serbia, the reason was clear: The presence of a large Albanian minority in neighboring Macedonia and of Albania itself mean that any Kosovo war would act as a tinder-box.
But a war would certainly suit Arkan, who is believed by Western diplomats to have made a fortune from the Bosnian conflict, mainly from oil smuggling. Similarly, many analysts believe that President Milosevic now depends on conflict somewhere to survive, because only war can distract attention from the ruinous economic state of Serbia and feed the nationalist fervor that has replaced Communism as the governing ideology.
 
The Next Front?
 "If the Serbs close the front in Bosnia, they will open one here," said Ibrahim Rugova, the gaunt Albanian intellectual who was elected "president" of Kosovo in an unofficial poll among Albanians last May and who held talks earlier this year in Washington with President Clinton's deputy national security adviser, Samuel Berger. "Arkan and his boys are ready to perform the first massacres."
Arkan himself is not talking. "No, I cannot give you even one minute, I am too busy," he said when asked for an interview, before striding off to get his shoes shined.
Arkan's militia is suspected of atrocities against Muslims during the Serbian takeover of Zvornik, Bjeljina and other Bosnian towns. In Kosovo, Mr. Erath says, Arkan has mainly been busy with speeches in towns where he has suggested removing Albanians to make way for Serb refugees.
Up to now, violence has been limited. In part this reflects a Serb desire to avoid a two-front war. It also shows the Kosovo Albanian leadership's determination to pursue passive resistance combined with diplomacy. The aim of the diplomacy is to achieve an independent state that might eventually unite with Albania.
Mr. Rugova said he gave Mr. Berger a 10-point plan calling for United Nations peacekeeping troops in Kosovo and the establishment of a United Nations protectorate leading to independence. American officials, however, have said Albanian calls for independence could not be supported because Kosovo was a province of Serbia before Yugoslavia's breakup and borders should not be changed, particularly if there are unresolved problems of power-sharing.
Still, the situation in Kosovo seems to be heading inexorably toward conflict. There seems no willingness to seek compromise, and a return to the autonomy Kosovo enjoyed under Tito in the old Yugoslavia would no longer satisfy the Albanians. That autonomy disappeared in 1990, when Serbian authorities effectively imposed direct rule from Belgrade.
Since 1990, the divide between the two communities has become near-total. Albanians say the Serb authorities have thrown Albanian teachers and students out of schools and universities, closed hospitals to Albanians, and fired more than 100,000 people from state jobs. Serbs say the Albanian exodus has largely been voluntary as the community establishes separate institutions in pursuit of independence.
Virtually all Albanian students now attend parallel schools in private houses, where students huddle on the floor in ill-equipped rooms. "Here we learn the history of the Albanian people," said Antigone Kajtazi, a 17-year-old student. "The Serbs have always been aggressors."
Another student, Gazmeno Krasniqi, said: "The Serbs have been trying to disappear us. The best solution for us is not to fight. With guns we have no chance. But we will win with help from outside."
That is what Bosnia's Muslims thought, too.

HEADLINE: The Paperless Office Looms on the Horizon. Again.

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
IN the 1960's, in the original vision of the office of the future, computer screens and magnetic data storage would replace filing cabinets and typewriters. Paper would become obsolete.
It hasn't worked out that way. Each new electronic office device -- copier, computer, printer and fax machine -- has instead contributed to the blizzard of office paper. 
 Companies, like Xerox Corporation and Wang Laboratories, that have tried to automate the office, have failed to persuade customers to buy all their equipment from a single company. Instead offices are filled with incompatible parts, which increases the need for paper.
The upward paper spiral has led the statisticians at the American Forest and Paper Association to note with some glee that despite the deployment of 25 million personal computers in this country, there appears to be a law of paper hyper-growth: for each additional billion dollars of gross national product yearly, there are 80,000 tons of paper.
But a series of recent and soon-to-be-announced events suggest that the paperless office may indeed be nearer:
* At a conference in Seattle this month, Xerox showed off a portable flat panel display with the resolution of laser-printed paper.
* The San Jose Mercury, a Silicon Valley newspaper, stepped into the information age this month by creating an electronic edition that appears daily on America On-Line, a dial-up database service like Prodigy.
* On June 9, Microsoft and a group of business allies are expected to announce a new office standard that will permit a range of previously stand-alone office machines to communicate electronic data.
* On June 15, Adobe, a software publisher, will formally introduce Acrobat, a new personal computer standard that will allow publishers to produce a single document that can be viewed on all kinds of personal computers and work stations.
The combination of vast and inexpensive on-line databases, hand-held computers that can wirelessly connect to other office systems and razor-sharp portable displays that match the clarity of paper is forcing skeptics to re-evaluate how far off the paperless office is.
"In the long run we are going to become paperless in the same way we became horseless," said Paul Saffo, a consultant at the Institute for the Future, in Menlo Park, Calif. "Horses are still around, but they're just ridden by little girls and hobbyists."
Already, the use of paper has changed. Once a means of storing and displaying information, paper is increasingly used only as a means of display, Mr. Saffo said, and computers are much more effective at storing and retrieving information.
"We are approaching an era when electronic paper will be possible," said John Seeley Brown, director of Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. "It will be a watershed event when you can now get the kind of quality that you are used to seeing on the printed page on a flat panel display."
Even some of the booming areas of paper growth in technology are subtly but significantly changing. Last year 2.3 million fax modems for personal computers were sold, and only 1.9 million fax machines, according to BIS Strategic Decisions, a computer industry market research company. The shift to fax modems is significant because increasingly it will mean that fax information, like E-mail, will travel directly from computer screen to computer screen -- never touching paper.
Patricia Seybold, president of the Seybold Group, a Boston office consulting company, said her company now publishes its reports both on paper and electronically. Ms. Seybold devised a system using Lotus Notes, a software program that allows personal computers to share information, which allows 50 of her corporate clients to read her company's reports electronically -- and give instant feedback.
Similar office systems appear to work best in companies where the PC's are interconnected. At Oracle Systems Corporation, a Belmont, Calif., database developer, extensive use of electronic forms and E-mail has banished paper clutter.
"We have wired the company and as a result of that we have an infrastructure that has made it very easy to automate," said Tim Negris, vice president at Oracle. "Honest to God, I haven't read a paper memo since I came here."
Still, predictions of the paperless office have been made prematurely before, and even the techno-optimists remain cautious about when it will arrive.
"This is either the best thing that ever happened to the Northwest forest industry," Mr. Saffo said of Microsoft's upcoming Digital Office announcement, "or the best thing that ever happened to the spotted owl. I'm just not sure which."

Rich Schools, Poor Schools, Never-Ending Litigation

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
WITH a state judge threatening, in essence, to close down the state's public schools in order to save them, the 3.2 million schoolchildren of Texas nearly started summer early this year. The move was apparently averted last week, after lawmakers finally agreed on a new law to do what the courts have insisted they do: divide the funds for public education more equitably. But the threat served as a vivid reminder that 25 years after advocates for children in poor school districts began seeking relief in state courts around the country, there are many places where the issue is far from resolved.
School-financing lawsuits are still pending in fully half the states right now. In many, the courts are monitoring state legislatures to see if they comply with judicial rulings aimed at producing greater equity. This was the case in Texas, where a state district judge grew so impatient with legislative foot-dragging and a popular vote that rejected a constitutional amendment aimed at redistributing money, that he said he would shut off all state funding on June 1. That threat spurred the legislature in Austin to act. 
 But courts in a few states are still trying to decide whether existing school-finance formulas are fair. In six more, including New York, plaintiffs are hoping to refile complaints that were dropped or dismissed.
The new measure in Texas is likely to spark another round of lawsuits. Rich districts are expected to complain that shifting their locally collected taxes to poor schools amounts to an unfair taking of their money. Poor districts are expected to argue that the new law does not go far enough toward achieving true equity -- spending the same amount on every Texas schoolchild.
The Texas law requires that each of the wealthiest 10 percent of the state's 1,044 school districts choose from a menu of options to help those at the other end of the scale. Rich districts can send a check to the state, shift commercial property from their tax rolls to those of poorer districts, or even make deals with other districts to send teachers or equipment. If a district does nothing, the state can tell it what to do.
In some ways, the approach here is novel, national education experts agree, because it is the first time that any state has required districts to directly decide how to help others. But some cautioned that the mechanism, which has not been fully agreed to, could be ripe for abuse. "It's kind of like saying, 'Here, here are five ways you can pay your 1040 to the I.R.S. this year,' said Chris Pipho, a senior analyst with the Education Commission of the States, a Denver-based research group. "Somebody could easily find a loophole."
And the "multiple choice" approach, as Texas lawmakers dubbed it, incurred the wrath of those who said that, no matter what route a wealthy district chose, it was still being robbed. "All those multiples are some form of 'Robin Hood,' with a gun against your head -- and you pick A, B, C, or D, or get shot," said Tom Craddick, a Republican state representative from Midland. He has urged that voters be allowed to vote on a constitutional amendment limiting the court's involvement in school-finance issues.
In any event, the new law did nothing to change the fundamental reason for such disparities: schools are financed largely with local property taxes.
In some Texas districts, typically those with oil fields or petrochemical complexes, taxes from businesses can pay more than 90 percent of school costs, and generously at that. Meanwhile, in the Rio Grande Valley, which has eight of the state's 10 poorest districts, there is little to tax but ramshackle houses and a few gas stations and fast-food stores. "We have facilities that go back to the Dark Ages," said Daniel Hernandez, the superintendent of the Edcouch-Elsa district, in Hidalgo County.
The Equity Center, a non-profit research group that represents many poor districts, says spending on the 5 percent of students in the richest ones averages $11,801 per pupil, while the poorest 5 percent spend $3,190.
Some states -- notably Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia -- have raised more taxes at the state level and directed them to poorer districts. But because Texas remains one of seven states without a personal income tax, it is politically difficult for lawmakers to try that. And plaintiffs are unlikely to change the basic mechanism by challenging it in Federal court: the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that property-tax collection was a permissible way to fund schools even if it led to great spending disparities.
Nonetheless, the poor districts vow to fight for some kind of overhaul. "We know that true equity cannot be reached unless the state gets committed with other kinds of funds," said Ernesto Alvarado, superintendent of the Pharr-San Juan-Alamo school district.
And, tellingly, many community leaders in areas in the middle range of the economic scale, who were generally unaffected by the new law, said that it may be a stopgap solution at best. "I think the real problem is that the Legislature just hasn't had the courage to bite the bullet," said Jim Clark, the district attorney in Tyler County, in rural East Texas.
But even now that it is on the books, and the court is expected to hold off on any school-closing measures, the seeds of new challenges are clearly out there. John N. Leedom, a Republican State Senator from Dallas, complained that the measure will limit how much some wealthier districts can spend on their students. "The children of Texas are going to be dumbed down," he said.
At the same time, Craig Foster, the executive director of the Equity Center, said poorer districts would be exploring ways to alter the new law so that it could go even further toward equalizing spending on all students. "We'd like to keep the good features and take the bad features to court," he said. "And our goal is to do it in such a way that the schools stay open."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Fiscal Stimulus? The Economists Say 'Never Mind'

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
LAST fall, running up the budget deficit to avert another recession did not seem like such a bad idea to dozens of economists. They signed onto the proposition that the extra spending, mostly on public works, would create jobs, helping to make the economy blossom rather than fade. They pushed this view on candidate Bill Clinton, who was sympathetic. And now they are silent.
What happened? Well, raising the deficit, even temporarily, is no longer on any public agenda. Deficit cutting, whatever the danger for a weak economy, has become a national obsession. Under pressure from Congress, President Clinton made deficit cutting the priority. And even the two most enthusiastic advocates of deficit spending -- James Tobin and Robert M. Solow, both Nobel laureates -- while not changing their view, have bowed to deficit-cutting. 
 "It is too bad that we are not having a stimulus package followed in two years by deficit reduction, but it is better to have Mr. Clinton's budget plan and go on from there," Mr. Tobin said, explaining an op-ed article in The New York Times last week in which he and Mr. Solow reluctantly put aside their stimulus proposal. "The budget bill is not the scenario we would have written, but it is better than having neither stimulus nor deficit reduction."
More than 100 economists signed a petition circulated by Mr. Tobin and Mr. Solow, and with the election approaching and the economy weak, other economists joined them, even some opposed to higher deficits. Essentially, they advocated public works spending and tax credits that would add as much as $120 billion to the deficit over two years. Once the economy grew briskly again, deficit reduction would kick in.
But the spending would have to raise the deficit; if the Government hires people to build a railroad, for example, and cancels a highway, nothing is gained.
Fiscal stimulus, as this is called, is still quietly favored by some of last year's advocates, among them Albert Sommers, a senior economist at the Conference Board. "The national goal should be jobs and higher living standards and not a particular level for the deficit, which is an instrument for making policy," Mr. Sommers said.
But many of those who signed the Tobin-Solow petition have changed their minds, preferring an alternative method for reviving the economy: low interest rates. "I thought the economy looked bad enough last year that even a fiscal stimulus seemed advisable," said Ed Yardeni, a Wall Street economist who signed. "But that was then and this is now."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Campaign Strategy: Show Them Who's the Mayor

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The best way to remain Mayor, David N. Dinkins has clearly decided, is to remind New Yorkers as often as possible that he already is.
To the extent that Mr. Dinkins has developed a political strategy in what is expected to be a very close race, it is to emphasize his incumbency. 
 The strategy carries risks, of course. He has a record to defend, and his political opponents have already begun questioning Mr. Dinkins's leadership on everything from budget woes to the civil unrest in Crown Heights two years ago and the boycott by black residents of a Korean grocery in Flatbush three years ago.
 
A Mayoral Opportunity
 But what might seem like an albatross to some looks for the moment at least like an opportunity to the Mayor and his advisers. They believe that, whatever problems the city may have, the Mayor has few other options. He cannot run from his record, and must use all his political tools to present the state of the city in the best possible light. As the incumbent, Mr. Dinkins is able to get news coverage virtually every day, focusing attention most of the time on issues of his choosing.
Mr. Dinkins has stuck steadfastly by his political script in recent days, even as a cascade of developments altered drastically the dynamics of the mayoral race. On Thursday, Mr. Dinkins's main Democratic foe, City Council President Andrew J. Stein, withdrew from the campaign to run again for his current office.
 
Focus on Giuliani
 A day later, the Mayor's chief rival, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate, announced that he would be joined on a multi-ethnic, multiparty slate by Herman Badillo, a Democrat who will now run for comptroller.
The moves by Mr. Stein and Mr. Badillo, who until two weeks ago had also been seeking the Democratic mayoral nomination, cleared the political underbrush and allowed Mr. Dinkins to focus on what is virtually certain to be a strong challenge by Mr. Giuliani.
Four years ago Mr. Dinkins beat Mr. Giuliani by only 2 percentage points, and this time his challenger has more money and a better organization and is guided by David Garth, the consultant who helped run five of the last seven successful mayoral campaigns.
A New York Times/WCBS-TV poll released two weeks ago showed that if the election were held now it would be a tossup between the Mayor and Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Dinkins was favored by 45 percent of the registered voters surveyed, while 44 percent said they supported Mr. Giuliani -- a statistically insignificant difference.
But before the Mayor retrains his sights on Mr. Giuliani, and vice versa, many politicians and political analysts expect Mr. Dinkins to continue for a while longer the local version of the Rose Garden strategy.
 
'Time-Honored Tradition'
 "It's a time-honored tradition," said Basil A. Paterson, the former deputy mayor, who is one of Mr. Dinkins's oldest friends. "Every mayor has done that. It is considered an advantage of incumbency. There are enough liabilities."
For weeks, while his opponents have been meeting behind closed doors to assess their chances and negotiate alliances balanced for maximum ethnic and political advantage, Mr. Dinkins has concentrated in public on things mayoral, indulging in only a handful of overtly political events. His daily schedule, though, is permeated with politics.
Thursday was a classic example of the powers of incumbency. The Mayor began his day as the host of a breakfast at Gracie Mansion for a group that represents Hispanic business executives. Then he met briefly in a courtesy call with the Secretary of State of the Dominican Republic, Alexis Joaquin Castillo.
Next, Mr. Dinkins presided with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo over the opening of a $127 million state park atop a sewage treatment plant along the Hudson River in Harlem, a park that did not cost the Mayor's battered budget a dime but whose opening allowed him to spend a blissful hour in the midday sun, hugging old friends and kissing babies while surrounded by a scrum of television cameras.
Then it was back to City Hall for photos with naval commanders, part of the ceremonies of Fleet Week, and for a news conference on a Special Olympics tournament for handicapped and impaired children.
That was followed by a mayoral announcement, reported prominently by newspapers and radio and television stations: Mr. Dinkins offered an unprecedented one-month amnesty on late penalties for delinquent parking fines, the latest in a series of pronouncements intended to court various groups. The pronouncements ranged from a speed-up in police hiring to easing the requirements for sweeping street curbs. His last stop was a brief but upbeat appearance at a dinner-dance sponsored by Queens Democrats at Antun's Restaurant in Queens Village.
 
'Not a Bad Day'
 It was a day that addressed a broad range of constituencies: Hispanic New Yorkers, Dinkins loyalists in Harlem, disabled voters, Queens Democratic district leaders and parking scofflaws of every racial, ethnic and political background.
While Mr. Dinkins was racing around the city attending to his official duties, his chief Democratic rival, Mr. Stein, had begun telephoning politicians and reporters to say that he would withdraw from the race.
"Not a bad day," Mr. Dinkins said, as he relaxed in his car in midevening, returning from Queens to a late dinner at Gracie Mansion.
Mr. Dinkins is not known for flamboyant oratory or startling political moves. Some Democrats said last week that they were disappointed he had been unable in recent weeks to respond to Mr. Giuliani's deft maneuvers by assembling an ethnically diverse slate of his own.
 
Diverse Constituencies
 But the profusion of Dinkins supporters among the Democratic candidates for the other two citywide offices, Council president and comptroller, made it difficult for the Mayor to get his diverse constituencies behind a slate balanced for ethnicity, race and sex. Joining Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Badillo is Councilwoman Susan D. Alter, a Brooklyn Democrat and former Dinkins supporter running for Council president.
Bill Lynch, the former Deputy Mayor who is Mr. Dinkins's campaign manager, and some independent consultants questioned whether Mr. Dinkins needed a slate. "Does David Dinkins have to prove that he's going to have Latinos involved in his government, that he is going to have women involved in his goverment?" Mr. Lynch asked. "When Mr. Giuliani starts talking about fusion, that's something new for him. Not for this Mayor, not for this government."
Maureen Connelly, a veteran political consultant who is not involved in the mayoral campaign, said that Mr. Giuliani needs a fusion ticket "to demonstrate that he can reach into the Democratic electorate."
 
Questioning Leadership
 "I don't think that's a requirement for Dinkins," Ms. Connelly said. "He's either demonstrated that he's the Mayor of all New Yorkers or he hasn't."
His aspirations as a healer, someone who could bring together the sometimes strained ethnic and racial groups of New York, was at the heart of Mr. Dinkins's campaign four years ago. He still talks often of the promise of the city's "gorgeous mosaic," but his opponents will surely seize on the racial and ethnic tensions of the last three and a half years to raise questions about his leadership and to try to make inroads on the fragile coalition of black, Hispanic and liberal white voters that made him New York's first black mayor.
 
Help From Fellow Democrats
 Mr. Dinkins will also be counting on help from his fellow Democrats, Mr. Cuomo and President Clinton. While it is not clear how much help they will be able to provide, the Governor and the White House have already tried to be useful -- trying, unsuccessfully, to persuade Mr. Badillo not to throw in his lot with Mr. Giuliani.
Since Mr. Dinkins and his advisers know that they will inevitably spend the next five months defending his record, they have begun refining the most positive message they can get from his term, which has been defined by a prolonged recession and almost constant fiscal duress.
At a candidates' forum Wednesday night, sponsored by the Chelsea Reform Democratic Club at St. Columba's Roman Catholic Church on West 25th Street, the Mayor presented the basic 15-minute talk that he has delivered nearly every week.
He took credit for balancing the budget each year, expanding the police force and a two-year decline in crime statistics. Mr. Dinkins also described some modest but well-placed programs his administration has initiated during the last year. They include a network of health clinics and the opening of many schools in the afternoon and evening for recreation and other services.
"I'm proud of some of the things we've been able to do," Mr. Dinkins said. "Hope to be able to do a lot more. That's one of the reasons, frankly, that I want four more years. I want an opportunity to do more."

HEADLINE: Eastward, Ho! The Great Move Reverses

SERIES: Forsaken Frontier: A Second Look -- First of three articles.

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: POCATELLO, Idaho

 BODY:
This spring, 150 years after the first wave of immigrants waded through the Oregon Trail dust here on the way to the West Coast, a couple from California dropped into this sage-coated valley cut by the Snake River and pronounced it Eden.
Pulling up stakes from Orange County, Cindy and Marty Madden had explored the arid plateaus and alpine hideaways of the West in their small private airplane. They settled on one of the most remote small cities in nation, a four-hour drive east of Boise. 
 "One of my friends said, 'Pocatello? What is that?,' " recalled Ms. Madden, who is 39 and has lived her entire life in California. "It wasn't ridicule. It was more like pity."
A century and a half ago, a similar sentiment was directed at that first hoof train of travelers, 875 people, who packed their belongings into 4-by-10-foot wagons for a 2,000-mile journey from Independence, Mo., to Oregon and California, each technically a foreign territory.
 
From Dreamland to Desert
 Most of them walked the entire way. It was the start of the Great Migration, a continental shift of 350,000 people to the West Coast that began in 1843 and ended a generation later.
Today, the sesquicentennial year of the Oregon Trail's first wave, another migration is under way: a reverse flow out of California and into the interior of the American West, an area the 19th century migrants shunned as uninhabitable.
While many of the early westward migrants were searching for more secure or lucrative livelihoods, many of the new migrants are leaving behind better jobs and the promise of fast-lane comforts in search of a vague America that may not even exist, an America that seems to grow more distant as the flood of newcomers continues to swell. They want safety, outdoor recreation within minutes of home and something closer to small-town life.
From 1985 to 1991, according to the Census Bureau, nearly two million people moved from other states to the intermountain West -- a region that even with its recent growth has less than 5 percent of the American population. Although they arrived from all over the nation, more came from California than from any other state.
The nation's most populous state with 31.5 million people, California is still growing, but the recent gains have come from a huge influx of international immigrants and a high birth rate. In the one-year period ending last July, the flow of people from state to state resulted in a net loss of 212,000 California residents. The trend is the same this year, as longtime Californians flee the state's stagnant economy and troubled cities.
For more than a decade, Golden State exiles poured into the West Coast's other big cities, primarily Seattle and Portland, Ore. But now the flow reaches farther east, filling an area once labeled the Great American Desert. The intermountain West is growing at a rate twice the national average.
A hundred years ago, when the frontier was pronounced closed by the historian Frederick Jackson Turner, it was said that settlers had pushed to the edge of the Pacific and could go no farther.
Americans have long had a habit of using up communities and abandoning them for something fresh. But virtually no one thought the next frontier, a century after the curtain closed on the unsettled West, would be in the chalk-colored, largely treeless basin that previous migrants had rushed through.
 
Importing Their Pools
 The latest migrants are moving to Nevada, the fastest-growing state in the nation for the last two years; to central Oregon, where sports cars and sidewalks clogged with roller-bladers make the high desert country around the town of Bend look like Santa Monica North on weekends; to Eastern Washington and the cities of Spokane and Richland, where home prices have doubled in three years; to Arizona, which grew by 35 percent over the last decade; to Utah, which boasts of "kidnapping" firms from California and bringing them to the cheap labor haven around the Great Salt Lake, and to southern Idaho, which led the nation in new job growth last year and is expected to do the same this year.
"What I see are people coming for the new frontier: the quality of life that most big cities have lost," said Karen McGee, president of the Pocatello City Council.
But when these newcomers arrive in places like St. George, Utah, or one of the subdivisions around Las Vegas, or even Pocatello, they tend to recreate California-style suburbs, with big lawns, two-car garages, swimming pools and artificial lakes. They also bring some of what they thought they left behind: congestion, soaring home prices and gangs.
On the slopes of this demure city, developers have clawed cul de sacs out of the mountains, the new houses looking west at the backed-up reservoirs of the Snake River and the setting sun. There is even occasional heavy smog, trapped in the colder air of the valley, a common feature in many Rocky Mountain communities set in the draws between mountain ranges.
"The California culture and mentality is sweeping across the West," said Bill Seavey of the Greener Pastures Institute, a Henderson, Nev., consulting firm for the fleeing urbanite. "You can go just about anywhere and see mini-L.A's."
 
The Lures
Seeking Fresh Start In a Simpler Place
 While the Oregon Trail migrants were lured by free land and a fresh start, the desert and mountain states of the West offer cheap property, low housing prices, a virtually tax-free business environment and cooperative local government agencies. And there are things that remain largely unspoken, the low labor costs and lily-white, homogenous neighborhoods.
"We don't advertise the low wages, but that's a big consideration for companies that want to move here," said Alan Porter, a manager with the Idaho Department of Commerce.
Technology, through faxes and computers, has cut the mountain obstacles and desert basins down to size, making it as easy for someone to earn a living on a isolated basalt bluff as an apartment in Century City. Thus, Park City, Utah, a two-hour plane and car commute from Los Angeles, has ballooned with white collar and Hollywood exiles, who maintain homes in Utah and offices in California.
The other historical impediment to settlement, the arid climate, matters less than it used to. Most of the Oregon Trail pioneers were farmers. Today, fewer than 2 percent of all Americans work the land.
Perhaps the biggest surprise in the new migration is Idaho, a place long known for spuds, sage, rattlesnakes and Mormons. Much of the state is desert dry. It is certainly remote, walled in by mountains. It is overwhelmingly white, with fewer than 5,000 blacks among its 1.1 million people. The population centers around Boise and Twin Falls are named in optimism -- Treasure Valley and Magic Valley. People say they move here for the oldest of American reasons: starting over.
 
A Marked Lack of Angst
 "We called ourselves Lewis and Clark when we came up here from California," said Ms. Madden. They first went to northern Idaho, last fall, where a booming tourism industry has taken shape around Lake Coeur d'Alene, an area promoters compare to Lake Tahoe 100 years ago. But the Maddens did not stay. Asked what was wrong with the Idaho Panhandle, Ms. Madden said, "Too many Californians."
One of them, Bill Beck, moved his family from the upper-middle class Southern California suburb of Newport Hills to Boise last year. "The people are friendly," he said. "And the one thing I've really noticed is the lack of free-floating anxiety here. In L.A., it was all around you, from the newspaper telling you about the body count for that weekend to the gangs getting discounts on ammunition."
Mr. Beck said one reason he moved to Idaho was that "I wanted my children to be able to learn how to light a campfire in the rain and saddle a horse." His California home had a view of the Pacific, but he feared for his children's safety, he said, and would not let them play in the front yard.
Despite its license plate slogan of "famous potatoes," Idaho is not much of farm state anymore. Jobs in mining, forestry and agriculture -- the traditional mainstays of the state -- have remained flat or declined over the last decade, while high technology, construction and tourism have soared. The picture is same throughout the West.
In Pocatello, a city of 50,000, the Maddens will soon open a sports bar and restaurant in a historic building that used to hold Federal offices. A bar may seem out of place in this city dominated by the Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints. But when the Maddens arrived at the airport, with their prospect of creating 30 jobs, the Mayor was there to greet them.
 
The Challenges
When Newcomers Bring Their Trouble
 Pocatello, like Boise, Coeur d'Alene and dozens of other mid-sized communities in the intermountain West, has a housing shortage. In fact, all along the old Oregon Trail, home prices are soaring. In Scottsbluff, Neb., where the trail's best-known landmark, Chimney Rock, towers above the plains, Leroy Scofield came in from California earlier this month and bought a three-bedroom brick home for $82,500. He paid cash.
"Housing is hopping like I've never seen it," said Jan Sauer, a Scottsbluff native who sells real estate. "There aren't enough listings to satisfy demand."
There is a particular historical irony in the migration to southern Idaho, where the Oregon Trail came to a fork, the southern route going to California, the northern one on to the Willamette Valley. Those who could read, goes an old Northwest joke, went to Oregon; the rest went to California and put their faith into finding gold in a stream.
Invariably, the earlier migrants described this area as godforsaken, a moonscape with odd inhabitants. They could not fathom trying to live here, though the native people had done quite well for better than 3,000 years.
"It is a melancholy strange-looking country, one of fractures and violence and fire," John C. Fremont said of Idaho in 1843.
"There is some of the largest rattlesnakes in this region I ever saw, being from 8 to 12 feet long," wrote Amelia Hadley in 1851.
"A desolate place, full of thieves," said Lucia Loraine Williams, in 1851, describing Fort Hall, a few miles north of here on the Snake River.
Compare those sentiments to the views expressed by the late 20th century arrivals to Idaho.
Larry Laraway researched communities all over the country, then settled on Boise in the early 1980's when he left California. Looking at demographic trends that showed Americans moving away from the cities and the suburbs as well, he predicted Idaho's boom at a time when people were actually leaving the Gem state.
 
Raising the Drawbridge
 "When I left for Idaho, some people thought I was leaving the country," said Mr. Laraway, who lives with his family on 50 acres just outside of town. "People thought I was wacko. Now, Boise is a byword."
Boise, the biggest city in Idaho with 135,000 residents, added about 15,000 people to its metropolitan area last year, an enormous impact on a city of that size. Schools are bulging. Roads are crowded during new rush hours. The homeless population has surged.
Along the old wagon trail stop in what was once Fort Boise, people are sleeping in cars and parks, left out of the boom. "Right now, every shelter in town is full, people are sleeping in greenbelts and demand for our services are up 140 percent," said Steve Bertoglio, executive director of Boise's Community Contribution Center, which serves the poor.
In 1843, the Oregon Trail migrants were called Overlanders. Today, no matter where they actually came from, new arrivals to the interior West are labeled Californians -- a pejorative in these parts. Perhaps 30 percent of the newcomers to Boise are from California, Idaho state planning experts say, a figure that matches estimates for other growing Western states.
"There's a real drawbridge mentality, keep-em-all-out thing starting to build," said Don Keirn, a special assistant to Mayor Brent Coles of Boise. "The Californians catch the heat for everything."
 
The Changes
The Restrictions Of New Borders
 Mr. Seavey has seen a brisk increase in the number of people that come to his Greener Pastures Institute. Most of his clients are middle-class baby boomers from Southern California, he said, who list crime as the main reason to close the door on the Golden State. Mr. Seavey gives them tips on what to expect in the interior West.
"We tell them to change the license plates right away, don't buy the biggest house on the block, don't flaunt the fact that you're from California," he said. Mr. Seavey is very high on Montana these days and is turning some people away from Boise and Seattle.
To help the transition, Mr. Seavey has set up a network of ex-Californians across the West, who greet newcomers, warn them of peculiar local customs and make them feel at home.
Still, resentment is building along the old Oregon Trail toward the new arrivals spilling in from the coast.
A native of Pocatello, Clark Collins is upset over the political leanings of the transplants. "There is a very popular saying around here: Don't Californicate Idaho," Mr. Collins said
Political analysts believe one reason 7 out of 11 Western states voted Democratic in last year's Presidential campaign was the new demographic shift. Overwhelmingly, people who are moving into Montana, Idaho, Colorado, eastern Oregon and Washington, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona are finding work in jobs unrelated to the traditional timber, mining and agriculture fields.
A poll taker in Oregon, Tim Hibbitts, calls the newcomers "life style refugees" and says they are responsible for a more environmentalist tilt in the electorate.
But even if they come here for clean air, icy trout streams and uncrowded streets, many of the transplants, like the Oregon Trail migrants of last century, are finding out the hard way that this may not be the promised land.
Last year, Boise led the nation in job growth, a 6 percent rise, gaining about 10,000 jobs in the metropolitan area. There are good-paying high-tech jobs at Micron Technology, or Hewlett-Packard, but far more common are $7-an-hour service jobs.
 
'Bit of Repression'
 For those who do find work, the pay can be very low compared to California or other states. Idaho ranks 43d in per capita personal income, with average earnings of $16,067. Montana is 44th with $16,062, and Utah is 49th, with income of $15,355. While it costs far less to live in this region than virtually anywhere else in the country, that situation may not last long if the rise in home prices continues.
There is also a certain intolerance, say some newcomers. A segment of the "Donahue" talk show about the Mormon Church's rituals for women was moved from its regular afternoon slot to a little-noticed period in the middle of the night on Pocatello television. In north Idaho and western Montana, neo-Nazis and white separatists remain active members of the community.
"The insularity can be nice, but there's also a bit of repression," said Dr. Dave Adler, a political science professor at Idaho State University in Pocatello. "If you are not Mormon, your kids can be left out of a lot of social things."
But on balance, the interior West has ingredients of the American dream that most places have lost, said Dr. Adler, who moved here in 1985.
That is certainly true for Bill Beck. He went on a picnic this spring in Boise with family friends, fellow California exiles who have taken root 800 miles inland from the end of the old Oregon Trail.
"We were watching all the kids play in the park, this perfect setting, no threats, and we commented on how this was like America in the 1940's," said Mr. Beck. "There's this desire to return to a simpler, nostalgic life, even though we don't really have any idea what that is."

HEADLINE: ENERGY TAX PLAN TO BE SCALED BACK, MOYNIHAN REPORTS

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee said today that the Clinton Administration and the Senate would scale back the size of the proposed energy tax to ease the burden on business, perhaps by exempting whole industries.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, said the resulting loss of revenue would be offset by additional spending cuts, possibly in Medicare, the Government health program for the elderly. 
 Mr. Moynihan said in an interview that the energy tax would be trimmed to help persuade wavering senators to back the President's deficit-reduction plan and to fulfill promises made to several representatives who agreed to vote with Mr. Clinton as the House narrowly approved the plan on Thursday.
 
Broad Opposition to Plan
 Many lawmakers from farm states and states with large coal, oil and chemical industries dislike the proposed tax, saying it would cost jobs and penalize their states unfairly. The National Association of Manufacturers, the United States Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute have mounted a vigorous lobbying campaign to kill the tax. The changes now envisaged are aimed at defusing industry opposition, several officials said.
Mr. Moynihan said President Clinton had approved plans to scale back the tax. While the Senator declined to say how much the tax would be cut, one prominent Democrat said the reduction was likely to be one-quarter to one-third of the anticipated revenues. The proposed tax had been expected to raise $71 billion over five years.
The Senator said he worked with the President at a meeting on Friday to sort out "a lot of undertakings and understandings reached in negotiations in the House."
 
Impact on Manufacturers
 Mr. Moynihan made clear that the Finance Committee would respond to those understandings by seeking to alter the tax so that it would minimize the burden on manufacturers, who have complained that the proposed tax will push up their costs and make them uncompetitive.
"As regards the energy tax, the direction is very clear," the Senator said. "We want it to have as little impact as possible on the production process. This is a consumption tax, not a production tax."
One senior Democrat in Congress said the proposed tax would not be changed with regard to consumer use -- consumption of gasoline, home heating or electricity used in homes. The Treasury estimates that the tax will cost a family of four earning $40,000 about $200 a year, raising home electricity bills by 4 percent and increasing the price of gasoline at the pump by 7.6 cents a gallon.
But the senior Democrat said whole industries, especially manufacturers facing international competition, might be exempted -- or subject to a much-reduced tax.
The energy tax is perhaps the chief obstacle to Senator Moynihan's locking up a majority for the President's package in the finance committee, where the Democrats hold an 11 to 9 majority.
Two Democratic members of the committee -- John B. Breaux of Louisiana and David L. Boren of Oklahoma -- have vigorously opposed the energy tax, which would be imposed according to the heat content of fuels measured in British thermal units.
"I have to obviously have changes in the B.T.U. tax," Mr. Breaux said in an interview on Friday. "I can't support it as it is. I'd much prefer a straight gasoline tax. But if I can't get that, I'm willing to do what has to be done to minimize the B.T.U. tax."
 
 
Quelling a Mutiny
 Administration officials said they were confident that moves like scaling back the energy tax would insure Mr. Breaux's support for the President's economic package. Mr. Moynihan said, however, that he did not know whether cutting the tax would be enough to win over Mr. Boren, who has led a small but problematic Democratic mutiny against the President's package.
The Los Angeles Times reported today that the Administration planned to abandon most of the B.T.U. tax plan and increase the gasoline tax by 8 cents instead. But Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, denied the report, saying President Clinton was opposed to trading the B.T.U. tax for a gasoline tax. And Mr. Moynihan said a gasoline tax would not pass Congress.
Manufacturers prefer the gasoline tax, but senators from the West are bitterly opposed because of the longer distances many people drive. Ms. Myers said the White House might be willing to adopt a 1- or 2-cent increase in the gasoline tax for a special purpose.
 
 
Possible Medicare Cuts
 Mr. Moynihan refused to discuss what cuts in Medicare his committee would consider. The Congressional Budget Office has outlined several possibilities, including freezing reimbursements to hospitals at current levels and increasing the premiums that wealthier Medicare participants pay for hospitals' and physicians' services.
These latest revisions to the energy tax come after the proposal has already been altered and re-altered in response to intense political and industry pressures.
After complaints from New England senators, the Administration agreed to provide a tax break on home heating oil. To please the steel industry, the Administration agreed to exempt metallurgical coal, and to please farmers, it exempted ethanol, which is made from corn. The House restored the tax for ethanol, but Mr. Moynihan said the Senate would probably exempt it again. The House also exempted diesel fuel and gasoline used in farming.
In negotiations with the House Ways and Means Committee, the Administration agreed to exempt the aluminum industry and the chlorine industry from 50 percent of the tax on their use of electricity.
 
 
Which Should Be Exempt?
 One Congressional official said that after those industries received their exemptions, it was likely that many others would do so as well.
One lawmaker wondered whether all manufacturers, including publishers and candy makers, should be exempted, or just those facing foreign competition. And there were questions about whether just energy used in factories should be exempted or whether energy used in corporate headquarters should also be exempted.
A Treasury official said that in negotiations with House and Senate members the Administration had pledged to push the Senate to make three other changes in the energy tax. Those are to impose the tax on imports of oil products, to rebate payments of the tax on energy-intensive products, like petrochemicals, and not to impose a special tax supplement on the residue left after refining petroleum.

HEADLINE: Tension Surrenders to Relief As Miami Reacts to Verdict

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, May 29

 BODY:
Under sullen gray clouds and an intermittent drizzle, Miami gingerly went about its normal business today, still anxious over reaction to the acquittal of a Hispanic policeman who killed two young black men but relieved that the verdict on Friday had not set off the racial violence that everyone here had feared.
By morning, rage had turned to bitter resignation, even in neighborhoods that erupted in anger on Friday afternoon when a jury in Orlando declared the Miami officer, William Lozano, not guilty of manslaughter. "Sure we're mad -- damn mad," Lee Johnson said as he stood outside a laundry a block from where Mr. Lozano fired a single fatal shot at a 23-year-old motorcyclist on Jan. 16, 1989. "But it's over with, and it don't do no good to stir up the dead." 
 The deaths of the motorcyclist, Clement Lloyd, and his passenger, Allan Blanchard, touched off three nights of rioting that resulted in one death, hundreds of arrests or injuries and millions of dollars in property damage in 1989. It was one of four major racial disturbances in Miami in the 1980's that resulted from confrontations between police officers and members of minority groups.
 
Reflecting Better Lives
 The comparatively calm response to Friday's verdict, which followed an earlier conviction by a Miami jury, was at least partly due to recent economic and political gains by blacks here, public officials and those active in the affairs of the black community said.
Metropolitan Miami's 400,000 black residents now have a greater stake in the health of the city, they said, thanks to increased black representation on the Dade County Commission and the success of a three-year black tourist boycott that ended when local business leaders agreed to increase economic assistance and job opportunities for blacks.
"All of that is something that people can point to as a tangible change," said James Burke, one of four blacks elected earlier this year to a new, 13-member county commission. "These are things that weren't here even a year ago that can have an impact on your life, and they've made a difference in terms of how people have reacted to the verdict."
Ever since the riots that followed the acquittals in the first trial of four white Los Angeles police officers accused of beating Rodney G. King, black ministers and community leaders here, with the support of the police, have been working Miami's streets. Talking to residents about the progress of the Lozano case at meetings and impromptu gatherings on street corners, they discussed the possibility of an acquittal and stressed the need to remain calm.
That groundwork now appears to be paying off. "The people are mad as hell," said Garth Reeves, publisher of The Miami Times, the city's leading black newspaper. "They think they got snookered in the courtroom. But the ministers did a lot of work in the community. People realized it didn't make a lot of sense to wreck and burn our own neighborhoods."
 
Show of Force
 Residents of black neighborhoods said they were also encouraged by the announcement by United States Attorney Roberto Martinez on Friday evening, shortly after the verdict was delivered, that the Federal Government would investigate the case to see if Mr. Lozano had committed a civil rights offense.
"He may have gotten off this time," said Ronald Bowles, who lives a block from where the fatal shot was fired. "But just like in the Rodney King case, there's still a chance for justice to be done."
But Mr. Burke, the chairman of the public safety committee of the county commission, said the decision to send large numbers of police officers into the streets in a show of force had also played an important role in keeping the peace. "People have seen police cars before," he said. "But when there are 12 cars for a little disturbance, that's an indication they were not going to let things go but would apply control immediately."
Throughout the city's three largest black neighborhoods -- Overtown, Liberty City and Coconut Grove -- those security measures grew visibly more relaxed as the day wore on without further signs of violence. Police still blanketed the three areas, but the barricades that were set up Friday afternoon to prevent movement in and out of the areas were being taken down this morning, and city, county and state police were no longer wearing riot gear. Exits from Interstate 95 that had been closed were reopened today.
The National Guard units that Gov. Lawton Chiles activated earlier in the week were nowhere to be seen. But a spokesman for the Guard said the 300 troops remained on standby at an armory here, ready for deployment if needed.
 
'They Should Be Proud'
 Bill Knighton, a Miami police officer on duty today in the heart of Overtown, said he was being approached by residents who complimented him on the restraint being shown by the police. "My return statement to them," he said, "has been that they are doing a great job in keeping the peace, that they should be proud of the way they are handling this."
At Olinda Park, in the heart of Liberty City, Little League teams were playing their usual Saturday morning baseball games. And H. T. Smith, the lawyer who organized the boycott and is one of the city's most prominent blacks, felt confident enough about the city's calm reaction to take time for a game of golf today.
Mr. Smith said the emergence of certain "oases of hope" in black areas, including the recent $50 million renovation of public housing projects, had helped prevent a recurrence of rioting. "For the first time in 25 years, the ceilings don't leak and the rats don't run the place," he said.
"Let's be honest," he added. "The rain helped."
 
62 Arrests After Verdict
 By this evening, police said 62 people had been arrested in connection with outbreaks of violence that followed the announcement of the verdict. Ray Lang, a spokesman for the Miami City Police Department, said most of the arrests were for looting in two parts of the city or for disturbing the peace.
"It was not very many arrests at all compared to what we have had in the past," Mr. Lang said.
The Community Relations Board, a county agency, joined black clergymen in calling for a march on Wednesday afternoon from the site of the shooting to protest the verdict. Organizers of the demonstration took to the radio to appeal to people of all races to join them, urging residents to "vent your emotions and state your feelings in a dignified way."
A coalition of ministers is also planning to hold a job fair on Tuesday at the Miami Arena on the edge of Overtown, at which 2,000 jobs will be available. But Overtown residents said they had seen such flurries of attention after other racial crises, adding that they hoped that this time there would be a continuous effort to help them improve their lives.
"Every time something like this happens, they pave the roads and give us a bunch of temporary six-month jobs," said Tony Jackson. "That's bull. We need real jobs and for the real problems to be answered."

HEADLINE: Clinton Mends Military Fences At West Point

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST POINT, N.Y., May 29

 BODY:
Seeking to quell simmering doubts within the American military about his leadership, President Clinton assured the graduating class of West Point today that when it comes to cutting the military budget "there is a limit beyond which we must not go."
But the President also could not resist getting in a plug for his budget plans, cautioning the 1,003 members of the United States Military Academy class of 1993 that "just as our security cannot rest on a hollow army, neither can it rest upon a hollow economy."
 
Speech Warmly Received
 Standing erect in a cool morning breeze, moving stiffly, and keeping a somber look on his face at all times, Mr. Clinton seemed to be trying to strike just the right demeanor for a Commander in Chief as he delivered his remarks, which were warmly received by the cadets and their families. 
 "The changes of recent years allow us to be hopeful," Mr. Clinton told the cadets. "But common sense reminds us to be prepared. One way we must be prepared is by insuring that our forces have what they need to get the job done -- the equipment and the quality people needed to insure that we can achieve decisive victory should we be called to battle once again."
"The budget cuts that have come at the end of the cold war were necessary, even welcome, appropriate in light of the collapse of the Soviet Union and other changes," Mr. Clinton continued. "But we must be mindful, even as we try so hard to reduce this terrible national deficit, that there is a limit beyond which we must not go. We have to insure that the United States is ready, ready to win and superior to all other military forces in the world."
Many cadets said there was a certain degree of tension and wariness about the President's visit before Mr. Clinton arrived. His legacy of having avoided the Vietnam draft, his reduction of the military, his support for homosexuals in the armed forces, and rumors that uniformed officers were made to feel unwelcome by some White House staff had left many at West Point curious about Mr. Clinton at best and resentful at worst, cadets said.
But his speech and tour of West Point barracks seemed to go a long way toward dispelling some of that. The cadets and their families gave the President a standing ovation for his remarks, and many said later that maybe he was not quite the anti-military 1960's radical they had imagined.
"I had this impression before that maybe he didn't see the military as a real American institution," said Cadet Bradley Helton, 20. "It is kind of a strange thing for us -- his generation and how they related to the military. But I think he came across really well today. He showed respect for the past in his remarks. I was surprised. It was reassuring. Look, all of us want to see the President do well because we want to see the country do well."
 
Top Marks for Haircuts
 Mr. Clinton seemed to endear himself most to the audience with some self-deprecating humor and self-criticism. Looking out on the sea of closely cropped cadets, he began his address by remarking, "You have met high standards for discipline, for physical fitness, for academics, and I must say, I am impressed by your haircuts."
That line received huge applause and seemed to cut some of the tension in the air at Michie Stadium, as did Mr. Clinton's comment that, "No one is perfect, as even the President demonstrates from time to time."
Cadet Jeffery Sutton, who is 18, said: "It is kind of neat for him to make a joke about the haircut thing. He said, 'Hey, I make mistakes.' For me to see him do that makes him likable to me over all. It was kind of tense before he came, people were really wondering about him. It was good to see him step up to it and say, 'I may not be the best military man for the job, but I'm going to do the graduation.' "
After the commencement speech, Mr. Clinton mingled with the cadets and their parents. He was swarmed by outstretched hands and voices yelling "Hang in there."
Today's appearance at West Point is part of a blitz by the President to try to overcome his uneasy relations with many in the military by addressing them head on. On Monday he will speak at a Memorial Day service at the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, despite protests by some Vietnam veterans that he should not come at all.
Economics, not military strategy, seemed uppermost in the President's mind today. He pointed out to the cadets and their families gathered in the stadium bleachers that "what ultimately enabled us to prevail in the cold war was the simple fact that our free political and economic institutions had produced more prosperity and more personal human happiness than did the confining institutions of Communism."
 
Assures Cadets on Cuts
 Mr. Clinton's budget calls for trimming the defense budget -- by reducing troops, closing bases and restructuring the armed forces to smaller, more mobile units -- by $88 billion more over the next five years than proposed by the Bush Administration. But just a few words from Mr. Clinton that he understood that there was a limit beyond which he could not cut seemed to ease the minds of the young cadets now going off to serve in the field.
"There was a lot of concern that we were cutting back too far and too fast," Cadet Samuel Amber said. "He really reassured us that nothing drastic will happen. It shows me that after the first 100 days he is adjusting."
Cadet Tony Renne, said that in his view Mr. Clinton would still have "to work a little harder to overcome some of the doubts."
"But I think his presence here, talking to military people -- that's good," he added. "I think now more than before he is starting to realize that there is genuine place for the military."
Cadet Layne Phillips said Mr. Clinton took her by surprise with his remarks.
"It is reassuring to hear it from him," she said. But she quickly added with the wariness of one who has heard a few speakers from Washington tell the military what it wants to hear, "We'll see what happens now."
There was one cheer for Mr. Clinton, though, that was definitely unreserved. It came from the upper decks of Michie Stadium, where all the underclassmen were sitting in their dress white uniforms. It erupted when Mr. Clinton announced that as Commander in Chief he was ordering an "amnesty" for disciplinary actions resulting from all minor violations of cadet rules like tardiness or messy rooms. The Clinton amnesty, a tradition of visiting Presidents, forgives the "walking tours" that require cadets to march back and forth for a specified number of hours while wearing their dress uniforms and carrying rifles.

HEADLINE: Man in the News;
A Master of the Image: David Richmond Gergen

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
Back in March, when Bill Clinton seemed to be riding more or less high, David R. Gergen, the master salesman, sat on the sidelines and marveled at the cleverness of the new President's marketing plan.
"It is clear now, in contrast to how Clinton presented himself during the campaign, that the Democrats' true agenda is to reverse the direction set by Ronald Reagan," said Mr. Gergen, who was the White House communications director in Mr. Reagan's first term. "And the irony is that they are attempting to do this by using the same techniques Reagan used." 
 In that interview the man who was a senior adviser to three Republican Presidents said of the Clinton political operators: "They understand what Reagan understood. They have grasped the essential point that a Presidency attempting change is a campaign, and you have to work it like a campaign."
But the Clinton Administration's "permanent campaign" proved infinitely less successful than the Reagan machine. Where the Reagan White House was a vault of secrets, the Clinton Administration leaks like a Congressional committee. Where the Reagan operation seemed to stage with ease propaganda coups like Nancy Reagan's interruption of a televised Presidential appearance to "surprise" her husband with a birthday cake, the Clinton operation has reeled from one public-relations disaster to another.
Now, proving anew that the abiding faith of this city is neither Republicanism nor Democratism, but Inside-ism, the 51-year-old Mr. Gergen has signed on as counselor to President Clinton, a role in which Mr. Gergen will shape the Administration's effort to reverse the very policies that he once sold for President Reagan.
Mr. Gergen describes his new job in a way that makes it sound vaguely but powerfully defined, more so even than when he was Mr. Reagan's communications director.
"When they approached me, they said they were looking for someone who will be at the intersection of policy and politics and communication," he said today in a telephone interview.
Unlike his role in the Reagan White House, Mr. Gergen said, he expects his new job to include contributions on all matters of policy, domestic and foreign. "In the Reagan Administration, I was not, for instance, in the loop on national security," he said. "Here they have assured me that I will be in the loop across the board on policy and thinking through how that policy fits in with everything else."
Mr. Gergen's transition caught many politicians flat footed, but not, of course, Mr. Gergen. Today, as always, he had the spin ready, and Gergen on Gergen was as smooth as Gergen on Reagan ever was or Gergen on Clinton promises to be.
 
Republican? Not Me
 "I'm not a Republican," he said. "I've always been a registered independent. I grew up in North Carolina as a Democrat, and I didn't even know any Republicans until I was 21."
Mr. Gergen said that he was "of course" aware that some Republicans would now accuse him of disloyalty and opportunism but that he was willing to accept that.
"Some on the far right wrote me off a long time ago, back in the Reagan years, and rightfully so," he said. "They knew I was not a deep conservative. I never tried to masquerade as a strong conservative. But do I think I'll take some hits from the right? Sure. And the President will take some hits from the left."
Asked about his observation that the Clinton Administration was seeking to reverse the direction set by President Reagan, Mr. Gergen said he believed that "in some areas they are trying to undo some aspects of the Reagan period."
"Let me make it clear," he added, "that I am proud that I worked for Ronald Reagan. He did a great deal for this country: brought inflation down, won the cold war, created a lot of jobs. But there were also things that were not addressed in the 1980's such as the pressing social problems and the declining standard of living for the middle class, and I think those things need to be undone."
On the defining difference between the Reagan and Clinton philosophies, Mr. Gergen said he had talked to Mr. Clinton about his economic program and felt "reasonably comfortable" that "he does not consider himself a tax-and-spend Democrat."
On other policies, Mr. Gergen said, "there are many things he is doing that I find strike a positive chord with me: national service, reinventing Government, welfare reform."
 
Not So Much an Ideologue
 Mr. Gergen's decision is in keeping with a career defined more by pragmatic than ideological concerns. Although he has been a senior adviser to three Presidents -- Richard M. Nixon, Gerald Ford and Mr. Reagan -- Mr. Gergen has always been regarded -- and he regards himself -- as more of a facilitator than an ideologue, more of a man in the middle than of the right.
He made his decision to quit the Reagan White House after infighting with the press secretary, Larry Speakes, and amid accusations from conservatives that he, along with the chief of staff, James A. Baker 3d, was not truly committed to the conservative agenda.
Since leaving the White House, Mr. Gergen has followed a path that is as close to the center as is possible. He has worked, simultaneously, as a fellow at the conservative-dominated American Enterprise Institute and the liberal-dominated John F. Kennedy School at Harvard University. He has been on the boards of bipartisan commissions and directs a domestic-policy group formed by the Aspen Institute whose co-chairmen are Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, and William J. Bennett, the Education Secretary in Republican Administrations.
As an editor and columnist for U.S. News & World Report and as a commentator on "The MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour" since 1987, Mr. Gergen has adopted a balanced tone. In a recent column he chided Mr. Clinton for "lurching to the left," but also said the President could prove himself "a hall of famer."
 
Influential Memo of 1980
 In a sense, Mr. Gergen was destined for his new job. It was his "100 days" memorandum in 1980 that shaped the communications-driven Reagan Administration and that Clinton advisers studied in the transition.
Much of what worked for Mr. Reagan was designed by Mr. Gergen, who helped devise techniques that have become cliches, frequent "warm and fuzzy" public events to shape a video image of the President that would override often critical verbal television reports, "spin patrols" to work with the press just before evening deadlines to put a positive turn on White House news and the disciplined hewing to a "message of the day."
Mr. Gergen lives in McLean, Va., with his wife, Anne, and their children, Christopher, 22, a senior at Duke University, and Katherine, 19, a first-year student at Yale University.
He has spent most of his adult life practicing, in one form or another, the craft of selling others on a point of view. He is good at it, a soft but sure-footed talker, who carries his 6-foot-5-inch frame with a loose-limbed casualness that manages to suggest impressiveness without intimidation.
 
Entering Republican Politics
 David Richmond Gergen was born on May 9, 1942, in Durham, N.C. He graduated from Yale in 1963 and Harvard Law School in 1967. He served in the Navy for three and a half years before gravitating into Republican politics as a full-time occupation.
As a speechwriter for Mr. Nixon, and as the scriptwriter for the Republican National Convention in 1972, Mr. Gergen formulated an understanding that in the video age defining the television message meant defining the national debate.
"We wanted to control what people saw, to the extent that we could," he said in an interview with Hedrick Smith for his book on Washington, "The Power Game." "We wanted to shape it and not let television shape it."
When Mr. Reagan was President and Mr. Gergen was stage manager, the answer to that question was clear. Now, Mr. Gergen returns to the orchestra pit amid Mr. Clinton's hopes that the old skills linger and the old magic still works.

HEADLINE: Japan and China to Discuss Asian Security

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 29

 BODY:
Japan and China, responding to increased tensions in the Asian-Pacific area, agreed today to begin talks on regional security issues.
Foreign Minister Kabun Muto of Japan proposed the new dialogue at a three-hour meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, who is on a four-day visit to Tokyo. 
 "The talks will be aimed at strengthening our bilateral ties and contributing to the stability of the Asian-Pacific region," a Foreign Ministry spokesman quoted Mr. Muto as saying.
However, Mr. Qian made clear that China believed it premature to consider setting up regional structures to discuss broader security matters, the spokesman said.
Mr. Muto said the talks might begin as early as July and would include senior Foreign Ministry and possibly Defense Ministry officials of both countries.
The spokesman said that the Foreign Ministers agreed on the need to prevent nuclear weapons from spreading to the Korean peninsula and that they hoped upcoming talks between the United States and North Korea would prove successful.
North Korea caused alarm in Japan and elsewhere in March when it announced that it was pulling out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
China, Pyongyang's major ally, has urged dialogue, not pressure, to help resolve the North Korean nuclear issue and opposes international economic sanctions against North Korea.

HEADLINE: U.S. Scientists Baffled by an Epidemic in Cuba

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

 BODY:
Scientists sent to Cuba to investigate an epidemic of a disease that impairs vision and damages nerves say they are baffled about its cause and the reason the number of cases has risen to 34,000 from nearly 26,000 a month ago.
Although some experts in the United States had said the epidemic appeared to have been caused by a vitamin deficiency, laboratory tests have not established any environmental, genetic, nutritional, infectious or toxicological cause for the epidemic, the Pan American Health Organization said in a statement last week. 
 After returning from a week in Cuba, Dr. Paul W. Brown, a virologist and epidemiologist from the National Institutes of Health, said in an interview, "Nothing has been proven and nothing has been excluded."
The health group said it was sending more experts to Cuba to help solve the mystery of the disease, which is not fatal and sometimes improves or disappears spontaneously. A toxicologist from the University of Oregon, Dr. Peter Spencer, left for Cuba this weekend, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta are to send a team of epidemiologists.
Researchers plan additional tests to explore a wide variety of causes, including the slim chance that it is a new disease, possibly due to a new virus. No cases have been reported outside Cuba.
The international scientists and Cuban doctors agree that there is an epidemic, Dr. Brown said. But its size and scope are uncertain, in part because it has been difficult to sort through the eye and nervous system problems that Cuban doctors have been treating to determine which are truly part of the epidemic and which are due to other serious disorders.
Many patients have only impaired vision. Others have pain or a pins-and-needles sensation in the feet and hands due to damaged peripheral nerves. Still others have a combined form of the disease. The eye symptoms seem to be decreasing and the nerve damage now seems to be the engine driving the epidemic, Dr. Brown said.
Many patients suffer weight loss, headaches, dizziness and frequent urination in the early part of the illness.
The disease has primarily affected men from 20 to 60 years old. But Cuban doctors say that the disease is beginning to affect women and children. It is not known to what extent the case total has risen because of a new effort to detect cases. Also, there have been some cases in which doctors have not found physical evidence to explain patients' symptoms.
President Fidel Castro is concerned about preventing panic over the disease, Dr. Brown said.
Dr. Brown said he saw no evidence of widespread malnutrition despite the economic hardships Cuba is undergoing. "The way the epidemic is moving, it does not look to us like a vitamin deficiency," he added.
The only factor in favor of vitamin deficiency is that many patients who have received intravenous injections of vitamins have improved. But Dr. Brown said the connection could be a coincidence, because laboratory tests did not confirm a deficiency of B or other vitamins. Some patients have recovered on their own without vitamin therapy, Dr. Brown said.
Last week, experts from Columbia University's medical school in New York who also went to Cuba said they believed that the disease was due to a deficiency of the vitamin B complex.
Another researcher who went to Cuba to aid in dealing with the epidemic, Dr. Alfredo Sadun of the University of Southern California, said he believed that it was due to a deficiency of another vitamin, folic acid, and to toxins in home-brewed rum.
Dr. Brown said the Cuban scientists working on the epidemic were very capable and were facing formidable difficulties in trying to solve the mystery. One puzzle is why the number of cases seems to have risen suddenly this year to several hundred a week from 25 a month last year.
The epidemiological pattern points more to an infectious agent than anything else, but the scientists do not know what microbe might be causing the disease, Dr. Brown said.

HEADLINE: Cuts Force Review of War Strategies

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
Wrestling with how to maintain the United States' military commitments with a shrinking budget, the Pentagon is moving toward a new strategy in which the military would no longer plan to fight two major wars at once but instead would seek to fight them in turn.
This would be the second time since the end of the cold war that the United States has recast its military strategy. 
 Under the new approach, which is being reviewed at the highest levels of the Pentagon, if conflicts broke out at the same time in two regions, military force would be used decisively to win one war while air power and a limited number of ground forces would be used to hold the line in another.
After the first war was won, the United States would shift its forces to win a second victory, a strategy Pentagon officials have dubbed "win-hold-win."
 
No Final Decision
 The sequential approach to warfare, which was developed as part of a review begun by Defense Secretary Les Aspin to reshape the American military, is intended to allow the United States to cut additional aircraft carriers, Army divisions and Air Force air wings while asserting that it is not retreating from its military commitments abroad.
The emerging approach marks a departure from the Bush Administration's strategy that the United States needs forces and weapons to fight two large regional wars at the same time, a decision it reached after the demise of the Soviet Union led Washington to redirect its military planning.
Vernon Guidry, Mr. Aspin's spokesman, acknowledged that the change in strategy was being considered but said the Defense Secretary had made no final decision.
The Secretary, Mr. Guidry said, "will consult with other members of the national security team before presenting recommendations to the President."
 
The Favored Approach
 But Pentagon officials, who asked not to be named, said that the "win-hold-win" strategy was emerging as the favored approach to cope with the continuing turmoil in the world, avoid the perception that the United States is retreating from its role as a world leader and enable the Clinton Administration to make big cuts in military spending.
After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the possibility of conflicts in trouble spots around the world has become the major issue for Pentagon planners. Judgments about the number of regional dangers the Pentagon needs to be prepared to confront simultaneously are what "really shapes and sizes the defense budget," Mr. Aspin said in March.
Even in the wake of the Persian Gulf war, President Saddam Hussein's forces present a threat to the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq and to the Persian Gulf countries.
North Korea has worried Western powers by deciding to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Gen. Robert W. RisCassi, the departing commander of American forces in South Korea, recently told Congress that he was "increasingly concerned that North Korea could slide into an attack as an uncontrollable consequence of total desperation or internal instability."
 
A 'Bottom-Up Review'
 Several thousand American troops are still stationed in Somalia. Though the Clinton Administration has ruled out the use of ground troops to stop the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina, American warplanes are preparing to provide air cover for "safe havens" there and the United States would send at least 28,000 Army and Marine troops to police a settlement if the Bosnian Serbs ever agree to the peace plan negotiated by Lord Owen and Cyrus R. Vance, according to NATO plans.
To decide what forces and weapons are needed to meet potential threats to United States security, Mr. Aspin has begun a "bottom-up review."
In a confidential memo to Mr. Aspin, Frank G. Wisner, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, summed up the problem Pentagon officials are confronting in the review as "less funds, more dangers."
To achieve a political consensus on restructuring the armed forces, Mr. Wisner wrote, the Defense Secretary and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, need to stand "shoulder to shoulder on basic positions."
To develop options for restructuring the armed forces, General Powell was asked to devise alternatives, and his staff has outlined three basic approaches. Underlying the review is the assumption that the United States will seek to use force decisively and to avoid the use of nuclear weapons.
 
The Bush Approach
 One option would seek to maintain the United States' capability to fight two major regional wars at the same time. It would maintain the military forces generally at current levels, establishing a force of 12 Navy aircraft carriers, 12 Army divisions and 24 Air Force active and reserve tactical air wings.
The Bush Administration favored this basic approach, arguing that it was needed to deter a potential aggressor from starting trouble while the United States was waging a war elsewhere.
"The question is if we did something like the Persian Gulf war and the North Koreans took advantage of that, we had to be able to fight two wars," recalled Zalmay M. Khalilzad, the director of the Pentagon's office of policy planning during the Bush Administration. "Otherwise, it might invite a second crisis."
But this approach is widely regarded as unrealistic because of planned reductions in military spending. And some military specialists say that even the force the Bush Administration was planning would have been hard pressed to fight two major wars at once because of limitations in the number of aircraft and ships to carry weapons and troops.
 
Plan Could Be Modified
 The Persian Gulf war, for example, strained the United States transport capabilities to the limit. Nearly every Air Force plane capable of dropping laser-guided bombs was dispatched to the gulf, and two-thirds of the Marines' combat troops were sent there.
The second option prepared by General Powell's staff is the "win-hold-win." Though the numbers of the forces might be modified, this approach is favored by some high-ranking officials because it would enable the Clinton Administration to assert that it was maintaining the capability to fight more than one war while cutting military spending.
Under this approach, if the United States was fighting a war in the Middle East and North Korea attacked South Korea, the United States would rely on air power and a limited number of ground forces to hold the line on the Korean peninsula until the Middle East war was over. Then force would be decisively applied against North Korea.
As outlined by General Powell's staff, the "win-hold-win" strategy would require 10 aircraft carriers, 10 Army divisions, 20 Air Force air wings and 100 "deployable" bombers that are used for nonnuclear attacks. The actual number of bombers would be higher because of maintenance and training requirements.
 
The Navy's Case
 This runs counter to the Navy's case that it needs to keep 12 aircraft carriers. Seeking to justify a 12-carrier force, the Navy has argued that the number of carriers should be based not just on the number needed to fight regional wars but on the number needed to maintain a regular presence in trouble spots in the Mediterranean Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Pacific.
The third option outlined by General Powell's staff would enable the United States to fight only one major regional war at a time while also undertaking small-scale relief operations and peacekeeping operations. This option would entail the deepest cuts. It calls for a force of 8 aircraft carriers, 8 Army divisions and 16 tactical air wings.
But this option is generally regarded as unacceptable because it entails too many military risks and because it would open up the Democrats to the charge that they were weakening the nation's military.
Lawrence J. Korb, a senior Pentagon official during the Reagan Administration, said the Defense Department had no choice but to cut the number of carriers, divisions and air wings, given the Clinton Administration's decision to cut military spending by 21 percent through 1998 after inflation is taken into account.
"There is no way they can keep the current force structure," Mr. Korb said. "I think if you don't do 'win-hold-win' you are basically abdicating your military superpower status."
But Loren B. Thompson, the deputy director of national security studies at Georgetown University, called the concept "exceedingly optimistic."
"It presumes that a relatively small amount of force can be used to maintain a position until a larger force can be brought to bear," he said. "What in strategic planning is 'win-hold-win' in actual experience may be 'win-lose-recover.' "
 
Air Force Backs Plan
 While the Navy objects to the proposed cuts in aircraft carriers, the "win-hold-win" approach appears to have general support from the Air Force. Air power would be critical, not only to winning a major regional war, but to holding the line in a simultaneous conflict.
The Marines, who have been vying with the Army for the role of primary quick reaction force, are likely to use the concept to justify a sizable Marine Corps. The "win-hold-win" strategy appears to depend greatly on the Marines' ability to deploy troops rapidly in a crisis.
A senior military official said that the success of the "win-hold-win" approach would depend not only on the total number of forces but also on the Administration's commitment to maintain financing for training, operations and maintenance and other accounts that make the military ready to fight.
"The dilemma is there are more requirements than there are capabilities to accomplish them," he said. "We have not found a way to bring that into line yet."

HEADLINE: China Denounces Terms of Clinton's Trade Deal

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 29

 BODY:
The Government responded today to President Clinton's one-year renewal of China's trade privileges with a harsh denunciation of the conditions he said he would impose on a further extension next year.
Mr. Clinton renewed the low-tariff trade benefits, known as most-favored-nation status, on Friday, while conditioning another renewal a year from now on improvements in China's human rights situation and progress in other areas including prison labor and nuclear proliferation. 
 These conditions brought an expression of anger from Beijing, although there were signs that leaders here were secretly relieved that the terms were relatively mild.
"The Chinese Government hereby expresses its strong opposition to the U.S. move and lodges a protest with the U.S. Government," China said in a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry. "If the U.S. side should insist on its way, it can only seriously impair Sino-U.S. relations and their economic and trade cooperation, which eventually will hurt the vital interests of the United States."
"Any attempt to impose one's way on others will go nowhere," the statement added. "We hope that the U.S. Government will size up the situation, change its course and correct its erroneous practice on the M.F.N. issue."
But while Chinese leaders would have preferred not to have any conditions, it became clear months ago that conditions were going to be imposed and that the real question was what kind.
A Chinese newspaper, China Daily, appeared to express the mood in the Government in a front-page report today saying that senior Chinese trade officials expressed "guarded pleasure" over Mr. Clinton's announcement.
"We welcome his wise decision," an unnamed trade official told the China Daily.
 
Hint of Relief
 A hint of this relief came through in what the statement omitted: there was no reference to retaliation. In the past, China has said that if the United States ends most-favored-nation status, it would retaliate by raising tariffs on American products entering China.
Despite their private feelings of relief, the leaders apparently felt obliged to protest formally at the conditions, which they say are an invasion of Chinese internal affairs. They say the conditions also violate the three Chinese-American agreements that are the basis for bilateral relations.
The Chinese authorities have been lobbying hard in recent months to win an extension of most-favored-nation status. They sent buying missions to the United States and also released several well-known political prisoners.

HEADLINE: Amid a Job Shortage, Why Send Work Abroad?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Regarding "In a Shaky Economy, Even Professionals Are 'Temps,' " (May 16), I have been placing software specialists on a temporary basis for five years. One of the more satisfying aspects of my work is helping talented professionals find work in today's struggling economy. However, there are just not enough jobs to go around. Therefore, it troubles me greatly when I read that a company like UNUM hires temporary workers from India because it is cheaper. I don't applaud companies that run their businesses on American soil but farm out the valuable jobs to workers overseas. Companies like UNUM need to be educated about the value of American workers. Otherwise, they will continue to hamper the economic recovery.

HEADLINE: Ross Whines, Bill Wins

 BODY:
His economic plan is hardly out of the woods, but Bill Clinton's narrow victory in the House last week gave a new sense of direction to his floundering Presidency and provided a road map for the difficult journey ahead. The victory will not silence critics like Ross Perot, who is again cluttering the airwaves with cheap shots safely fired from distant sound stages. But it certainly gives the lie, at the least for now, to Mr. Perot's claim that he alone can end gridlock.
There was a lot on the line Thursday, including Mr. Clinton's political reputation. The question was whether a man who'd been wrong-footing himself at every turn could summon the energy to save his budget plan -- the centerpiece of an economic strategy that would surely have crashed, perhaps taking his Presidency with it, had the Republicans prevailed. 
 The vote was also a test of his party's credibility as a governing force, given the dominant role the voters had awarded the Democrats in both the White House and Congress last November.
The President and his party passed these tests. Thomas Foley and the rest of the House Democratic leadership, often chided in this space for spinelessness, whipped their people into line. For his part, Mr. Clinton showed there are things that a governor of a small state learns that are useful in Washington. Legislators require a combination of stroking and bullying, and Mr. Clinton -- hitherto a reluctant warrior -- used both to good advantage.
The House vote does not guarantee success in the Senate, where the political mathematics are less favorable. So while he's still in combat mode, Mr. Clinton should open up on two fronts. It is time to take on Senator Bob Dole's reflexive opposition politics, making the point as loudly and publicly as he can that Mr. Dole has yet to offer an acceptable prescription for fixing the economy. It is also time to take on David Boren, the senior Senator from Oklahoma who's now acting like the senior Senator from Big Oil, giving higher priority to tax protection for the oil companies than to the deficit.
Mr. Clinton's triumph neither erases nor excuses the gaffes that have led him to invite David Gergen, a veteran communications expert from the Republican years, to join his White House team. These fumbles included several dubious appointments, the botched stimulus plan, his wobbling on campaign financing reform and the optical nightmares produced by the callous treatment of the White House transportation staff and the now-legendary $200 haircut.
But it certainly showed what a determined President can do when he gets himself and his staff on the same page. It also provided a timely rebuttal to Mr. Perot, who's been describing Mr. Clinton's executive skills as barely adequate for a middle-management job in a medium-sized company.
Speaking of Mr. Perot, his most recent media blitz reinforces his reputation as the world's premier back-seat driver -- full of advice but in no danger of actually taking the wheel. Back in 1992, Mr. Perot earned great credit -- and 19 percent of the vote -- for concentrating the nation's mind on the budget deficit, and also for his consistent call for campaign reform and stricter control on lobbyists.
But it soon emerged that despite a gift for folksy metaphor, Mr. Perot was essentially a phony populist whose main idea was to buy down the Reagan-Bush deficits with a 50-cent gasoline tax. Further, he had no stomach whatever for the hard decisions he urged on others. Having enlisted an army of eager followers, he cut and ran rather than risk the consequences of political daring. His new group, United We Stand America, still suffers from the memory of that betrayal and from Mr. Perot's authoritarian style.
Mr. Perot's basic M.O. was to tease, tantalize, talk. It still is. When NBC's Bryant Gumbel tried to pin him down the other morning on spending cuts, Mr. Perot said, "If I had known you wanted them, I would have brought my charts."
He also continues to promote the phony notion that business leadership is directly transferable to politics. And he suffers from the illusion that governing a big, messy democracy is as simple as running a tidy little company that he controls.
It is not. Politics is a complex enterprise, inviting abuse and embarrassment and requiring a thick skin, imagination, a talent for timely compromise and, above all, the very thing so conspicuously absent from Mr. Perot's psyche: the ability to turn one's convictions into a coherent program of action.
Mr. Clinton, after four somnambulant months, appears to be awakening to these necessities.

HEADLINE: On China: Mr. Clinton Keeps Faith

 BODY:
President Clinton has now given Chinese leaders notice that their trading privileges with the U.S. will depend directly on their respect for internationally recognized human rights. He thus keeps faith not only with his campaign commitments but with America's responsibility to millions of Chinese who want to see political freedom keep up with the rapid pace of economic change.
U.S. trade pressure won't turn Beijing's lifelong Leninists into Jeffersonian democrats, but it will maximize Washington's leverage over Chinese conditions. And it will put America's economic weight behind the struggles of those Chinese most sympathetic to American values -- students, intellectuals, workers and ordinary citizens of cities like Beijing, many of whom still suffer the consequences of the repression that began in Tiananmen Square four years ago this week. 
 The nearly $20 billion surplus China enjoys in its trade with the U.S. far exceeds that with any other trading partner. This hard-currency surplus helps fuel China's economic reform program, giving Washington significant leverage. But under George Bush, the leverage was deliberately kicked away.
Mr. Bush's repeated vetoes of Congressional attempts to enact conditions on Beijing's trading privileges encouraged Chinese leaders to treat American diplomacy with contempt. They betrayed their own promises on a variety of issues and cruelly toyed with the lives of political prisoners. The one time the White House flexed its muscles, over purely commercial grievances, China quickly acceded to American wishes. Surely prisoners of conscience deserve as much American effort as intellectual property rights do.
Mr. Clinton's executive order spells out realistic conditions Beijing must meet for the Secretary of State to recommend extension of trading privileges beyond July 1994. The Chinese must insure that no prison labor is used on products exported to the United States, take steps to account for and release people imprisoned for "non-violent expression of their political and religious beliefs" and assure that prisoners are being treated humanely, for example by allowing International Red Cross visits.
The order also calls on the Secretary to insure that China abides by its commitment not to discriminate against U.S. businesses and adheres to international treaties governing the transfer of missile technologies and nuclear materials.
Most of these conditions involve keeping promises China has already made. And they give the Secretary of State, and ultimately the President, needed flexibility to determine whether Chinese actions go far enough to justify further renewal of trading privileges.
China's first reaction has been relatively mild. But it may still refuse to take meaningful steps. In that case, its trading privileges will be canceled next year, if not by the Administration, then by Congress. But it needn't come to that. The Administration's conditions are reasonable and attainable. Best of all, by keeping faith with American principles, they honor America's highest interests.

HEADLINE: In Another Part of the Balkans, Resorts Are Empty

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OPATIJA, Croatia

 BODY:
The war is a good 100 miles down the coast from this sleepy Adriatic resort, a fact that seems almost too obvious to mention to Marko Zoricic, Opatija's long-suffering chief of tourism.
"Look at me," pleads Mr. Zoricic, otherwise a portrait in leisure as he lounges in deck shoes and tennis shirt on the terrace of a nearly deserted seaside hotel. "Am I wearing a gun on my hip? Do I have a knife clenched between my teeth?" 
 And yet, Mr. Zoricic laments, only a smattering of tourists are here -- a couple of buses from Austria, a handful of Britons, some Dutch senior citizens. Despite an intensive campaign by Government ministers in Zagreb and hotel keepers to convince foreign travelers that this part of Croatia, anyhow, is as safe and quiet as a Sunday picnic.
For Croatia, more is at stake than the economic well-being of a few seaside hotels and coastal fishing trawlers. With its treasury drained by the fighting, Zagreb has little else these days but tourism to keep its sputtering economy from stalling.
 
Seek $700 Million in Tourism
 As a result, Government strategists declared this spring they hope to bring in up to $700 million in precious foreign currency -- twice the revenues earned in 1992 -- from visitors to the nation's steep, 1,100 mile-long Adriatic coastline.
To that end, they have begun a campaign to convince tourists that only a small part of the coast is actually under the threat of Serbian guns. In a recent meeting with a group of European travel writers, Prime Minister Hrvoje Sarinic said he would personally guarantee the safety and security of any foreign tourist who visits Croatia this summer.
To make room for a hoped-for tide of tourists, the Croatian Government has begun shuffling Croatian refugees out of the seaside hotels where many of them have been housed since they were driven from their homes in eastern and northern Croatia by Serbian advances. In Opatija alone, some 6,000 refugees have been transferred inland to dormitories and apartments.
While much of the coast looks as if it has been evacuated, the "Visit Peaceful Croatia" campaign has scored some positive results, and a few enthusiastic endorsements.
Dr. Mark Freedman, an 81-year-old retired New York City hospital director, arrived in Opatija earlier this month. "Did anybody tell me I was crazy to come here?" he asked. "Yes they did. But the coast here is one of the most beautiful places in the world."
 
No Vacancies at Marinas
 Marinas along the Adriatic report they have no vacancies for the coming season, and in Porec, just across the Istrian Peninsula from Opatija, there has been a sharp jump in visitors this spring, most of them Austrians and Italians who live only a few hours away and zip down by private car to take advantage of the good weather and sharp discounts on the large numbers of vacant seafront rooms. For example, a two-bedroom apartment overlooking the sea is renting for as little as $47 a night during the peak months of July and August.
Geographically, and psychologically, Porec is much closer to Italy than it is to the rest of Croatia. Just 70 miles across the sea from Venice, seafront cafes in Porec keeps their radios tuned to Italian stations.
Compared with the old days, when 13,000 people a day spilled across the tennis courts, beaches and nudist camps of western Istria, tourist officials are now counting about 6,000, families like the Schmoltzers from Vienna, who came down for a long weekend in the sun.
"No, no, it's very peaceful, very quiet here," said Peter Schmoltzer, as he headed for the pool at the Galijot Hotel with his youngest son. "The war is a long way away."
 
An Empty Riviera
 At this time a year ago, there was nobody in town, Albino Sinozic, the head of tourism for Porec, said. "What we still do not have are the big tour operators, the charter flights and bus tours, that used to help fill the hotels," Mr. Sinozic said.
Using statistics from 1989, the last normal year before the war, officials at the Ministry of Tourism and Trade estimate that tourism ought to contribute about 12 percent of Croatia's gross domestic product, and between 10 and 12 percent of its national employment.
But since the rest of the Croatian economy is now in such shambles, argues Boris Vukonic, the author of a recent book titled "Tourism in the Whirlwind of War," Government officials are now counting on tourism to supply a much larger share of revenues, perhaps as much as 30 percent.
"The good news for Croatia is that the war has not destroyed the real heart of our tourist industry, and it will recover quickly, once the fighting is over," Mr. Vukonic said.
When the old Yugoslav federation collapsed into independent republics, Croatia came away with most of the tourist spoils; the largest share of the resorts and hotels along the Dalmatian coast that visitors associated with the old Yugoslavia are now within the borders of the Croatian republic.
 
Dubrovnik Is Rebuilding
 In the fighting over the past two years, the part of the Croatian coast hardest hit was the ancient port city of Dubrovnik, which is only now rebuilding from the ruins left by a two-month siege by Serbian forces in 1991. More than 1,000 shells hit the old walled city, destroying several hotels in a city that was once one of the most popular tourist destinations along the Adriatic.
More recently, Serbian shelling has also affected the towns of Zadar and Sibenik, and most of the coastline in between, although islands just off the coast, like Brac, have escaped the war.
But the fighting has barely touched Istria. Apart from two bombs dropped on an Istrian airport in the early days of the Croatian-Serbian war in 1990, not another shell has been heard here since.
Thick with lime and olive trees, the Adriatic coast near Opatija was first settled as a winter resort in the 19th century by the royal families of Vienna, and its steep, terraced hillsides are dotted with century-old pastel villas, many of which have been turned into restaurants or small hotels.
"Right now, this may be one of the world's most exclusive resorts," said Mr. Zoricic, who now counts fewer than 1,500 guests a day scattered among hotels and apartments with 20,000 beds. "Everyone gets the roads to themselves, and their own private beach too."

HEADLINE: The Career and the Kimono

BYLINE: By David E. Sanger; David E. Sanger is chief of The Times's bureau in Tokyo.

 BODY:
A few months ago, Masako Owada took the elevator to her office on the seventh floor of Japan's Foreign Ministry in Tokyo for the last time. Heading down the dark hallway, she stepped into the cluttered office of the economics section of the North American division and slipped past her battered gray-steel desk. Her telephone directories and a row of books about the semiconductor market were lined up neatly on a shelf above her desk. The phone still bore inky fingermarks -- reminders of the time not so long ago when she routinely put in 15-hour days managing some of Japan's nastier trade disputes with the United States.
On this day, though, the jangling phones went unanswered and her former colleagues were on their feet, waiting for her. They bowed low as she came into view, wearing the power outfit favored by the ministry's female diplomats: a trim blue suit, a bright scarf tucked neatly around her neck. The trade negotiator they once flippantly called "Owa" was now Masako-sama -- an honorific befitting the future Empress of Japan. 
 Never before in the 1,600-year history of the Japanese monarchy has anyone with a day job married into the royal family. Outspoken, witty in a quiet way, far more worldly and better educated (she is a graduate of Harvard and attended Oxford) than most Japanese men, her career clearly on the rise in the Foreign Ministry, Masako Owada was no ordinary working woman. She was a member of an elite group of Japanese women, path makers occupying jobs that only 10 years ago women were virtually barred from holding.
So when it was announced in January that Crown Prince Naruhito -- the 33-year-old elder son of Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko and grandson of Hirohito -- had finally convinced the 29-year-old Owada to marry him, the question many Japanese immediately asked was: Why did she do it? Why would she choose to come under the thumb of the hidebound imperial household, where she will be expected to keep her eyes downcast and her attitude deferential?
No place was this question debated more thoroughly than in Owada's old haunts in the Foreign Ministry. But as her former colleagues prepared to present her with their farewell gift, the question was momentarily put aside. The gift was a fine calligraphic rendering of the character wa, meaning harmony. In Japanese culture, wa is the way to peace and serenity. To some in the crowded room, the gift seemed both a wish and a warning: that Masako Owada would find a way to change Japan without colliding with the most traditional, the most rigid segment of Japanese society, the palace guard.
On a far less grand scale, this is the tightrope that tens of thousands of Japanese women of Owada's generation have been walking for the past decade. With none of the drama that has accompanied women's movements in America or Europe, they have been making inroads in a country where men, and many women, view career-oriented women with skepticism and sometimes outright suspicion. They have become doctors and lawyers in increasing numbers, and taking midlevel management jobs in the one environment that has been most hostile to their presence -- the big companies of Japan Incorporated.
At the same time, surveys consistently show that many young working Japanese women do not plan to forgo marriage and motherhood, just delay them. But for them, it's either child-rearing or a career, not both. Indeed, they often say they fail to see the advantage in juggling both motherhood and a career. "No one will love me more for choosing a job," a young woman graduating from Tsuda College, Japan's equivalent of Wellesley, recently told her American instructor.
Nonetheless, more and more of them are putting off marriage. (The average marriage age for Japanese women is 25.9.) And once married, they are having fewer and fewer children. So few, in fact, that the declining birth rate -- rather than political action groups or court decisions -- has caused the Japanese Government to develop a sudden interest in the well-being of women. When the fertility rate hit a new low of 1.53 in 1991, laws were passed offering men and women a leave of absence after the birth of a child.
"Companies suddenly worried they will not have enough workers," says Sumiko Iwao, a scholar who studies the role of women in Japan. Men in the ruling party "almost felt as if the Japanese race was on the verge of extinction."
But women have yet to become a political force, as many had predicted they would a few years ago. The much heralded "Madonna strategy" -- the brainchild of Takako Doi, the woman who headed the Socialist Party -- failed to propel large numbers of women into the parliamentary seats of male politicians caught in corruption scandals.
"The truth is that politics and kabuki are a lot alike," says Yuriko Koike, who recently became one of the 49 women in Parliament. In both politics and kabuki theater, she adds, the key roles are still "passed down from men to their sons."
As Crown Princess, Owada will have a strictly apolitical job, but she may well assume Japan's most important political task. She will be the new face abroad, an urbane, English-speaking member of the royal family whose mission will be to soften Japan's mercantilist and isolationist image. As a result, many Japanese say she is exchanging one diplomatic job for another. It is a job that comes naturally. Her father, Hisashi Owada, is the country's most senior diplomat, a brilliant international lawyer in charge of formulating Japanese foreign policy.
Masako Owada's decision to marry the Crown Prince has clearly touched a national nerve. For months, women have argued over whether that decision is an advance or a setback for women. The debate will continue long after June 9, when Owada dons a 12-layer, $300,000 silk kimono and walks into the shrine deep in the woods of the Imperial Palace grounds. There will always be those who see in her decision yet another surrender to the status quo. But there are others who feel that the arrival of someone like Owada can only hasten change.
FROM THE START, Masako Owada was a rarity. She was a sogoshoku.
In Japanese, the word describes a new group of career-track women entering jobs that, until seven years ago, were almost exclusively the preserve of men. Owada's graduation from Harvard in 1985 coincided with a major legal change in the status of Japanese women. As the United Nations Decade for Women came to a close, and under international pressure to do something, Japan's Parliament reluctantly passed the country's first Equal Employment Opportunity Law.
The law prohibits employers from offering women fewer fringe benefits than men or forcing women to resign when they marry or become pregnant. It "recommends" that employers "give equal opportunities to men and women when recruiting and hiring workers" and "treat women workers on an equal footing" when deciding on assignments or promotions. However, at the insistence of Japanese companies, the law carries virtually no enforcement clauses and it is violated with impunity. Indeed, what Japanese companies did in the labor-short days of the late 1980's was to create two classes of female employees.
There are the "office ladies" who don their prim uniforms, serve tea to visitors, do clerical chores and are often hired as likely spouses for male employees. They still make up the bulk of the young female work force. Then there are the sogoshoku. Like men, they pledge 9-to-midnight loyalty and a willingness to be assigned anywhere, anytime.
Until the bubble burst for the Japanese economy in 1990, Japan's biggest banks and companies competed to bring in several score of sogoshoku a year. While the numbers are small by American standards, it was a revolution for Japanese industry. In fact, women were hired in such numbers many bosses did not, and still don't, know what to do with them.
"No one was more confused than the sogoshoku themselves," says Etsuko Ohara, a reporter for Asahi Shimbun who has covered the changes in the workplace. "They knew they didn't belong to the men's world, but they didn't belong to the world of other women in the office either. Many of them didn't even know who to have lunch with."
When Masako Owada returned to Tokyo after graduating from Harvard, she entered this uncertain world. According to her friends, she toyed with the idea of remaining in the United States, where she had lived since she was a high-school student in Belmont, Mass. (Her father was teaching at Harvard.) Wall Street's investment banks and brokerage houses were eager to hire this multilingual Harvard economics major, whose senior thesis, written under the tutelage of Prof. Jeffrey Sachs, was a detailed examination of the role of oil prices and exchange rates in Japanese trade policy. But afraid she might lose touch with her own culture, she decided to return to Japan.
Owada enrolled as a student at the University of Tokyo. Then, finally deciding to follow in her father's footsteps, she studied for the daunting Japanese Foreign Service exam. Hisashi Owada has always loomed large in his daughter's life. "The first thing you need to understand about her is that she worships her father," a friend of the family says. The second, others say, is that as the eldest of three daughters, she bore the heaviest burden of fulfilling the expectations of this family of overachievers.
For a potential sogoshoku, Owada had several strikes against her. First, her Harvard background was something of a liability; in Japan, an ambitious future bureaucrat is expected to graduate from the University of Tokyo, then, for polish, spend a year or two abroad. Second, she had lived abroad so long her instincts, some feared, might no longer be Japanese. Third, she was a woman.
Owada passed the exam, survived the interview that often shunts women to other ministries and soon joined a select group of some of Japan's brightest and most internationalized women -- the two dozen or so on track to become Japan's top diplomats. For them, the pressure to stay single, evidence of one's commitment to the job, is intense. Only six of Owada's career-track female colleagues are married.
"When I applied to join the ministry," recalls a woman who is among the ministry's most talented young diplomats and a friend of Owada's, "the interviewer asked me right out, 'What would you do if you fall in love? Would you continue to work or would you quit?' I said I don't think I would ever fall in love with someone who would ask me to quit." For her, marriage would be "an enormous impediment," an interference with the long hours, overseas postings and frequent restaurant-and-bar rounds necessary for conducting diplomacy. (Male diplomats, on the other hand, are viewed with some suspicion if they remain unmarried for too long; the stability of a home life and a supportive wife are considered crucial for the best postings.)
At the Foreign Ministry, few seemed more committed than Owada. After two years at Oxford on a Government-sponsored study program, she returned to Tokyo. (At Oxford, she was hounded by Japanese reporters who had heard rumors she had caught the Crown Prince's fancy.) Assigned to two of the stickiest problems in Japanese relations with the United States -- American access to the semiconductor market and the limitations on foreign lawyers working in Tokyo -- she was often on the red-eye to Washington or pressed into service as an interpreter when officials like Carla Hills, then the United States Trade Representative, came to negotiate with senior Japanese officials.
During the periodic trade crises over computer chips, she very quietly, very expertly discussed with American reporters in Tokyo such esoterica as Japan's arguments for treating Eproms (an arcane form of memory chips) very differently from D-RAMs (the kind found in most personal computers). In her unaccented American English, she was soft-spoken but all business. Away from the office, she seemed to prefer going out with groups.
Most nights, the place to find her was at her desk. A midlevel Japanese diplomat now in the United States remembers serving as the night-duty officer at the Foreign Ministry last year. At around 2 or 3 A.M., when he was sleeping in a small office, he was roused by a sharp knock on the door. Outside stood Owada. She had just completed an urgent report and needed to get it distributed. "Apart from me and the guards," he recalls, "she was the last one in the building."
 OWADA'S LESS-privileged contemporaries face a far tougher time in the office.
Fukiko Akiba, a 34-year-old graduate of Japan Women's University, remembers the day in 1986 when her superiors at Saitama Bank (now the Asahi Bank) posted the first list of employees selected for the career-track positions. All the men in the office and the sprinkling of women who were in low management positions were on the list. Every other woman, including Akiba, was shunted into the office-lady category. A notice asked them to indicate their acceptance. Akiba refused.
She confronted her boss with un-Japanese directness. "What is your image of a woman suited for a career job?" she demanded.
He named an economist for a major bank and a senior woman executive at a major department store.
"Then all of the bank's men are as excellent workers as the two of them?" Akiba shot back.
"No," he said, "a man could be assigned to clerical work, too" -- if he received the lowest job evaluation, an E in the Japanese system.
"Then you are saying my ability is the same as men ranked E?" she asked.
A bit stunned, he had no answer.
Eventually, Akiba was put on the career track, but it was a lonely life because she found the overwhelmingly male corporate culture off-putting. "I wanted to leave after the official working hours were over," she says. "For men, of course, overtime is no problem. So I had to stay. I felt isolated. And when I told my boss that, he moved my seat to a more crowded area. He took my isolation as a physical thing." Last year, she finally quit in frustration and wrote a book about the hostility facing Japanese women in the workplace.
Statistics show that time and the economic downturn have taken a toll on working women. Fuji Bank, which hired 30 sogoshoku a year in the late 1980's, hired only 10 when things began to sour in 1990. This year, 5 were hired, even as the bank found room for 385 men. A spokesman explains that the quality of the female applicant pool has suddenly declined.
Those who got in during the boom are discovering that the careers of men and women are already veering in different directions. Masako Kataoka, 32, a graduate of Waseda University who has worked as a trader at a major bank for nine years, says only men are sent out to see customers.
Kataoka, one of the bank's more successful sogoshoku, earns more than $90,000 a year, yet feels underutilized. "Some managers want to use female workers more effectively," she says, "but only a few will take the risk. They know that if a woman takes a maternity leave or leaves the company, they will be blamed."
For career-track women in Japan, motherhood further complicates the picture. "The fact is that people still think mothers should stay home rather than cause trouble," says Midori Kawashima, a 40-year-old Ph.D. candidate at the University of Tokyo and the mother of a 7-year-old girl. She is pressing cities like Kawasaki to offer night and weekend baby-care services. Day-care centers usually close at 5:30 P.M., which is fine for factory workers but a problem for professional women, who are expected to take part in entertaining clients or bosses in the evenings.
But if Japanese society is not yet designed for working mothers, it is mystified by women who want neither marriage nor motherhood. Mariko Sakai, 40, is one of the first women to become a reporter and then producer for Hokkaido Television, which serves Japan's northernmost island. "I don't feel the necessity to get married, and they don't understand that," she says. "That is why so many Japanese women go to America. In America, you feel like you can make any choice you want. You don't have to fulfill an expectation. But in Japan, you are always expected to be a typical Japanese woman. At a certain age, you dress and express yourself a certain way. Later, you change the way everyone changes. That is why the big culture shock for Japanese women is when they get back to this country, not when they leave it."
The unmarried face several obstacles. Women who are denied promotions are often told by company managers that they cannot risk giving a job to someone who might marry or have a baby and then resign. Other women say their bosses refuse to send them to out-of-the-way places or to Japan's sprawling industrial empire in the third world, explaining they could not guarantee the safety of a single woman. (But a married woman couldn't go with a husband either, because that would disrupt his career.)
A few companies have refused outright to open career tracks to women. At the Arabian Oil Company, a joint venture established under the encouragement of the Japanese Government, Kumiko Hanada, who is in her late 20's, is one of the few who speak English, Arabic and Persian. A graduate of the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, she prepares foreign-language publications for the company. Yet she is technically a clerical worker because there are no career-track women. "Their excuse is that a woman could not get a visa to Saudi Arabia," she says.
Nonetheless, Hanada goes through the office rituals and says she even enjoys the nights out with the boys. "That is where I really learn a lot about the company."
Japanese men, particularly older ones, seem oblivious to the career desires of the younger women sitting around them. A few years ago, the chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan's largest defense contractor, was asked what his company was doing to improve the status of women. He answered by describing his hopes of building housing in outer space so that "poor Japanese housewives" would "have room to enjoy bigger refrigerators."
AS CONSTRAINED AS their lives are, professional women in Japan show little interest in following the path of their American sisters, who are seen as overly aggressive, naively idealistic and not sufficiently "supportive" of their husbands. Nor do they have much interest in becoming corporate samurai. (Though older managers complain that their younger workers enjoy staying home on the weekends with the family, the stereotype of the Japanese salary man who is an absentee father and husband still holds true.)
Even many who made a splash in Japanese business a few years ago have gone on to other things. Four years ago, Fumi Handa could be seen standing on the seat of a small delivery van called the S-Cargo, her head poking through the sunroof, bursting with joy over her creation. The van indeed looked like a snail, with two big mournful headlights for eyes, a curved back and a narrow chassis made to slip down narrow Tokyo back streets. Handa had come up with the design for the car for Nissan, and the company allowed her and five other young women to join a team that developed the vehicle for small businesses, especially those owned by women. S-Cargo was an overnight success and made its creators famous.
Today, only Handa and another of the original six women are left at Nissan. One left for another job and three got married and quit. The idea that led to the team has also been abandoned. "At that time, in the late 1980's," says Handa, "the entire Japanese society was using women's power, and it was trendy to put together a team like that."
These days, Handa is careful never to press her opinions too hard. "You don't say, 'I prefer this.' Instead, you collect a sample of outside opinions agreeable to your own." She is now in the public-relations department of the design center and will quit if she falls in love with someone who doesn't want her to work.
Many women insist it is very American -- and wrong -- to view the quickness to drop out of corporate life as evidence that women in Japan are passive and willing to bend to men's will. In a country that operates on relationships rather than ideology, many women insist that their advance has to be worked out case by case.
"Americans set a goal for success and get angry when there are obstacles," says Sumiko Iwao, a professor at Keio University whose recent book on Japanese women describes them as much tougher than is commonly believed. "But Japanese are more situation-oriented, and they are quicker to say, 'Look how far we have come from 10 years ago or 3 years ago.' "
Some feminists in Japan see Iwao as too forgiving, but many Japanese women say progress will depend on a gradual turning of events to their advantage. Probably no one knows this better than Masako Owada as she takes on a new persona -- not the American student, not the workaholic bureaucrat but the deferential Crown Princess.
THEY MET AT A reception, or so the almost fairy tale goes, for Princess Elena of Spain. Masako Owada, then 22, had just joined the Foreign Ministry. The long search by the Crown Prince, then 26, for a bride was already on its way to becoming a subject of black humor.
Very little in the Imperial Palace happens by accident, but few doubt that love was at work, at least on the Prince's part. "My guess," says one of Owada's friends, "is that for the first time he met a woman he could talk to about something real, not one of these daughters of the right families who take shopping tours to Paris."
By all accounts, the young woman was flattered but uninterested. It was about six years later, after the intercession of several intermediaries, including Hisashi Owada's mentor at the Foreign Ministry, that another meeting was arranged. Over time, Owada's friends say, she too fell in love, but cautiously. "I don't think there is much doubt in her mind that she loves the Prince," says a Harvard friend. "The question was never him. The question was the palace."
For some 1,600 years, as long as there have been empresses, Japan's Imperial Court has molded them to fit a national image. With Masako Owada, say members of the old establishment, things have changed.
In January, the whole country came to a stop when the Crown Prince and his would-be bride held their first, and so far only, press conference. There was no chance there would be surprises, since under palace rules questions were submitted in advance. Nonetheless, by her very demeanor Masako Owada made news.
Gone were her usual trim business suit, cocked turn of head and bright scarf. Instead, she sat in a yellow jacket and billowy skirt, with a matching hat and purse. She wore white gloves. But if the uniform was suitably by the book, the words were not. She talked about how she had "agonized considerably over whether I ought to give up my work or not." When the Crown Prince popped the question last October, at a duck-hunting ground outside of Tokyo, she said, she hesitated and gave him no answer for two months. Those 60 days, her friends and acquaintances (Continued on page 48)
say, were filled with lots of lengthy, emotional phone calls to close friends and fears that she would be ruining her life by entering the cloistered, rigid world of the imperial family.
"I'd be telling a lie if I were to say that I do not feel a sense of sadness on leaving the Foreign Ministry, where I have been working for close to six years," Owada told the crowd of reporters. But she was won over, she said, when the Prince told her, "I will protect you with all my power throughout my life." It was unclear whom she needed protection from, but many believe those words were a signal to both the Imperial Household Agency and the Japanese press that if they tangle with the new Princess, they will be tangling with the Prince. The message was out: There would be no digging into her past life, no carping from old-line families whose daughters were passed over and none of the harsh treatment by the Imperial Household Agency that led Empress Michiko to a near nervous breakdown and a miscarriage a generation ago.
Curiously, the press conference has emerged as a sort of national Rorschach test. Many older Japanese said they were shocked by Owada's forwardness. Miss Owada, they complained, had breached imperial etiquette by repeatedly stepping in to add a few words to Prince Naruhito's comments.
"She said too much," said one middle-aged woman who knows the Emperor and Empress well. In fact, she added, the future princess had talked longer than her fiance. Another woman noted: "She evaluated the Prince, describing his good characteristics. In Japan, evaluation is impolite. It should only happen when people who are higher up evaluate those who are lower down."
Akira Hashimoto, a senior executive of Kyodo News Service who went to school with the Emperor when he was a child, also suggested Owada has a bit to learn. "She tried to meet the questions and answers too directly," he said. To become a true princess, she must "give up her endeavor to build up her own character" and should "find a way to express herself simply with her smile."
In contrast, many younger Japanese, particularly working women, were thrilled to see a future empress offering direct, savvy answers, even opinions. "She said the very maximum she could say," one of her colleagues and friends at the Foreign Ministry said. Owada's account of how she deliberated between job and marriage was particularly satisfying to many of her friends, because they knew it would infuriate old-line families and pro-imperialists. "To them, her view, her feelings should not be important," a former colleague said. "She was saying it was the deciding factor."
Yet another group -- Owada's American friends, who knew her as a bright, witty and outspoken young woman -- had a different reaction. Some said they were shocked by what they saw. Sitting in her perfect dress, bowing at all the right moments, her gloved hands folded just-so in her lap, she "had turned into something different, almost robotic," said a friend who knew Owada well at Harvard. "You would hardly recognize her. I saw this and said to myself, 'It's over.' " Last month, these friends noted that after Owada received the official engagement gifts from the palace, she posed a bit awkwardly in her kimono for the cameras. They could not remember ever seeing her in a kimono.
For their part, weekly magazines and television now portray Owada in the one-dimensional terms that royalty are treated to in Japan -- as the idealized princess, even if it means obliterating her Americanized past, her intellectual interests and her opinions. Though Japanese reporters have been combing Harvard in search of old boyfriends or tidbits of gossip (there seem to be very few of either), not a word of it has appeared in print or on television.
These days, in the Japanese mass media, Owada appears as a young woman interested in making dinner and babies, a woman for whom her work as a diplomat was a premarriage diversion -- good training for the state dinners and official trips she will be taking. One recent television special examined her cooking skills, her wardrobe, her taste in pearls. A morning television program spent the better part of the show teaching viewers how to tie scarves the way she ties them. Her hairdresser has become a celebrity.
When a reporter recently asked Owada about such feminine pursuits, she, clearly at a loss, finally and gently conceded that she hadn't cooked much in recent years. It would have been inappropriate for the future Crown Princess to point out that, until January, she regularly got home from work long after dinner time had passed.

HEADLINE: Offering Help to Depression Sufferers

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
THOSE who break a leg or an arm will see a doctor immediately, but fewer than one-third of those who suffer from clinical depression, a far more severe malady, are likely to seek help.
Clinical depression strikes more than 12 million adults in the United States each year and costs $27 billion a year in worker absenteeism, lost productivity and health care. Moreover, clinical depression is a leading cause of suicide. 
 Tragically, 15 percent of people with severe untreated depression kill themselves. One in eight adults living in Westchester is likely to experience clinical depression sometime in his or her lifetime.
Dorothy Curtin, who now at 53 has a part-time paid job as an assistant leader at the Sterling Social Club at the Mental Health Association's headquarters at 29 Sterling Avenue in White Plains, is one of those who sought suicide as a way out of clinical depression.
 
Not a Therapy Group
 "I tried to commit suicide twice: once, after I was divorced in 1983 and then a few years later when I felt I had reached bottom," she said. "I couldn't work. I couldn't concentrate. I had no confidence. I had physical problems and I felt totally alone and friendless.
"This is the first paid position I have had in years, and I can't believe the big change it has made in my life. I feel so good about myself. What is especially meaningful to me is that in the Social Club I am able to help others having a hard time simply by listening."
The club is run by its 40 members, who range in age from 22 to 80. Ms. Curtin said that it is not a therapy group but rather a group of peers who set the club's agenda.
"The group decides what outings to go on or what movies to see or even what topics in the newspaper to discuss," she said. "I know my own life turned around when I began going to the Social Club after I had been in treatment for 18 months at White Plains Hospital. It gave me something to do with my time. I was able to make friends and do things with them."
 
<SC0>Assistance for Employees
 Such social clubs are one of the major services offered to men and women with a variety of mental illnesses by the Mental Health Association of Westchester County.
Barbara G. Hirst, director of community relations for the Mental Health Association, said: "Last year 400 people joined one of our eight clubs, which meet at various locations in Westchester. It not only gives them a place to go and meet but for most the club is the only place they have to socialize. You have coffee shops that provide lunch and snacks at below cost. Some people come every day. The Sterling Club, for example, is open six days a week and two weekend evenings. Members run their clubs. Advisers are merely facilitators."
Clinical depression, an illness that causes persistent changes in a person's mood, behavior and feelings, is characterized by depressed mood or diminished interest in ordinary activities. It shows up in the workplace as an inability to concentrate, remember things or make decisions, often accompanied by a change in personal appearance.
Dr. Esterann Grayzel, corporate medical director at New York Telephone, said: "We were one of the first companies to acknowledge that clinical depression was a treatable medical illness that was a problem of the workplace. Ten years ago we made our employee assistance program available to those employees who showed signs of mental distress, often identified by a change in job performance which affected productivity. We try to get people help as soon as possible for their own good and the good of the company."
 
Viewed as a Weakness
 Although troubled employees are referred by the employee assistance program to outside doctors and psychiatrists, there are some employees who suffer from clinical depression who prefer not to go through the program even though everything is kept confidential.
"Unfortunately, although people today understand and are knowledgeable about treatment for drug and alcohol abuse, there is still a stigma associated with mental illness that keeps people out of treatment," Dr. Grayzel said. "But if clinical depression is diagnosed early, in the great majority of cases it can be effectively treated with medication, psychotherapy or a combination of both."
Although family history is a risk factor, there are other factors at work. "Family stress because of the economy and loss of a second income, the pressure to produce more on the job, all these things can act as a catalyst that triggers depression," Dr. Grayzel said.
"Symptoms can range from fatigue and loss of energy to a paralysis in which the person can't function, accompanied by a loss of self-esteem," he said.
 
Taking the First Step
 Mary F. Foster, a certified public accountant with the firm of Deloitte & Touche, is also on the board of the Mental Health Association of Westchester.
"In my practice as an accountant, I see the way many different companies operate," Ms. Foster said. "Sadly, I find that companies are much more understanding when it comes to getting help for employees with drug or alcohol problems than they are with those who suffer from mental illnesses.
"Too many companies feel mental illness is a weakness, not an illness, and unfortunately it is shame that prevents people who need it from seeking help. Even foremen in companies with good E.A.P. programs are reluctant to 'blow the whistle' on someone they suspect is suffering from a mental illness, because they feel it would be a stigma and adversely affect the person's keeping their job or getting another job."
A 1991 public opinion survey conducted for the National Mental Health Association bore out Ms. Foster's observation. It showed that 43 percent of American adults see depression as a personal weakness rather than a health problem.
Ms. Curtin acknowledged the stigma factor. "Although I'm very open and want to share my experience in treatment because I feel good about myself and I feel that it may help others, I do believe there is still a stigma attached to clinical depression," she said. "For instance, my mother, who is 80, has acknowledged that I might have had a physical problem but never admitted that I had a mental problem."
Ms. Foster is doubtful that most workplaces are organized to deal with mental illness effectively. "I know that after the bombing of the World Trade Center, a number of companies, recognizing that this was a traumatic experience for their employees, used their E.A.P.'s to put people in touch with professionals who worked in mental health," she said. "But realistically, how many companies today are ready to expand their human resource departments to deal with forms of mental illness?
"I think it is much more important that people suffering from clinical depression take the first step toward seeking treatment. They can't rely on employers to do it for them."
Ms. Hirst said that the Mental Health Association of Westchester is taking an active role in a national education campaign on clinical depression.
"In Westchester it is estimated that 123,530 adults -- 91,784 of them women and 31,746 of them men -- may experience a major depression in their lifetimes," Ms. Hirst said. "What the campaign wants to emphasize and bring home to the public is that clinical depression is a mental illness for which effective treatments are available."
Those interested in learning more about clinical depression or about the Mental Health Association's social clubs should call Ms. Hirst at 949-6741.

IN DEFENSE OF GARBAGE
By Judd H. Alexander.
Praeger, $22.95. 
 As the current wave of revisionist environmentalism crests, more treatises like "In Defense of Garbage" are sure to wash ashore. Judd H. Alexander, a former vice president of the American Can Company, challenges the notion that the United States is a throwaway society, arguing that only a small fraction of nonrenewable materials like metals, glass and plastics finds its way into landfills. According to his figures, packaging makes up a mere 14 percent of municipal solid waste, not the one-third that has been widely asserted. There is, Mr. Alexander says, no real garbage crisis. The problem is that uninformed journalists and politicians and unthinking and capricious environmentalists have fanned public fears. Mr. Alexander indicts all three groups for laws and regulations banning certain types of packaging, blocking waste-to-energy plants and new dumps, and requiring recycling; the authors of these requirements, he argues, have uniformly failed to consider the economic impact on business and consumers. There is much in his book to think about regarding the handling of municipal solid waste, and the accounts of the history of garbage and the development of modern packaging are peppered with quirky detail. But in veering from discussion to diatribe, Mr. Alexander undercuts his stated aim: correcting "serious misunderstandings" concerning "the inevitable residue of commerce."

THE NEW DEALERS
Power Politics in the Age of Roosevelt.
By Jordan A. Schwarz.
411 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50. 
 THE dominant trend in New Deal historiography, exemplified by such traditional liberals as Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and William E. Leuchtenburg, has been primarily celebratory. Conceding the New Deal's failure to achieve a full economic recovery before the onset of World War II, these authors prefer to emphasize breakthroughs in social welfare legislation, the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt and the reshaping of American politics in the 1930's.
Other historians, situated at various ideological points on the left, criticize the New Deal for failing to establish a socialist, egalitarian America. A few label it the work of a reactionary capitalist elite. Conservatives, largely scorned in the academic world, have not produced an appealing alternative to the liberal-radical debate. A few scholars, seeking large perspectives and with no sharp political axes to grind, have asked whether some coherent vision of an ideal political economy motivated the movement. Usually the answer, most notably in the pathbreaking work of Ellis Hawley, the author of "The New Deal and the Problem of Monopoly," has been that the New Deal was a jumble.
It is to the last group that Jordan A. Schwarz, Distinguished Research Professor at Northern Illinois University, belongs. But unlike his predecessors, he finds a grand theme, arguing that the New Deal was a system of "state capitalism" promoting modernization in the underdeveloped South and West through the deployment of easy credit, substantial subsidies and public works. In his view, New Deal state capitalism had its origins in the huge Federal spending and economic planning of World War I, and was fueled by a Brandeisian hostility toward big business and finance. It was midwifed in the 30's, Mr. Schwarz says in "The New Dealers: Power Politics in the Age of Roosevelt," by regional politicians, especially the Texans Jesse Jones, Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson.
Carried out by public administrators (especially David E. Lilienthal) and furthered by private entrepreneurs (foremost among them Henry J. Kaiser), the New Deal brought the comforts of modernity and the blessings of industrialization to the Pacific Northwest, the Tennessee Valley and thousands of farms and small towns in the "colonial" areas of a nation dominated by a Northeastern imperial metropole. World War II consolidated these changes, Mr. Schwarz writes, creating shipyards and aircraft factories that stretched from the Canadian border to San Diego, spilled over into Texas and dotted the Gulf Coast. After the war, he says, state capitalism manifested itself in numerous foreign development schemes that provided markets for American goods and in massive enterprises like the space program.
Let no one assume that this is simply interesting academic history with no relevance to today's policy debates. The New Deal, Mr. Schwarz tells us, "built the world's largest middle-class society by following an experimental industrial policy." He also quotes Louis Bean, a little-remembered but capable New Deal economist, who advocated the abandonment of "the phrase 'government spending' " and the adoption of "another phrase including the word 'investment.'

THE NEW DEALERS
Power Politics in the Age of Roosevelt.
By Jordan A. Schwarz.
411 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50. 
 THE dominant trend in New Deal historiography, exemplified by such traditional liberals as Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and William E. Leuchtenburg, has been primarily celebratory. Conceding the New Deal's failure to achieve a full economic recovery before the onset of World War II, these authors prefer to emphasize breakthroughs in social welfare legislation, the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt and the reshaping of American politics in the 1930's.
Other historians, situated at various ideological points on the left, criticize the New Deal for failing to establish a socialist, egalitarian America. A few label it the work of a reactionary capitalist elite. Conservatives, largely scorned in the academic world, have not produced an appealing alternative to the liberal-radical debate. A few scholars, seeking large perspectives and with no sharp political axes to grind, have asked whether some coherent vision of an ideal political economy motivated the movement. Usually the answer, most notably in the pathbreaking work of Ellis Hawley, the author of "The New Deal and the Problem of Monopoly," has been that the New Deal was a jumble.
It is to the last group that Jordan A. Schwarz, Distinguished Research Professor at Northern Illinois University, belongs. But unlike his predecessors, he finds a grand theme, arguing that the New Deal was a system of "state capitalism" promoting modernization in the underdeveloped South and West through the deployment of easy credit, substantial subsidies and public works. In his view, New Deal state capitalism had its origins in the huge Federal spending and economic planning of World War I, and was fueled by a Brandeisian hostility toward big business and finance. It was midwifed in the 30's, Mr. Schwarz says in "The New Dealers: Power Politics in the Age of Roosevelt," by regional politicians, especially the Texans Jesse Jones, Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson.
Carried out by public administrators (especially David E. Lilienthal) and furthered by private entrepreneurs (foremost among them Henry J. Kaiser), the New Deal brought the comforts of modernity and the blessings of industrialization to the Pacific Northwest, the Tennessee Valley and thousands of farms and small towns in the "colonial" areas of a nation dominated by a Northeastern imperial metropole. World War II consolidated these changes, Mr. Schwarz writes, creating shipyards and aircraft factories that stretched from the Canadian border to San Diego, spilled over into Texas and dotted the Gulf Coast. After the war, he says, state capitalism manifested itself in numerous foreign development schemes that provided markets for American goods and in massive enterprises like the space program.
Let no one assume that this is simply interesting academic history with no relevance to today's policy debates. The New Deal, Mr. Schwarz tells us, "built the world's largest middle-class society by following an experimental industrial policy." He also quotes Louis Bean, a little-remembered but capable New Deal economist, who advocated the abandonment of "the phrase 'government spending' " and the adoption of "another phrase including the word 'investment.' "
Mr. Schwarz tells his story through a series of biographical profiles of New Deal precursors, participants and beneficiaries. The message is arresting, the strategy questionable. The author, a competent stylist, invites a can't-win comparison with Mr. Schlesinger, the master of New Deal biography. Mr. Schwarz invariably wanders down side issues that are often intriguing (the position of Jews in the Roosevelt Administration, say) but take attention away from his central argument.

Working Cannes, On a Wing and a Script

BYLINE: By Neal Koch; Neal Koch, a Los Angeles-based journalist, writes about the entertainment industry.

DATELINE: CANNES, France

 BODY:
ALL year long, Mark Damon dreams of two weeks of conquests on the French Riviera, where the movie stars and seminude sunbathers enliven the sun-warmed sands of this Mediterranean resort for the world's wealthy. But once here, he sequesters himself in sweltering, smoke-filled hotel rooms and spends his evenings pressing the flesh with suited, middle-aged men at crowded cocktail parties.
Still, for the man who may be the world's top salesman of independently made martial-arts and sex-thriller movies, there is no more intriguing place to be in May than the annual Cannes film festival and market. 
 "We're No. 4!" Mr. Damon exclaims as he's handed a fax from his Los Angeles office that reports on the United States box office performance of his latest release, "Sidekicks," starring Chuck Norris. The previous weekend, the movie grossed more money than all other theatrical films in America except for "Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story," "Dave," and "Indecent Proposal," an exceptional performance for an independently produced film.
But such success is nothing new for Mr. Damon, a former teen magazine idol and spaghetti-western actor who is widely credited with subsequently pulling together the informal overseas network of local distributors that has mounted a true challenge to the major Hollywood studios over the last two decades.
Mr. Damon and other independent salespeople cobble together the financing to film such movies by persuading local distributors -- country by country, picture by picture -- to buy future exhibition rights before the film is even made. The independent films financed this way include "Wild Orchid" from Mr. Damon's Vision International and "Super Mario Brothers," a $40 million live-action adaptation of a Nintendo game, produced by Roland Joffe and Jake Ebert, which opened this weekend.
The sales deals are usually based on little more than vague assurances that certain stars and directors are attached and that each script is the most exciting one the distributor has ever read. Now, in his 25th year of distributing films, and with so many of his competitors having been felled by the recession, Mr. Damon "dominates the industry," says the producer Peter McAlevey.
So perhaps it's understandable that at 7:30 on a Saturday morning, in Vision's sales suite at the Majestic Hotel across from the Palais de Festival, the 60-year-old Mr. Damon seems ahead of his 30ish staff of six in energy and focus. They're gathered for their daily morning meeting, which typically follows long days and late nights of selling. In May, the sun rises early here and hangs until after 9 P.M. Business parties can start after midnight.
Reiko Bradley, Vision's vice president for international sales, reports that she just closed a deal while jogging with a buyer at 6:15 A.M. But Mr. Damon wants more.
"You sit down and tell them that if they get to license 'The Quest,' " Vision's Jean-Claude Van Damme martial-arts project, scheduled for a Christmas 1994 release, "they have to take all our pictures in the future -- except," he adds laughingly, "that we get to pull them out any time we want."
Stories of Mr. Damon's sales enthusiasm abound, including the one about the movie "Wild Orchid." A few years ago, needing another film to hawk, he and Zalman King, a producer and screenwriter for "9 1/2 Weeks," wrote a script in two days while at Cannes, then hustled up an artist's drawing of a wild orchid for Vision's hotel suite, the story goes. Mr. Damon put out the word that he had a property so enticing that he was giving it only to special buyers, refusing to entertain general sales meetings. Offers poured in so fast, Mr. Damon claims, that he raised the $9 million production budget within days.
Then there's the crying game. Once Mr. Damon was pitching a Japanese buyer on "Misunderstood," a film in which an estranged son makes a deathbed confession to his father that all he ever wanted out of life was the father's love. "When I got to that part," Mr. Damon says, "I began to cry. I just got so choked up I couldn't finish the story. The Japanese buyers in the room were so touched that they came over, tapped me on the shoulder and told me, 'Don't worry. We'll buy the picture.' "
Turning problems into selling points seems to be a Damon specialty. This Cannes, he declined to show buyers the script for "The Quest," the story of a young homeless man with masterful martial-arts skills who finds the courage to triumph over adversity and emerge victorious. Mr. Damon said Mr. Van Damme feared his ideas would be stolen. Instead, Mr. Damon served up smoked-salmon finger sandwiches and baby fried crabs at a cocktail party on the beach for 452 of his closest business associates. There, and throughout the week, he proclaimed it an asset that Mr. Van Damme would not only star in the movie, but also direct.
As the last of the crabs were downed around 9 P.M., and an intermittent drizzle scuttled plans for Mr. Van Damme to ascend in a hot-air balloon painted with "The Quest" and "Vision International," Mr. Damon quietly slipped away to work the phones to Los Angeles and to meet with a producer until 2 A.M.
Just hours later, already chatting business with another producer in tow, he strode into Vision's hotel suite for Saturday's 7:30 A.M. staff meeting.
Near the festival's end almost two weeks later, an old friend reported that Mr. Damon was talking privately of having had his best year ever -- perhaps $60 million in sales, more than double any previous performance. Mr. Damon himself could not be caught for comment. He was already off on a three-day auto trip to Paris -- dreaming all the way, one imagines, about next year at Cannes.

Never Mind the Numbers, Business Pays Big Taxes

BYLINE: By H. B. ATWATER JR.; H. B. Atwater Jr. is chairman and chief executive of General Mills Inc.

 BODY:
CONGRESS and the Clinton Administration are on the brink of a budget plan. But before they jump, they should realize that one central budget issue -- corporate tax rates -- has become a victim of misleading statistics.
Originally, President Clinton's budget plan called for a 36 percent general corporate tax rate -- a 2 percent increase. But, to minimize the harm to economic growth while still achieving credible deficit reduction, the President later agreed to Representative Dan Rostenkowski's suggestion to seek only a 35 percent rate and to drop the temporary tax credit for large corporations. 
 The House of Representatives narrowly passed a budget containing the 35 percent rate on Thursday night. But the rate, along with other features of the House bill, now faces an uphill battle in the Senate.
Some disagree with the 35 percent provision, including the Democratic Study Group, a prestigious group of liberal politicians. This group, among others, contends that American companies pay relatively low taxes. The claim is highly misleading. In fact, American companies pay very high income taxes by several measures:

Foreign Taxes. In a paper released on May 11, the Democratic Study Group asserted that American companies pay less in tax than companies abroad. This is not true; indeed, the reverse is often the case. For example, while Japan's 37.5 percent corporate rate is higher than the American rate, both Britain and France have lower rates -- 33 percent and 33.33 percent, respectively.
Moreover, the study group failed to say that, when corporate income is taxed a second time in the form of shareholder dividends, the combined rates are higher in America than in the three nations mentioned and in many others. (The Clinton tax increases, both personal and corporate, would widen this international gap.)
In any event, nominal tax rates are often deceptive because few taxpayers pay those rates in practice. The effective tax rate -- what people really pay after deductions, credits and the like -- is a truer measure of tax burden. And here, too, the United States is revealed to be a heavier corporate taxer than such major competitors as Britain, France, Germany and Japan. The combined effective tax rate on equity for companies and individuals in the United States is 51.2 percent -- higher than all the others.

Past Taxes. In another assertion, the study group argued that even a 36 percent rate would be lower than the 46 percent rate that prevailed before the 1986 tax reform law.
This claim confuses nominal and effective rates. When the nominal corporate rate was 46 percent, the tax code was so perforated by special exemptions, deductions and credits that the effective corporate rate was only 18.6 percent, according to the General Accounting Office. In contrast, in 1989, when the loopholes were filled, the effective rate was 32.9 percent even though the nominal rate was a much lower 34 percent.

Tax Share. Corporate taxes account for only 9.2 percent of total Federal receipts, a statistic that has declined over the years. The Democratic Study Group notwithstanding, the number does not mean that Corporate America is not paying its fair share of taxes. It simply reflects a decrease in corporate profits -- that is, the corporate income on which taxes are levied. Indeed, if corporate taxes constituted 28 percent of Federal receipts in recent years, as they did in years past, they would have exceeded the income on which they were imposed.
The only true way to measure tax burden is to compare the tax paid with the income taxed -- in other words, the effective tax rate. By that measure, American corporations are pulling their weight. During the 1990's, the average company paid 34.5 percent of its income in tax. That was much higher than the corresponding 9.7 percent paid by the average individual taxpayer in the same period.
We are all being asked to sacrifice to help achieve meaningful reductions in the Federal deficit. That is as it should be. But false finger-pointing and misleading statistics do not contribute to the cooperative spirit needed to succeed in this task.

HEADLINE: KEY FOE OF BUDGET SUGGESTS OPTIMISM OVER A COMPROMISE

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
Senator David L. Boren of Oklahoma, who holds the crucial swing vote that could make or break President Clinton's economic plan, said today that the odds had greatly improved that a compromise he could support could be worked out.
Senator Boren's new position almost guarantees enactment of legislation to lower the budget deficit, said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over much of the Clinton plan. 
 Until today, Mr. Boren, one of 11 Democrats on the committee, had been threatening to block the budget by joining the panel's nine Republicans who have vowed to vote against the package. The Clinton plan was approved by the House of Representatives in a cliffhanger last week and indications were that it would face an even rougher road in the Senate.
 
Concessions on Fuel Tax
 But in a television interview, Mr. Boren said signals in the last few days that the White House and Mr. Moynihan would accept deeper spending cuts and modifications in the proposed energy tax "improved the chances by about 100 percent that we're going to be able to work out an agreement."
Mr. Moynihan, reached by telephone at his farm in upstate New York after the broadcast of the interview, said: "It is clear that Senator Boren sees that we have to have a deficit-reduction bill. We are going to have a bill more of the kind he has hoped for."
The Clinton Administration expressed delight with the turn of events. On "Face the Nation," the CBS News program on which Mr. Boren appeared, Leon E. Panetta, Mr. Clinton's budget director, called Mr. Boren's more conciliatory stance "very encouraging."
 
Brighter Prospects
 Last week, the House approved the President's budget plan without significant change, 219 to 213. The victory required every bit of political firepower in the President's arsenal.
The uncomfortably narrow margin seemed to be a harbinger of deep trouble in the Senate, where party discipline is laxer than it is in the House and where lawmakers from oil-producing states who oppose the President's proposed energy tax are more influential.
But Mr. Boren's statements today were the second sign of the weekend that the prospects might be improving.
On Saturday, Mr. Moynihan said he had been working with the Administration on changes in the President's program to command maximum support in his committee and in the Senate as a whole.
Despite the favorable signs, the plan is not out of the woods yet for two important reasons.
First, as Mr. Boren said today, "the devil is in the details," and the particulars of a compromise will be difficult to work out.
Second, Mr. Boren has been maddeningly fickle about where he stands, and he could change his mind overnight.
The Clinton package is supposed to reduce the Federal budget deficit over the next five years by almost $500 billion, divided evenly between tax increases and spending reductions.
The main tax provisions would raise income tax rates for wealthy individuals and large corporations, impose a fuel tax, increase the portion of Social Security benefits subject to taxation for upper- and middle-income retirees and require the wealthy to pay Medicare taxes on all their earnings, while offering more generous tax breaks to workers who earn less than about $30,000 a year.
The bulk of the spending cuts would come from the military and Medicare, the medical insurance program for the elderly and disabled.
 
The Alternative Budget
 The week before last, Mr. Boren joined forces with two moderate Republican Senators, John C. Danforth of Missouri and William S. Cohen of Maine, to offer an alternative plan that contained no energy tax and had much deeper spending cuts for Medicare and Social Security.
The alternative plan itself stands no chance of enactment. The word in the Capitol is that 20 Senators at most would vote for it. But it did provide somewhat of a basis for negotiations.
Mr. Boren has said he is not wedded to this alternative, although like many other lawmakers from energy-producing states he opposes the President's proposed fuel tax because it would make products like petrochemicals much more expensive.
He indicated today that three changes in the Clinton program would satisfy him: somewhat more cuts in spending than the House approved and changes in the fuel tax to give rebates to producers of exports and to keep the levy from rising automatically each year as prices increase because of inflation.
Mr. Moynihan said he and Administration officials were prepared to accept $30 billion in additional budget cuts, almost all of it in the Medicare program.
The White House has already agreedto giving rebates on the fuel tax, and as long as the inflation rate remains low, eliminating automatic increases should be acceptable, an official said.
 
A Fickle Senator
 But these solutions could create problems elsewhere. Rebates on exports, for example, could be viewed by other countries as a violation of international trade agreements. Cuts in Medicare would mean that those savings would not be available to finance the new health-care system the Clinton Administration plans to propose this summer.
Mr. Moynihan said he understood those problems but thought it best to work "one day at a time."
Mr. Boren's fickleness is a more complicated matter.
As soon as President Clinton announced his budget plan last February, Mr. Boren began to take shots at it. But 10 days later, he said in an interview that he supported the plan "unconditionally," and added: "This is the best, most promising budget I've seen since I've been in Congress."
Early in the spring, he promised Mr. Clinton and Mr. Moynihan he would support the plan in the Finance Committee, but over the last few weeks, he has demanded concessions in return for his vote. Publicly, he has demanded deeper spending cuts. But privately, he has demanded fewer cuts in agriculture programs, which are important in Oklahoma.
Mr. Boren and another centrist Democrat, Sam Nunn of Georgia, said today that Mr. Clinton had helped himself with his appointment on Saturday of David R. Gergen, who served in Republican Administrations, to a top position on the White House staff.
"I think what's happened this week cannot be overestimated in terms of its importance," Mr. Boren said. "This was a watershed week for the President, and he dealt not from weakness but from strength, after he passed his package through the House; he then reached out with naming Dave Gergen."
Mr. Nunn, who spoke on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," said that in appointing Mr. Gergen, the President was "clearly signaling the direction of his Administration."

HEADLINE: Forbidden City No Longer, Vladivostok Is Wide Open

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VLADIVOSTOK, Russia

 BODY:
After decades as a virtually sealed military fortress at the point where Russia's endless expanse finally runs up against China, North Korea and the sea, Vladivostok has opened up with a vengeance.
Merchant sailors come off the sea loaded down with loot and cars. Already four of every five cars is a used Japanese sedan, and another 260 arrive daily, all with the standard Japanese right-hand drive, creating a traffic hazard of murderous proportions on the hilly, potholed streets. 
 Thousands of Chinese stream over the nearby border daily with bales of cheap track suits, running shoes and glossy skirts to peddle on street markets in Russia's Far East. Russians buy up "rags" and cheap electronics in Harbin and trudge back to resell their goods across the former Soviet empire. The legendary Trans-Siberian train leaves its eastern terminal bursting with their wares, and an Aeroflot jetliner recently ran off the runway on takeoff because it was so loaded down.
 
Foreigners Tour the Area
 Consulates, including an American one, have opened, bolstering Vladivostok's claim to be the capital of the Far East. Foreigners, recently barred from the region, now tour the harbor past rusting battleships and submarines.
Forests and minerals abound. Though Russia's political, legal and economic quagmire has kept major investment at bay -- here as elsewhere in the former Soviet Union -- more than 400 joint ventures have opened in Primorsky Province, of which Vladivostok is the capital, and gaggles of Western and Asian entrepreneurs are camped at the Vladivostok Hotel.
Chinese are restoring a luxury hotel. Canadians have set up a motel outside town. A Soviet emigre from California has opened a fast-food restaurant called Magic Burger, reportedly with the Russian Navy as a partner. South Koreans have opened a casino, and even the North Koreans have opened a restaurant, which recently held a gala evening to mark the birthday of the Great Leader, Kim Il Sung.
Dangers of similar proportions stalk the streets. Visitors are advised not to walk around at night. A bomb was recently found in a department store. People talk of two or three killings each night somewhere in the city.
Outside the Vladivostok Hotel, a marble slab imbedded in the sidewalk last year marks the spot where a mobster named Aleksandr -- his last name is not disclosed, even in death -- took his last step after being gunned down.
There is no hot water at the hotel -- or anywhere in the city, nor will there be until October, because of fuel shortages. Sewage flows into Golden Horn Bay, nourishing poisonous jellyfish. Thick fog drapes the coast in springtime, and typhoons lash it in summer.
This is the leading edge of Russia's Wild East, seven time zones and 5,778 miles of Trans-Siberian track from Moscow, a port city of 800,000 ready for action.
Vladivostok was born tough. The name itself comes from "vladei vos tokom," or "control the east," and it was bestowed by the Governor of what was then called Eastern Siberia, Count Nikolai N. Muravyev, when he audaciously seized the strategic harbor in 1860, threw up a fort, presented China with a fait accompli and so concluded Russia's expansion to the east.
The Soviet rise to global power turned Vladivostok into the home of the mighty Pacific Fleet and the region into a sealed military camp. Even Soviet citizens required authorization to visit, and only President Ford's 1975 summit meeting with Leonid I. Brezhnev opened the gates a crack.
 
Night Train to Nakhodka
 Until Vladivostok was opened on Jan. 1, 1992, foreigners traveling east to Japan or other destinations had to disembark from the Trans-Siberian Railroad in Khabarovsk to the north and take a special night train to the one open port, Nakhodka, so they would not spy on the myriad battleships, tanks and warplanes.
The warships bristling with missile tubes and antennas still make for an awesome spectacle in the crumbling harbor, and these are only a small sample of the huge armada at the main base on Rossiya Island off the coast. But it is unclear whether the fleet represents security or danger in the current political and economic disarray. A year ago, an ammunition dump exploded, lighting up the sky with the force of an atomic bomb and scattering debris and ordnance over much of the city. More recently, two naval recruits died on Rossiya Island of malnutrition, evidently victims of hazing.
Such incidents are only a part of the deterioration and chaos that have characterized the military since the breakup of the Soviet empire. Shortages of fuel, recruits and money led to corruption, low morale, and schemes to sell fuel oil and parts of ships for profit. After the death of the two sailors, the fleet commander was dismissed and an investigative commission spent two weeks in Vladivostok, but the findings have not been made public.
But the fact that such incidents are now known to everyone and devoured by the press mark a major change. Sitting with an American reporter at fleet headquarters, the new fleet commander, Vice Adm. Oleg M. Faleyev, admitted to a curious sensation.
 
'It Used to Be Simply Wild'
 "It used to be simply wild," he said. "Before, the skipper of a naval vessel was instructed to hide his face when a foreign plane flew overhead." Admiral Faleyev still declined to disclose the number of active ships or sailors, but he insisted that after the initial investigation, the Defense Ministry had found the fleet back in battle trim.
The cutbacks in military spending have also obviously hurt the city. Officials acknowledged they had no figures, but given the integrated structure of the old Soviet command economy, the navy was a central force in the city.
For years the people of Vladivostok were as isolated from the outside world as foreigners were from the closed city. While the lives of most residents revolve around the ships, there is light industry in the area, which employs other people. Until now, Vladivostok's residents led protected, somewhat coddled lives because the Soviet Government made sure that the closed cities were well supplied. In Vladivostok, people were not used to the long lines Muscovites were resigned to, and they emerged into the capitalist world wide-eyed, pouncing on commercial opportunities with less sophistication and experience but with more enthusiasm than their counterparts in other cities.
But many a civilian institute or maintenance facility made its living off the military, and the many idle warships and dry docks speak of hard times.
 
New Mission: Chasing Pirates
 The troubled times themselves have created new missions. Among the ships docked that day was the antisubmarine vessel Petropavlovsk, just returned from several weeks in the South China Sea hunting for pirates who have taken to preying on Russian freighters.
None were apprehended. But the skipper, Capt. 2d Class Vladimir I. Cheparsky, said the purpose was to show pirates that there were risks to toying with the Russian bear, even if he was not at full strength.
If the navy has faded somewhat, the slack has been taken up by the merchant and fishing fleets. Freighters of the Far Eastern Shipping Company now do a lively business plying the world's trade routes, returning only to unload the accumulated loot of the merchant sailors.
Fishing trawlers, freed of mandatory deliveries to the domestic market, now sell up to 80 percent of their catch for dollars.
But here, too, the chaos of Russia's transition takes a toll. At the provincial administrative center, an incongruous white skyscraper on the harbor, known locally as the "Wisdom Tooth," the deputy commissioner for foreign trade, Viktor P. Tumanov, told a tale that would sound incredible to anyone who has not spent time in Russia these last two years.
In the first rush of privatization, he said, many freighters were sold off for a song. But some of the new owners fell prey to the suspicion many of Russia's new entrepreneurs harbor about tomorrow. Rather than recycle their earnings into fuel and maintenance, they simply delivered a load, collected a quick profit and abandoned the ship in some distant port.
 
Captain Held Hostage in Africa
 In one case, the Ivory Coast is holding a Russian sea captain hostage until someone pays the fees for his ship. There are as many as 40 other Russian ships similarly amassing harbor fees.
Not all tales of doing business in the new Russia are as extraordinary. One of the biggest prospective deals in the Far East, a large logging operation north of Vladivostok involving Hyundai of South Korea, was stopped by pressure from conservatives opposed to any export of raw materials who joined forces with environmentalists and a small native tribe, the Udege.
For now, probably the biggest business in the city is used cars. Starting with a trickle two years ago, the importing of used Japanese cars has turned into a torrent, inundating Vladivostok and most of the Far East with remarkably similar white, boxy Nissans, Toyotas, Hondas and the like -- all with right-hand drive.
A sailor can bring one car in per trip for a quick profit. Prices for a five-year-old car in good condition are in the $1,000 range, much less than for a new Russian Lada. About 120,000 cars were imported last year.
 
Yeltsin Opposed Car Imports
 In March, President Boris N. Yeltsin tried to put an end to the imports of right-hand-drive cars. The uproar was predictable: the entire Far Eastern Shipping Company threatened to walk out, and just before the referendum in April, Mr. Yeltsin backed down.
In the referendum, Vladivostok gave Mr. Yeltsin and his economic reforms a larger percentage of the vote than the nation as a whole. Otherwise, local politics has been much like Moscow's, only with a delay of several months.
Here too, as in Moscow and many other provinces, the legislature elected under the Communists tangled endlessly with a reformist Governor appointed by Mr. Yeltsin, Vladimir S. Kuznetsov. The President finally gave in and let him go, and on May 18 the legislature voted 146 to 7 to replace him with the director of a mining operation, Yevgeny I. Nazdratenko.
Similar changes have taken place in the neighboring provinces of Kamchatka and Khabarovsk, reflecting a nationwide shift from the first generation of radical reformers to more conservative industrial managers.
 
Achievements of First Wave
 Few regretted Mr. Kuznetsov's departure. An international economist by training, he was accused of spending too much time abroad, and too little on his province's problems. But his last words could be an epitaph for the entire first wave of economic pioneers.
"In conditions of crisis, the good is rarely perceived," he told a hushed legislature. "But I have to say this, that all our work was for a new political culture. And if the result is that you can now make the choice you just made, I take this as a good sign. We were clean and honest with you, and that in itself is a major achievement in our lives.
"Whatever you say here, there was real reform, real privatization. Reform in our province has been given real momentum. It can be hindered, but not stilled."

HEADLINE: Scientists Say U.S. Must Slash Northwest Timber Harvesting

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
Government scientists will recommend that President Clinton reduce timber harvests in the Northwest's ancient forests by at least 60 percent from what they were in the mid-1980's, Administration officials said today.
None of the alternatives that the scientists are devising would let loggers cut more than two billion board feet of wood a year from national forests in Oregon and Washington, said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
 That is substantially below the five billion-plus board feet that the industry harvested on those lands each year from 1983 to 1987, before the dispute over the northern spotted owl and protection of ancient forests wound up in court.
A second Government official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the group's final recommendation for the maximum annual timber harvest could be 1.5 billion board feet.
A board foot is one-foot square by one inch thick. It takes about 10,000 board feet of lumber for a single-family house.
The formal recommendation, expected in early June, represents a bitter disappointment for a logging industry, which has argued that the Government cares more about the threatened owl than jobs.
It also presents President Clinton with a new dose of political reality. Despite his pledge to find a compromise, strict compliance with environmental laws probably mandates putting thousands of people out of work.
 
Harm to Industry Cited
 Mark Rey, executive director of the industry's American Forest and Paper Association, said dropping harvests as low as 2.5 billion board feet would cost the region tens of thousands of timber jobs. The industry claims it has already lost more than 30,000 jobs since the dispute began.
Mr. Clinton commissioned a working group of scientists on April 2 to report back in 60 days on how much logging could safely be allowed in the Northwest's ancient forests. The group, based in Portland, Ore., is nearing completion of its work.
The scientists' recommendations are part of a puzzle that Mr. Clinton must put together. Two working groups, one on economics and the other on unified Government responses, also were to report back to the President by June 2. Administration officials say it is unlikely they will meet the deadline.
Marla Romash, spokeswoman for Vice President Al Gore and the White House Office on Environmental Policy, rejected the notion that the Administration's focus was too narrow and favored environmentalists.
Congress has tried to find a solution since the Fish and Wildlife Service declared the northern spotted owl a threatened species in 1990. The Forest Service says the owl's dwindling numbers signify a threat to the entire ecosystem in the ancient forests.

HEADLINE: An Expert on Cities, at Home in the World

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
Jane Jacobs is lost in Toronto. Among the world's pre-eminent "foot people," as she termed urbanites like herself in "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," she is riding in the passenger seat of a car, looking uncharacteristically puzzled.
More than three decades have passed since Mrs. Jacobs, now 77, wrote "The Death and Life of Great American Cities." Many books are hyped as "seminal." Few books, certainly few books written in the second half of this century, can be said to have truly affected the way large numbers of people think and live. "Death and Life" is one. 
 It was published when the full, combined weight of government and academe was behind the wholesale destruction of old neighborhoods and their replacement with highways and housing projects. Mrs. Jacobs's book was an impassioned liberal response to the liberal urban-planning establishment, written in lively, jargon-free prose, based not on abstract theories but on the observation of how cities actually operate. "Clinging as closely to reality as a squirrel to a nut" is one way her approach has been described. Even now -- the book has lately been reissued as part of Random House's Modern Library series, which includes classics by the likes of Tolstoy, Joyce and Proust -- what Mrs. Jacobs observed about cities 30 years ago rings astonishingly true.
 
Dear? Sweet?
 The book, like much else she has done as a writer and community advocate, was incendiary. But she certainly doesn't look like a rabble-rouser, dressed in poncho and sneakers. She greets a visitor warmly, with a quick, friendly laugh that can bring to mind Margaret Rutherford in the old Miss Marple movies. Only slowly does she reveal the stubborn, self-assured determination that once prompted Roger Starr, a former adversary as the executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council in New York, to say: "What a dear, sweet character she isn't."
Mrs. Jacobs has proved herself to be nothing if not fearless in the face of authority. She took on Marx and John Maynard Keynes in "Cities and the Wealth of Nations" and Adam Smith in "The Economy of Cities." She argued for the breakup of Canada in "Quebec and the Struggle over Sovereignty." The latest of her five books, "Systems of Survival" (Random House), is a revaluation of morality in the form of a Platonic dialogue among a group of often testy New Yorkers. ("Originally I placed them in Toronto but people here are so polite -- it's one reason I like it here -- that I couldn't get the characters to argue properly," she says. "People in New York are blunt, even downright rude.")
Each book has led naturally to the next: from writing about how people function within cities, she analyzed how cities function within nations, how nations function with one another and, finally, how everyone functions in a world of conflicting moral principles. Invariably, the problems she tackles are almost ridiculously sweeping. Yet her home-grown prescriptions never are. Mrs. Jacobs prefers diversity to conformity, decentralization to centralization, natural growth to drastic change.
 
An Observant Child
 By her own account, she has been a contrarian from childhood. As a schoolgirl in in Scranton, Pa., whose downtown she recalls lovingly, she was "told in fourth grade that cities originated near waterfalls because that was where mills could be built."
"But this was obviously untrue in Scranton," she said, "and I said so to my teacher. There was a scenic waterfall in the area, but the city certainly wasn't there."
Mrs. Jacobs skipped college and went to work in New York City. When, as an editor of Architectural Forum, she began writing "The Death and Life" on a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, a group of urban planners from Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology summoned her to Cambridge, Mass. "They had it all figured out, that I should be writing on the results of a questionnaire on middle-class housing projects," she said. "I was so grateful to be independent of the academic establishment. I thought, how awful it would be to have my future hinge on such people and such decisions."
Mrs. Jacobs's independent-mindedness has been especially apparent since she made herself a thorn in the side of New York City officials in the 1960's by spearheading a group that blocked William Zeckendorf, the developer, in collaboration with those officials, from tearing down a large stretch of her old West Village neighborhood to make way for a new high-rise complex. In 1968 -- as a 51-year-old mother of three children -- she was arrested on charges of second-degree riot and criminal mischief for disrupting a public meeting on the proposed construction of an expressway that would have sliced across lower Manhattan and displaced hundreds of families and businesses.
And in 1969, shortly after she moved to Toronto with her husband, Robert H. Jacobs, an architect, and their children, in protest over the Vietnam War, Mrs. Jacobs joined the opposition to a highway that would have cut into the middle of the city, as it happened along the street, Spadina, on which her family then lived.
She was also among those who in 1972 disrupted a wrecking crew while it was on the verge of destroying the place she is trying to find by car as we talk, a building that today functions as the Dundas Sherbourne Community House. It is "where the revolution started," Mrs. Jacobs says, by which she means the revolution to overthrow local planning moguls who wanted to tear down old structures like that one in the name of progress. The struggle to save the Dundas Sherbourne Community House was the Boston Tea Party of Toronto's urban revolution, Mrs. Jacobs says.
 
What Makes a City
 But it is not easy for her to find at first. After almost passing it by, Mrs. Jacobs spots it: a pleasant, unpretentious, old yellow-brick two-story affair with a ramshackle porch -- a neighborhood favorite -- although not obviously the sort of building to provoke a revolution.
Yet that is, in a way, Mrs. Jacobs's point: cities, healthy cities, at least, are not made up simply of grand statements and coherently designed suites of buildings, as the failures of one utopian scheme after another has often painfully demonstrated, but rather of quotidian, unpredictable, even anarchic assortments of structures. The Dundas Sherbourne Community House, knitted into the complex fabric of the street, is special precisely because it is so average.
Mrs. Jacobs contends that Toronto is realizing the dreams that she once had for New York City but that she says as often as not failed to come true there: examples of safe, lively neighborhoods that mix businesses and residences and one ethnic group with another; of renovations that have given life to once dead parts of town, and of new housing gracefully meshed with old, as on Sherbourne Street. There, in response to the protests of Mrs. Jacobs and others, new houses, instead of replacing old buildings like the Community House, have been tucked so discreetly behind the existing low-rise structures that they can't be seen from the sidewalk. Toronto may not be the most beautiful city, but to Mrs. Jacobs it is among the most livable, open-minded and optimistic.
And no place here better illustrates Mrs. Jacobs's ideal conception of city life than her own neighborhood, in the area known as the Annex. The Jacobses' house, on a quiet residential street, is modest and comfortable, a place lived in but not designed, with its 1960's-ish white furniture surrounding the fireplace in the living room and a basket full of empty cereal boxes for kindling.
 
A Community of Differences
 Her son lives up the block, and as Mrs. Jacobs walks down the street she is greeted by neighbors: a banker delivering a box of checks to her, a woman living in a rooming house nearby. The Annex is full of people of different incomes, different nationalities. Bloor Street, the busy thoroughfare at the corner, is crowded with offices, stores and restaurants, including a few Hungarian ones that date back several decades to when this was a Hungarian enclave.
In the 1950's, the houses on Mrs. Jacobs's block were almost torn down to make way for a development; Mrs. Jacobs proudly recounts the story of the housekeeper whose employers bequeathed her their home, which she refused to sell to the developer, even though she didn't even live in it. Thanks to this kindred spirit, Mrs. Jacobs says, the neighborhood was saved.
Up the street near Bloor is a development that for once Mrs. Jacobs fought for when others in the community were against it. The development consists of a suite of differently designed, multi-family homes in what used to be a derelict park. It is the sort of in-fill housing that blends seamlessly into the neighborhood. Mrs. Jacobs directs the car past an unlikely site, the Sky Dome, where the Blue Jays play baseball. Because the Sky Dome is amid downtown office buildings with ample parking and easily accessible by public transit, it did not require the sort of vast parking lots that turn the areas surrounding most stadiums into wastelands. The Sky Dome also incorporates stores and hotels that make it active even during the off season.
"Before it was built, I had thought that would be a terrible site for a stadium, blighting the area like other stadiums," Mrs. Jacobs admits. "But I was wrong. I am wrong plenty of times, you know."

HEADLINE: ITHACA JOURNAL;
An Alternative to Cash, Beyond Banks or Barter

DATELINE: ITHACA, N.Y.

 BODY:
NO matter how the gross national product is faring, enterprising residents of this small city have a way to keep the goods and services in motion. The secret? An alternative currency.
Since November 1991 this community scrip whose name is Ithaca HOURS has extended the local economy beyond the borders of cash and credit trading. 
 Paul Glover, a city native, graphics designer and community economist, originated the system, which he recently discussed over tofu (paid for with HOURS) at the ABC Cafe.
"It all came together when my back went out," Mr. Glover said.
That was about two years ago. Three weeks in bed, "staring at the ceiling" and thinking about ways to improve the local economy, brought his Eureka! moment. He imagined a system of printed notes that would let people exchange their labor without resorting to cash or direct barter.
Right away, Mr. Glover made some sketches. When he was upright again, he copied the sample bills.
"Then," he said, "I ran around town signing up friends and acquaintances."
That first round of presentations yielded 90 people willing to try the idea. Today, more than 700 businesses and individuals have signed up to use Ithaca HOURS. A monthly paper, Ithaca Money, lists names, phone numbers, offers and requests in classified and larger display ads.
Ithaca's new currency system has historical roots. In the Depression, when banks were failing and government payrolls faltered because of lack of revenue, communities all over the United States discovered the practicality of going beyond the official legal tender.
Governments, unions, churches and civil groups issued currency certificates that are now collectors' items. Some communities even experimented with new designs: Seattle issued money made of cardboard, and its neighbor Tenino, Wash., produced quarters, half-dollars and dollars of Sitka spruce.
Mr. Glover thinks the system is so popular because it works for Ithaca, a town of 29,500 residents that is home to Cornell University and Ithaca College.
"Dollars come to Ithaca, shake a few hands, then leave to buy rainforest lumber and fight wars," he said. "HOURS stay in the community and help us hire each other."
Ithaca HOURS allow participants more flexibility than a pure barter system could. They also streamline record-keeping. Members who accept HOURS can spend them as they choose. There is no requirement that transactions be logged into a central computer, or that exchanges be made on the basis of a predetermined price.
Becoming part of the HOURS network is easy. Prospective members list the products or services they will exchange for HOURS and pay a $1 registration fee. A startup grant of four HOURS (equivalent to $40) is issued to each new member, along with voting rights in the organization's governing body, the noisily democratic Barter Potluck.
One of the questions before the Potluck is how to regulate the money supply; a recent calculation showed that about 3,400 HOURS were in circulation. The group is also trying to recruit people who provide basic goods and services, like food and carpentry, so the currency can be more widely used.
For some participants, HOURS attract an otherwise unavailable clientele. Becca Haber, a self-described herbal educator, shares information with clients who cannot afford either conventional health care or her alternative counseling on a cash basis.
"We have people in this community with very little money. They want to learn this," said Ms. Haber, who accepts HOURS as payment in full.
Although HOURS participants report many positive impressions, some business owners are reluctant to accept alternative money. At a recent Saturday Farmers' Market, where many merchants accept HOURS, a few expressed reservations.
Scott Stull of CRS Growers is sticking with cash. "I have a philosophical problem with the idea," he said. "I don't trust it."
But Jane North, proprietor of Northland Sheep Dairy, is a believer.
"I've always been into barter," she said. "It's honest exchange. It's more personal."
Mr. Glover, the originator of the system, wants to spread the idea beyond Ithaca. He has created a mail-order kit that offers information on how to get started.
Alternative money is legal, within certain limits.
The bad news? It must be reported to the Internal Revenue Service.

HEADLINE: Pressure Mounting on Guatemalan in Power Grab

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GUATEMALA, May 30

 BODY:
President Jorge Serrano Elias's hold on the almost dictatorial powers he seized last week appeared to be weakening today as the pressure against him mounted at home and abroad.
The country's electoral court threw a major obstacle into Mr. Serrano's path late Saturday, announcing that until he restored constitutional order it would not sanction the new elections he has called. 
 And after hearing appeals for a return to democracy from delegates of the Organization of American States, military commanders strongly suggested that their support for the President was waning.
"This should worry us," the Defense Minister, Gen. Jose Domingo Garcia Samayoa, said of the international pressures on the Government, "and we should be very respectful of them."
Speaking as he left a meeting with the O.A.S. Secretary General, Joao Baena Soares, and other officials, General Garcia Samayoa, added, "This gives us space to be able to make recommendations on the situation." The general had previously been steadfast in his support for the President.
Mr. Serrano scrambled to respond to the growing criticism of the measures he imposed on Tuesday, which included the dissolution of the Congress and the Supreme Court and the suspension of basic constitutional rights.
Addressing the nation by radio and television on Saturday night and this afternoon, Mr. Serrano softened his tone markedly. Abandoning his initial call for the election of a constituent assembly to write a new constitution, he invited political parties and civic groups to join in preparing a national referendum on constitutional reforms.
But while Mr. Serrano even praised some members of the Congress and courts, he gave no indication he might allow them back to work. "We have the obligation to look forward," he said.
The unexpected refusal of the five members of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal to sanction new elections appeared to mean that Mr. Serrano would either have to come up with a new plan or dissolve that body, too.
The court is independent of the executive branch, and the five national elections it has overseen since 1985 have been widely accepted as legitimate by the country's political parties.
The president of the tribunal, Arturo Herbruger, said the Constitution would have to be fully restored before any new vote could be held. He left unclear whether the ruling, given to Mr. Serrano in a letter on Saturday, meant that he merely had to restore rights like freedom of speech and habeas corpus, or reinstall the Congress and Supreme Court.
By his afternoon, Government opponents seemed to be taking the offensive.
In a country of profound social, economic and ethnic divisions, the campaign to undermine Mr. Serrano found left-wing unions organizing with right-wing business groups, and Indian leaders like Rigoberta Menchu, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, meeting with members of the white aristocracy.
People familiar with the talks said the groups had yet to settle on a common strategy. But as Mr. Serrano's backing appeared to erode, growing numbers of his opponents, including the Government's human rights ombudsman, Ramiro de Leon Carpio, began calling for his resignation.
"He is fighting for his life as President," one diplomat in the O.A.S. delegation said. "He is realizing that he has no real support. His ability to negotiate is weakening every hour."
The stance of the conservative armed forces was likely to determine the outcome, many analysts said.
As recently as Friday afternoon, General Garcia Samayoa had hotly disputed any suggestion of division or uncertainty within the military. But soldiers have kept conspicuously off the streets in recent days, and people close to the officer corps have spoken of increasing dissent within it.
Among those who have questioned Mr. Serrano's measures, these people said, have been many younger officers, the head of one of the two army brigades in the capital and members of the general staff.

HEADLINE: Low Rates: A Limited Blessing

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
With Government spending rejected as a stimulus, Americans have become dependent on low interest rates to revive the economy -- and this has helped. But low rates alone cannot expand the economy any faster than the slow pace at which it is now growing.
Housing and car sales have risen as a result of low rates, which make financing more affordable, and retail sales have also benefited. But a wide range of economists, executives and industry experts say that low rates cannot alone squeeze much more out of these key industries, unless obstacles like wage stagnation and the high prices of some homes are overcome.
 
'In the Very Long Run'
 "It will be very hard to get the economy to grow more rapidly than it now is growing," said David Wyss, chief economist at Data Resources Inc., a consulting and data-gathering company. "Can low interest rates generate enough jobs and income to offset the work lost in defense and other industries? Maybe they can in the very long run, but not now." 
Previous recoveries since World War II have benefited from incentives besides low rates, including strong export growth, a rush by companies to replenish inventories and rising employment as business picks up. For various reasons, all these have been absent lately.
Of course, if economic growth stalls -- as it seems to have done in the second quarter, when the growth rate fell to less than 1 percent -- Congress could revive economic-stimulus measures, as President Clinton had requested at the outset of his term.
The failure of the economy to expand at an annual rate above 3 percent, the minimum considered necessary to bring down unemployment, has raised the determination of some Clinton Administration officials to try yet again to win approval for Government spending on public works to create jobs.
"If it were not for the political environment, the ideal scenario would be a strong stimulus, and then once the economy was back on track -- growing at 3.5 percent a year or more -- then serious deficit reduction," said Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich. "But this is not a political climate in which John Maynard Keynes would flourish."
Keynesian theory holds that in a weak economy, with idle workers, the Government should spend to put them back to work and reduce unemployment, which is now reported at 7 percent of the labor force. But under such assumptions, the spending must be financed by raising the deficit; otherwise it would not serve as a stimulus. And for the moment, additional deficit spending is not on the agenda.
 
Hardly the National Mood
 So the only stimulus currently available is whatever low interest rates can provide.
Lower rates tend to encourage a certain amount of extra spending by corporations. At some point, though, executives look for more orders before they are willing to expand their operations and hire workers. And whatever encouragement consumers draw from low rates, they often hesitate to buy when they do not see their incomes rising.
"Personal incomes are barely keeping pace with inflation, limiting people's ability to spend, regardless of the carrot of low rates," Mr. Wyss said.
Still, low interest rates have helped the economy in recent months. With mortgages less costly, families have moved to home ownership from the rental of apartments, and the construction of single-family homes has risen, creating jobs.
Interest rates on 30-year home mortgages now average 7.8 percent, down nearly 4 percentage points from 1990. For a $100,000 mortgage, that represents $100,000 in savings on payments over the life of the mortgage, or $275 a month, said David Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America.
But mortgage savings barely offset the steep rise in house prices that occurred during the 1980's. And while home ownership has become more affordable for some people, the lower rates have not managed to push up ownership among young families to any significant degree. Ownership by families with breadwinners in their 20's and early 30's is under 50 percent of all households, Mr. Brobeck said, and requires a household income of $50,000, well above the $30,000 median household income.
 
Projection on Building
 Such dynamics help to explain why David F. Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders, is only mildly optimistic. New-housing starts rose last month to 1.21 million, at an annual rate, from 1.14 million in March. But when the year ends, Mr. Seiders projects, ground will have been broken for only 1.3 million homes -- well below the 1980's, when an average year produced 1.5 million new homes and construction workers had steady jobs.
Perhaps the most important economic gain from low rates is supposed to come from corporations, many of them still burdened with debt from the 1980's.
Lower rates have pared debt payments, saving companies more than $60 billion a year -- money that can be invested in machinery and equipment. And many companies have made these investments. The ones that are making the new machinery have added workers. But the companies purchasing it have mainly used such machines and equipment to cut costs, often by replacing workers.
"This restructuring is still in process and will remain in force into next year, although the fallout is limited employment," the economist Henry Kaufman said.
 
Car Sales Help
 Low auto-loan rates -- a four-year car loan now averages about 8.5 percent -- helped to push car and truck sales to an annual rate of more than 14 million vehicles, the highest level in several years. But even that is well below the industry's capacity of 18 million vehicles in the United States. That means Ford, to meet the demand for its popular Explorer four-wheel-drive vehicle, can rely on existing plants and on overtime.
"We have the Explorer plant in Louisville on 10-hour shifts, two shifts a day," said Joel Pitcoff, a Ford Motor Company analyst. "But there is not enough demand for a third shift. To justify hiring a third shift, you would need 50 percent more output in a given plant. That is a huge amount."
And then there is consumer credit, where rates have not come down as much as for other kinds of borrowing. Revolving credit -- mainly resulting from purchases made with bank credit cards or department-store charge cards -- has risen more than any other category of consumer debt. Annual interest rates on these cards still run 17 percent or more for most consumers.
 
Effects of Easy Credit
 "That is because banks and non-banks, like A.T.& T., are aggressively offering these cards and they are easier to get than a standard loan," said Mr. Brobeck of the consumer federation.
The results show up in appliance sales: stoves, washers, dryers, dishwashers and refrigerators. All rose last year and many of the purchases were made with credit cards, according to Marian Stamos, a vice president of the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers.
Sales this year are running about even with 1992, and at a convention last month of people who make kitchen and bathroom appliances, the manufacturers said they were pleased, Ms. Stamos said, adding: "But no one said, 'We have it made.' There was concern about the impact on purchases from lack of job creation. Americans are concerned about their jobs."
J. C. Penney, the nationwide retailer, reports the same heavy use of credit cards. Roughly 50 percent of its customers make purchases with credit cards, and many avoid the finance charges by paying their bills within 60 days, said Ira Silver, Penney's chief economist.
For Penney, the lower rates have meant that thousands of homeowners are shopping with the money that once went into monthly mortgage payments, Mr. Silver said. But even so, Penney's sales are rising only mildly. Without more jobs, Mr. Silver added, mild sales gains are the likely trend for the rest of the year.

HEADLINE: Travel Industry Looks at Approach of Summer, and Smiles

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
As more than 28 million Americans traveled 100 miles or more from their homes this Memorial Day weekend, the traditional start of the summer vacation season, the travel industry is looking hopefully at the weeks ahead.
Even in the face of sluggish signals in the economy generally, "nearly every indicator we checked points to a strong summer travel season," said Paul R. Verkuil, president of the American Automobile Association. 
 By the traditional end of the vacation season, Labor Day, on Sept. 6 this year, Americans are expected by the experts to have taken a record 232 million "person-trips" -- one person traveling 100 miles or more from home. That would be 9 million more than last summer and a 4 percent increase over a year ago, according to the Travel Industry Association of America, a not-for-profit group in Washington.
Equally impressive, in the view of tourism officials, the increase will follow last summer's surprising 8 percent gain, sparked by the half-price sale that put 24 million passengers on airplanes in the three summer months, including 9 million who would not otherwise have flown.
Despite more people than ever waiting until the last minute to make travel arrangements, so many people have already made plans that rental car and hotel reservations are running well ahead of recent years.
"Advance reservations for the next 90 days are up 15 percent at our Ramada Inns and 5 to 10 percent at Howard Johnson and Days Inns," said Bob McGrail, senior executive vice president of Hospitality Franchise Systems, which has almost 3,500 hotels and motels nationwide.
Most vacationers will again visit family or friends, but millions will also go camping or cruising, or swimming, or travel to Europe or Eureka.
Many East Coast beach resorts, including Long Island and the New Jersey shore, also expect a good year, provided the weather cooperates.
 
A Variety of Events
 The events that will attract the crowds are as varied as the thousands of places people will go. In June alone, vacationers can attend a brass band festival in Danville, Ky., a rose festival in Portland, Ore., or a three-day festival in Warren, Ark., celebrating the tomato. But they will have to wait until Aug. 4 to see the crowning of "Miss Crustacean," the winner of an annual beauty contest in Ocean City, N.J.
The urge to commune with nature is still so strong that the National Park Service again expects more summer visitors (282 million) than the nation's population (250 million).
The urge to commune with nature in a more measured way is also strong -- so much so that vacationers are expected to make up the bulk of the visitors this summer at the National Zoo in Washington, where the Amazonia exhibit that was seven years in the making is now open; at the Moody Gardens in Galveston, Tex., where an acre of rain forest recently opened under a 10-story glass pyramid, and at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden, where the biggest project in the zoo's 120-year-history, the jungle exhibit, opens July 10.
The trend to "eco-tourism" is in the theme amusement parks more than ever this summer, too. Sea World of Florida, for example, just opened. "Manatees: The Last Generation?," which includes advice on how to help save those endangered animals from extinction. Busch Gardens Williamsburg, in Virginia, just opened a display wiht six bald eagles that were injured in the wild and cannot return to nature.
Yet despite the emphasis on the outdoors, a surprising 18 percent of vacationers plan to visit cities this summer, up from 13 percent two years ago. New York, Boston and San Francisco, among others, are wooing those out-of-towners as never before with special promotions and discount packages.
"We don't care if they leave their heart in San Francisco," a New York tourism official said the other day, "just as long as they leave their paychecks in the Big Apple."
To encourage them, a public-private partnership has raised more than $1.3 billion to promote New York's cultural, athletic and theatrical events, even offering discount coupons for shoppers. With the blessing of City Hall, many restaurants will move outdoors during the week of July 6-11 Moreover, 100 of the city's restaurants will also offer lunches that week for $19.93.
Executives in the tourism industry say one reason for their optimism is that despite a lukewarm economic recovery and declining consumer confidence, travel costs in the country have lagged behind the rate of inflation and Americans continue to choose shorter and less expensive vacations.
Thus the typical vacation this summer will average 4.8 nights, and a family of four traveling by auto will spend an average of $188 a day for food and lodging, according to the automobile association. While that is up $5 since last year, it is only 3 percent higher than the last two years combined -- the smallest two-year rise since the mid-1960's.
Moreover, the cost of travel in the United States dropped 0.5 percent in April, the first monthly decline this year, according to the U.S. Travel Data Center, in Washington.
If money were no object, many Americans would like to vacation in Hawaii (15 percent) and Australia (9 percent), a recent New York Times/ CBS News poll found. The poll found that other popular destinations included Alaska, Florida and California.
Various polls, including those by the American Society of Travel Agents and the American Bus Association, found strong interest in Yellowstone National Park; Branson, Mo.; Glacier National Park in Montana; the 78-acre Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., and the gambling casinos in Atlantic City, the casino at Ledyard, Conn., and the riverboat gambling at Morton, Minn., and Biloxi, Miss.
Washington's popularity is attributed to the new Presidency. President Clinton's native Arkansas also expects a big influx of vacationers.
In fact, most Southern states are predicting a strong tourist season, from the Civil War battlefields of Virginia to the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.
The admission price to Disney World in Orlando is $1 more this year than last: $35 for those 10 or older a day at either the Magic Kingdom, the Epcot Center or the Disney M-G-M Studios Theme Park. A ticket good at all three parks, over four days, is $125 each.
In Anaheim, Calif., home of Disneyland and other theme parks, hotel occupancy for the first three months of this year increased 3.2 percent over the same period last year, to 65.7 percent.
Bob and Edwina Ericsson of Glenview, Ill., are among the thousands who will be traveling this summer. They have booked passage aboard the 420-passenger Mississippi Queen, a paddlewheeler, for a seven-day river trip in August from Chattanooga, Tenn., to St. Louis -- their 11th river cruise.
"My wife always says you get on as a passenger," Mr. Ericsson said, "and after eating al that food you get off as cargo."

HEADLINE: Germany Links Iran to Kurds' Killing

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, May 30

 BODY:
Prosecutors have charged that Iran ordered the assassination of prominent Kurdish leaders who were killed in a hail of bullets at a Berlin restaurant eight months ago.
New indictments assert that an agent of the Iranian intelligence service, Kazem Darabi, received orders from superiors in Teheran to kill the Kurds during their visit to a meeting of the Socialist International here. He is said to have planned and carried out the shootings with the help of four Lebanese confederates. All are under arrest. Four people were killed in the attack. 
 The indictments have already prompted calls for Germany to break diplomatic relations with Iran. The Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl has resisted those pressures, but diplomatic consequences are considered likely if the case results in a guilty verdict.
In a statement the day after the killings, the Iranian Embassy in Bonn disclaimed any involvement. It had no comment after the new indictments, which were announced Thursday.
 
Links to Iran Suspected
 Mr. Darabi has lived in Berlin for years, and other Iranians here have long suspected him of having ties to the Iranian intelligence service, known by the acronym Vevak. The local police had also listed him as potentially dangerous. On Friday, one day after he was indicted, leaders of all parties in the Berlin City Council agreed to name a committee to investigate why he had been allowed to live and work here.
Iranian dissidents in Paris have long complained that Germany was tolerating what Massoud Rajavi, president of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, last year called "nests of terror and espionage" run by Iranian intelligence. The French magazine L'Express recently said that Germany's loose asylum laws, which were tightened by Parliament last week, have allowed Iranian agents to function here with relative ease.
News of the killings last Sept. 17 shocked and outraged many residents of Berlin, where the use of firearms is rare, even by criminals. At least 10 Iranian dissidents had been killed in Geneva, London, Vienna and Paris since 1987, but the gangland-style quadruple slaying in Berlin was the first such incident on German soil.
The most prominent victim was Sadegh Sharafkandi, secretary general of the Iranian Democratic Party of Kurdistan. Last week's indictments describe that party as the most important political organization representing Iran's Kurdish minority.
Also killed in the attack were the party's European representative, Fattah Abdouli, and its German representative, Homayoun Ardalan. The fourth victim was a translator, Mohammedpour Dehkordi.
The 20 million Kurds are scattered among several countries, most of which deny them full rights. About half live in Turkey, where some are engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Government. About 4.5 million live in Iraq, 2.5 million in Iran, and smaller numbers in Syria and several former Soviet republics. Some of those in Iraq are living under the protection of the United States and its allies in the northern part of the country.
Many Kurdish groups favor the establishment of autonomous Kurdish regions and ultimately a Kurdish state, and they are considered hostile by governments that rule them.
 
Lebanese Militia Named
 Two of the four Lebanese men accused of aiding Mr. Darabi in the Berlin killings, Youssef Amin and Abba Rhayel, were named in the indictment as members of the pro-Iranian Party of God militia. Another, Atallah Ayad, was said to belong to another militia, the Syrian-backed Amal.
After the indictment was issued by the chief federal prosecutor, Alexander von Stahl, Berlin's Green party issued a statement demanding that Germany cut all ties with Iran, even banning it from participating in a forthcoming international food exposition here. One of the signers was Ismail Hakki Kosan, a member of City Council who is of Kurdish descent.
"Iranian state terrorism on German soil must have a consequence," the statement said.
The Munich newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung said Germany could not act in the absence of a guilty verdict, but would be required to do so if one is reached.
 
'Sensational' Accusation
 "There is a growing belief that the Iranian secret service is directing terror attacks abroad," the newspaper said in an editorial. "This makes it all the more sensational that federal prosecutor Von Stahl, in his indictment of the alleged murderers of four Kurdish opposition politicians, asserts that the ringleader of the Berlin attack was Kazen Darabi, an agent of the Iranian secret service Vevak."
"Such a charge, which undoubtedly affects relations between Bonn and Teheran, could hardly have been included in the indictment without the approval of the federal Government."
Germany has close economic ties to Iran, and some German exporters have lobbied the Government on Iran's behalf. Human rights groups have opposed any improvement in relations. They won a victory recently when Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel canceled a cultural agreement between the countries. He said he was reacting to Iran's renewed endorsement of the death sentence against the writer Salman Rushdie, who Iranian leaders say is guilty of slandering Islam.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Handicapping a G.O.P. Primary by the Ads

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
A poll isn't necessary to figure out who is leading in the race for the Republican nomination for Governor of New Jersey.
Take a look at the paid political advertisements now appearing on New York and Philadelphia television stations. 
 The ads paid for by Christine Todd Whitman have a soft, gauzy texture, showing the candidate talking about breadbasket issues. In one spot she refers to Jim Florio, the Democratic incumbent, as though she alone stands between the Governor and a second four-year term. There is no mention of Cary Edwards and James Wallwork, her actual opponents in the G.O.P. primary on June 8.
A rule of thumb in modern political campaigns on television is that a confident front-runner in a party primary strikes a positive note, shying away from personal attacks that might cause scars that could keep the party from unifying behind its nominee in the November general election. Personal attacks, however, are the cudgels picked up by the candidates trailing behind the leader.
 
Typical Trenton Brawling
 "Going negative to hurt the front-runner is now an automatic reflex in New Jersey politics," said Cliff Zukin, professor of political science at Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute.
In sharp contrast to the positive tone of Mrs. Whitman's ads, the Edwards and Wallwork television spots now hitting the airwaves take a much harsher approach, ganging up on Mrs. Whitman.
In a series of 15-second ads titled "Republican Reality Check" paid for by the Mr. Edwards's campaign, he is not featured at all. Instead, snapshots of Mrs. Whitman flash on the screen with cartoon-like blurbs floating above her head. The voice-over by a woman punches out questions about Mrs. Whitman's veracity and preparation for office, ending each spot with the question "Christine Todd Whitman? Can we afford the risk?"
The ads of Mr. Wallwork, considered the most conservative candidate in the race, attempt to portray Mrs. Whitman, seen in black and white photos, as a liberal.
All three candidates are campaigning against Governor Florio in their television spots, most notably Mr. Edwards, who has one ad in which the Governor's face is transformed into the Joker character in "Batman." Still, the campaigns of both Mr. Edwards and Mr. Wallwork have made Mrs. Whitman their main targets.
Perhaps they are responding to political realities; several factors conspire to make it difficult for an underdog to catch the front-runner in a statewide primary race. In the absence of overriding issues that galvanize public attention, it is hard for a lesser-known candidate to attract much notice, while trying to get the message out through paid advertising can be extremely expensive.
Thus, Professor Zukin said, the candidate who begins with the largest base of votes generally winds up winning.
 
The Benefits of Indifference
 If that holds true this year, Mrs. Whitman, who has led in newspaper polls of voter preference and has been campaigning among grass-roots Republicans for two years, should be in a position to win a party primary that usually attracts fewer than 400,000 voters. Nearly half of registered voters in New Jersey, which has a population of 7.5 million, are independents, while only 20 percent are registered as Republicans. Technically, undeclared voters may also vote in a party primary, but most do not.
The third debate between the three Republicans came and went Wednesday night without apparently attracting a great deal of notice. It was broadcast live only on the New Jersey Network, a noncommercial channel with low viewership.
"The primary campaign," said Professor Zukin, "typically is invisible until the last two weeks, when the television spots begin appearing."
But trying to reach voters by television is extraordinarily expensive in a state without a network affiliate based in the most populous areas. Candidates are forced to buy time on New York City and Philadelphia stations, the first and fourth most expensive media markets in the nation -- air time that is wasted on Democrats, independents and residents of other states.
 
Communications Barriers
 All three candidates have accepted public matching funds and therefore are limited to $2.6 million in total primary expenditures. The Whitman and Edwards camps each expect to spend more than $1 million on television alone, but aides complain that that sum does not buy enough air time to make a strong impact. The Wallwork campaign is expected to spend less than half as much as his rivals.
"New Jersey is the worst in the country in terms of communicating with voters," said Jay Smith, partner in the firm of Smith & Harroff, Alexandria, Va., which serves as media consultant to the Edwards campaign.
Further, New York and Philadelphia television stations give scant coverage to New Jersey political news, the so-called "free media" that candidates crave to inject excitement into a campaign.
The decision by the Edwards and Wallwork camps to concentrate their fire on Mrs. Whitman was forced by her ability to overcome gaffes on several issues without serious damage to her standing in the polls, according to campaign aides and outside experts.
"Our judgment on going negative was helped by the ability to throw her own words back at her in TV spots, using cartoon-like graphics that gave a comic bent to it," said William J. Palatucci, an Edwards adviser. "It was clearly time to raise questions about this person's preparation to be Governor."
 
Act of Desperation?
 Predictably, the Whitman camp sees the ads as a distortion.
"They've taken two unrelated facts in each spot and put in their own conclusion," asserted Sal Russo, media consultant to the Whitman campaign. "It's very unfair."
David P. Rebovich, professor of political science at Rider College, said voters often sense that a negative ad campaign "is a act of last-minute desperation." He also said there was a danger the ads might backfire on Mrs. Whitman's male opponents by "coloring a woman candidate as befuddled."
Jay Smith, manager of the Edwards campaign, disagreed.
"I don't believe that by using her own words against her we are crossing the line into unfairness," he said. "I guarantee that the stuff we already have on the air and coming up next week will hurt her and cut her lead."
The only question, he conceded, was whether enough voters were hearing the message to make a difference on June 8.

W. CARY EDWARDS
 
TITLE: Republican Reality Check: Education
 
CREATOR: Smith & Harroff, Alexandria, Va.
 
TEXT: (Voice-over) Christine Todd Whitman has never voted in a public school election. Why?
 
VISUAL: Photograph of Mrs. Whitman with cartoon bubble above her head with the printed words "We send our children to private schools." To the right the words "Public Schools" are within a circle with a red diagonal line across them.
 
TEXT: (Voice-over) "We send our children to private schools. I didn't feel informed."
 
Not informed?
 
Christine Todd Whitman?
 
Can we afford the risk?
 
ANALYSIS: The use of a woman to do the voiceover takes some of the hard edge off the mocking tone that questions Mrs. Whitman's qualifications to be Governor. The education spot seeks to drive deeper the notion planted by her foes that Mrs. Whitman's wealth puts her out of touch with average voters. Coupling her failure to vote in her local school district election - a lapse shared by most citizens - with her ability to afford private schools for her children, is by no means an air-tight syllogism that she is antagonistic to public education.
 
CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN
 
TITLE: Three Years Ago
 
CREATOR: Russo Marsh & Associates, Washington, D.C., and Sacramento, Calif.
 
VISUAL: Mrs. Whitman stands on a sidewalk on a sunny day, wearing a tailored suit, and talks directly at the camera with short chopping hand motions that convey strength and decisiveness.
 
TEXT: Three years ago, Jim Florio raised taxes over $2 billion. I said it was wrong then and I campaigned against it. But it passed anyway and it cost New Jersey over 300,000 jobs.
 
Now I'm running for Governor and I'm still campaigning against higher taxes, less waste and government reform will. Call for a copy of my economic blueprint and we'll work together to rebuild New Jersey.
 
ANALYSIS: Ascribing 300,000 job losses to Florio taxes while a Republican administration in Washington presided over a national recession that persists today is a hard one to swallow. Campaigning against higher taxes is easy (see Clinton, W.J.), but actually coming up with acceptible cuts after the election is another thing (see Clinton, W.J.).
 
JIM WALLWORK
 
TITLE: Taxes
 
CREATOR: Chris Matolla, Shooters Inc., Cherry Hill, N.J.
 
VISUAL: Photographs of Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Wallwork alternate with the mention of their names. The spot begins with the printed words "A Clear Choice for New Jerse."
 
TEXT: (Voice-over) Christine Todd Whitman voted to raise taxes 17 times.
 
Jim Wallwork is pledged to repeal all of Florio's taxes.
 
Christine Todd Whitman, a multimillionairre, voted to raise her own pay four times.
 
Jim Wallwork voted against all legislative pay increases.
 
Christine Todd Whitman is a liberal.
 
Jim Wallwork is proud to be called a conservative.
 
Jim Wallwork, the successful conservative businessman New Jersey needs.
 
ANALYSIS: Mrs. Whitman might be viewed in South Texas as a "liberal" but she is in the center of moderate Republicanism in New Jersey. The use of her three names with the description "multimillionaire" - as in the Edwards spots - seem designed to alienate her from good Americans with only two names and less that seven-figure bank accounts.

HEADLINE: Even Women at Top Still Have Floors to Do

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Alice M. Rivlin, the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, shops at her local Safeway, where she often runs into people who seem surprised to see her there.
She's just as surprised at their reaction. "How else do they think I'm going to get food?" she said as she sat in her office in the Old Executive Office Building. "Do they think I have a staff? I don't know what they think. All of us run households." 
 In a year when more women than ever before took seats in Congress and were appointed to important Government posts, and when the First Lady was given the responsibility for health-care reform, very little has changed at home for women who work, even at the highest levels.
 
12-Hour Days Plus
 For eight of these women, there are 12-hour workdays but little relief from all the traditional responsibilities at home: making macaroni and cheese, scrubbing floors and wiping runny little noses.
These officials are perhaps the most visible examples of the struggles that countless women who work outside the home continue to face. Women who are now competing with men at most levels in the professional world often say they still carry the major share of guilt about how they perform their traditional responsibilities, particularly the care of their children.
They are careful about asking for time off to pick up children at school or to stay home with them when they are sick. They scramble to be as productive as their male colleagues, sacrificing the usual office camaraderie to get their work done and get home earlier.
At best, younger women, like Carol M. Browner, 37, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Ann Stock, 46, the White House social secretary, have forged partnerships with their husbands to share household and child-care duties instead of merely helping with them. But not one of the eight has ever been able to do what men have done forever -- leave the responsibility for their families and their homes to their spouses.
Some younger women in Washington are trying to make their private lives more public to show that changing diapers and ironing are not impediments to professional success. "Let's face it," said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. "Women are good organizers. That means we can do really well at a lot of jobs."
But Senator Murray's celebration of her family life is the exception.
 
Subtle Surprises
 "The tendency is to think if you are a professional woman it's because you've turned your back on the traditional side," said Lucille Roybal-Allard, a first-term Democratic Representative from California, one of 23 new women in Congress this year, for a total to 54. "The tendency is not to recognize that we can excel as professionals without giving up our identity of being mother, wife and homemaker. People show surprise that I have interests outside my political career. There is subtle surprise, for example, that I would be interested in a recipe."
Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, seemed surprised that anyone would even ask whether she keeps house. "Of course," she said in an interview in her Capitol Hill office. "I think women always keep house," the Senator said. "It comes with the gender. Every career woman with a family does the wash, the laundry, scrubs floors, cleans the bathrooms, changes the beds. The man generally does not."
Senator Feinstein, 59, a former Mayor of San Francisco, has been married to her third husband, Richard C. Blum, an investment banker, for 14 years. "I haven't taught him to hang up his bath towel yet," she said. "Rather than nag, I don't bother anymore. I pick it up."
 
Leaving School, Guiltily
 Ms. Feinstein also belongs to the generation that had to give up her job after childbirth because maternity leave did not exist when her daughter was born. Representative Eva Clayton, Democrat of North Carolina, had to quit law school when she had her fourth child.
"I wasn't super enough to be a supermom," Mrs. Clayton, 58, said. "I left to be a mom. My husband was supportive, but I felt enormously guilty. I think I would do it differently now. I think I would know how to demand more of my husband."
Today with the couple's children grown and gone from home, Mrs. Clayton's husband, Theaoseus, a lawyer, helps her more than ever. "It's amazing," she said. "I think he is aware of my demands. I don't think he was as sensitive then."
Proof that men can change?
Asked who was responsible for household duties in her family, Ms. Murray, who is 42, laughed. "I would say, like most women, I carried the lion's share," she said. "But my husband's helpful. I probably did a lot more when the kids were little; he probably does a lot more now." The Senator and her husband, Rob, have two children: Randy, 16, and Sara, 13.
"My husband has really come around," said Ms. Murray, who was elected to the Senate last year. "When the kids were younger, guess who packed all four suitcases? But he quit his job of 16 years to come to Washington."
 
Changing Perceptions
 Ms. Murray is helping to change the perception of the female politician. For her Senate race, she ran as "just a mom in tennis shoes," and her family was an integral part of the campaign.
"One of the reasons a lot of people voted for me," she said, "is because I went grocery shopping and I sit at baseball games and I know what they are struggling with."
The professional campaign advisers were dead set against that kind of campaign. "They told me not to talk about my kids," Ms. Murray said, "or the fact that I have to clean house. I wanted to show that you can do both, show that when school calls and your kid has a nosebleed you can go to the school and you can still be the best United States Senator."
Perhaps it is easier for a Senator to miss a vote or cancel an appointment because of a family crisis than it is for a secretary in a large company to leave work early to pick up a sick child. Perhaps the times make it easier.
Ms. Rivlin said she remembered how hard it was in the early 1960's to muster the courage to say she had to leave a meeting early to get home to a small child. "I was a consultant to a House committee in the beginning of my career," she said. "The meetings started at 6 or 7 at night. I said very timidly: 'Is there any possibility we could do this in the morning. I have to get home and get dinner.'
"Senator Al Quie had a bunch of kids. He said: 'Oh, what a wonderful idea. My wife would love it if I came home for dinner.' It was a big triumph for me."
 
Need to Be Careful
 When Ms. Feinstein was a single mother, she could never bring herself to say she had to leave work because of her child. "I was sure what the response would be," she said. "I still think women have to be very careful. One of the reasons they are denied promotions is because they are looked at at the office as the ones responsible for the family."
In her previous career as a registered nurse, Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, 57, a Texas Democrat serving her first term, said she never had a qualm about leaving work because of family responsibilities. "I was very skilled in my work and there was a demand for me in the marketplace," she said. "I didn't think twice about it because my first responsibility was always to my family."
But Ms. Johnson said she would never encourage a young woman with a family to seek elective office. "That's harder than having a regular job," she said.
For the modern version of the professional woman's dilemma, Ms. Browner of the E.P.A. and Ms. Stock, the White House social secretary, are the role models. For five years Ms. Stock, who was special-events director for Bloomingdale's in New York, traveled every weekend to Washington, where her son, Chase, now 13, and her husband, Stuart, lived. During the week, her husband was the primary caretaker.
"He bore the brunt of it," Ms. Stock said. "I was always juggling a lot of balls. My husband had to make it fit, too -- more so than me because I don't think he expected it."
 
Different Point of View
 When Ms. Browner moved to Tallahassee from elsewhere in Florida to head the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation, someone was prompted to ask her husband, "Isn't it amazing you are willing to move to Tallahassee with Carol?"
Her husband, Michael Podhorzer, she said, cut that conversation short, saying, "You wouldn't be asking me the question if I were a woman."
The Browners have joint responsibility for duties at home. "My husband doesn't help me," she said. "We try to figure out how to share. I did dinner Sunday night. He did dinner Monday night."
As ideal as their arrangement is, Ms. Browner said the guilt about her 5-year-old son, Zachary, was still there. "A day doesn't go by that I don't worry whether he is getting enough of me," she said. "It's important that he understands what I do. At some level, I think he does. He tells people that his mother saves trees, animals, rivers, lakes. And bananas."
Ms. Rivlin's children are grown, so she no longer needs to feel guilty about leaving them. But she finds other ways in which she thinks she is not measuring up at home. Last Christmas, she said, her husband's sister and brother-in-law were visiting. "We were getting the budget set, and I wasn't paying attention to them," she said. "They weren't distressed. The guilt was all mine."
Ms. Rivlin's husband, Sid Winter, chief economist with the General Accounting Office, was working, too. Did he feel guilty about not entertaining his sister? "No," Ms. Rivlin said.
"I worry about passing this on to our children," Ms. Rivlin said. "I know I conveyed some of that."
Ms. Rivlin sees her daughter, who has two children, making her own compromises. "She has a government job as a lawyer, in part, because it gives her more regular hours," she said. Speaking of her son-in-law, Ms. Rivlin said: "Bob's terrific, but he does not regard it as his responsibility to work out how all of this is going to work. Really, it's her job. He helps, but he's not in charge."
Something has to give when a working woman has a family. And one of the first things to go is cooking. "The busier I get, the less I cook," Ms. Stock said. "I used to cook incredible meals -- when I had time. It was a way to relax."
Ms. Feinstein said she was just as happy not to be cooking, adding, however, that she makes a very good cheese pie.
And then she offered this bit of homey trivia. "The other night, I opened a can of Campbell's vegetarian beans, and the only decision was whether I had to heat them or eat them cold out of the can."
How to combine career and marriage is a that remains unanswered for many young women.
"When I talk to teen-age girls," Ms. Browner said, "they want to know if they can have children and a career and will someone still want to marry them. For an awful lot of women it's still very, very difficult. I guess it's progress when the husband says, 'I'm going to baby-sit the kids.' "
The Ann Stocks and Carol Browners are still a tiny minority. "We've come this far," Ms. Feinstein said. "My daughter could run for District Attorney and win, but she'd still have to go home and clean."

HEADLINE: Tool Orders Are Near 5-Year High

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Orders of American-made machine tools rose 4.8 percent last month to the highest level in nearly five years, an industry trade group said in a report to be released today.
The gain was attributed by the Association for Manufacturing Technology largely to growing demand from the three big auto makers. Machine tools, which cut or form metal, are used in many manufacturing processes and are thus considered a barometer of future industrial output. 
 Orders totaled $348.2 million in April, compared with a revised figure for March of $332.1 million, marking the industry's third month of expansion. The figures were up 58.6 percent from a year earlier, when orders totaled $219.5 million. The April total was the highest since June 1988, when orders reached $382.8 million.
But the trade association's president, Albert W. Moore, played down the importance of the gain, noting that many machine-tool makers were still searching for contracts. "Ordinarily, after three consecutive monthly order increases, the industry would be heralding a recovery in the market," he said in a statement. "While the first quarter was good for many in the industry, a large number of builders are still seeking work for the second and third quarters."
His caution was echoed by some private economists, who say that businesses are postponing expansion because of uncertainty over the prospects for President Clinton's economic plan, to be taken up in the Senate.
Shipments of machine tools skidded 21.4 percent in April, to $249.7 million from a revised $317.85 million in March, but were up 25.3 percent from shipments of $199.3 million in April 1992. There is a 12- to 18-month lag between orders and shipments.

HEADLINE: California Sees More Lost Jobs

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., May 30

 BODY:
A state commission estimates that California will lose 125,000 jobs in the next four years because of Federal cuts in military spending and base closings.
The figure is up sharply from the commission's forecast last fall that 80,000 jobs would be lost. Since then, Defense Secretary Les Aspin has proposed closing more military bases in California. 
 The Commission on State Finance said last week that reductions from 1988 to the end of 1992 resulted in a loss of 162,000 jobs, including 140,000 in the aerospace industry and 22,000 civilian jobs at military bases.
From 1993 to 1997, the commission said California could expect to lose an additional 90,000 aerospace jobs and 35,000 civilian jobs at military bases.
The Los Angeles and San Diego regions accounted for almost 83 percent of the aerospace jobs lost over the last five years. The San Francisco Bay area and the Sacramento region are expected to bear the brunt of job losses over the next four years.

Heady Fittipaldi Picks Right Time to Step on It

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, May 30

 BODY:
On a day that required smart driving as well as aggressive driving, Emerson Fittipaldi blended both with such skill this afternoon that he was able to win his second Indianapolis 500 in a race that may have been the most competitive in the event's 77 runnings.
Fittipaldi, a 46-year-old Brazilian who lives much of the time in Miami, took the lead in his Penske-Chevy on a restart on the 185th lap, out-accelerating Nigel Mansell of England and Arie Luyendyk of the Netherlands, both in Lola-Fords, into Turn 1. Fittipaldi held it from there, even on another restart with five laps to go. 
 He held on to beat Luyendyk, who was second, by 2.862 seconds, and Mansell, who was not far behind in third. Also within car lengths of the top three were Raul Boesel of Brazil in fourth and Mario Andretti in fifth, both in Lola-Fords. All told, the top 10 finishers were on the same lap as Fittipaldi, who led only 16 laps in all and whose winning average speed was 157.207 miles per hour.
Before the race, the drivers were speculating that changes in the track layout at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway would make it hard to pass today. As it turned out, some of the cut-and-thrust maneuvers on the track made Manhattan traffic seem sedate.
Fittipaldi, who also won the event in 1989, was the 12th different leader in this race, breaking the record of 10 set in 1980. The lead changed hands 21 times. So competitive was the race that even Kevin Cogan, the slowest qualifier, was able to lead four laps.
The Brazilian said this victory was the most important of his career -- even more so than his 1989 victory -- "because of the time of my career now, my age now."
And with that age came wisdom. "I think I am able to drive better now than when I was 25 years old," Fittipaldi said. "I have experience."
He, along with all the other drivers, needed that today.
After last year's crash-filled Indy 500, race officials and the speedway decided to slow the cars and make them safer by narrowing the turns by 12 feet and reducing the aerodynamic devices on the cars. They achieved that goal, as only four cars crashed today and there were no serious injuries.
The changes also made it more difficult to pass. It took patience and intelligence to survive today, but the drivers seemed up to it. A total of 24 of the 33 starters finished, and none was more than eight laps behind over the 200-lap distance.
"I was very impressed with the quality of driving from everybody," the winner said.
 
Brains and Aggressiveness
 But no one was more impressive than Fittipaldi.
"The guy with the most brains won today," said Eddie Cheever, who finished 16th after starting 33d and last.
"He drove an outstanding race," said Roger Penske, Fittipaldi's car owner, who got his ninth Indy victory in 25 years of coming here. "He won this race himself."
"To have a run on the guy ahead of you, you had to have the right timing," Fittipaldi said, explaining the need for patience and skill in passing. "But I think there was some aggressive driving sometimes."
The most aggressive move, probably, was the one that won him the race.
 
Mansell Misses a Beat
 After a yellow flag to tow in Lyn St. James's disabled car, the green came back out at the start of the 185th lap. At that point, Mansell was in the lead, but this was the first oval track ever for the defending Formula One world champion. And it was that inexperience that probably accounted for his failure to master one of the major tricks of American oval-track racing: hitting a restart just right.
The rules say that once the pace car pulls off, the drivers can start racing again. Anticipating restarts can win races, as it did for Bobby Rahal here in 1986 and for Fittipaldi today.
In this case, both Fittipaldi and Luyendyk were on the gas faster than Mansell, who must have been shocked to see both Luyendyk and Fittipaldi flashing by him as the three crossed the start-finish line and headed to Turn 1.
 
'I Messed Up'
 By the time they got there, the order was Fittipaldi, Luyendyk and Mansell. It stayed that way even after a final restart on lap 195, which came after Mansell brushed the wall in Turn 2.
"I messed up a few things today," said an otherwise happy Mansell after the race. "I don't mind admitting it."
Once Fittipaldi got ahead, he couldn't be caught. "The car was dialed in," he said. "We had the best set of tires, the balance of the car was perfect, and I was in clean air."
By that, he meant he didn't have turbulent air from cars ahead of him making his car handle unpredictably. That helped him outrun Luyendyk to the finish.
"I was worried about Luyendyk in that situation because he has a lot of experience," Penske said of Fittipaldi's winning restart, "but Emerson did a great job."
 
Compliment From Luyendyk
 Luyendyk, who said the turbulent air from Fittipaldi's car kept him from challenging him at the end, gave Fittipaldi credit for playing the final restart perfectly.
"He slowed the field down to such a slow speed that I had to go back to second gear," said Luyendyk, the 1990 Indy winner. "And he accelerated when his car was in a straight line, and I was still running through Turn 3."
Fittipaldi got a big assist today from a not-so-patient piece of driving by his 24-year-old teammate, Paul Tracy of Canada.
After 86 laps, Fittipaldi made a pit stop earlier than the leaders under a green flag. Two laps later, a yellow flag came out, allowing everybody else to stop without losing too much time. On the restart on lap 93, Fittipaldi was a few seconds away from being lapped by Andretti, which would have severely hurt Fittipaldi's chances.
But on lap 95 another yellow came out, allowing Fittipaldi to get back to the pack and remain on the lead lap, when Tracy crashed while trying to get by Scott Brayton on the bottom of Turn 3. Tracy seemed to commit himself too far into the corner, and Brayton moved down in front of him, clipping Tracy's front wings and sending him into the wall. Tracy was unhurt and Brayton finished sixth.
Andretti led 72 laps, more than anyone else, and was ahead with 26 laps to go. Andretti, Mansell's teammate, said his last pit stop spoiled what could have been his second victory, and his first here since 1969. The rear tires that were put on didn't have the proper inflation differential. This difference, called "stagger," helps steer the cars through the four left-hand turns.

HEADLINE: Do Something About Superfund

 BODY:
To the Editor:
President Clinton has said of Superfund, our country's toxic waste cleanup program, "I'd like to use that Superfund to clean up pollution for a change and not just pay lawyers." The President's recognition of the program's problems is music to my ears as a business owner trapped in the bureaucracy of Superfund. 
 My company, a scrap metal and recycling operation since 1946, was notified by the Environmental Protection Agency, Region 3, that it was a "potentially responsible party" at two Superfund sites in Pennsylvania. In simple terms, this means my company is liable for some or all of the cleanup costs at the site.
Like many other potentially responsible parties at the site, I had always played by the rules. For years, we routinely sent our used automotive batteries to local recycling and disposal facilities for handling. Now those facilities have been declared Superfund sites, and I'm left holding a cleanup bill of more than $450,000. Such a payment would devastate my family's business.
It seems somehow un-American to change the rules in the middle of the game and to punish those who followed the old rules. But that's how Superfund's misguided retroactive liability system works. Under the system, the E.P.A. can hold any party connected to a Superfund site liable for the entire cost of cleanup, regardless of what, when or how much that party contributed to the problem, or whether or not that party's action was legal at the time. Congress established this system so that "polluters" would pay for cleanup. In reality, the liability system unfairly penalizes thousands of people like me.
Cleanup at my site hasn't even begun yet. And, while E.P.A. works to sort out the "responsible" parties, the lawyers battle, the site's toxic waste remains untouched, and the cost of cleanup rises higher and higher.
A new approach to hazardous cleanup must be found. One proposal that could solve Superfund's problems is an environmental trust fund, which would change the way money is raised for cleanup. This would replace Superfund's retroactive liability with a broad-based fund, paid into by businesses across all economic sectors. That would stop the endless bickering over who is responsible, leaving cash, time and energy available to clean up environmentally damaged sites. Such a proposal makes not just environmental sense, but economic sense as well.
Congress has the chance to improve Superfund during its reauthorization this year. I urge everyone to support ideas like the environmental trust fund.

Return of The Old Clinton?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A couple of weeks ago, White House chief of staff "Mack the Nice" McLarty invited me over because he was concerned about a phrase in this space: the "lurch to the left" that dismayed Republicans and centrist Democrats who had voted for Clinton.
Apparently White House polls were registering an alarming discontent with a President who had promised tax cuts and then proposed tax increases; who had adopted the rhetoric of deficit reduction but put off spending cuts for years; who had come up with "stimulus" spending that was a porcine payoff to big-city mayors. 
 Because the Republican minority in Congress now represented majority opinion in the country, Clinton's leftward lurch had been checked by Dole & Co.'s filibuster. Middle America's sense of having been double-crossed was reflected in the President's rising "negatives."
Then came Travelgate with its ominous abuse of the F.B.I. and the ludicrous Scalpgate with its relentless ridicule. Bill Clinton was Carterizing himself before the country's eyes.
His hard-hooking Presidency was saved by the two centrist Democratic Davids -- Boren in the Senate, McCurdy in the House. Using Boren's resistance as leverage, McCurdy put a needed fig leaf over the tax-and-spend budget. Because the Clinton Presidency was approaching what he called "a near-death experience," McCurdy and unhappy Democrats held their noses and passed a spender's budget. It was not an Act of Congress; it was an act of mercy.
Clinton got the three-pronged message from the polls, the press and the pols: his ideological double-cross would not be tolerated.
Last weekend, he pulled his bloodied communications director and good soldier, George Stephanopoulos, 32, out of the night that covered him and into his sheltering bosom. He substituted someone we had all assumed to be a lifelong Republican, David Gergen, 51, with the prestigious title of Counselor.
". . . we are rising above politics . . . beyond partisanship," said a President who had failed to steamroller the opposition, and whose wife the week before delivered a partisan, class-warfare harangue, ". . . to search for new ideas, a new common ground, a new national unity."
The mid-course correction (before the near-death experience) was emphasized in urgent background calls. These promised that the choice of Gergen -- an aide to Nixon, Ford and Reagan -- was not cosmetic but signaled a shift to the ideas of the Old Clinton, campaigner for individual responsibility, welfare reform and the platform of the New Democrats.
Gergen is in an enviable position; he has been given options to buy Clinton stock at the all-time low. He is a member of the Judson Welliver Society of former White House speechwriters, which automatically softens the hammering from this quarter.
By revealing "I have never been a Republican," he has justified two decades of Pat Buchanan's suspicions, and undermined the symbolic value of his appointment to Mr. Clinton; that was Gergen's first communications mistake this time around.
If he denies access to his new client, as he did to President Reagan, on the basis of "He's been hostile to us," that will be unfortunate; if his place at the power table really augurs the comeback of the Old Clinton, that will be good.
Signals are nice, but substance is better. Here are a few questions that will determine if the President has redefined his mission or if, like John Major in Britain, he is merely buying time by shuffling his Kitchen Cabinet.
Does Clinton still intend to press ahead with his plan to raise taxes retroactive to last January while postponing even his modest spending cuts until three or four years from now?
Does Clinton now buy his own budget director Leon Panetta's original proposal of two dollars in cuts for every dollar in taxes to reduce the deficit?
Does Clinton still subscribe to the disavowed but all-too-accurate Tarnoff Doctrine of "we're too poor to lead," or will we see some muscle instead of continued handwringing in the Balkans?
And hardest of all: Does the Old Clinton dare to tell the Other Clinton that price-rigged, low-deductible, demand-generating, taxpayer-subsidized health insurance does not fit into the mainstream he again professes to represent?

HEADLINE: An Offering To the Wolves

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
It is one of the oldest rites of government: when things are not going well, when the leader is in trouble, a member of his retinue must be sacrificed. At least the wolves will be silenced for a while, and with a bit of skill and a lot of luck, the direction of the whole enterprise can be changed.
So it was with President Clinton this weekend. The problem, the President has been saying for weeks, is that his program has not been effectively communicated to the public. So there was a certain logic in shoving aside George Stephanopoulos, the young communications director, in favor of David R. Gergen, the old Nixon and Reagan hand, however embarrassing such a symbol of the established order must have been to an apostle of change. 
 But, in fact, Mr. Gergen, who has been promised as much direct access to Mr. Clinton as he likes, will handle a lot more than communications. As counselor to the President, he seems destined for a role similar to that of Theodore C. Sorensen in the Kennedy Administration -- as principal all-purpose adviser.
Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the chief of staff, has survived for the moment, at least partly because of his lifelong friendship with Mr. Clinton. But the coming of Mr. Gergen will dilute his power.
There is no magic in personnel changes. Getting rid of John H. Sununu, George Bush's rough-edged chief of staff, may have tamped down controversies in the White House, but it did not save Mr. Bush's Presidency, whose problems lay in the currents of history, the tides of economics and the character of the man in the Oval Office.
Similarly, it remains to be seen whether Mr. Gergen can make enough of a difference to an Administration that must cope with a society that demands change without undue sacrifice, a political system shorn of discipline and a President who wishes to be almost all things to almost all people, and all at the same time.
 
President's Two Roles
 "Bill Clinton is part of the solution," one of the President's aides said. "But often he's part of the problem, too."
In countries with parliamentary systems, a fresh start is usually sought by relieving one or more ministers responsible for a failed (or at least an unpopular) policy. It happened last week in Britain when Prime Minister John Major ousted the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, who was the architect, along with Mr. Major himself, of an economic policy that had deepened a recession.
In Washington, however, admissions that policies have failed are as rare as balanced budgets. The Clinton Administration, still young, has attributed its troubles to everything but ill-considered policies: poor communication, lack of focus, inadequate staff work, unfortunate timing and conflicts among the President's aides.
Some of that is true. Lackluster liaison work with Congress cost Mr. Clinton his stimulus package, and discord over trade policy has hampered work in a number of crucial areas.
But in the end, the President is responsible for whatever goes wrong, even things he was not aware of, like the travel office fiasco that Mr. Clinton ascribes to others' decisions. Too many denials of responsibility eventually make Washington and then the country wonder exactly who is in charge.
 
Clinton's Choices
 It was Mr. Clinton who so firmly pledged during his campaign to give the middle class a tax cut and then broke his promise, arguing that fiscal realities had changed, making such a cut impossible.
It was also Mr. Clinton who chose to put the question of homosexuals in the armed forces on the agenda for his first week in office, to nominate Lani Guinier, a law professor with a history of radical writings, for a major Justice Department post, and to emphasize tax increases as much as spending cuts in his campaign to reduce the deficit. Each of those decisions led many of those who considered him a "new" Democrat, and supported him for that reason, to feel tricked, if not betrayed.
How he deals with Ms. Guinier in the weeks ahead may show whether Mr. Clinton is moving back to the middle of the road.
He won in November partly because of his command of the minutiae of dozens of difficult problems, and he went on to impress the pros during the transition by his performance at his economic summit conference. Unlike a merchant in gauzy generalities, like Ronald Reagan, Mr. Clinton cannot easily say others messed up the details.
One of the President's biggest problems, in the view of some of those who have been working closely with him for four months now, is his tendency to talk publicly without adequate reflection. He said in the midst of the muddle over Bosnian policy, for example, that he was on the verge of an agreement with the European allies, but his advisers knew at the time that even a limited agreement was in doubt.
"What the President needs is an enforcer," a member of his Cabinet said, "someone who can keep him in line, keep him from wandering off onto topics that haven't been thought through. I love him -- he's my friend -- but my goodness, he can't stop talking."
Put another way, what Mr. Clinton seems to need is someone who can say "no" to him occasionally and possibly to Hillary Rodham Clinton as well. Asked whose job that was, a staff member replied, "Mack McLarty." Asked whether Mr. McLarty did it, the staff member replied, "Not that I know of."
Mr. McLarty has been unable to do another of the jobs often assigned to chiefs of staff: avoiding any nasty little surprises that can knock the White House off balance, like the now-famous $200 haircut that Mr. Clinton treated himself to while Air Force One sat at the Los Angeles airport.
"You have to be willing to go in there and say, 'No, not now, not this way,' " said a White House chief of staff in another Administration. "You have to give it to your man straight, the best advice you've got, no worrying about whether you are too blunt.
"But he has to be prepared to let you do that from time to time, and to pay attention when you do. He has the upper hand."
In that sense, it is the President who is responsible for the kind of advice he gets or does not get, and since he has evidently decided to keep the gentlemanly Mr. McLarty in place, some of his staff members hope that he will bring in Harold M. Ickes Jr., the New York political operative, to ask the hard questions in the months ahead.
A hard-bitten man with a confrontational style, Mr. Ickes could nonetheless prove a substantial asset in the battles, this year and next, to enact the taxing and spending plan and medical-care overhaul. But Mr. Clinton himself will have to change his methods first.
