HEADLINE: CLINTON IN AFRICA: VOICES;
Blacks on a Brooklyn Street: Both Cynics and Optimists Speak Out

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO 

 BODY:
Far from Africa but so deeply connected to his roots that he considers himself African (no hyphenated ethnic label for him), a vegetable and fruit vendor from Brooklyn pondered the question for a moment and replied with a shrug: "I haven't really thought about it. I'm not into politics, you know,"
The topic he would rather not discuss is President Clinton's 11-days in Africa, the first significant visit of an American President to the region. The President also made history Monday when he told school children in Uganda that he regretted the role the United States played in slavery. 
 Told of Mr. Clinton's remarks, the vendor, who uses only one name, Jawara, lost his reticence "Now, why did he have to go there to do that?" Mr. Jawara, 42, said. "We are still enslaved here. We are still fighting for our so-called rights, are we not?"
Midway through Mr. Clinton's tour of six African countries, it may be too early to know how the trip has affected African-Americans -- Mr. Clinton's most faithful constituency. But conversations yesterday with several people in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn revealed that Mr. Clinton's every move and word are being carefully dissected by African-Americans from all walks of life -- from unemployed factory workers and accountants to secretaries and store owners.
"I'm glad Clinton went," said Marlon Outler, a 38-year-old unemployed man. "They are poor and a visit like this can be uplifting, but, as far as what he said about slavery, well, it's a little too late for that, isn't it?"
"African Americans are still enslaved, but in a different form now," Mr. Outler said. "There are a lot of black young men locked up in jails. And, for what? A black man has a hard way to go, that's for sure. And if they see you moving forward, they try to knock you down again."
A block away, a shop owner who uses an American Indian name, Talks with Wolves, said Mr. Clinton's quasi-apology was directed to the wrong people.
"The question is, what was his original purpose going there?" said Talks with Wolves, a New Yorker who owns a store by the same name and describes himself as half Indian and half black. "Because if he went all the way to Africa to apologize, that makes no sense. The former slaves are here, not back in Africa."
Instead, Mr. Clinton should have apologized for the way American companies have stripped African countries of their natural resources, offering little compensation in return, he said.
"It's fine that he goes there," he continued. "But will economic help mean that Nigeria is going to look like Broadway? I hope not, but I'm told it already does."
But others were kinder to Mr. Clinton, noting that the trip has served to highlight Africa's needs. Mr. Clinton has promised aid for education, farming and police training in some of the countries he has visited and pushed the idea that the best way to help Africa is through trade.
"I think the President has seen that some of the countries really are trying to change in accordance with the new world order," said Lennox Norville, 44, standing in a bakery during a coffee break from his job as manager in an insurance company. "His visit will pressure them to step up initiatives to come in line with the rest of the free world."
Mr. Norville also said that Mr. Clinton's comments on slavery were right on target. "It is important for a powerful country such as the United States to accept its mistakes," he said.
Pam Morgan, 34, a marketing consultant chimed in when she heard the topic. She described her thoughts with just one word, "Garbage," she said.
Ms. Morgan elaborated later. "If he's apologized, what is he going to do for us now?" she said. "He can't go back and change it. He needs to take us from where we are now. Take a look at our needs. Proper education, adequate training, jobs, rampant crimes, kids shooting at each other in schools all over the country. That's what I'm talking about.
"If going to Africa is part of his job as a President, fine. Let him do it. But I couldn't care less. I don't know the issues in Africa, but I know there are things to be done here."
Others at the bakery seemed to agree with Ms. Morgan, nodding in silent approval. But outside, at the door of a club where she works as a secretary, Valda Dumbombe, 48, an immigrant from Jamaica, said the President's visit is symbolic of what many other Americans would like to do, but cannot.
"It's important for the morale of all African-Americans that the President goes to Africa," she said. "A lot of people are talking about it and wishing him well. I like what he is doing. He's gone back to my old, old home."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN AFRICA;
Clinton's Painful Words Of Sorrow and Chagrin

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: KIGALI, Rwanda, March 25

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's address, as provided by the White House, at the Kigali airport to survivors of the mass killings in Rwanda in 1994:
I have come today to pay the respects of my nation to all who suffered and all who perished in the Rwandan genocide. It is my hope that through this trip, in every corner of the world today and tomorrow, their story will be told; that four years ago in this beautiful, green, lovely land, a clear and conscious decision was made by those then in power that the peoples of this country would not live side by side in peace. 
 During the 90 days that began on April 6 in 1994, Rwanda experienced the most intensive slaughter in this blood-filled century we are about to leave. Families murdered in their home, people hunted down as they fled by soldiers and militia, through farmland and woods as if they were animals.
From Kibuye in the west to Kibungo in the east, people gathered seeking refuge in churches by the thousands, in hospitals, in schools. And when they were found, the old and the sick, women and children alike, they were killed -- killed because their identity card said they were Tutsi or because they had a Tutsi parent, or because someone thought they looked like a Tutsi, or slain like thousands of Hutus because they protected Tutsis or would not countenance a policy that sought to wipe out people who just the day before, and for years before, had been their friends and neighbors.
The Government-led effort to exterminate Rwanda's Tutsi and moderate Hutus, as you know better than me, took at least a million lives. Scholars of these sorts of events say that the killers, armed mostly with machetes and clubs, nonetheless did their work five times as fast as the mechanized gas chambers used by the Nazis.
It is important that the world know that these killings were not spontaneous or accidental. It is important that the world hear what your President just said -- they were most certainly not the result of ancient tribal struggles. Indeed, these people had lived together for centuries before the events the President described began to unfold.
These events grew from a policy aimed at the systematic destruction of a people. The ground for violence was carefully prepared, the airwaves poisoned with hate, casting the Tutsis as scapegoats for the problems of Rwanda, denying their humanity. All of this was done, clearly, to make it easy for otherwise reluctant people to participate in wholesale slaughter. . . .
The international community, together with nations in Africa, must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy, as well. We did not act quickly enough after the killing began. We should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe haven for the killers. We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. We cannot change the past. But we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear, and full of hope.
We owe to those who died and to those who survived who loved them, our every effort to increase our vigilance and strengthen our stand against those who would commit such atrocities in the future -- here or elsewhere.
Indeed, we owe to all the peoples of the world who are at risk -- because each bloodletting hastens the next as the value of human life is degraded and violence becomes tolerated, the unimaginable becomes more conceivable -- we owe to all the people in the world our best efforts to organize ourselves so that we can maximize the chances of preventing these events. And where they cannot be prevented, we can move more quickly to minimize the horror. . . .
I am directing my Administration to improve, with the international community, our system for identifying and spotlighting nations in danger of genocidal violence, so that we can assure worldwide awareness of impending threats. It may seem strange to you here, especially the many of you who lost members of your family, but all over the world there were people like me sitting in offices, day after day after day, who did not fully appreciate the depth and the speed with which you were being engulfed by this unimaginable terror. . . .
Secondly, we must as an international community have the ability to act when genocide threatens. We are working to create that capacity here in the Great Lakes region. . . .
Events here show how urgent the work is. In the northwest part of your country, attacks by those responsible for the slaughter in 1994 continue today. We must work as partners with Rwanda to end this violence and allow your people to go on rebuilding your lives and your nation.
Third, we must work now to remedy the consequences of genocide. The United States has provided assistance to Rwanda to settle the uprooted and restart its economy, but we must do more. I am pleased that America will become the first nation to contribute to the new Genocide Survivors Fund. We will contribute this year $2 million, continue our support in the years to come, and urge other nations to do the same, so that survivors and their communities can find the care they need. . . .
Fourth, to help insure that those who survived in the generations to come never again suffer genocidal violence, nothing is more vital than establishing the rule of law. There can be no peace in Rwanda that lasts without a justice system that is recognized as such.
We applaud the efforts of the Rwandan Government to strengthen civilian and military justice systems. . . .
Fifth, we must make it clear to all those who would commit such acts in the future that they too must answer for their acts, and they will. In Rwanda, we must hold accountable all those who may abuse human rights, whether insurgents or soldiers. . . .
I know that in the face of all you have endured, optimism cannot come easily to any of you. Yet I have just spoken, as I said, with several Rwandans who survived the atrocities, and just listening to them gave me reason for hope. You see countless stories of courage around you every day as you go about your business here -- men and women who survived and go on, children who recover the light in their eyes remind us that at the dawn of a new millennium there is only one crucial division among the peoples of the Earth.
And believe me, after over five years of dealing with these problems I know it is not the division between Hutu and Tutsi, or Serb and Croatian and Muslim in Bosnia, or Arab and Jew, or Catholic and Protestant in Ireland, or black and white. It is really the line between those who embrace the common humanity we all share and those who reject it.
It is the line between those who find meaning in life through respect and cooperation and who, therefore, embrace peace, and those who can only find meaning in life if they have someone to look down on, someone to trample, someone to punish and, therefore, embrace war. . . .
To those who believe that God made each of us in His own image, how could we choose the darker road? When you look at those children who greeted us as we got off that plane today, how could anyone say they did not want those children to have a chance to have their own children? To experience the joy of another morning sunrise? To learn the normal lessons of life? To give something back to their people?

Strong Home Sales Report Pushes Price of 30-Year Issue Down

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday after a stronger-than-expected home sales report for February raised investors' concerns about how long the Federal Reserve could refrain from raising interest rates.
The price of the 30-year bond dropped 27/32, to 102 5/8. And the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.94 percent, from 5.88 percent on Tuesday. 
 While there is little threat of any action by the central bank at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday, the thinking is that the Fed might move to a more restrictive monetary policy after the effects of Asia's economic turmoil are out of the way.
The National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes jumped 8.7 percent in February, to a record annual 4.75 million units; the forecast was 4.42 million.
Before the home sales report, prices in the Treasury market had risen in response to the Commerce Department's report of durable goods orders for February. Orders fell 1.7 percent, which was worse than expected, led by weakness in aircraft and telecommunications.
However, Hamilton Davis, a vice president of government trading at Everen Securities Inc. in Chicago, said that a second look at the durable goods report showed underlying strength. After excluding aircraft, orders for durable goods were up five-tenths of 1 percent.
Traders said technical selling helped aggravate the drop in bond prices, which many thought would help yesterday's $11 billion Government auction of new five-year notes. But that assumption turned out to be wrong. The notes were awarded at the high yield of 5.620 percent. Mr. Davis called it a sloppy auction, with dealers selling on the way down, which could not generate enough retail demand to clean the market up.
"Investor surveys show investors are a little bit long on benchmark and didn't have as much room to buy new securities" despite relatively attractive yields, he said.
Bonds also came under pressure from rumors that Japan would sell United States Treasury securities to buy a trillion yen of stocks.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

High Price	99.483	High Yield	5.620%	Low Yield	5.550%	Median Yield	5.592%	Accepted at low price	59%	Total applied for	$25,770,899	Accepted	$14,161,498	Noncompetitive	$329,598	Interest set at	5 1/2 	
 
The five-year notes mature March 31, 2003.

HEADLINE: Power Deregulation: Shadow, Substance and Politics

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration presented guidelines yesterday as to how it would like to see the utility industry deregulated, including an innovative way for consumers to easily compare deals offered by rival sellers of power. But it's unclear whether the proposals will help expedite the process of dismantling the economy's last major regulated monopoly.
Under some of the major guidelines presented by Energy Secretary Federico F. Pena, utilities would have to open themselves to competition by the year 2003, a fund of $3 billion would be established to help low-income people with their electric bills, and old laws governing the utility industry would be repealed. 
 Part of the reason Secretary Pena presented the guidelines at a news conference in Washington is that the drive to deregulate has stalled in Congress and in many states. Mr. Pena intends to get it going again.
"There is limited time left," he said in an interview. "We're going to press ahead as hard as we can to get something done this year."
But the Administration is still facing a clamor of divergent interest groups over how to proceed.
Part of the problem is the enormous size of the utility industry, which sold more than $212 billion worth of electricity last year. Moreover, many utilities have never contended with competition and are nervous about how to make the transition.
Consumers are already confused by a welter of offers in states like California, which soon plans to give residents a choice among electric utilities.
There are battles between state regulators and legislators over who should lead the deregulation. The utility industry itself is split.
Big utilities that have plenty of cheap power want to accelerate the process so they can sell outside their territory. Other utilities that sell expensive power want to slow the process, so they can make the transition without bankrupting themselves.
The most divisive issue has become how to insure that residential and other small consumers get a fair share of the savings that are promised from competition. As it stands now, most of the savings are falling to the larger industrial and commercial customers, who are cutting deals with power companies in anticipation of deregulation.
California had planned to give customers a choice as of Jan. 1, but was forced to delay that until March 31 because of computer glitches and concerns over transmission reliability. An announcement yesterday by the state's biggest utilities that more testing would be needed before the process could begin next Tuesday has not reassured the public either. Some already skittish consumers have said in surveys that they do not want to deal with more choices.
Deregulation has also drawn criticism from environmentalists, who fear that competitive pressure to cut the cost of power means that utilities will rely more on coal-fired plants. Such plants produce most of the cheapest electricity, which could make it more difficult to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, a possible cause of global warming.
The Clinton Administration's proposal calls for more efficient burning of fuels to lower emissions and for a tripling of the amount of power to be generated from renewable sources like wind and solar energy by 2010. But environmental advocates called such a measure inadequate.
David Hawkins, director of the air and energy program of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said it "fails to deliver on the President's promise to make a significant down payment on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants."
Mr. Pena, though, is optimistic that some kind of Federal legislation will result because states will have difficulty achieving common standards, such as a nationwide system that would enable consumers to compare what marketers are offering.
As proposed by the Administration, that information would also disclose what fuel utilities use to generate electricity so that consumers can choose from sellers that offer power from renewable sources.
"As consumers see more information and they get more clarity," he said, "they will be able to compare apples to apples."
And as they get more comfortable and see savings, support for deregulation will grow, the Energy Secretary predicted. In an effort to impart some lightness to a heavy subject, Mr. Pena ended his news conference by playing John Lennon's "Power to the People."

HEADLINE: Cutting Congestion, and Taxes

 BODY:
One manifestation of America's devotion to driving is a Federal tax rule that makes an employer-provided parking space a tax-free benefit, now worth up to $175 a month. This is far more generous than the nontaxable benefit for using mass transit or van pools, which is only $65 a month and governed by more restrictive rules that limit the number of people who would find it an attractive option. The disparity retards efforts to promote mass transit as the best road to cleaner air, less congestion, more efficient energy use and economic growth in metropolitan America.
But now the huge transportation bill recently approved by the Senate would bring the transit and van benefit under the same tax rules and principles that govern parking. The Senate provision, sponsored primarily by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, would not instantly catapult the monthly dollar value of transit and van pooling benefits to the same level parking enjoys. The monthly benefit is $65 now and would reach $100 in 2002. But the new provision would make it easier for employers to offer the benefits tax free and make it possible for an employee to convert a tax-free parking benefit into a tax-free transit or van pool benefit. 
 That is heading in the right direction. Making it possible for people to switch from cars to the subsidized use of transit or vans would help a lot of metropolises unclog roads and improve air quality. Today, when the House Ways and Means Committee meets to mark up its own transportation spending bill, it should incorporate the Moynihan provision.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Union Pacific Halts Some Traffic to Mexico

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS, March 25

 BODY:
As shippers see it, this is the Union Pacific campaign to repeal the North American Free Trade Agreement.
An embargo announced late Tuesday by the clogged railroad on most freight through its primary gateway to Mexico, shippers say, will quickly disrupt trade and coordinated industrial production between the two nations. 
 Union Pacific, pointing to 5,500 railroad cars backed up into Kansas, about 1,000 miles to the north, said it has no choice but to stop most new southbound shipments through the Laredo, Tex., gateway until it can roll thousands of those cars on into Mexico.
The border mess is the latest signal that Union Pacific, the nation's largest railroad and dominant carrier along the Mexican border, has yet to unsnarl the chaos resulting from its acquisition of Southern Pacific in 1996.
Some shippers may be hurt especially severely because delays in moving trucks across the border have forced them to rely more on rail transport.
Union Pacific pledged to continue carrying automobiles, auto parts and containers designed for easy transfer to boat or truck. But beginning Saturday, the railroad will refuse new shipments through Laredo of other freight such as chemicals, plastics, coal, grain and a range of goods used in industrial production.
Bernard L. Weinstein, a University of North Texas economist, estimated that the embargo would affect shipments at a rate as high as $500 million a month.
Trade with Mexico has increased since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect four years ago. Union Pacific handles 80 percent of all rail freight across the border, and 61 percent of the traffic through Laredo. Jim Shattuck, the railroad's marketing and sales chief, said the embargo should last two weeks to a month. The railroad can reroute some traffic to Mexico, he said, but rail cars already cleared through Laredo will have to wait to go there.
Despite evidence that congestion in some parts of Texas is easing, Union Pacific's past predictions of relief have been unreliable. Over the last two weeks, Mr. Shattuck said, slow shipments of soda ash have already caused three Vitro glass plants in Mexico to shut down for about a day each. Mr. Shattuck said that no other customers reported pending crises today.
But Jim Woodrick, president of the Texas Chemical Council, said the slowdowns and shutdowns already forced on United States plants could spread on both sides of the border. "If we can't get shipments to our customers," he said, "they can't run their factories, and pretty soon this turns into unemployment."
The swiftest freight across the border today was in the accusations between Union Pacific and Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana, which picks up its cars at the border, over who was to blame. Union Pacific ascribed the tie-ups to delays in Mexico, saying the Mexican railroad was able to handle fewer and fewer cars. The Mexicans called the embargo "a unilateral move by U.P. to give it time to relieve its own congestion," adding, "This decision comes at the expense of Nafta traffic between the United States and Mexico."
Union Pacific's customers point to a lack of spare capacity or management ability to handle challenges -- from weather, accidents or border delays. The point is far from academic because the railroad's customers have asked regulators to allow competitors to share more of Union Pacific's tracks or even undo the Southern Pacific merger. Chemical and plastics makers, including the nation's largest oil companies, are likely to be prime victims of the embargo, since they ship huge quantities to supply Mexico's toy, electronics, chemical and glass industries. Some of these final products end up back in the United States.
The Huntsman Corporation, which supplies chemicals and plastics to Mexico, has already had to track down errant rail cars, including one bound for a small Texas town that wound up in Mexico. Now, executives wonder how to keep shipping to Mexico. "It creates huge problems for us with our Mexican customers," a spokesman, Don Olsen, said.
Some other manufacturers, fearing retribution from Union Pacific, have been reluctant to speak except through their trade groups. Several that were called today, including Mobil, Shell, Exxon and Dow Chemical, either had no comment or said they were still assessing their situations.

HEADLINE: Swiss Banks Face Deadline And Sanctions

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
More than a year after the investigations of Nazi gold began to taint Switzerland's reputation, its banks are fighting the threat of politically damaging sanctions across the United States and a lobbying effort by New York State to block the merger of two giant Swiss financial institutions.
Late last year officials from state and local governments around the country gave Switzerland's banks three months to demonstrate that they were fulfilling their promise to find and return money to Holocaust victims and their survivors. That deadline is March 31, and officials of several states, including New York and California, have indicated that they are considering sanctions against the banks, which would exclude them from lucrative public financing deals. Last year New York City imposed such sanctions against the Union Bank of Switzerland but later suspended them. At hearings scheduled for Thursday in New York City, the banks, the Swiss Government, Jewish groups and others will make arguments about whether the moratorium on sanctions should end next week. 
 The sanction threat, however, is colliding with another problem for the banks: an accusation this week by the acting superintendent of banks in New York State, Elizabeth McCaul, that the Union Bank and the Swiss Bank Corporation have been "lax and uncooperative" in searching for accounts from the World War II era and have engaged in "perhaps even fraudulent conduct." While New York State cannot on its own block the banks from merging, it can refuse to license their New York branches. "For too long, Holocaust survivors and their heirs have been stonewalled about the fate of money rightfully belonging to them," Gov. George E. Pataki of New York said on Tuesday.
Mr. Pataki and other officials are following the lead of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who has pressed the issue of bringing the banks to account. Mr. D'Amato, who is up for re-election this year, today urged Allan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, to block the merger of the two banks.
Beneath the political maneuvering, however, are two fundamental and difficult issues facing the banks.
The first is whether to offer a "global settlement" to Jewish groups and others, one that would end class-action suits and other claims against the banks.
But the second, and equally sticky problem, is what the Swiss banks should do with a preliminary report by a Swiss historical commission showing that Switzerland received $450 million in Nazi gold shipments in World War II, much of it stolen from the central banks of occupied countries or, in many cases, plundered from the assets of Holocaust victims. At today's prices that gold would be worth roughly $4 billion.
Both the Swiss Government and the Clinton Administration will argue at Thursday's hearings, which will be headed by Alan Hevesi, the New York City controller, that sanctions will only further poison the discussions between the two countries and any hopes of a global settlement of the suits.

HEADLINE: Nurses Get New Role in Patient Protection

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., March 25

 BODY:
Kaiser Permanente, the nation's largest health maintenance organization, agreed today to let its Northern California nurses' union appoint "quality liaison" nurses to serve as watchdogs at each of the organization's hospitals in the region and to force prompt attention to abuses and oversights in the care of patients.
Because of the organization's size and influence, with nearly nine million enrollees in 18 states, analysts and Federal officials said the agreement was a striking breakthrough in both patient protection and labor-management relations in the health care industry. The agreement, part of a four-year contract subject to union member approval, follows more than a year of one- and two-day strikes that had contributed to Kaiser's loss of $270 million last year, the first in its 53-year history. 
 "We're going to try to set up an internal process to get problems dealt with before they become a public issue," Rose Anne DeMoro, executive director of the California Nurses Association, said.
Lila Petersen, a Kaiser spokeswoman, said, "It puts us at a new level of collaboration."
Today's agreement comes at a time of growing backlash to the managed-care industry, largely centered on complaints that H.M.O.'s are delaying or denying care, which has prompted a wave of patient protection legislation in state capitals and Congress. Kaiser invented managed care to help employers provide competent and cost-effective medicine for their workers, and its home base of Northern California became the crucible of innovation in care.
C. Richard Barnes, deputy director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, who helped expedite the negotiations, said the agreement ranked in importance with the teamsters union settlement last year with the United Parcel Service and the settlement this week of the long-running dispute between the United Automobile Workers and Caterpillar.
"And these are life-and-death issues, which are as important to the U.S. as any economic issue," Mr. Barnes said. "Nurses will play a greater role in the design of patient care. Now that's done primarily by management. We think this language will be a model for other health care negotiations across the country."
Karen Donelan, a senior research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health and co-director of a health care opinion research program there, said, "It's fascinating. People want some assurance that they can get the care they need when they need it. And they've always trusted the nurse at the bedside to be their advocate."
The settlement applies for now only to the organization's 2.7 million enrollees in Northern California and the 7,500 members of the California Nurses Association it employees in the region. The nurses had scheduled another strike for today, an ominous prospect for Kaiser, which says its cost in shifting patients and personnel in each strike was $10 million.
On economic issues, the union said it won important concessions. The nurses, who earn an average of $29 an hour or close to $60,000 a year, will receive 3 percent annual increases over the four years of the new contract.
"It sounds like the C.N.A. got exactly what they wanted," said Joanne Spetz, a health economist for the Public Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research organization in San Francisco.
But Ms. Spetz said it was the issue of the quality that the union emphasized most in its strikes, its Web page and its advertising.
Under the agreement, Kaiser will appoint 18 union-selected registered nurses to quality-liaison positions, one for each of 15 hospitals and the others to work with other Kaiser services.
"They will monitor what's going on and advocate basic patient standards, staffing levels and other things that impact the quality of care," Ms. DeMoro said.
The liaisons, she said, will bring problems in care to existing professional-practice committees at Kaiser's hospital and 28 clinics. If they are not resolved there, the liaisons will bring them to a new "labor-management quality facilitation committee" composed of three executives and three nurses.
Unlike senior management nurses who are often appointed to committees and participate in the organization's efforts to control costs, Ms. DeMoro said, the liaisons "will be independent voices independently bucking the system."
Ms. Spetz said that Kaiser management might find ways to ignore the liaisons' complaints, but that "given the C.N.A.'s history with Kaiser, I doubt that will happen."
Ms. Petersen, the Kaiser spokeswoman, said the agreement suited both sides' interest in good care.
"It's a win for Kaiser Permanente," she said. "It's a win for nurses. And it's a win for patients."
In promoting the quality issue, the union had characterized Kaiser's care as increasingly perilous for patients, with anecdotal accounts of deaths and inattention because of incompetent care by low-skilled workers and the stresses on nurses whose ranks had been reduced in layoffs.
But it produced little solid evidence of general deterioration in care. Ms. Spetz of the Public Policy Institute examined data on Kaiser staffing and found, she said, that "Kaiser has a richer skill mix than other hospitals in California on average."
She said there had been little change in the hours that registered nurses give patients in the last few years, although she said patients were typically sicker and needed more care. She looked at patient recovery from cardiac care and found that "Kaiser was right there in the middle of the pack" among hospitals.

HEADLINE: Zions to Buy Sumitomo California Bank

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Zions Bancorporation said yesterday that it would buy Sumitomo Bank Ltd.'s California bank for about $546 million in cash to expand into the state's growing Asian immigrant banking market.
Zions, of Salt Lake City, will pay Sumitomo $32.26 a share for its 85 percent stake in Sumitomo Bank of California, which is based in San Francisco. Public shareholders will get $38.25 a share, which is 24 percent below the shares' price of $50.50 at the close of trading yesterday. 
 Sumitomo, based in Osaka, Japan, said it would close its American commercial banking department, which lends to mid-size companies. The bank said it would continue capital markets operations and banking for large American corporations, which it says offer better growth and profit opportunities.
The retreat comes as Japanese banks prune operations to rebuild capital and profits. The banks are burdened by trillions of yen in bad loans, mostly real estate credits made during the "bubble" economy of the 1980's.

HEADLINE: Trade Group Is Opposing Bank Measure

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
The American Bankers Association, the Washington trade group that represents the nation's largest banks, said yesterday that it opposed a bill intended to break down barriers that separate the banking, insurance and securities businesses.
Opposition from the association, which wields significant lobbying power on Capitol Hill, throws a substantial roadblock in the way of the Republican-sponsored bill, which will go to the House floor for a vote on Tuesday. 
 Two weeks ago, Republican leaders in the House introduced the Financial Services Act of 1998, which would allow securities firms, insurance companies and commercial banks to merge under a holding company structure. Among other things, the bill would also expand the Federal Reserve's regulatory authority over these new financial groups.
Because of significant differences within the commercial banking industry on the matter, it was not entirely clear until yesterday how strongly the association would oppose the bill. But yesterday's announcement left little doubt about where the association stands.
In a letter to Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, chairman of the House Republican Conference, the party's policy-making group, the trade group said that "after giving the proposal the extensive consideration it deserves, the A.B.A. has determined it must oppose" the bill.
The association said the bill was problematic because it would weaken the regulatory authority of the Comptroller of the Currency, whose office charters national banks and who has historically been an advocate of allowing banks to pursue new lines of business. The group also cited concerns that the bill would allow state insurance regulators to limit banks' ability to sell insurance in favor of local insurance agents and that it would give the Securities and Exchange Commission unwanted authority to define banking products.
Representative Boehner said he was disappointed by the association's stance and held out hope that the trade group might still be swayed.
"We've heard from banks from across America who support this legislation, and many of them see opportunity for all in these reforms," Representative Boehner said. "I know we will have converts along the way, and we still hope to convert the members of the A.B.A. as the process continues."
Even with House approval, the bill would have to be passed by the Senate and signed by the President to become law, but even House passage promises to be much more difficult in light of the association's position. While the bill's proponents say the association's stance may be a negotiating ploy, the association is apparently committed in its opposition.
The separation of investment banking and commercial banking was required by the Glass-Steagall Act, passed in 1933 as part of Depression-era measures aimed at eliminating abuses thought to be responsible for the nation's financial collapse. Since then, any effort to change the law has been thwarted by the public's fear that broad deregulation would create a dangerous concentration of economic power or give rise to greater economic instability should a financial-services giant collapse.
Moreover, divergent interests among financial services concerns have stalled efforts to change the law, most recently in 1991 and 1995. The insurance and securities industries have largely backed the current legislation even though insurance agents once vigorously opposed it.
Small banks and savings institutions have traditionally opposed attempts to overhaul Glass-Steagall, and larger commercial banks are not speaking with one voice on the issue. Those that have big consumer banking operations and concerns about having to work with a hodgepodge of state insurance regulators, like Citicorp, oppose the bill. Others that have spent years building up their securities operations, like J. P. Morgan & Company, favor it.
"If the House doesn't act on this bill pretty fast, it's going to be hard to get something over to the Senate," said Cory Strupp, managing director for government relations with J. P. Morgan. "And if this Congress doesn't pass the financial modernization bill, it will be a fairly long time before they come back to it."
Many of the barriers separating banks and securities firms have eroded over the years as regulators and the rapidly shifting landscape in financial services have combined to allow these companies to pursue new lines of business. For example, many commercial banks now own brokerage firms or underwrite stock issues, while many brokerage firms offer mortgages or checking accounts.
But there remain limits on the revenue commercial banks can generate from securities operations, and both commercial and investment banks would like to play a much larger role in the insurance business.

HEADLINE: C. G. Sontheimer, Cuisinart Backer, Dies at 83

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Carl G. Sontheimer, a creative electronics engineer and successful entrepreneur who made his most visible contribution to the American economy -- and American kitchens -- after his retirement, died on Monday at a hospital near his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was 83 and known as the man who revolutionized American cooking by bringing the Cuisinart to the United States.
His family said the cause was respiratory failure. 
 It's a shudder to think what would have happened -- or not happened -- to American cooking if Mr. Sontheimer had taken up golf.
There he was in 1971, a 57-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate who had invented an array of technical devices, including a microwave direction finder that went to the moon, and started and sold two electronics companies, giving him the wherewithal to enjoy a well-deserved life of leisure. And he was bored.
So bored, in fact, that almost as soon as he had sold his last company, Anzac Electronics, in 1966, and completed a three-year consulting contract with the new owner, he had begun casting around for a new venture, among other things considering and rejecting a flier in home security systems.
Then, drawing on a lifelong passion for French food and French cooking, he decided to try to combine business with pleasure by finding French products suitable for an American franchising operation.
So Mr. Sontheimer, a native New Yorker who had grown up in France, where his father represented an American company, headed back to France in 1971 with his wife, Shirley, on a scouting trip.
It was there, at a French cookery show, that he spotted it, an ungainly but versatile machine designed to process food for restaurants. A sort of glorified blender whose multiple attachments allowed it to cut, slice, knead, chop, dice, grate, grind or even blend, it had been manufactured by a French restaurant supply giant, Robot-Coupe, for eight years, but Mr. Sontheimer immediately saw its possibilities for the home kitchen, specifically his.
As he told his wife, the machine would be ideal for making quenelles, those French delicacies whose meat or fish bases had to be chopped to a fare-thee-well, then laboriously forced through a sieve to achieve the proper consistency.
Moving swiftly, Mr. Sontheimer and his wife concluded an agreement to distribute a modified version of the commercial machine in the United States, then came up with the name that would soon become a household word.
"He always thought of French cooking as an art and he wanted it to be based on the word, 'cuisine,' " his wife said yesterday in explaining how they had come up with Cuisinart.
It was not until January 1973 that the Cuisinart was introduced at a show in Chicago, and for all its French lineage, the product had more than just an American touch. No wonder. Mr. Sontheimer had spent more than a year modifying virtually every component.
But then Mr. Sontheimer was never one to leave well enough alone, especially when it came to food. There was the time, for example, when he suffered such cuisine shock eating the food at his M.I.T. fraternity after years of fine dining in France that he went into the kitchen to help put things right.
He continued his interest in cooking throughout his varied career, which included stints with RCA and Maguire Industries before he founded the forerunner of Trak Electronics in 1947 and then, after selling his Trak stake in 1960, establishing Anzac to develop and manufacture precision microwave systems.
Along the way he studied French cooking in New York and became friends with James Beard, the enormous cooking master he only occasionally resembled. At a bit more than 6 feet tall, Mr. Sontheimer would periodically trim down to portly.
For all the Sontheimer improvements, the expensive Cuisinart sold sluggishly until 1975 when a rave review in Gourmet magazine and endorsements from Mr. Beard and others touched off a stampede of sales and created a new industry.
As Cuisinart sales soared, a host of competitors offered similar food processors, but although the clones were generally much less expensive, Cuisinart's acknowleded edge in quality, a Sontheimer obsession, led to a marketing anomaly in which the most expensive machine was the biggest seller.
The road to Cuisinart success was not always smooth. After winning permission from Robot-Coupe to use other suppliers, for example, Mr. Sontheimer created an improved model and had it manufactured in Japan, a move that led Robot-Coupe to market its own model in the United States, but without success.
There was also his battle with Zabar's, the Manhattan specialty food store, which sold Cuisinarts at such a deep discount that Mr. Sontheimer cut off the store's supply until his efforts ran afoul of Federal and state laws, leading to a $250,000 fine.
Partly because of fresh competition from Sunbeam's Oskar and other cheap, miniature processors, Cuisinart's sales declined in the 1980's, but when he and his wife sold the company to an investment group in 1987 the price was $42 million. The company is now owned by Conair.
After that, Mr. Sontheimer did not seek any more bold new ventures, but the man who never played golf didn't exactly retire. He continued to maintain an office in Greenwich to manage his real estate and other investments and he helped produce two cookbooks, "Classic Cakes and Other Great Cuisinart Desserts," and "The Pleasure of Cooking Fruits and Vegetables," both based on recipes from his acclaimed magazine, The Pleasure of Cooking.
And, of course, he continued to cook.
Shortly before he entered the hospital two weeks ago, his wife recalled yesterday, he had turned out a delicious rack of lamb.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by four children from a previous marriage, Peter and Henry, of Gettysburg, Pa., Katherine Rovine of Elkins Park, Md., and Barbara Young of Monroe, Conn.; a sister, Eleanor Tichner of New Canaan, Conn.; 10 grandchildren, and 3 great-granchildren.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN AFRICA: THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON DECLARES U.S., WITH WORLD, FAILED RWANDANS

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: KIGALI, Rwanda, March 25

 BODY:
President Clinton came here today to talk to scarred and mutilated survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and to acknowledge that the world could have protected them, though it did not.
"We in the United States and the world community did not do as much as we could have and should have done to try to limit what occurred in Rwanda in 1994," the President told half a dozen people here who lost parents, siblings and children during three months of ethnic mass killing that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. 
 After listening to the victims' stories of hiding among blood-soaked corpses, of being sliced with machetes, and of watching hundreds die, Mr. Clinton said in a later speech that "we cannot change the past," but that nations should learn from it. Excerpts, page A12.
Both in his meeting with the victims and the speech to an invited audience here, Mr. Clinton called for sharper vigilance against genocide and swifter prosecution of its perpetrators in a new permanent international criminal court.
He told the survivors, who gathered at the airport here, that the international community was not organized to deal with such violence.
"And we're still not organized to deal with it," he continued, citing as another example from his years in office the slow reaction to ethnic killing in Bosnia. Mr. Clinton said it took his Administration "more than two years" to reach consensus internally and with American allies "to go in and stop all that killing."
In April 1994, the United States decided to take no action in Rwanda, fearing the risks outweighed the potential rewards. The decision was codified in a Presidential directive, signed by Mr. Clinton the following month, which limited American participation in international peacekeeping operations.
And in those months, while the massacres were raging, the Clinton Administration successfully argued against a United Nations effort that, in retrospect, might have saved hundreds of thousands of lives, according to United Nations officers, former Administration officials and human-rights advocates. Page A12.
Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat who is traveling with the President, said Mr. Clinton felt guilty that the United States had not intervened early on to halt the Rwandan genocide. But in his speech here, the President did not go as far as he did in his talk with the survivors toward accepting blame for the United States.
In the speech, delivered to a couple of hundred diplomats and Rwandan Government officials, Mr. Clinton did not single out the United States, but said that the "international community, together with nations in Africa, must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy, as well."
He called the genocide, which he said resulted in at least a million deaths in 90 days, "the most intensive slaughter in this blood-filled century we are about to leave."
Mr. Clinton repeatedly said that the genocide was planned. "It is important that the world know that these killings were not spontaneous or accidental," he said.
As at other stops on his 12-day tour, Mr. Clinton was greeted here by dancers and drummers as he arrived in a drizzle at the airport, which rests among hills quilted with dark green forests and light green fields. Two little girls in white dresses presented him with flowers. But the tone of the President's visit was pensive, and often sad.
The Clinton Administration had planned this trip as an upbeat tour of African nations with growing economies and strengthening democracies. In advance of the President's appearance today, officials said that Mr. Clinton would acknowledge inaction by the world, but not specifically by the United States, to stop the Rwanda massacres.
But they appear to have underestimated Mr. Clinton's signature willingness to empathize with suffering, and he went further than they expected, at least in his impromptu remarks to survivors. The White House permitted one newspaper reporter to attend the meeting as a representative of the press corps.
Mr. Clinton's remarks today followed a speech in Uganda on Tuesday in which he departed from his prepared text to express regret for American failures in Africa, from benefiting from the slave trade to dealing with dictators.
The United States was more resistant than some of its European allies to putting a large United Nations force in Rwanda after leaders of the majority ethnic group here, the Hutu, began a campaign to wipe out a minority, the Tutsi, in April 1994. The Clinton Administration had just been scalded by its peace mission in Somalia, in which 18 American soldiers died.
Tutsi rebels, operating from bases in Uganda, succeeded in replacing the Hutu regime that year with what is essentially a military government. The President here, Pasteur Bizimungu, is a Hutu, and the Clinton Administration is persuaded that the Tutsi-dominated Government is bent on national reconciliation and democracy.
But the genocide still reverberates here. Hutu insurgents are fighting in the northwest, and Rwandan troops have been accused of killing civilians in reprisals for their raids.
"Our post-genocidal society is fragile," warned President Bizimungu, in a speech in which he thanked Mr. Clinton for his "commitment to helping our people overcome the ravages of genocide." He said that in judging the progress of Rwanda, other nations should treat it as a "special case."
As he listened to the survivors' stories, the President appeared moved, thanking some in a voice choked with emotion. Venuste Karasira was among nearly 4,000 people who took refuge during the genocide in a school protected by Belgian paratroopers. But the troops were withdrawn; Hutu militia members entered the school and killed all but 400 of those hiding there.
"I had to find some dead corpses," said Mr. Karasira, who lost his right hand in the attack. "I swim in their blood to survive." He added, "We died because we were left by the United Nations soldiers." When he finished, Mr. Clinton appeared unable to speak. He simply nodded for the next account.
One of those who met with Mr. Clinton, Gloriosa Uwimpuhwe, said later that he "behaved as a real, real human being who felt what people were saying, even though he did not see it himself." Ms. Uwimpuhwe said that she considered Mr. Clinton's acknowledgment of United States inaction to be an apology. "He said that he not only is sorry, but he's looking forward to taking positive options for the future," she said.
The audience for his subsequent speech enthusiastically greeted Mr. Clinton today, and interrupted him with applause each time he acknowledged error by the international community.
Several Rwandans here said that the United States, like other nations, should have acted earlier to stop the genocide, but they seemed less interested in pointing fingers than in moving on. "Everybody is to blame," said Sam Nkusi, a government official. He said that "to feel the President of the United States shares our sadness and the tragedy with us is very good."
Rwanda was added late to Mr. Clinton's tour. Administration officials said Secret Service nervousness, not White House fears of addressing genocide, delayed the decision. After analyzing the situation here, the Secret Service agreed to a Presidential visit, officials said. But Mr. Clinton did not leave the airport during his three and a half hours here, and the engines of Air Force One never ceased idling. Mr. Clinton arrived in Cape Town, South Africa, early Thursday, Reuters reported.
To the disappointment of some Rwandan officials, Mr. Clinton did not even visit the genocide memorial built at the airport in advance of his visit. The Secret Service considered the site, on a hillock, to be too exposed to the surrounding hills, said Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman.
In his speech, Mr. Clinton pointed to three errors by the international community: not acting quickly to halt the killing; permitting refugee camps in neighboring Zaire to become havens for Hutu killers, and not immediately labeling the slaughter "genocide."
Although the killing here was widely reported, Mr. Clinton suggested that he did not appreciate its magnitude at the time. "All over the world there were people like me sitting in offices, day after day after day, who did not fully appreciate the depth and the speed with which you were being engulfed by this unimaginable terror."
But Mr. Clinton looked to the future as well. "We must have global vigilance," he said. "And never again must we be shy in the face of the evidence."
The President said that "at the dawn of the new millennium there is only one crucial division" among people, and it was not that between Hutu and Tutsi or Arabs and Jews. "It is really the line between those who embrace the common humanity we all share and those who reject it."
Mr. Clinton then looked up and declared with emotion: "When you look at those children who greeted us as we got off that plane today, how could anyone say they did not want those children to have a chance to have their own children? To experience the joy of another morning sunrise? To learn the normal lessons of life? To give something back to their people?"

HEADLINE: BLOODSHED IN A SCHOOLYARD: THE REGION;
Six Leaders In East Africa Agree to Build Democracies

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ENTEBBE, Uganda, March 25

 BODY:
After a three-hour meeting at a lakeside hotel here, President Clinton secured a commitment from six East African leaders today to work toward building more democratic governments in their countries and to prevent genocide in this strife-torn region.
But beyond vague pledges about regional cooperation, a communique issued by the leaders was short on details about how a raft of lofty sounding goals, including protecting human rights and expanding trade, would be accomplished. On democracy, for instance, the agreement contains several loopholes and caveats that would allow one-party systems, like the one in Uganda, to continue. 
 The six African leaders pledged only to "pursue a dialogue on democratization" that "recognizes there is no fixed model for democratic institutions" and "explores alternative approaches to the democratic management of cultural diversity," according to the communique.
Mr. Clinton said: "America knows from our own experience that there is no single blueprint for a successful democracy. We're still working in our country to create what our founders called a more perfect union."
The meeting was the culmination of Mr. Clinton's two-day visit to Uganda, the second country in his tour of Africa to promote a new American policy toward the continent, which Mr. Clinton's aides say would stress trade and investment.
The meeting came just hours after the President visited neighboring Rwanda and gave a moving address in which he said the United States had not done enough to stop the genocide there in 1994, in which more than a half-million Tutsi people were killed by Hutu militias.
In their communique, the seven leaders promised to prevent massacres, among other things, denying safe havens to political extremists who advocate genocide.
"We have agreed to work together to banish genocide from this region," Mr. Clinton said after signing the communique. "Our efforts come too late for yesterday's victims. They must be in time to prevent tomorrow's victims."
The agreement was signed by the United States, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Congo (the former Zaire) and Ethiopia, as well as an envoy from the Organization of African Unity. In the talks Mr. Clinton held out the possibility that he would support more debt relief for East African countries and promised to restore direct American aid to Africa to its historically high level of about $813 million a year, said Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser.
But Mr. Clinton also made it clear that in return the United States expected economic and political changes that would insure human rights, expand their democracies and create a stable environment for investors, Mr. Berger said.

HEADLINE: Puerto Rico Statehood

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It was sad to see Rosario Ferre choose statehood for Puerto Rico ("Puerto Rico, U.S.A.," Op-Ed, March 19). Like most Puerto Rican writers and artists, Ms. Ferre had been a supporter of independence for the island.
Most Puerto Rican writers and artists advocate independence for linguistic and cultural reasons. The Spanish language is the repository of Puerto Rican history and culture, and it could well be endangered under statehood. For most Puerto Rican writers, the possible loss of Spanish and the accompanying symbolic elements of Puerto Rican culture is tantamount to cultural death. 
 Ms. Ferre's argument that statehood for Puerto Rico no longer need mean being swallowed up by the majority culture because of the growth of the Hispanic community and the advances of multiculturalism in the United States is unconvincing.
Harsh economic and social realities are still faced by most Hispanic people, and there is opposition in many parts of the United States toward the use of Spanish in education and at work.

Indonesian Students Clash With Police

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, March 25

 BODY:
Rock-throwing students fought with the police and troops today in the most violent clash so far in a monthlong series of anti-Government protests on Indonesian campuses.
Security forces shot tear gas into the crowd and used sticks and clubs to beat back about 1,000 students who tried to stage an illegal street march in Solo, 250 miles east of Jakarta, witnesses said. 
 Witnesses said at least 10 police officers and 39 protesters were wounded at the public March 11 University, named for the date President Suharto assumed special powers to restore order during an earlier period of national instability.
Students have been protesting a lack of democracy in Indonesia and Mr. Suharto's failure to reverse a plunge in the value of Indonesia's currency.
The fighting broke out hours after the United States announced it would send $56 million in food and medical aid to ease the suffering of millions of Indonesians impoverished by their worst economic crisis in 30 years.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
This Time All Women, No Spiders

BYLINE: By WILBORN HAMPTON 

 BODY:
Entering the Intar theater for Manuel Puig's "Mystery of the Rose Bouquet," the audience encounters a woman asleep in a hospital bed. As the play begins, a nurse arrives, changes the flowers in a vase and is about to filch some sleeping pills from a night stand when the patient awakes. It is quickly established that the woman, identified only as the Patient, has been depressed since the death of her grandson 14 months ago and has been hospitalized for a nervous condition. We soon learn, of course, that she is as strong as a horse.
For the second offering in a joint project with the New Federal Theater and Pan Asian Rep to present three plays from three cultures over three months, Intar Hispanic American Arts Center has mounted a satisfying production of Puig's intriguing psychological comedy. 
 The Patient, a strong-willed, intelligent and wealthy widow, goes through nurses like tissues, and this one is her fourth in a week. The nurse presents herself as a poor and self-effacing wretch who eats her patients' leftover hospital food to economize, is separated from her husband and is so bereft of self-confidence she never even finished high school let alone earned her nursing certificate. By the end of the first act, however, it is clear that what little the audience has learned about these women may or may not be true.
Puig, an Argentine who died in 1990, is best known as the author of "Kiss of the Spider Woman," a novel that was turned into a play, a film and then a Broadway musical. "The Mystery of the Rose Bouquet," which was written in 1981, is similar in structure and theme: two characters from diverse backgrounds are thrown together in a confined space (a prison cell in "Spider Woman" and the hospital room in "Rose Bouquet") and through their initial confrontations discover mutual dependence, even affection.
For Puig a person's true self is known only through dreams, fantasies and fears, and in "Rose Bouquet" these are uncovered through stream-of-consciousness scenes that are spliced into the main narrative. It is through these sequences, played almost as asides, that the audience finally comes to know the truth about the characters. Both the Patient and the Nurse secretly carry a burden of betrayal that has come to define their outward lives.
Under Max Ferra's direction, the Intar production captures the vitality of Puig's modest tale, and the segueing in and out of the dream sequences, always difficult onstage, is fluid and seamless on Van Santvoord's functional set. Little directorial touches flesh out the characters, like having the Nurse continually tuck in the sheets of the hospital bed only to have the Patient absent-mindedly pull them out again. Virginia Rambal turns in a credible performance as the Patient, although at times during an early preview she seemed more concerned with the pillows at her back than what was happening onstage. Doris DeFarnecio delivers a fine low-key portrayal of the Nurse, who actually likes hospital food.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Up 4,000

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
The number of newly idled workers filing for unemployment benefits edged up by 4,000 in the latest week to the highest level in a month, the Labor Department said today.
Initial jobless claims, which give an early reading on the resilience of the labor market, rose to 313,000 in the week that ended on Saturday, up from 309,000 in the previous week and the highest since 320,000 in the week ended Feb. 21, the Labor Department said. 
 The weekly jobs data, which Wall Street analysts had forecast at 308,000, remain at levels typical of a healthy United States economy, one that was entering its eighth year of uninterrupted expansion.
The four-week average, viewed as a more accurate indicator of longer-term labor conditions, measured 306,500 in the latest week, down from 308,250 a week earlier.

Japanese Party Backs $124 Billion Economic Plan

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 26

 BODY:
After hemming and hawing and hinting for weeks, the dominant Liberal Democratic Party today approved a package valued at $124 billion intended to spur the foundering Japanese economy and reduce the risk that Japan will set off a global economic slowdown.
This would be Japan's largest stimulant package ever, but it is still unclear whether it will revive the world's second-largest economy and help Asia escape its financial crisis. With wages, prices and corporate profits sliding, Japan is swerving toward a recession, and the Government has been forced to admit that even its one-tenth of a percent growth target for the 1997 fiscal year, which ends next Tuesday, may be too high. 
 The economic stimulus marks an about-face for Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who had previously argued that Japan could not afford to spend more at a time when its budget deficit was rapidly expanding. Still, Mr. Hashimoto has been giving ground lately after coming under intense pressure from the Clinton Administration to take such dramatic steps to bolster the economy.
The package will take the form of extra Government spending, without any of the major tax cuts sought by Washington. But on the whole, the package is a major step toward what the United States had repeatedly advised. Moreover, this evening, Mr. Hashimoto revealed a willingness to consider a shift in the Government's steadfast policy of fiscal austerity to allow for bolder measures, such as large tax cuts, to boost the economy, according to Yomiuri Shimbun, a leading Japanese daily.
Governing party leaders have been divided over whether tax cuts to individuals would actually be spent, which would help invigorate the economy, or saved, which would not. Yomiuri Shimbun, however, said the Liberal Democratic Party was leaning toward a tax cut and might propose one in time for the economic summit meeting in May of the Group of Seven countries.
The business community had been hoping for tax cuts. But the Tokyo stock market still rose today on the news, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 jumping 322.28 points, or nearly 2 percent, to close at 16,980.62.
Mr. Hashimoto did not formally announce the new package today, but the Liberal Democratic Party, which Mr. Hashimoto heads, summoned Japanese reporters and leaked it to them. Cabinet ministers are expected to approve the proposal on Friday and details will be worked out after the annual budget is passed by the Parliament next month.
Information on the package was sketchy. But economists say the central question is how much money will actually be poured into the economy. In the past, the Government has assembled stimulus packages that included large sums of loans or other measures that did not actually put new money into the economy.
"It's certainly better than nothing, but the next question is how much of it is real water?" Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute, said of the latest stimulus plan. "Exactly how much the Government puts into the income stream is what matters at the end of the day, not how much money is spent -- but whether it is spent at all."
Mr. Koo said if even half of the package, $62 billion worth, "were indeed real money, then it will have a huge impact."
Most of the $124 billion package, the equivalent of about 3 percent of national economic output, would pour money into public works projects, according to Kyodo News Service. In the past, these have often been criticized as unnecessary pork-barrel projects, but economists said that money spent that way would nonetheless improve growth.
The package also offers loans for Japan's ailing Asian neighbors and it aims at reaching a broad swath of the economy. It will invest in the environment, in technology and telecommunications, such as fiber optics, and it includes measures to deal with the nation's aging population.
The Government will use public funds to encourage growth of the market for asset-backed securities to help banks dispose of bad real estate loans. It will channel cash from the nation's postal savings institution into stocks to strengthen the stock market. This move, however, is likely to be criticized by some economists as Government interference in the stock market.
Other measures that may not have a large fiscal impact include initiatives to encourage entrepreneurs to manage infrastructure projects and charge fees on roads they build; to ask local governments to spend their own money on public works, and to promote urban redevelopment and land purchases for public use.
The proposal also calls for examining tax breaks for social welfare and education and for considering cuts in income and corporate taxes to bring them in line with international standards.
The last time Japan poured so much money into the economy was in the fall of 1995, when it announced a package worth 14.2 trillion yen, about $110 billion at current exchange rates. The real spending amounted to slightly more than half of that amount, according to Mr. Koo, and the result was annual economic growth in 1996 of more than 3 percent, the highest growth rate among the Group of Seven nations.
The lower house of Parliament passed a $600 billion budget last week that essentially squeezed as much as $27 billion out of the economy, according to economists. So a fair amount of today's package will be compensating for that hole.
Some critics said that the package is aimed mainly at awarding public works projects in areas that will help politicians win votes in the coming election for members in the upper house of Parliament. Tax cuts would be less effective, critics say, in directly bringing in votes from constituencies.
"The Hashimoto administration is now considering how to cope with the upcoming election, and a tax reduction is another alternative, but it's not so useful in mobilizing people in the constituencies," said Toru Nakakita, a professor at Toyo University in Tokyo. "So the U.S. and outside pressure comes at a timely moment. It makes it easier for the L.D.P. to find a pretext for pouring money into its constituencies."

Morgan Stanley's Income Increases 21% in Quarter

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company said yesterday that net income for the quarter ended Feb. 28 increased 21 percent, to $691 million, or $1.10 a fully diluted share.
The earnings announcement, which continues the run of high profits from big Wall Street firms this week, beat analysts' estimates of $1.06 a share, said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call, a stock research firm in Boston. 
 While Morgan Stanley's earnings were good, they lost some of their impact because they came just a day after strong earnings from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., and a couple of days after earnings numbers from Goldman, Sachs & Company, which on Monday reported record profits before taxes of more than $1 billion.
Earnings from Morgan Stanley's credit card business declined in the latest quarter, touching off renewed speculation that the firm might eventually sell its Discover credit card business, which some analysts say is neither sufficiently large nor sufficiently profitable.
These earnings, for Morgan Stanley's first fiscal quarter of 1998, were bolstered by the firm's securities business, where net income rose 31 percent from the corresponding period a year earlier. Morgan Stanley, with its prosperous Wall Street capital markets business, has been able to use Dean Witter's network of offices and army of brokers to sell a lot more of its securities offerings.
Morgan Stanley & Company and Dean Witter, Discover & Company announced their merger just over a year ago, and this week voted at the firm's annual shareholder meeting to simplify the company's name to Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, dropping the word Discover, the name for the company's credit card business. This change of name "was a recognition that the name was quite a mouthful," the company's financial officer said in an interview yesterday.
Analysts generally praise the merger of the two firms. "They seem to have put this thing together in a way that enables both parties to do more," said James Hanbury, an analyst at Schroder & Company, commenting on Morgan Stanley's ability to push more of its products through Dean Witter's salesmen.
"The broker side was just fantastic," said Thomas P. Facciola, a Lehman analyst, who said Morgan Stanley Dean Witter was the only brokerage stock his firm was recommending. "The momentum continues to be building. We weren't expecting much for the card business, but it was a tad below our expectations."
"The environment is just incredible," Mr. Facciola added, remarking on the combination of low interest rates, low inflation, strong investor interest in stocks and soaring stock prices, that has helped to push the stock markets to new records in recent days."
"I thought they looked good," said Sallie L. Krawcheck, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a brokerage firm. "There is a lot of good news coming out of the firm's securities business, both market-driven and merger-driven." But, she added, "the market was disappointed with Morgan Stanley's credit card business," where first-quarter net declined 21 percent from a year ago, to $99 million.
Schroder's Mr. Hanbury pointed out that under the pooling arrangement that Morgan and Dean Witter used to complete the merger, the combined company would have to allow two years to pass after the merger date before any sale of its credit card business. As for whether there might be such a sale, Mr. Hanbury said: "A year ago, I'd have said 'no.' Today, I don't really know, but it's more of a possibility."
Morgan's Mr. Scott, however, denied that the firm had any such intention. "We're not abandoning Discover," he said.
Shares of Morgan Stanley fell $2.5625 yesterday, to $73.125.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Fall on Concern in Advance of Fed Meeting

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities prices were lower yesterday, weighed down by new supply and market uneasiness ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting on monetary policy.
Still, the 30-year bond slipped only 14/32, to a price of 102 6/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.97 percent, from 5.94 percent on Wednesday. The yield on the two-year note rose to 5.62 percent, from 5.57 percent the day before. 
 Contributing to the seeming lack of direction were several reports that painted a mixed picture of the economy. Initial claims for unemployment benefits rose last week, the Government said, suggesting that the labor market may be softening a bit. The Conference Board's help-wanted index, which measures the level of classified job advertising, strengthened, however.
But Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said of the help-wanted report, "Many investors have recently been taking the results of this survey with a grain of salt since it measures only the amount of advertising that takes place rather than the true intentions of firms." Meanwhile, final figures for growth in gross domestic product in the fourth quarter showed that the economy grew slightly more slowly than was indicated in the preliminary estimates. The Commerce Department also said that after-tax corporate profits slipped in the fourth quarter.
In trading yesterday, securities with shorter maturities led the market lower, as traders tried to distribute the new Treasury securities sold this week. The auctions began on Tuesday with a sale of two-year notes that was in line with expectations. The results of Wednesday's sale of five-year notes was disappointing, however, but yesterday's $11 billion auction of one-year bills went well enough, with the average rate at auction 5.110 percent, about as expected.
Many market participants said they thought that the shrinking size of recent bill auctions would help the bills get distributed after this week's sales. Others said, however, that they expected some difficulties because of a report on Wednesday of strong home resales during February; it hinted at possible inflationary pressure in the economy, which some traders fear could make the Federal Reserve react by raising interest rates. The short-maturity end of the Treasury market is particularly sensitive to interest rates.
Still, though the Fed's Open Market Committee meets next week, most analysts expect it to keep interest rates unchanged. Not including the regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, the Treasury sold $36 billion in Government securities this week. The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new one-year bills:

HEADLINE: Corporations' Profits Fell In 4th Quarter

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
The Asian financial crisis contributed to the first drop in corporate profits in more than a year despite a healthy rate of growth in the economy as a whole, the Commerce Department said today.
After-tax corporate profits slipped 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $483.7 billion. 
 And the United States economy grew at a slower pace than previously estimated in last year's fourth quarter. The gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, rose at a 3.7 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department reported, down from an earlier 3.9 percent estimate because consumer spending on services was not as robust as first calculated.
After-tax corporate profits in last year's fourth quarter, reported today for the first time, fell 2.3 percent after rising 4.2 percent during the third quarter. It was the first decline since the third quarter of 1996.
While a slowdown in exports and a rise in cheaper Asian imports may trim growth this year, analysts say the United States economy is on track for an eighth consecutive year of expansion. Consumer spending and housing "are going gangbusters," said Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve governor who is now an economic consultant at the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
In 1997, the economy expanded by 3.8 percent, topping 1996's 2.8 percent growth and the strongest showing in nine years. Not adjusted for inflation, the United States economy's output was $8.1 trillion in 1997, representing more than a quarter of total global output of goods and services.
In the first quarter, which ends Tuesday, the economy probably grew at a 3.5 percent annual rate, according to Russ Sheldon, an economist at MCM Moneywatch.
The final fourth-quarter gross domestic product figure is lower than the Government's previous growth rate estimates from February and January of 3.9 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. The Government issues three estimates of each quarter's gross domestic product as more information becomes available. Analysts had expected no change in the latest report.
A lower estimate for fourth-quarter consumer spending on services more than offset a higher estimate for spending on aircraft, Commerce Department figures showed, accounting for the latest revision. Real final sales, which exclude the effects of inventory changes, rose 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter, previously reported as a 2.5 percent increase.
Inventories rose in the fourth quarter at a 1.4 percent annual rate. That inventory buildup accounted for much of the increase in growth during the final three months of the year.
Inflation, meantime, barely registered a blip on the Government's radar screen. The gross domestic product price deflator, a measure of prices followed by many investors, grew at an unrevised 1.4 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter. The deflator also rose 1.4 percent in the third quarter, the smallest since a nine-tenths of 1 percent increase in the second quarter of 1964.

HEADLINE: Senate Backs I.M.F. Funds, And Girds for Fight in House

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
The Senate today overwhelmingly approved $18 billion in new financing for the International Monetary Fund, setting up a fight with the House, which has attached a divisive anti-abortion provision to the financing measure.
Underscoring the Senate's urgency for replenishing the monetary fund's treasury, which has been strained by the Asian financial crisis, Senators voted 84-16 to attach the new financing to a popular, $5 billion emergency spending bill for military operations and disaster relief for domestic flood and storm victims. Senators completed work on the spending bill and must now await House action on a companion bill. 
 Senate supporters hope the lopsided vote will persuade the House in a conference committee to act quickly on the disaster aid bill -- with the I.M.F financing tucked in -- or risk the wrath of catastrophe-hit constituents.
But House conservatives are balking. Republican leaders have separated the monetary fund financing from the House version of the disaster aid bill, and have said that the House will not vote on the financing package until late April, when lawmakers return from a spring recess.
Even then the I.M.F. bill in the House includes a measure, unpopular with many conservative Republicans, to pay $505 million in back dues of the nearly $1 billion that the United States owes the United Nations and other international organizations. House Republicans are also holding up the monetary fund financing until President Clinton agrees to an anti-abortion provision that the White House has said he would veto.
The House is also on a collision course with the White House by insisting that money for the emergency military spending and disaster aid package come from cutting $2.9 billion from some of Mr. Clinton's prized domestic programs. These include low-income housing and the Americorps national service program.
The Senate opposes this approach, but Republican leaders say it is the only way to pay for the military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf and for the disaster aid while staying within the caps set in last year's balanced budget agreement.
By pursuing this path, the House risks replaying last summer's impasse over disaster aid just as Congress was leaving on a long recess, a public relations debacle that few Republicans want to remember, much less repeat.
"I urge you not to take actions that could result in gridlock and that would be detrimental both to our troops abroad and to our citizens at home at their time in need," said the White House Chief of Staff, Erskine Bowles.
The monetary fund financing has exposed deep divisions among House and Senate Republicans, and has become enmeshed not only in American international interests but also in fiercely partisan domestic politics.
Resolving the many differences between the two chambers will probably have to wait until House and Senate negotiators meet in late April to work out a final version of the emergency spending bill for the Pentagon and disaster aid. Much of what is happening now is jockeying for leverage to take into those negotiations.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin praised the Senate's action today, saying in a statement that the vote "is a major step toward providing the I.M.F. with the resources necessary to deal with risks to financial stability around the world."
The Senate has also prepared a back-up strategy, a stand-alone monetary fund financing bill that could be negotiated in a conference committee if the House approves its I.M.F. financing bill with the United Nations dues and anti-abortion provision.
The hurdles, however, are high. The abortion provision, which would bar the Government from giving aid to international organizations that lobby foreign countries to change their abortion laws, was contentious enough last year to stalemate a bill to pay the United Nations arrears and reorganize the State Department.
Today the House approved by voice vote to reprise the failed bill. That legislation approves the payment of nearly $1 billion in back dues to the United Nations, reorganizes the State Department and approves $38 million to finance democratic efforts in Iraq.
But this legislation, unlike the emergency spending bills, has no ready companion in the Senate, and contains the anti-abortion language. Tonight Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, urged Mr. Clinton to sign the bill.
The anger among Republicans over the monetary fund financing, which until now has largely bubbled below the surface, boiled over this week when some Senate Republicans, particularly from Pacific coast and farm states, accused their House counterparts of sabotaging American economic interests.
"If we don't act, the country better get ready for a slide" in the United States stock market, said Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee.
Earlier in the week, Senator Stevens said he did not want to see "games played with the I.M.F.," adding, "The I.M.F. is serious to us."
The monetary fund financing package includes $3.5 billion for a new line of emergency credit and $14.5 billion for the American portion of the I.M.F. reserves.
The package includes conditions on the $14.5 billion that would require the Treasury Secretary to certify that the Group of seven leading industrialized countries insure that borrowing countries live up to their international trade obligations and eliminate preferential subsidies.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
New East Harlem Co-op Is Priced for Wide Range

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A vacant block along Madison Avenue in East Harlem from 123d to 124th Streets is coming back to life as a cooperative apartment complex designed to be affordable to people with low to upper-middle incomes.
The complex, called Maple Plaza, will have 155 one-to-three-bedroom units ranging from 650 to 1,040 square feet. The apartments will be sold for an average of $7,600 each because of an unusual financing structure that blends public subsidies with private money. 
 Eighty percent of the apartments will be offered to people with annual incomes from $32,000 to $70,000. The remaining 20 percent will be made available to people with incomes of as much as $118,000.
Maple Plaza will have 12,000 square feet of ground-level medical office space. The complex is eight stories high in the middle, with two six-story wings, and the building is set back from Madison Avenue and overlooks Marcus Garvey Park. Parking in a lot at the complex will be available for $85 a month. The apartment complex also has a laundry room and a landscaped courtyard in the rear.
Construction of Maple Plaza, which began in late 1996, will cost $20.9 million. Completion is expected in July, when residents are scheduled to be moving in.
Maple Plaza is the second project developed under a plan devised in the early 1990's by the city and North General Hospital to revive the six-block area along Madison Avenue around the hospital, which is the neighborhood's largest employer.
The first project, Maple Court, with 135 units, was completed in 1995, just north of the hospital on the block from 122d to 123d Streets. A third project, with 140 units, is tentatively planned two blocks south of the hospital from 119th to 120th Streets.
Sparrow Construction Corporation of the Bronx, which developed Maple Court, is also developing Maple Plaza. The complex was designed by Architecture for Health, Science and Commerce of Tarrytown, N.Y, which designed North General Hospital.
Eugene L. McCabe, president of the hospital, said, "Now with two projects, there is the impetus for rebuilding the neighborhood."
Barry Zelikson, director of development at Sparrow, said the success of Maple Court led his company to get involved with Maple Plaza. "What we found with the initial project is that potential buyers wanted to come back to the neighborhood, but we had to turn lots of them away because their incomes were too high," Mr. Zelikson said. "So we increased the income threshold for 30 units, providing for a healthy economic mix."
Joseph Pagan, vice president of Community Board 11, which helps guide growth in the area, would like to see marketing efforts that "reach a broader ethnic mix." Additional housing has helped build the neighborhood's tax base and change how people perceive East Harlem, Mr. Pagan said, but he added, "A community only prospers when the housing is offered to all its members."
The new apartments, like the earlier ones, are being sold through a lottery, and 40 percent of the units are reserved for neighborhood residents.
Maple Plaza, like Maple Court, is being built as a limited equity co-op, and any profits from resale of the units must be split evenly with the city, which provided most of the money to build the complex.
Buyers benefit from prices that have been kept low because of a novel financing plan. Maple Plaza is being financed partly by a $16.7 million mortgage provided by the city's Housing Development Corporation through the sale of tax-exempt bonds. In addition, the apartment complex has secured $2.72 million in city subsidies and a $15.6 million construction loan from Chase Bank.
Typically, a buyer of a share in co-op apartment building makes a down payment of about 20 percent and obtains a loan to pay off the rest. In addition to making payments on a personal mortgage, the shareholder pays a monthly maintenance fee, part of which is used to pay the co-op's underlying mortgage, which is secured by the entire building.
But at Maple Plaza, prices are set low -- ranging from $4,971 to $10,171 -- enabling many of the purchasers to buy the apartments without a loan. The co-op has a larger underlying mortgage, which buyers help pay through their monthly maintenance fees, which in turn are high, ranging from $729 to $1,240. On an apartment priced at $7,600, for example, the buyer's share of the building's underlying mortgage would be estimated at $105,000, and the buyer's monthly maintenance fee would be $925, 65 percent of which would be used to pay the building's debt.
The interest rate on Maple Plaza's mortgage is a relatively low 6.25 percent a year, helping to keep monthly fees comparable to what a high-end rental unit in the area would cost, said Mr. Zelikson of Sparrow. The rent from the office space, which North General Hospital plans to occupy, will also help, as will a 20-year property tax abatement from the city, he said.
Since sales began four months ago, contracts have been signed on 50 apartments and reservations taken on 13, Mr. Zelikson said.
Danny Bell, a city bus driver, and his wife, Maritza, a social worker, hope to close on a two-bedroom apartment in Maple Plaza by this summer. The monthly cost of their co-op will be slightly higher than the $780 in rent on their apartment in Flushing, Queens, Mr. Bell said, adding, "and now we own a home."

HEADLINE: Bernard Meltzer, Dispenser Of Advice on Radio, Dies at 81

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Bernard Meltzer, the folksy foggy-voiced radio personality who built a huge following in the 20 years that he dispensed advice over WOR-AM in New York on virtually every known problem and every conceivable subject, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Manhattan. He was 81 and widely regarded as the father of "expert talk radio."
His wife said the cause was complications from pneumonia. 
 "Remember," the announcer intoned, "Dr. Meltzer is not an attorney."
Come to think of it, his doctorate -- a mail-in degree in philosophy, economics and finance from the unaccredited Columbia Pacific University in California -- was not all that kosher, either.
Never mind. When Dr. Meltzer spoke, people listened, and with such rapt attention and in such numbers -- almost 600,000 listeners an hour at his peak in the mid-80's -- that he was on the air for 23 hours a week, from 3 to 6 on weekday afternoons and 10 to 2 on weekends until 1993.
What they heard when they tuned into his program, "What's Your Problem?" was an engaging grandfatherly presence who sometimes mispronounced words or garbled syntax but who addressed bereaved widows as "Mother," included a prayer on every program and instilled such confidence with his wide-ranging expertise and common-sense wisdom that at a time when WOR sold commercials for $350 a minute, the fee was $500 if Dr. Meltzer, himself, read them.
For all that, the personal touch could be quite a bargain, especially if Dr. Meltzer departed from the text, as he frequently did. When he got wound up, an ad-libbed 60-second ad could last for two and a half minutes.
An eclectic expert, Dr. Meltzer had a legitimate degree in civil engineering from City College and a master's in economics and city planning from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
Dr. Meltzer, who was born in Manhattan, liked to say that he was born in the shadow of the Williamsburg Bridge and that his immigrant father had delivered seltzer from a wagon on the Lower East Side. By the time he joined WOR in 1973, Dr. Meltzer had worked as an engineer, a real estate contractor, a property evaluator and an investment analyst. He had taught real estate, finance and economics as an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania and was chairman of the Philadelphia Planning Commission.
He also made a surprising name for himself as a radio personality. In a story he loved to tell, Dr. Meltzer, who had been a frequent guest on a number of Philadelphia programs, was pressed into service in 1967 as an emergency replacement for a departing host on WCAU. On his first day, he mispronounced so many sponsors' names, mangled so much ad copy and generally gave such a dismal performance that the station manager fired him on the spot, only to rescind the dismissal after learning from his supervisors that listeners had flooded the station switchboard and his sponsors' telephone lines with adoring calls.
When he moved to New York almost six years later, Dr. Meltzer proved even more popular. Although only a handful of callers could get through on a program, hundreds of thousands of others hung on his every word as he advised on mortgages, leaky basements, Medicaid, feuding neighbors, retirement plans, recalcitrant children and philandering husbands, or, as Dr. Meltzer put it, "everything from affairs of the heart to affairs of the pocketbook."
It was not uncommon for a caller to begin by saying that he had been trying to get through for years, apparently realizing that whatever long-forgotten problem had prompted the effort another one would surely have popped up by the time the caller got through and could wheedle a signature T-shirts.
Except for personal appearances and a brief television stint that his friend Joe Franklin had him do on WOR-TV in the early 70's, Dr. Meltzer was largely unseen, which meant that he could move around unnoticed, at least until he opened his mouth.
His wife, Meredith, recalled yesterday that she and her husband, who loved Broadway musicals, opera and ballet, would be eating at a restaurant or on a cruise when someone at the next table hear his distinctive voice and say with startled delight, "Why, you're Bernard Meltzer."
In addition to his wife, who lives in Long Branch, N.J., he is survived by four children from a previous marriage, Melinda Jacobs of Milburn, N.J., Cynthia Weller of Philadelphia, Lesley Silverstein of Washington and Michael Meltzer of Westport, Conn.; two sisters, Rae Fieldman and Dora Glatter of Brooklyn, and eight grandchildren.

Crisis in Asia Contributes To Fall in Corporate Profits
The financial turmoil in Asia helped push American companies' after-tax profits down 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $483.7 billion. 
 And the economy grew at a slower pace than previously estimated in last year's fourth quarter. The gross domestic product rose at a 3.7 percent annual rate, down from an earlier estimate of 3.9 percent because consumer spending on services was not as robust as first calculated. Page D3.

HEADLINE: Plan Ratified for Mall at L.I.R.R. Terminal

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
After a last-minute dispute with City Hall was resolved, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority yesterday approved the renovation of Brooklyn's busiest rail terminal, the combined Long Island Rail Road and subway station at Atlantic Avenue and Flatbush Avenue, and the construction of a large shopping mall above it.
Long envisioned as a link in a chain of development that has revitalized parts of downtown Brooklyn since the late 1980's, the 450,000-square-foot mall would be built directly over the subterranean rail station by Forest City Ratner, the developer of the Metrotech office complex and a smaller mall next to the station. 
 Although the transportation authority's board had been expected to approve the project in January, it was forced to delay its vote after aides to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said they had not been provided with sufficient information. Yesterday, Randy Levine, the Deputy Mayor for economic development, said, "We think it is a very good project, and we are happy to cooperate."
Under plans previously approved by the transportation authority and budgeted at $180 million, the rail station, which serves 10 subway lines and the L.I.R.R., is to receive extensive alterations, including the widening of several platforms.
An authority spokesman, Tom Kelly, said yesterday that the project would also include construction of a new street-level entrance that would lead to the renovated platforms by escalator. Access for people in wheelchairs would also be added.
Fewer details of the shopping mall have been disclosed. But the Atlantic Center, Mr. Ratner's neighboring mall, is notable for its large stores, including Pathmark, Caldor, Old Navy, Circuit City and the Sports Authority. The businesses have brought oversized retail spaces and suburban-style selection to what had been a declining urban crossroads.
Oficials with both the M.T.A. and Forest City said yesterday that decisions about such things as the design of the new mall, its tenants and the size of stores had been put off pending the outcome of yesterday's vote.
"It means that we will now be able to move forward and negotiate how the rail station project can be coordinated with Forest City Ratner's work," Mr. Kelly said.
Although M.T.A. officials expect simultaneous construction of the rail terminal and the mall, Mr. Kelly declined to say when construction would begin. One city official involved in negotiations on the project, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he expected construction to begin by early next year.
The site, designated by the city for more than 30 years as the Atlantic Terminal Urban Renewal Area, provides many reminders of Brooklyn's decline since World War II. Sandwiched between the 19th century residential blocks of Park Slope, Boerum Hill and Fort Greene, it was proposed in the 1950's as the site for a new stadium for the Brooklyn Dodgers, to replace Ebbets Field. After the city refused to finance the stadium, the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles.
The remnants of meatpacking businesses that had thrived on the site earlier in the century were leveled by the city in the 1960's, and since then, a series of short-lived development proposals have come and gone, including a proposal in the 1980's for a corporate complex similar to Mr. Ratner's Metrotech in downtown Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: On Tour With Clinton: Business, Business, Business

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN, March 26

 BODY:
President Clinton is the undisputed star of the American troupe touring Africa, but there are supporting acts, too.
In the company of 800, which fills two planes in addition to Air Force One, are the usual gaggle of advance people, security specialists, stenographers, telephone operators, pilots, diplomats, coordinators, facilitators, assistants to the President, deputy assistants to the President, special assistants to the President, reporters and technicians (about 250, including 58 from Fox News alone), spin doctors (10, if you count the assistants and their assistants), members of Congress (16, including 14 Democrats and 2 Republicans), Cabinet members (3), business executives, labor leaders, mayors, church leaders, Clinton pals and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, who is working hard to learn how to play second banana. 
 A lot of them -- two of the three Cabinet members and 12 of the 16 members of Congress, for example -- are African-Americans, as Mr. Clinton has emphasized. He made apologetic remarks about slavery in Uganda on Tuesday, but in the next breath he remarked upon how much the descendants of slaves had contributed to the United States.
The President thus plays simultaneously to two constituencies, the mostly Democratic black voters at home and the black leaders with whom he is conferring.
It is a new twist on an old political technique, practiced in the past by American Presidents barnstorming in Poland, Italy or Ireland.
At a briefing here today, Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, discussed the makeup of the delegation, answering Republican criticism that many are Democratic contributors who stand to profit from White House policies on Africa.
"Obviously, some of them are political contributors," he said, adding, "Some of them contribute to the Republican Party in excess to what they contribute to the Democratic Party."
"This was not a delegation assembled by quota," he said. "This is, in part, a delegation assembled by interests. And there were very substantial interests, on the part of the Congressional Black Caucus, in this trip.
"The President, I think, feels we've got a balanced, representative delegation who's here. And we make no apologies for the fact that some of them are political supporters of the President. That's not unusual, and that's been a practice in past White Houses."
For many African-Americans on the trip, it is a moment to savor.
"I can hardly believe this is happening," said Representative Donald M. Payne, a Democrat from Newark. "I'm pinching myself. I've been in the wilderness for 20 years, me and a few others, trying and failing to get the United States interested in Africa."
Mr. Clinton's role is to buck up the leaders of countries that are privatizing their economies and liberalizing their political systems, while urging others to follow their lead, and to alert Americans to the changes here.
The Americans whose attention the President most wants to grab are business executives, in the hope they will invest in Africa.
"We have the leader of the free world here for 12 days," said Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, a Democrat who has attended many of the President's meetings. "That has to say to people back home, 'Africa ain't what you think it is.' It's gone gone beyond Sally Struthers on television, saying, 'Send money to this little baby.' It's time for business to take a second look."
One question hangs over the enterprise -- the fate of an Africa development bill that has passed the House. Representative Edward R. Royce, a California Republican who heads the House Subcommittee on Africa, said it would be taken up in the Senate soon. "If it passes," he added, "Africa will be open for business."
It will be up to William M. Daley, the Secretary of Commerce, who is traveling with the President, to clinch deals with individual business leaders later. He says it won't be easy.
"This isn't for everyone," he said. "We're going to have to target our opportunities carefully, matching companies and countries. I just hope this trip will get people to listen to our arguments, which is all you can ask. There are still serious problems in these countries. But the smart businessman will say, 'Where there's a problem, there's an opportunity.' "
Mr. Daley said the Administration's plan for more investment would succeed only if African governments maintain stability, make a commitment to legal norms and develop cadres of able officials and administrators.
There are other problems, different in each country. In Uganda, for example, access to the port of Mombasa, in Kenya, is vital. At the moment, the port is so corrupt and supply routes so inefficient that it costs 10 times as much to ship cargo from Mombasa to Kampala, the Ugandan capital, a distance of 750 miles, as it does to ship it from Los Angeles to Mombasa.
Some of Mr. Daley's targets are among his fellow voyagers, like Melvin Clark Jr., chief executive of the Metroplex Corporation, a Washington construction company; Carl Ware, who heads the Africa group at the Coca-Cola Company; Paul A. Allaire, chairman of the Xerox Corporation, which returned to South Africa in 1997, and Kase L. Lawal, the Nigerian-born owner of a Houston energy and real estate firm called Camac Holdings.
Others are along for other reasons. Lottie Shackleford is a former vice chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party and a longtime Friend of Bill. Alma Brown, a senior vice president of the Chevy Chase Bank in the Washington suburbs, is the widow of Ronald H. Brown, who as Commerce Secretary began the work of encouraging American business to invest anew in Africa.
Kweisi Mfume, a former Representative, heads the N.A.A.C.P. Ilyasah Shabazz, an aide to Mayor Ernest Davis of Mount Vernon, N.Y., is the third child of the late Dr. Betty Shabazz and the late Malcolm X.
Maurice Tempelsman, best known as a longtime beau of the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, made his fortune as a diamond dealer and industrialist. He has longstanding connections with the DeBeers diamond syndicate, based in South Africa, and he made Democratic campaign contributions of more than $170,000 in 1995 and 1996 alone.
Also here is Ron Burkle, a Los Angeles supermarket executive, who contributed $125,000 and lent his Beverly Hills mansion to President Clinton for fund-raisers.
But none have generated the attention in African business circles that Robert Johnson has. A calm, quiet-spoken Washingtonian, he has built a network of companies around his Black Entertainment Television network. Its jazz programs are already beamed into southern Africa by satellite, and on this trip he hopes to put together enough countries in East and West Africa to justify spending the $8 million to $10 million a year it costs to rent a satellite transponder.
Mr. Johnson made it plain that he is willing to take considerable short-term risks to establish his brand names here, and he said he sensed that African business executives welcomed deals with African-Americans like himself, "maybe because they think they get a squarer shake."
"You have to take a long-term view here," Mr. Johnson said in Kampala the other day. "I don't think you can ignore Africa forever. If you think you have a product Africans want or are going to want, like entertainment, then you come in, maybe take some knocks, and stay the course as the place matures."

HEADLINE: Dreamers of Thoroughbred Glory Mine Florida

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: OCALA, Fla., March 26

 BODY:
Dennis G. Madonna, a 39-year-old general contractor from Pennsylvania, walked around horse stalls at the Ocala Breeders' Sales Company here this week with a trainer and two veterinarians in tow. Tired of losing money with four racehorses, he came to an auction of thoroughbreds determined to find a winner, if not of the Kentucky Derby, at least high-stakes races.
"It's more entertainment than it is a business, but it's also a business," Mr. Madonna said minutes after successfully bidding $37,000 for an unnamed brown filly and $27,000 for "Star One One," another filly. "I don't like to lose." 
 The two-day auction that ended on Wednesday was one of several held throughout the year in this central Florida city that is one of the world's largest horse-breeding areas and the heart of Florida's thoroughbred industry. Although Florida is better known for citrus than horses, its 600 farms breeding and training thoroughbreds employ 29,000 people, generate $1 billion for the state's annual economy and produce more than 3,300 horses a year, which puts Florida second to Kentucky in the production of registered thoroughbred foals in the nation. Kentucky produces more than 7,000 thoroughbreds a year.
The auction of selected 2-year-olds, thoroughbreds screened for both pedigree and physicality, attracts buyers from all over the world, young and retired, poor and rich, experienced and novices, all in search of "the dream." They took their places in an amphitheater where each horse was paraded on a crescent stage, bringing bids as high as $500,000 on Wednesday.
Mike H. Sherman, who is president of Farnsworth Farms in Ocala and who races his own horses, is one of the most successful breeders.
"We have the dream," Mr. Sherman said. "The Kentucky Derby, the Breeders' Cup, to have a horse like Cigar or Secretariat. To win fame, glory and money."
This week, $18.3 million was spent on 288 horses by buyers, some looking for that dream, others for simply getting a competitive horse that would at least earn more than it cost. The average sales price was $63,000, but dreams can also come cheap.
Silver Charm, winner of the 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, sold here two years ago for $17,000 and so far has earned more than $2 million in prize money. Owners typically take 60 percent of the purse money, with most of the rest going to the jockey and the trainer. Millions more can be earned in breeding fees after the thoroughbred is retired from racing.
But the potential of such immense profit is set against enormous risk, with the worst being injury. Breeders like Bob Noble, manager of Ocala Stud Farms, one of the oldest farms in the area, says that for every story like Silver Charm "there are others where people just pay bills."
That was not the case of Rick Kaster, a home builder in Wisconsin who was picking horses here with the aid of a bloodstock consultant hoping to strike gold again. Mr. Kaster said he and three partners spent $85,000 on the mare that was pregnant with Countess Diana, the $1 million Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Champion last November. Now, mare and brood are worth more than $6 million.
"Realistically, they're still going to be rare," Mr. Kaster said of such champions, "but if we work right we'll have another and then another. We'll find another one."
The auction also drew buyers like Mauro Porcelli, 29, a local firefighter and paramedic who said he realized barely an hour into the bidding that he would have to return next year with more than the $15,000 he had planned to spend. Mr. Porcelli said he wanted to invest $50,000 on both a horse and its first-year upkeep, looking for "a business adventure."
"You have the potential of making a lot of money and it looks like a lot of fun," Mr. Porcelli said. "I'd rather spend $50,000 on horses than in the stock market."
Mr. Porcelli said his wife, a bank vice president, "thinks I'm an idiot but she supports me."
Although Florida breeders acknowledge that Kentucky still offers the best blood stock in the industry, Mr. Noble and others say environmental advantages here -- a limestone-rich soil that nurtures strong bones and a warm climate that allows horses to spend more time outside exercising -- have helped develop an athletic horse that can outrun its pedigree.
Florida, where thoroughbred breeding and training began in the 1930's, produces about 10 percent of the country's thoroughbred foals, but they win 20 percent of the major races, said the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders' and Owners' Association. Kentucky produces about 25 percent and the rest come from about 30 states.
So buyers here look not just for bloodline, but things like muscularity, personality, even attitude, in a greatly subjective process that relies as much on intuition as expertise. A 2-year-old, the age when a horse can start racing, also allows buyers to see the horse work out. None of the horses have raced competitively before they are sold.
"After all the work," Mr. Kaster said, "you still have to get lucky."
Mr. Madonna, for whom owning racehorses was a sentimental incursion that goes back to the trips to the racetrack with his father, is determined to work at being lucky. He pays about $2,200 a month in boarding, training and veterinarian fees for each of his four thoroughbreds and is still far from recouping his investment. Recently, he decided on some changes that he hoped would help reverse his fortunes. Heswitched to a trainer with a solid winning record and started buying better-quality horses at this auction.
"I'm trying to do everything right," he said, "but you can still go wrong."
In addition to having the best trainers, blood stock and advice, buyers say they need a plan. Mr. Kaster said his strategy was to know what it took to buy a good horse and then "try to find them as young horses when they are still affordable."
Others note that even the best horse can be doomed in the wrong hands.
"If the person doesn't have the wherewithal to take it all the way he'll probably destroy that horse before it gets to a stakes," Max Hugel, a former Central Intelligence Agency official who owns the Rockingham Park racetrack in New Hampshire, said referring to the upper-tier races. "I can tell you that most owners have a hard time making money in this business, but they love it."
That is because nothing, owners say, compares to the thrill of victory.
"Watching your horse cross the finish line first you have to feel," Mr. Madonna said. "It's like your kid. When I win a race I take videos of it and I watch the race two months after."
Mr. Kaster, remembering Countess Diana's victory, said, "It's like having a football team and winning the Super Bowl."

HEADLINE: Bid-Rigging Case Engulfs an Elite Who Built the Interiors of Offices

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Addressing the elite of New York City's interior construction industry at an awards breakfast earlier this year, Dennis M. Cahill, the publisher of Interiors magazine, made a little joke that hit painfully close to home. He said he would understand if anyone had to leave early to talk with a lawyer about indictments or subpoenas.
A long-running investigation into allegations of bid-rigging and kickbacks in New York's huge but largely hidden office construction business has been the subject of dark humor, feverish rumors and legal maneuvering for much of the 1990's. But now it is drawing to a close, with the Manhattan District Attorney's office negotiating plea deals with officials from as many as six companies. 
 The plea arrangements could come within the next few weeks, said lawyers involved in the negotiations. And if those talks fall apart, the lawyers and industry executives say, prosecutors are expected to bring charges of tax evasion, money laundering and bid-rigging against more than a dozen executives. Eventually, the charges are expected to involve architects, real estate brokers and corporate managers, as well as lighting and furniture suppliers.
"This is going to be a steamroller over the industry, and it'll cause a major restructuring," said Thomas D. Thacher 2d, president of Thacher Associates, a corporate investigations firm, who has monitored the industry for 15 years. "Every single corporation that renovated its space or relocated in the past decade could well be affected by what will come out of this."
Investigators say they believe a group of construction executives rigged the bidding on almost all the major corporate renovation and relocation jobs in the 1990's in exchange for millions of dollars in payoffs and kickbacks from contractors. As a result, investigators say, major corporations were overcharged by as much as 20 percent for office construction.
The contractors have told the District Attorney's office that the payments were legitimate commissions for helping them obtain contracts, and not kickbacks. They also maintained that they did not raise their prices to offset the commissions.
 
Influential Executives At Center of Inquiry
While corruption investigations in the construction business are not new, most have involved union officials and organized-crime figures. This inquiry, by contrast, strikes at an elite segment of the industry, whose executives have vast wealth and influence.
The investigation began after the chairman of a construction company pleaded guilty to money laundering in 1995 and began to guide investigators through a maze of corporate relationships. The inquiry now encompasses much of the $5 billion-dollar-a-year industry, which is thriving in the city's building boom, just as it did during the recession, when businesses were forced to renovate rather than relocate.
Because of the pending plea bargaining, most of the people involved in the case, including prosecutors, either refused to comment or declined to be quoted. Six of the people involved agreed to be interviewed on the condition of anonymity.
Even without any charges filed, many large corporations have dismissed or avoided tainted contractors. For example, Christie's, the auction house, said that it ended its contract with a consulting firm, Bennis & Reissman, and would end its dealings with a construction company, A. J. Construction, because of the investigation, said Taggarty Patrick, a Christie's spokeswoman.
"It's a cloud over the entire industry," said Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress, a trade association. "We'd like to see it resolved."
Central figures in the inquiry, company executives and lawyers said, are Howard Lazar, 55, and Robert Bennis, 52, childhood friends from Queens who went on to become two of the most powerful people in the industry.
After pleading guilty to charges of attempted bribery in the 1970's, Mr. Lazar, a diminutive, athletic man with a talent for sales, established one of the city's largest interior construction companies, NICO Inc. In the 1990's, Mr. Bennis became the most powerful owners' representative in the business.
A trim, white-haired man who drives a Bentley convertible, Mr. Bennis helped develop budgets and schedules for relocation and renovation work for his clients. He also coordinated the work of architects, real estate brokers and, because he was so highly regarded, often solicited and accepted the bids from contractors. His fees amounted to $1.50 to $4 a square foot, or about $2 million for a 1 million square-foot project. His firm, Bennis & Reissman, which once had as much as two-thirds of the business in New York, closed its doors in January.
 
'Pay to Play' Was Rule, Office Contractors Say
The contractors under investigation are suspected of having made $14 million in payments to JDL Holdings, a company with ties to Mr. Lazar. Executives with two of the contractors and a lawyer familiar with the investigation said that the money was provided to insure that the contractors obtained work. They also said Mr. Lazar split the proceeds with Mr. Bennis, who was in a position to direct companies to particular contractors.
Contractors who did not "pay to play" did not get work, said representatives of three of the contractors under investigation.
Mr. Bennis, Mr. Lazar and their lawyers did not return repeated phone calls requesting comment.
Bruce Fahey, president of E. S. McCann & Son, an interior construction company, acknowledged that the District Attorney had subpoenaed his records concerning a multimillion-dollar project at two Times Square office towers owned by Morgan Stanley.
McCann is one of the companies under investigation, said executives and lawyers involved in the case. The others, they said, are Lehr Construction Corporation, Structure Tone, AJ Contracting, Ambassador Construction and Bennis & Reissman.
Some executives said the District Attorney had asked six contractors for records of check requisitions for money paid to JDL Holdings. Although some of the requisitions indicated that the checks were for business development services, investigators suspect that JDL was essentially a mail drop and had no employees, said an executive who worked at one of the construction companies and a representative of another contractor.
Construction and design operations make up about a third of the $60 billion-a-year real estate industry, according to the New York Building Congress.
A cloud fell over the industry in 1995, with the indictment of Ted Kohl, chairman of Herbert Construction Company, on charges related to a $7 million kickback scheme. Mr. Kohl pleaded guilty last year to money laundering and tax evasion, and began providing prosecutors with information that led them to JDL, Mr. Bennis and Mr. Lazar, said industry executives and a defense lawyer.
Mr. Lazar and Mr. Bennis, who have known each other since kindergarten at Public School 86, started in the industry in the late 1960's, at H. L. Lazar, an interior construction company started by Mr. Lazar's father and uncle in 1954.
In 1975, Mr. Lazar was one of the most prosperous executives in the industry when he was indicted on bribery and corruption charges. He and other executives were accused of paying off building inspectors to speed up permits and obtain favorable treatment.
Mr. Lazar eventually pleaded guilty to attempted bribery and was sentenced to one weekend a month in jail for 12 months. In testimony in a related case, he admitted doling out money to Peter Roberto, an expediter for H. L. Lazar, who paid off about 100 building inspectors with theater tickets and cash before becoming an undercover agent for investigators.
Mr. Lazar's testimony came back to haunt him in a 1977 civil suit brought by one of his company's biggest clients, J. C. Penney. The department store chain said Mr. Lazar, his father and their company had paid $1.4 million in bribes to a J. C. Penney executive, Andrew Tsanas, to get $23 million in contracts for renovations at the J. C. Penney Building. The lawsuit also said the Lazars inflated the cost of their work and submitted fake invoices while doing renovation work at the homes of Penney executives.
According to a transcript of his testimony, Mr. Lazar said he and his father met with Mr. Tsanas, who told them if they paid $5,000 he would guarantee contracts from J. C. Penney. He then detailed how bids were rigged.
"After the bids were in," Mr. Lazar testified, "Mr. Tsanas came to our office and showed me what the other bids were and we went in at the lowest price."
Mr. Lazar testified that Mr. Tsanas told him to make up the cost of the payoffs by inflating his bills to J. C. Penney.
In the end, H. L. Lazar and its subcontractors paid Penney $2.5 million to settle the lawsuit. Mr. Tsanas was sentenced to three years in prison for tax evasion.
 
An Era of Prosperity For Two Old Friends
Mr. Lazar's legal problems did not prevent him from starting NICO Inc. in 1977, and it became one of the largest publicly traded interior-construction firms in the country. In 1984, NICO bought Mr. Bennis's consulting firm, A. R. Blyth. Reunited for the first time in more than a decade, the two old friends fell into a working rhythm: Mr. Lazar solicited work for the company, while Mr. Bennis worked out the budgets for the jobs.
In 1991, NICO closed after suffering major losses. Mr. Lazar then joined his brother Gerald's company, Lehr Construction. Mr. Bennis did independent consulting before forming Bennis & Reissman, with Maurice Reissman, the former chairman of the failed Crossland Savings Bank.
Bennis & Reissman quickly prospered, in part because many corporations had eliminated their own real estate executives during the recession in the early 1990's.
But in 1992, a woodworking subcontractor in the Bronx went to the police with a tale of graft, claiming that he was fed up with having to kick back millions of dollars to Mr. Kohl, according to court papers filed in Mr. Kohl's case. The allegations led to Mr. Kohl's indictment in 1995 and eventually to the top interior contractors in the city.
No matter what ultimately happens with the District Attorney's investigation, giant cracks have opened up in the interior construction industry. Smaller companies are gaining an increasing share of the business, while companies like Plaza Construction and HRH Construction, known for building skyscrapers, are now doing the interior work that seemed impossible to get only a few years ago.
"It was a cartel," said the chief executive of one large construction company, who insisted on anonymity. "If you didn't play the game, you couldn't get any work."

White Rejects Criticism for Remarks

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
Reggie White did not back off yesterday from his remarks in the Wisconsin State Legislature on Wednesday that left some legislators cringing and some activists criticizing him.
"I didn't start a ministry to please everybody," White, the Green Bay Packers star, said in a telephone interview. "I'm getting tired of people patting me on the back, anyway." 
 White, an ordained fundamentalist Christian minister, admitted he was feeling the fallout from his comments, which included referring to homosexuality as "one of the biggest sins in the Bible."
An African-American, White also said that blacks "like to sing and dance" while whites "know how to tap into money" and he also used what he felt were positive stereotypes of Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans.
Yesterday, White said he had received calls from sponsors to his New Hope Ministry in Knoxville, Tenn., from which he tries to stimulate minority-owned business.
"People are saying they're going to have to re-evaluate me," White said. "I said: 'Don't re-evaluate me. Forget about me. I don't need your money.' "
Among those speaking out yesterday was David Smith, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay and lesbian activist group, who was quoted by The Associated Press as saying that White had showed "complete disrespect" for gay Americans.
Felmers Chaney, the president of the Milwaukee chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said: "Reggie is not one of those who speaks for all of us, and he shouldn't attempt to do that. I am not going to condemn him, and I am not going to stand up for him."
Mark Kanz, the director of tourism for the Green Bay Area Visitor and Convention Bureau, said: "Most people who I have spoken to are shaking their heads and saying, 'Reggie just kind of got loose a little bit and probably said some things he was thinking but probably shouldn't have been brought up in a public forum.' "
In fervent, unapologetic tones yesterday, White said: "What people missed was the message. I was discussing the gifts people have. It's just like a marriage. People bring different gifts to the marriage."
White said he had stressed the spiritual and musical and athletic side of African-Americans. He also said that people had made too much about his remarks about homosexuality, saying: "That's not the only sin in the Bible. There's fornication, lying, stealing, adultery, false idol worship."
Asked about his motivation for speaking of sin in a public place, White said: "When wicked people came into power, the Roman Empire fell. Yes, I was speaking to things today, if it's true about the White House. People say, 'The economy is good,' but it's not good for everybody. If our leaders are into this, we should expect more from them than just intelligence."
He added: "Look, I'm not saying I'm perfect. I made my mistakes in high school but then I straightened out. Today you've got television stars talking about passing out condoms. They should be talking about abstinence, instead."

HEADLINE: BLOODSHED IN A SCHOOLYARD: THE IMPACT;
Determined to Find Healing In a Good and Decent Place

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: JONESBORO, Ark., March 26

 BODY:
This is a place that has learned to cherish a slow day.
Most days, Dennis Woody and the other paramedics at Emerson Ambulance have a nice, long wait between calls, and sit talking on the soft, secondhand sofa, watching television, thinking about how they could throw darts at the dartboard, if they really wanted to. 
 On Tuesday, an afternoon that forever altered the lives of so many in this small city, Mr. Woody found himself on his knees in a blood-spattered schoolyard, trying in vain to make a young girl live again as her father stood over him and chanted, "Come on, come on, come on."
Most days, T. J. Kelley of radio station KFIN cracks jokes, reports on soybean futures and spins country music ballads for lovesick teen-agers, helping to heal broken hearts that are never really broken all that much. This week, he tries to help young listeners who feel guilty for just being alive while their classmates and friends are dead from a hail of bullets, and pours words out onto the airwaves that remind this place how good and decent it was before this, and will be again.
Most days, Mitchell Faught, who has run the flower shop for 34 years, and Grover Cooper, longtime superintendent of schools, join other older men in the McDonald's to drink coffee, read newspapers and joke about Mr. Cooper's impending retirement.
This morning, as four of his students and a teacher lay in funeral homes and two young schoolmates sat in jail, charged in the killings, the talk was kinder than usual.
"How you doing, Grover?" Mr. Faught asked.
"I'm going to be fine," Mr. Cooper said.
Most people here say that. They will be fine, only different.
Jonesboro, which is expected to pass 50,000 in population by the next census, will always be known, at least partly, as the Arkansas city where two boys, ages 13 and 11 and dressed in camouflage as if they were going deer hunting, shot to death four of their classmates and an English teacher in a rain of bullets that also wounded nine other children and another teacher.
Before that, it was a place to live and work and raise children, where the worst thing that ever happened was a 1983 bus accident that killed eight people: a tragedy, but a thing that they could understand.
It was a place where only one store carries Playboy magazine and you have to ask for it "under the counter." There are no blinking beer signs or hotel happy hours because there is no booze -- Craighead County is dry as old bones -- and faith in God is a given. In a town dominated by the Church of Christ and Baptists, the Methodists are about the most liberal people in town.
One of the two boys charged in the killings was given Bibles as they were locked away, after asking Sheriff Dale Haas whether he had "any Bible thoughts" that might help him through his ordeal.
John Deresbach, assistant minister of music at Central Baptist Church, said, "When you hear people say, 'It isn't supposed to happen here,' what they're saying is, 'This is not the atmosphere that breeds this sort of violence.' "
That is why people in this mostly white, largely blue-collar college town get angry when they hear psychiatrists talk on daytime television about how Southerners are just more prone to violence, or that a proliferation of guns -- deer hunting is a rite of passage here -- led to the slaughter at Westside Middle School.
What happened at Westside Middle School, these people say, was born in the disturbed minds of one of the two boys, perhaps both, and carried out in a freakish, unmentionable moment in time. It had nothing to do with them, people in Jonesboro say of themselves. They only have to dig the graves, and live with the memory of what happened here.
Mr. Deresbach has noticed one change in people.
"People are gentler," he said, in dealing with each other. They will help each other, feeding the need with food baskets prepared at churches and binding up their wounds with thousands of white ribbons, some on mailboxes, others on car antennas, all honoring the dead. Marquee signs that once advertised fried catfish promised prayer.
At Emerson Ambulance, the lobby was crowded with men who had worked to save the students who were shot down. They talked angrily about news accounts blaming breakdowns in society -- their society -- for what happened.
If that were true, these men wondered, why had they not seen this horror before now?
Most days at the ambulance service are "pretty much like recess," said Rickey Elder, a 42-year-old paramedic.
Charlie Ferguson, a 32-year-old paramedic, described a usual day: "We sit, we eat, we get fat."
Some days, they may answer two or three emergency calls. In 1996, there were two killings. In 1997, two again.
"This is a college town," Mr. Ferguson said, "and the wildest things that happen here are the parties. And, it's a dry county," so those parties are not often drunken brawls resulting in trauma.
The 911 calls changed all that.
They all scrambled to it, men like Mr. Woody, Mr. Ferguson and Toby Emerson, who is also the coroner. Mr. Woody, the first to arrive, described how he had knelt over the already dead child, at the feet of her frantic father, and could do nothing. Mr. Woody said he knew she was dead, but could not tell him.
But that was not the worst of it. "The thing I'm going to walk away with," Mr. Woody said, "is the memory of looking up and seeing another girl," in the arms of another rescuer, and how "her head fell back, and the blood coming out."
They did not question whether this would not have happened if guns were absent from the culture.
"You lay a gun on a table and a hundred years from now the gun will still be sitting there, unless someone touches it," reasoned Mr. Elder. Like the others, he wore a white ribbon across his badge.
At KFIN, T. J. Kelley is more accustomed to callers who want to hear the latest by Garth Brooks or dedicate a song to their boyfriends.
"It's not really small town," Mr. Kelley said of his city, which has an economy that mixes farming, factory work and teaching jobs at Arkansas State. "But it's hometown."
He used to be the late-night disk jockey, and he got to know a lot of 12-year-old boys and girls.
"You know when their boyfriends or girlfriends break up with them, know when they're acing a test or got special homework," he said. "They're good-natured Southern kids. You have some doing the nose ring thing, but they're good kids."
When he first heard the names of the dead and wounded, he said, he recognized some of them from those late-night calls. Now he reports on prayer vigils. He hears dedications to dead children.
But like the paramedics, Mr. Kelley cannot blame the world the children grew up in for this. If anything, he said, young people here know better than inner-city youths what a gun can do.
They do not carry guns in their waistbands, for the feel of it. They have seen bullets strike and kill animals, he said. If anything, he said, they have more respect for the gun.
What they are losing respect for, say many here, is the news media. The first mass invasion of news media here has been an ugly one for so many people. Two television camera people cursed each other outside the county jail because one had gotten in the way of the other's shot.
Today, Sheriff Haas told reporters, some from around the world, that his switchboard was flooded with complaints from people here. Television trucks block driveways and access roads. Some reporters have refused to leave doorsteps when people asked them to, or have been trespassing or offering money for stories.
"If it doesn't stop," he sheriff said, he will ask his deputies to start arresting people.
But mostly, people have gone about the necessary things in this bad time.
Mr. Faught, the florist, usually does about 75 arrangements a day. Today, he and his workers did more than 200. The orders for the funerals are still coming in.
People here say the city is still small enough so names and faces are familiar, and history seems to circle around itself. In the bus accident of 1983, one passenger, a man named Terry Woodward, was credited with saving the lives of several students.
Mr. Woodward is the stepfather of 13-year-old Mitchell Johnson, one of the two boys sitting in jail, blamed for the killing of his classmates.

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD;
A Cow Town That Acquired High Culture

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
This is the Mile High City, right? Right. Its National Football League champion Broncos play in Mile High Stadium, right? Right. So Denver must be cradled in the beautiful Rocky Mountains, right?
Wrong. 
 Denver is in fact 5,280 feet above sea level; there is a brass disk marking that exact altitude on the 18th step of the State Capitol's staircase. The city is not in the mountains, however, but at their base -- at the foot of the Front Range, on a high plateau at the western limit of the Great Plains.
Nor is this Blizzard Central, as so many Easterners seem to think. Most years, the sun shines for at least 310 days (the Chamber of Commerce swears it), the sky is often startlingly blue and the Rockies provide a backdrop to daily life so vivid that Albert Bierstadt himself might have painted it.
Denver came into being as a mining town, a put-up-your-dukes, shoot-first-and-ask-later kind of place. When The New York Herald's great editor, Horace Greeley, spent two weeks here in 1859, on an overland trip from the Atlantic to the Pacific, it was a log city of 150 dwellings -- not a third of them, he wrote, fit to be inhabited. No place of similar size anywhere on earth, Greeley concluded, had as many brawls, fights or "pistol shots with criminal intent."
Just after World War II, John Gunther judged this "the most self-sufficient, isolated, self-contained and complacent city in the world."
That was long ago. Now Denver is a haven of clean air, low crime rates and successful high-tech businesses, full of healthy people obsessed by the outdoors. They like their city and state, and many people who don't live here wish they did. When the Harris polling organization asked Americans not long ago where they would like to move, only the three top retirement states -- Florida, Arizona and California -- finished ahead of Colorado. Which worries Coloradans, who fear the place will be overrun; many would pull up the drawbridge if they could.
Japan is about to open a consulate here, and enough Koreans live here to support a Korean-language daily newspaper. A Japanese company owns one of the nearby ski areas, a Canadian company owns another, a Brazilian company owns a third. Denver-based companies mine gold in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and the Russian Far East. And Mayor Wellington Webb travels the world, courting international business for his city.
Yet Denver doesn't feel like a city on the make. It is too laid back, too comfortable in its in-town neighborhoods full of unpretentious houses from the 1930's, 40's and 50's, plus smart suburbs farther out.
When not at work, all Denver, it seems, bikes, hikes, camps, climbs, hunts, fishes, jogs, skis and comes perilously close to mountain worship. Road warriors can join in if they like; weather permitting, you can make a day trip by car through Boulder, Rocky Mountain National Park, Granby and Winter Park, then back to Denver. The world-class ski resorts of Vail, Aspen and Crested Butte are only commuter flights away, and in summer the charming Victorian mining villages of Leadville (America's highest incorporated town at 10,152 feet) and Telluride (once the hideout of Butch Cassidy and other outlaws) beckon visitors.
No place has everything, not even Paris, and few would anoint Denver as a national cultural capital. Still, this is no philistine cow town, even if some men still wear cowboy boots, and the National Western Stock Show draws record crowds each January. It boasts a fine zoo, extensive botanical gardens and one of the nation's better natural history museums, and it is slowly developing into a regional arts center for Colorado and the other mountain states.
 
A Boom in the Arts
"The city I grew up in doesn't exist," said Robert B. Yegge, dean of the University of Denver law school, whose family has been here for four generations. "The oil boom attracted one group of new people, and the technology boom attracted another one. They're young and well educated, and many bring a taste for the arts with them."
Indeed, more people hereabouts bought tickets last year for arts events and scientific institutions like the zoo than for sports events, at a time when the Broncos were on their way to a championship, the baseball Rockies were bashing long balls by the bucketful in Denver's thin air, and the Avalanche was trying to win the Stanley Cup again.
Not many areas tax themselves to support scientific and cultural facilities, but the six counties of metropolitan Denver do; last year 250 organizations received about $27 million from the levy. And not many areas have a cultural center like the glistening, four-square-block Denver Center for the Performing Arts.
It includes the Helen Bonfils Theater by Kevin Roche and John Dinkeloo, named for the late owner of The Denver Post; the updated Auditorium Theater, opened for the 1908 Democratic National Convention that nominated William Jennings Bryan; the Boettcher Concert Hall by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer; a 1,700-car parking garage, and other structures. They are connected by a series of enormous steel and glass arches that form a kind of galleria to keep snow and rain at bay.
Together, the buildings house eight halls with more than 9,300 seats, second in capacity in this country only to Lincoln Center in New York. They are home to the Denver Center Theater Company, an ambitious repertory group, as well as Broadway touring productions, and to the Colorado Symphony Orchestra, Opera Colorado and the Colorado Ballet.
The city's performing arts gem is the Denver Center Theater Company, a resident group that presents a dozen plays a year on four stages, ranging from Shakespeare, Moliere and O'Neill to Strindberg, Athol Fugard and Derek Walcott. In a large building just across the street, it has what most regional theaters only dream of -- rehearsal halls, storage spaces and elaborate shops that fabricate sets, costumes and props.
A silver-haired, pink-cheeked North Carolinian named Donald Seawell made it happen. A longtime New York lawyer and Broadway producer (and present-day chairman of the American National Theater and Academy), Mr. Seawell collaborated on stage projects with Ms. Bonfils. Later she brought him here as publisher of The Post. Returning from lunch one day, he said, he decided the area around the auditorium would make a perfect site for the arts center the city needed.
With money from the city and from Ms. Bonfils, as well as other donors, the complex was built in the 1970's and 80's. Now 85, the courtly Mr. Seawell remains active as head of the $110 million Bonfils Foundation, which devotes most of its resources to sustaining the theater company's operations.
At least to date, the musical organizations have found no equally reliable stream of support.
Founded in 1981 by a pair of displaced New Yorkers, Nathaniel Merrill and his wife, Louise Sherman, the opera has hit a rough patch after the death of Ms. Sherman in February and the resignation of Mr. Merrill this month.
The orchestra plays "in the round," with the audience seated all around it, much like the Berlin Philharmonic in its home hall, the Philharmonie. Both the orchestra, under Marin Alsop, one of the nation's most prominent female conductors, and the ballet company, which won good notices on recent visits to New York, are still struggling to build lasting traditions.
 
Shakespeare, or Bust
Denver is a young city, dating only from the gold strike of 1858, but it grew fast; within 18 years it was the capital of the nation's 38th state, with a population of 35,000. Much of the wealth produced in its hinterland went to enrich other cities, like the smelting fortune of Meyer Guggenheim, a Swiss immigrant who struck it rich at Leadville in 1880, and the dry-goods fortune of David May, who started in business in a tent in Leadville on Harrison Avenue.
In those raucous early days, the performing arts were more than a little problematical. Oscar Wilde appeared onstage in Leadville in 1882 in a velvet suit, I learned in the applicable volume of the invaluable Smithsonian Guide to Historic America, and read to the miners from the autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini. Asked why he hadn't brought Cellini with him, Wilde replied that Cellini had been dead for quite a while, which elicited the question, "Who shot him?"
The year before, one of the mining kings, Horace A. W. Tabor, took offense when the opera house he had built in Denver, with a stage 70 feet long and 50 feet wide, opened for business. Noting a portrait in the lobby, he summoned his partner and asked who it was.
"That's Shakespeare," the partner is said to have replied.
"Who is Shakespeare?"
"Why, the greatest writer of plays who ever lived!"
"Well, what the hell has he ever done for Colorado?" demanded Tabor, incredulous. "Take his picture down and put mine up there!"
Tabor was also famous for having abandoned his wife for a blue-eyed waitress, Elizabeth (Baby) McCourt Doe, whom he married in Washington in 1883 with President Chester A. Arthur in attendance. His monument in modern Denver is the Tabor Center, a shopping mall that forms one anchor of the Lower Downtown or LoDo district. Also in that yeasty neighborhood are Larimer Square, where 17 buildings from the Victorian era have been converted to shops, and the 16th Street Mall, a pedestrian promenade packed with bistros and brew pubs. There is a branch of the Tattered Cover, one of the nation's great bookstores, at 1628 16th.
Nearby stands Coors Field, home of the Rockies, another of those faux-Fenway exercises in nostalgia, designed by the same firm that did Baltimore's and Cleveland's ballparks, but a little too pretty to carry off the illusion.
The Denver Art Museum, largest of its kind between Missouri and California, is housed in a fascinating if forbidding building designed, late in life, by the great Milanese architect Gio Ponti. It houses impressive collections of pre-Columbian and Spanish colonial art and 18,000 American-Indian objects, including pots, totem poles, jewelry and baskets dating back as far as the ninth century. It also holds the personal collection of Herbert Bayer, once a teacher at the Bauhaus, later a leading American designer who helped develop Aspen.
In facing the building with a million triangular pieces of gray glass, Ponti said, "I asked the sun and the sky and the light to help me."
At the moment, the local cultural lion is a burly, earthy mutual-fund tycoon named William M. B. Berger, who has assembled an immense collection of British art in a spending spree over the last few years. His holdings were to have formed the centerpiece of the grand reopening of the museum's European and American galleries in November, after a $7 million, seven-year, museumwide make-over.
But the collection, which includes works by Turner and Holbein, George Stubbs and Joshua Reynolds and Joseph Wright of Derby, as well as a 16th-century Nottingham alabaster of a splendor rare even in Britain, proved too large; it will now be shown starting in September, when part of the permanent collection will go into storage and Mr. Berger's trove will occupy the whole seventh floor.
Some experts are skeptical about the quality of some items in the collection, arguing that they cannot match those of the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven and the Huntington Library in San Marino, Calif. The museum's director, Lewis I. Sharp, strongly disagrees. Mr. Sharp, a former curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said that many of the Berger works, especially the earlier ones, "are of great beauty and rarity -- some of them unique in this country."
 
Modern Architecture
The new wing of the Denver Public Library, a post-modern extravaganza by Michael Graves just across the street, houses a collection of books, photographs and ephemera chronicling the development of the American West. It also displays works by the trinity of American Western art, Bierstadt, Frederic Remington and Charles Marion Russell.
Graves's building, where the leaders of the Western world met during their economic summit conference here last June, looks as if it had been made out of oversize children's building blocks -- pyramid, rectangle, cylinder, rectangle, rotunda, rectangle, piled together to surprisingly good effect -- then painted with watercolors.
Denver's most discussed building, without a doubt, is its new, $6 billion airport, and much of the discussion is ill-tempered. To start with, it is inconveniently located 26 miles northeast of downtown. Its supposedly advanced baggage-handling system, which chewed up luggage for three years, has been quietly set aside; now the only problem is that baggage takes forever and a day to arrive. The rental-car system is also subject to infuriating delays.
The building itself has a certain majesty, especially the main terminal hall, which is covered with a tent of Teflon-coated fabric. But from the outside, it looks like nothing so much as a high-tech encampment for a race of Bedouin giants, and I confess that I can't look at it without giggling.
 
If You Go to Denver (as Tourist or Cowboy)
 
Here is information about visiting Denver. Room rates are based on double occupancy.
 
Where to Stay
 
BROWN PALACE, 321 17th Street, (303) 297-3111. Completed in 1892 at the zenith of Colorado's silver boom, to a Richardsonian design by Frank Edbrooke, a talented local architect, the Brown Palace has reigned ever since as the empress of Denver hotels, and a $10 million renovation completed last year restored its Gilded Age luster. It has 237 rooms, centered on a sparkling nine-story atrium with a stained-glass skylight, surrounded by intricate bronze balconies. Every 20th-century President since Calvin Coolidge has stayed here. Daily room rates: $125 to $195.
WESTIN TABOR CENTER, 1672 Lawrence Street, (303) 572-9100. Location, location, location -- right on the 16th Street Mall, close to theaters, LoDo restaurants and downtown offices. The lobby, lean and blond, is enlivened by an angular stainless-steel fountain. A fourth-floor swimming pool offers a view of the mountains, and the amply proportioned rooms are subtly decorated, mostly in grays. A branch of the Palm, the Manhattan steak house, is in the building. Weekend daily room rates: $128, including breakfast and self-parking.
LOEWS GIORGIO, 4150 East Mississippi Avenue, (303) 782-9300. This 190-roomer is often overlooked. Although it is situated some distance from the downtown action, it's close to the University of Denver and the Cherry Creek shopping district. This is a handsome, well-kept hotel, full of fresh flowers and copious fruit baskets, with Italianate frescoes concealed beneath a steel-and-glass skin. Its restaurant, the Tuscany, serves the city's most sumptuous Sunday brunch. Weekend daily room rates: $89, with city view; $99, with mountain view.
OXFORD, 1600 17th Street, (303) 628-5400. Opened in October 1891, rescued and reopened in June 1983, this is Denver's oldest hotel. Reasonably priced, comfortable rather than luxurious, it has been skillfully restored. Its 85 guest rooms are furnished in turn-of-the century English, French and American antiques, including good Arts and Crafts pieces. The Cruise Room cocktail lounge, remodeled in purest Art Deco style in 1931, with hand-carved decorative panels and dramatic cherry-red lighting after dark, is so authentic that you expect Fred and Ginger to dance by at any moment. The dry martinis are no less genuine. Weekend daily room rates: $139.
 
Where to Eat
 
BAROLO GRILL, 3030 East Sixth Avenue, (303) 393-1040. It doesn't really look much like an Italian farmhouse, but Barolo delivers in other respects. The wine list, for instance, which would impress people in Turin with its 50-odd Piedmontese classics, from Angelo Gaja, Ceretto, Luigi Einaudi, et al; and the food: a superb wine-sauced duck, and a mixed fry of scallops, calamari and baby shrimp, served with a harissa mayonnaise, and perfect gnocchi. Such quality makes it easy to ignore buffoonery like presenting the check inside a Michelin guidebook to Italy.
PAPILLON CAFE, 250 Josephine Street, (303) 333-7166. Radek Cerny is a Czech who worked with Roger Verge in the south of France and pals around with the likes of Paul Bocuse. He mixes Italian, American regional and Asian influences in an appealing menu strong on seafood and pasta. A smoked salmon quesadilla with goat cheese is a brilliant starter, and gingered tuna and Thai beef salad are both worth trying. Service is more professional than at most Denver restaurants.
BRASSERIE Z, 815 17th Street, (303) 293-2322. This is the latest venture of Kevin Taylor, a pioneer of modern cooking in Denver. The setting is stunning: the Tuscan-columned main hall of an old bank, walls white, floors tiled, with four big palms and commedia dell'arte murals for color. My waitress was clueless, but I ate an excellent, properly chewy hanger steak with frites; at the next table, a tuna salad looked good. Every menu I saw in Denver featured tuna; I presume a school of bluefin swam up the South Platte River the day I arrived.
STRINGS, 1700 Humboldt Street, (303) 831-7310. A good-looking spot with bare maplewood floors and blocks of Mondrianesque color, even on the menus, Strings has been at it for a long time. On my last visit, the calf's liver and the pasta were hits, the egg roll and the waiter were misses. Noel Cunningham, the Dublin-born chef, is held in high regard by his peers around the country, and Denver's beautiful people flock there.
AUBERGINE, 225 East Seventh Avenue, (303) 832-4778. Only a decade ago, says a longtime resident, Denver thought good cooking meant "melting three cheeses on top of anything." This is the kind of place that helped change that, and at which Denver now excels: simple, welcoming, reasonably priced. There are only 15 tables, covered with brown paper. The Caesar salad is good, the desserts (like a rich panna cotta with coffee syrup) even better, and the Sunday-night roast chicken for two, cooked as it is at Zuni in San Francisco, a total delight.

HEADLINE: Lawmaker Sees Hope Of Erasing Arts Losses

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
New York State may be about to restore aid to the arts to a level not seen in nearly a decade, State Senator Roy M. Goodman told cultural officials and artists yesterday at a gathering at Lincoln Center.
In what has become, in effect, an annual state of the arts luncheon, Mr. Goodman, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Special Committee on the Arts and Cultural Affairs, urged the Senate and Assembly to add $10 million to Gov. George E. Pataki's proposal of $41.7 million for arts grants in 1998-99. 
 That, he said, would bring the grants to be distributed to arts groups to nearly $52 million, close to the high in 1988-89 and 1989-90, when $54.3 million was given out each year, although inflation would make the difference greater.
Mr. Goodman said some members of his party had opposed national aid to the arts, but he said it was Governor Pataki, also a Republican, who reversed the decline in Albany. Under Mr. Pataki's Democratic predecessor, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, arts grants were cut, dropping to $23.3 million in 1992-93, according to a report by Senator Goodman.
Mr. Goodman said the prospects for a proposed state capital contribution to the arts had been thrown into disarray by efforts to spend much of the money on sports stadiums.
The prospect of more money for the arts was hailed by many at the luncheon, including Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center, who said: "We used to fight a rear guard action. Now the question is just how much the budget is going to be increased this year. It's a good feeling."
Still, the writer Kurt Vonnegut contrasted the $98 million budget of the National Endowment for the Arts this year with the billions spent by European governments overall. "Arts make the soul grow," he said. "The soul deprived of arts starves to death."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Major Indexes Close Lower For Third Consecutive Day

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Rising investor concern about corporate profits pushed major stock market indexes lower for the third day in a row.
An early morning rally bolstered by a stronger dollar, rising crude oil prices and Treasury bond increases fizzled by late morning. Then a broad array of stocks headed south and stayed there, in contrast to their recent resilience. 
 "I think there's a growing nervousness about the earnings reporting period," Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said. "As the days go by, the companies are telling you the earnings are not going to be as good as they had hoped."
Earnings warnings from Adobe Systems and Silicon Graphics were among the latest in a batch of disappointments announced this week. Many companies will begin reporting quarterly earnings in late April.
After Thursday's market close, Adobe Systems announced a larger than expected 50 percent decline in first-quarter earnings because of weaker software sales in the United States and Asia.
Silicon Graphics said yesterday that it would lose money this quarter because demand for its work stations and supercomputers was waning.
Such weakness among technology shares helped to push the Nasdaq composite index, a key technology stock indicator, lower for the first time this week. The Nasdaq fell 4.92 points, to 1,823.62. Despite those declines, the Nasdaq ended the week up 34.46 points.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.81 points, to 8,796.08, finishing the week down 110.35 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 company index slipped 5.36 points, to 1,095.44, off 3.72 points this week.
The modest declines could be short-lived, some forecasters say, if the Dow average surmounts the 9,000 peak and moves to 9,100 and 9,200 in the next two to three weeks, convincing more investors that the bull market's stamina remains strong.
"I think there is a psychological barrier there, but this is a normal little dip that's going to prepare us to break through the barrier," Robert Dickey, managing director of technical analysis at Dain Rauscher in Minneapolis, said.
"The momentum is still there," he said. "We're still likely to see money come into the market. Where else is it going to go?"
The continued flow of cash into mutual funds should also keep stocks from seeing steep declines, he said. "You can't argue with money and when money goes in, no type of analysis can fight that kind of trend," Mr. Dickey said.
But some analysts are not so sure prices will bounce back quickly.
"Momentum has been strong, but there's a natural hesitancy here," Mr. Acuff said. "The next thing is to take some profits and to sit back and see what happens. I'm not interested in market levels. I'm interested in whether companies are going to make their earnings."
Some investors have been extraordinarily cautious about making strong commitments to the market.
Despite the S.& P. 500's 12.9 percent gain this year, Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust in Bryn Mawr, Pa., is still recommending that clients hold 10 percent to 20 percent cash in their portfolios.
Mr. Sichel said that if companies reported strong earnings, he might adjust his cash allocation to 5 percent to 10 percent.
 
Treasury Securities Rise
 (By Bloomberg News) -- The prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday as the dollar rallied against the yen and investors snapped up the highest yields since March 6.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbed 5/32, to 102 11/32, pushing its yield down to 5.96 percent, from 5.97.
The dollar rallied against the yen on doubts that Japan will cut taxes to revive its economy, and after the credit ratings on four of the country's biggest banks were cut by Standard & Poor's. A stronger dollar increases returns from Treasuries for foreign investors who convert the proceeds into their home currencies.
Bonds had fallen this week as traders absorbed some $50 billion of new Treasury debt, including $25 billion of new two- and five-year notes.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN AFRICA;
Two Presidents, Two Strong Commitments to Africa

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN, March 27

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks by President Clinton and President Nelson Mandela at their news conference today, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House, a private company:
 
Mr. Mandela
During these last four years, we have received a record number of heads of states and heads of government. They have come from all continents and practically from every country. They have come from the industrial nations. They have come from the developing world. Some have advanced democratic institutions. In others, such institutions are just developing. . . . 
 I have visited one, which is a creditor nation, which has got one of the highest standards of living in the world, which is tax-free, which has got one of the best schemes of subsidy for housing, for medical services, and where education is free and compulsory, and yet the people in that country have no votes. They have no parliament, and yet they are looked after better than in so-called democratic countries. . . .
So we have received heads of states and heads of government from all those countries. But a visit to our country by President Clinton is the high watermark, and I hope that the response of our parliamentarians yesterday has indicated that, very clearly, our people have welcomed President Clinton with open arms. . . .
The fact that we have high respect for him does not mean that we have no differences. But I would like to declare that when we have differed on an issue, at the end of that, my respect for him is enhanced because I fully accept his integrity and his benevolence. But such differences are unavoidable. . . .
We had a Government which had slaughtered our people, massacred them like flies, and we had the black organization which we used for that purpose.
It was very repugnant to think that we could sit down and talk with those people, but we had to subject our plan to our brains and to say: without these enemies of ours, we can never bring about a peaceful transformation to this country. And that is what we did. The reason why the world has opened its arms to South Africans is because we are able to sit down with our enemies and to say, let us stop slaughtering one another. Let's talk peace.
We will comply with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. And the United States, as the leader of the world, should set an example to all of us to help eliminating tensions throughout the world.
And one of the best ways of doing so is to call upon its enemies to say, "Let's sit down and talk peace." I have no doubt that the role of the United States as the world leader will be tremendously enhanced. . . .
 
Mr. Clinton
. . . As I said yesterday in my address to the Parliament, I was very honored to be the first American President to visit South Africa on a mission to Africa to establish a new partnership between the United States and the nations of Africa and to show the people of America the new Africa that is emerging -- an Africa where the number of democratic governments has quadrupled since 1990, where economies are beginning to grow, where deep-seated problems, to be sure, continue to exist, but where hope for the future is stronger than it has been in a generation.
It is in our profound interest to support the positive changes in Africa's life.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the miracle you have wrought here in South Africa. The partnership between our nations is only four years old but already we are laying the foundation for a greater future. And I think everyone knows that the most important reason for our success is President Mandela. . . .
Today, we talked about how the United States and South Africa can move into the future together. We've reaffirmed our commitment to increasing our mutual trade and investment, to bringing the advantages of a global economy to all our people.
South Africa is already our largest trading partner in Africa, and as the President said, America is the largest foreign investor in South Africa. We want to do more. . . .
Questions and Answers
 Q. Mr. President, two days ago in Kigali, you met with survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and you said that the United States should have acted sooner to stop the killing. Do you think that American racism . . . played a role in its inaction?
MR. CLINTON. I do not believe that there was any racial element in our slow response. Keep in mind, I don't think anybody on the outside was prepared for somewhere between 800,000 and a million people to die in 90 days. . . .
What I believe we have got to do is to establish a system, hopefully through the United Nations, which gives us an early warning system, that gives us the means to go in and try to stop these things from happening before they start.
And then, if it looks like a lot of people are going to die in a hurry, that kicks in motion some sort of preventive decision, mechanism, before hundreds of thousands of people die. I mean, if you look at the sheer -- the military challenge presented by those who were engaging in the genocide, most of it was done with very elemental weapons.
If there had been some sort of multinational response available and sort of multinational force available to go in pretty quickly, most of those lives probably could have been saved.

HEADLINE: Yugoslav Leader Snubs U.S. Envoy and Rejects Peace Offer

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, March 27

 BODY:
The Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, refused to see a top American envoy today and rejected a European offer to help end the crisis in the independence-minded Kosovo Province.
In Kosovo itself, some 5,000 ethnic Albanians buried two men, cousins aged 19 and 21, who were killed this week when Serbian police officers and ethnic Albanians fought an 11-hour gun battle. 
 Mr. Milosevic declined to see the United States special envoy, Robert Gelbard, who warned senior Milosevic aides on Thursday that time was running out on chances to avert tougher foreign sanctions -- or a war in Kosovo.
More than 80 ethnic Albanians have died in police crackdowns in the province this month, fanning fears of wider bloodshed.
After snubbing Mr. Gelbard, Mr. Milosevic received Poland's Foreign Minister, Bronislaw Geremek, the chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Mr. Geremek said he brought a plan for ending the crisis, but after meeting Mr. Milosevic, he was clearly upset and said he was disappointed that there had been no change in the Yugoslav position. Mr. Milosevic insists that the Kosovo problem is an internal issue that should be solved without foreign mediation.
In Washington, the State Department said Mr. Milosevic was risking stiffer economic sanctions by rebuffing United States and European efforts to resolve the crisis.
Mr. Gelbard later visited Montenegro and met with President Mile Djukanovic, an advocate of Western-style reform. Far from the diplomacy, more than 5,000 ethnic Albanians came by car, horse cart or on foot to the village of Glodjane to bury Agron and Gazmen Mehmataj.
A cousin, Haki Mehmataj, 39, said no one knew how the men had died. He said the whole Mehmataj family was home when gunfire erupted on Tuesday morning. Serbian policemen said the gunfire came from an Albanian terrorist ambush that killed one policeman.
Later the family decided to flee and the two cousins went to collect children from school. "That is the last we saw of them," he said. Today the bodies lay in open coffins, draped in Albanian flags, on a makeshift stage in the village.

HEADLINE: Personal Income and Spending Were Up Strongly in February

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
Personal income and spending grew robustly in February, an indication that American consumers will continue to spur economic growth.
The Commerce Department said today that incomes rose six-tenths of 1 percent in February, the same as in January. Spending rose four-tenths of 1 percent in February, while January's increase was revised to seven-tenths of 1 percent, the largest rise since a 1.7 percent gain in July, from the four-tenths of 1 percent reported initially. 
Low unemployment, income tax refunds and a surging stock market are expected to bolster consumer strength. "The consumer is king of the world," said Christopher Rupkey, an economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York.
Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's output of goods and services.
The data were issued a few days before the next meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee. That body, the Federal Open Market Committee, will meet Tuesday and is expected to keep interest rates unchanged.
At its meeting on Dec. 19, the most recent meeting for which minutes have been released, the committee dropped the presumption that its next move in interest rates would be upward. Its members cited uncertainty about the impact of the Asian turmoil on the American economy.
Today's Commerce Department report also showed that disposable income, the money left over after taxes, increased six-tenths of 1 percent in February after having risen eight-tenths of 1 percent in January. The savings rate rose to 4.3 percent, the highest since June 1997, from 4.2 percent in January. Interest payments to businesses, which are counted separately from the spending figures over all, were little changed from a month earlier, at $160.6 billion.
The increase in February spending was led by strength in spending on nondurable goods and services, which both showed gains of half a percent. Spending on big-ticket items was flat.

HEADLINE: A Road Warrior of Innovators;
Tires a Slow-Growth Industry? Don't Tell Goodyear's Chief

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

DATELINE: AKRON, Ohio

 BODY:
How is this for a corporate nightmare:
Your company is in a slow-growth industry. It spends a fortune on research, yet customers view its product as a ho-hum commodity. Now the topper: Every new product either lasts longer than the old, does double duty or otherwise reduces demand for your company's goods. 
 That scenario would keep most executives tossing and turning all night. But it doesn't ruffle Samir G. Gibara, chief executive of the $13 billion Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. "If you innovate enough, you can have a sustainable competitive edge," Mr. Gibara said.
In tires, though, unlike the cars or computers whose users crave the latest bells and whistles, innovation can also crimp sales. Producers introduced all-weather tires and killed the market for snow tires. Several now offer tires that can go without air for 50 miles, obviating the need for spares. And all tires, even the cheapest, last much longer today than they did a decade ago.
None of which seems to faze Mr. Gibara. He promises Wall Street that he will make Goodyear grow twice as fast as the industry, adding $10 billion to its top line within five years. With tire prices barely keeping pace with inflation, the only way to do that is to increase market share. Acquisitions will account for some of that, Mr. Gibara concedes. But most, he insists, will come from home-grown innovation.
Whatever the route, he vows that Goodyear, now trailing the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan and Michelin of France in global sales, will leapfrog over them to the No. 1 spot in the world before five years are out.
Last month, amid much hoopla, he began trotting out the products and processes that he expects will drive that growth. There was a passenger tire that unlike the old steel-belted radials replaces polyester with steel throughout the tire carcass, making it, Goodyear said, one of the most durable tires around. There was a run-flat tire that unlike most available models can be installed on old cars without special rims or wheels. And there was Impact -- the Integrated Manufacturing Precision Assembled Cellular Technology -- which Goodyear says will slash the cost of making tires without expensive new plants.
"Are people forgetting that 35 years ago, a tiny tire company called Michelin introduced a radial tire, grew 25 percent a year and became No. 1?" Mr. Gibara asked. "Well, we have the radials of the 1990's."
Still, none of Goodyear's new products look like slam dunks. People who pay $125 each for the run-flat tires, for example, also have to spring $300 for a sensing system to tell them if their tires have lost air.
"These days, you can drive 70,000 miles on the tires your car came with," said Marvin Bozarth, executive director of the International Tire and Rubber Association. "Who wants to pay $800 to put new tires on a car you're ready to trade in?"
Nor is Goodyear traveling a low-traffic road. It commands 29 percent of American sales but just 17 percent of the $70 billion world market. Bridgestone and Michelin are less than two percentage points ahead, but even analysts who recommend Goodyear doubt that it will siphon sales from the leaders.
"Most consumers don't believe there's much difference between, say, a Goodyear or a Michelin tire," said Stephen Girsky, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. Moreover, said Efraim Levy, an analyst with Standard & Poors Equity Group, "Whatever Goodyear comes up with, the competition will match."
To hear the competition tell it, they already have. Unlike Goodyear, they say, their new tires are rolling and their new plants are humming.
"We announce breakthroughs when they occur, rather than prematurely speculate in the media," said James C. Morton, a spokesman for Michelin, who notes that Michelin has already installed its new manufacturing process in many plants and has had run-flat tires for certain high-priced models for years.
John Lampe, president of Bridgestone's American subsidiary, is equally dismissive. "It is easy to say what you want to be five years out," he said. Bridgestone, he said, is building an ultramodern tire plant in Aiken, S.C., and is modernizing 17 other plants.
Nor is Continental A.G. of Germany, the No. 4 tire maker, standing still. Continental General Tire Inc., its American subsidiary, is investing more than $100 million to automate the plants that make its biggest-selling tires. "We're all automating and getting more flexible," said Bernd Frangenberg, the subsidiary's chief executive. "Frankly, I think Goodyear's claims are one big public relations story."
Mr. Gibara easily ticks off his rebuttal. He says he has armed Goodyear with a revved-up research department, a more nimble marketing operation and a number of alliances overseas, all aimed at getting products out quickly. "If you strike first, your sales grow, even if competitors are right behind," he said.
Investors seem to believe him. On Feb. 9, the day Goodyear announced its new products, its stock rose $3.632, more than 5 percent, to $68.88. Goodyear shares closed Friday at $74.1875, down 62.5 cents.
"When you introduce this many new products and technologies, your image as a leader serves as an umbrella for your entire product line," said Gertrude G. Michelson, a Goodyear director.
Goodyear once had that image down pat. Indeed, until a decade ago, it was on a roll, churning out new products and comfortably occupying the world's top tire spot.
But then, in 1986, the British financier Sir James Goldsmith made a hostile run at the company. Goodyear stayed independent, but it was a Pyrrhic victory. The company spent the next 10 years digging out from the $4 billion in debt it incurred in warding him off. "Research budgets were frozen, and we had to defend every project," recalled Chet Gasowski, an engineer who joined Goodyear in 1971.
"We were crippled," Mr. Gibara acknowledged. "Michelin and Bridgestone were buying up Uni royal and Goodrich and Firestone while we were paying down debt."
Things started changing in 1991, when Stanley Gault, freshly retired from Rubbermaid Inc., signed on as Goodyear's chief. In three years, Mr. Gault cleaned up the balance sheet, sold ancillary businesses and expanded distribution. Goodyear's research and marketing people had been working on a wet-traction tire for years; Mr. Gault lighted a fire under them, insisting that they push it out the door. Aquatred, the tire, was a hit, salvaging Goodyear's reputation as an innovator.
Mr. Gault also spurred Goodyear to spew forth incremental improvements, from the slightest change in tread or chemical composition. "He realized that a constant stream of new products is the only thing that will keep competition from grabbing market share," said Robert G. Purcell, owner of Purcell Tire and Rubber Company, a chain of 50 tire stores that is based in Potosi, Mo.
Mr. Gibara is trying hard to build on that momentum. While he continues to cut costs -- shrinking the headquarters staff in Akron to fewer than 500 from more than 3,000 two years ago, for example -- he is also beefing up the research staff. In the last year Goodyear has hired 100 engineers, and it is seeking 100 more.
And he is building outlets overseas, apart from the mature domestic market. "Stan Gault started the overseas push, but Sam Gibara has internationalism in his blood," said William J. Hudson Jr., a director.
An Egyptian by birth and an internationalist by career, Mr. Gibara spent 25 years working for Goodyear overseas and pushed the company into China, Eastern Europe and Latin America. He is not only chasing tire sales in those areas; he is also taking advantage of their low labor costs to make tires for export.
Mr. Gibara also masterminded a strategic alliance with Sumitomo of Japan, the world's fifth-largest tire maker, whose brands include Dunlop. Under the alliance, Goodyear and Sumitomo make, test and sell each other's tires in their home countries. Periodically, rumors crop up that the two companies will merge, but Mr. Gibara said that for now "we're happy with the relationship just as it is."
On the home front, Mr. Gibara has led Goodyear more heavily into the lucrative side business of retreading truck tires. "We want to manage tires cradle to grave," said Marco Molinari, Goodyear vice president of sales for North America.
Mr. Gibara has set his sights higher than that. He wants Goodyear to be a "transportation services" company.
He is offering, for example, to provide car companies with mounted wheels, not just tires that they must mount themselves. He is offering to handle fleet maintenance for trucking companies. He also wants Goodyear dealers to grab more of the auto service business -- changing oil, fixing brakes, everything but engine repairs.
"Too many people don't realize we can service their cars," said Craig Arch, who owns Bay Area Tire and Service Centers, a chain of seven Goodyear dealerships in Maryland.
Still, putting Goodyear in a fast-traffic lane will require a lot more than some extra brake jobs.
"Can anyone really grow at twice the industry rate these days?" asked Mr. Bozarth of the tire association.
His tone made it clear that he doubts it. How much time will investors give Mr. Gibara to prove him wrong?

Stocks Fall for Third Day On Fears of Weaker Profits
Rising concern about weaker corporate profits pushed major stock market indexes lower for the third consecutive day. An early rally on a stronger dollar, rising oil prices and higher Treasury bond prices faded, and selling undermined a broad array of stocks. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been less than 100 points from the 9,000 level a week ago, finished at 8,796.08, down 50.81 for the day and 110.35 points for the week. But some forecasters called the retreat a temporary blip and said a renewed rally could push the Dow average past 9,000 in the next few weeks. Page D3.
 
Treasury securities prices ended higher. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell to 5.96 percent from 5.97. D3.
 
Income and Spending Rise
Personal income and spending grew robustly in February, an indication that consumers will continue to spur economic growth. The Commerce Department said that incomes rose six-tenths of 1 percent, the same as in January. Spending rose four-tenths of 1 percent, while January's increase was revised to seven-tenths of 1 percent, the largest rise since July 1997. D2.
 
Loss Forecast by Silicon Graphics
Silicon Graphics Inc. said it expected to report a significant quarterly loss and a 23 percent drop in revenues because of declining demand for the company's work stations and supercomputers. The news surprised securities analysts, who had lowered their expectations for the company only a few weeks ago. Silicon Graphics shares traded lower and are now worth less than half their value of six months ago. D2.
 
German Concern Over Euro Stability
The German central bank endorsed the country's participation in the euro, but it said it was concerned that big debts burdening Italy and Belgium could undermine the stability of the single European currency, which is to be introduced next year. D2.
 
Metromail Bidding Intensifies
The bidding war for Metromail, a direct marketing company, heated up, and Metromail's shares rose amid expectations that both suitors -- Great Universal Stores of Britain and American Business Information -- might offer even more. D3.
 
Higher Bid Possible
Decaux, a family-owned French outdoor advertising company, said it might make a bid for More Group of Britain at a higher price than an existing offer of about $750 million by the United States media company Clear Channel Communications. D3.
 
Costlier Cigarettes Foreseen in Law
After protracted negotiations on tobacco legislation, leading senators have agreed to drive up the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.10 over the next five years, almost double what the cigarette manufacturers accepted in a settlement they reached last June with state attorneys general. The price increase is not definite. A1.
 
REIT Shares Fall
Shares of several real estate investment trusts ended lower yesterday on news that influential members of Congress had thrown their weight behind a bill to end a tax break that has helped some REIT's expand. D3.
 
Pacific Lumber Still Faces Protests
A California environmental protest dating to 1925 is unlikely to disappear even with a recently announced $380 million deal to preserve the nation's largest stand of old-growth redwoods in private hands. Although the agreement would save 84 percent of the ancient redwoods owned by Pacific Lumber, environmental groups say the company remains free to cut substantial numbers of trees, covering an area bigger than New York's Central Park.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN AFRICA: THE OVERVIEW;
From Mandela, a Gentle Admonishment

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN, March 27

 BODY:
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa praised President Clinton and some of his policies today as Mr. Clinton stood beside him in the midday sun, but he stoutly defended his right to remain friendly with nations the United States considers rogues, like Libya, Iran and Cuba.
He also suggested, fondly but firmly, that "the United States, as the leader of the world, should set an example to all of us" by reaching out to its enemies and saying, "Let's sit down and talk peace." The standing of the United States would be "tremendously enhanced," he said. A South African minister explained later that he had been referring to Cuba, among other countries. 
 Mr. Clinton listened intently, his face betraying no emotion. Excerpts from Mr. Mandela's and Mr. Clinton's comments, page A5.
It was an extraordinary moment. The rules of the diplomatic game do not permit the leader of one country to lecture the leader of another. But Mr. Mandela has such towering moral authority that the rules do not really apply to him, and American officials took no offense.
Mr. Clinton has made it clear at every stop on his 12-day tour of Africa that the United States wants full partnerships with the continent's young states, rather than the unequal relationships of the past. Today Mr. Mandela, at 79 years of age almost three decades Mr. Clinton's senior, acted every bit his equal.
After a 90-minute meeting with Mr. Clinton and a joint news conference, Mr. Mandela gave Mr. Clinton an emotion-drenched tour of Robben Island, where he spent 18 years as a political prisoner, confined to a tiny cell, forced to do backbreaking labor. From that confinement he emerged, as Mr. Clinton noted, "not in anger, but in hope, passion and determination to put things right," to become the first leader of newly democratic South Africa.
"When I come here," Mr. Mandela said after he and Mr. Clinton reached the island by helicopter, "I call back into memory that great saga in which the authorities, who were pitiless, insensitive and cruel, nevertheless failed in their evil intentions."
The two Presidents first visited a quarry where Mr. Mandela broke rocks, hour after hour, as his assigned duty. They were casually dressed, Mr. Clinton in a navy blue sport shirt, open at the neck, Mr. Mandela in a flowing gold and midnight-blue shirt whose collar was buttoned. Mrs. Clinton joined them.
Mr. Mandela put his right arm around Mr. Clinton's waist as he led him into the cellblock where he was jailed, and Mr. Clinton put his left arm over Mr. Mandela's shoulder.
"This was my home," Mr. Mandela said softly as the two men entered a 6-by-6 cell with a small window looking onto a barren courtyard. A slop bucket and a pile of gray felt blankets sat on the floor. For 14 years Mr. Mandela slept on the floor, until his bad back won him the privilege of a cot.
President Clinton praised President Mandela because he had survived "without having his heart turn to stone and without giving up his dream for South Africa."
Eight miles off Cape Town in the Atlantic Ocean, Robben Island was a place of banishment for centuries. Many of the leaders of the African National Congress, today the ruling party, were imprisoned on its 1,600 acres, and their lives were harsh. Like Gettysburg for Americans, it is sacred soil for South Africans. Patrick Lekota, now Chairman of the Council of Ministers, the upper house of Parliament, described it today as "the ground on which the peace, the stability and the future of our country was cultivated."
Tonight President Mandela was host at a state dinner at Vergelegen, a showpiece farm northeast of Cape Town. The guests ate in a marquee erected near the restored 18th-century homestead.
A bit shaky on his legs now, Mr. Mandela needs help going up and down stairs. But he was full of intellectual vigor as he answered questions at the news conference.
Mr. Mandela was asked about an African trade bill passed by the House of Representatives earlier this month. It has been widely criticized in South Africa as a harmful neocolonial plan because it would require African nations to privatize their economies and liberalize their political systems in order to attain free access to American markets.
"This is a matter over which we have serious reservations, this legislation," Mr. Mandela said. "To us, it is not acceptable. But nevertheless we accept each other's integrity and we are discussing the matter in that spirit."
A senior American official, speaking on condition that he not be identified, said later that most of the African leaders had welcomed the bill, which Mr. Clinton supports. He conceded that the South Africans were highly dubious, but suggested that "when the intention of the act is better understood, that will erase some concerns here."
The bill's prospects in the Senate remain highly uncertain, and the continued opposition of South Africa, the continent's major economic power, would do little to improve them.
Noting that many foreign leaders had visited South Africa in recent months, Mr. Mandela said he had invited Fidel Castro of Cuba and Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, and had received Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former President of Iran. The United States has no diplomatic relations with those three countries, and has accused all of them of violating human rights and harboring terrorists.
"I do that because our moral authority dictates that we should not abandon those who helped us in the darkest hour of the history of this country," President Mandela said with animation. "Not only did they support us in rhetoric, they gave us the resources for us to conduct the struggle, and the will.
"Those South Africans who have berated me for being loyal to our friends -- literally, they can go and throw themselves in a pool. I'm not going to betray the trust of those who helped us."
But he stopped short of noting that for many of the years when Cuba, Iran, Libya and other countries were helping the cause of apartheid's foes, the United States and many of its allies maintained relations with the old white-controlled Government, largely because of strategic and economic considerations.
Mr. Clinton, who spoke after Mr. Mandela at the news conference, did not dilute his praise as a result of the South African's comments. Everyone in the world, he said, could learn from Mr. Mandela's example that "fundamental goodness and courage and largeness of spirit can prevail over power lust, division and obsessive smallness in politics."
To some in the President's party, that last phrase seemed to carry a hint of bitterness against those who have hounded him over his alleged financial and sexual transgressions. It was the first news conference at which the President was not questioned about those issues since the disclosure in late January of the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern.
Mr. Clinton also promised to press his partners in the Group of Eight industrial nations to cancel up to 80 percent of their debts for African countries that reformed their economies. He said that the subject of debt relief had been raised by every Africa leader he had met on this trip.
At the end of his remarks, President Clinton turned briefly to a domestic topic, expressing his determination to prevent a repetition of the shooting deaths of five people at a Jonesboro, Ark., school.

HEADLINE: Hip-Hop Idol Is the Pride Of a People;
Young Haitian-Americans Get Help Against Stigma

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
Nelust Wyclef Jean, a member of the hip-hop group the Fugees, strolled onto the basketball court in the Springfield Gardens High School gymnasium in Queens, grabbed a microphone and delivered a few lines from "Gone Till November," a hit from his latest album.
The thousand or so teen-agers packed into the bleachers screamed and began to sing along. But just as quickly, Mr. Jean stopped and got to the main point of his visit. "I want everybody to know, first of all, that I'm a kid from Haiti who grew up in New York City," said the 27-year-old musician, to thunderous applause from a group of Haitian students, who were waving the blue and red colors of their country's flag. 
 Mr. Jean, who won two Grammy Awards last year and was nominated this year, was peppered with questions from students about how he got his break in the music business. But one Haitian girl wanted to know something else. "What do you do when people make fun of you because you're Haitian?" she asked with distinct pride.
Mr. Jean had a pointed answer: "The same people that are making fun of you, 10 years from now most of them will be on crack anyway. So get your education."
Being a Haitian teen-ager in America is not easy, many young immigrants and children of immigrants say. With black skin, French names and Creole accents, they stand out vividly at an age when fitting in is all important. The teen-agers say "Haitian" has become an all-purpose dirty word hurled by some of their classmates as an insult -- most often by African-American teen-agers who share their skin color but feel no bond with the newcomers.
Now Haitian youths in New York and across the country have latched on to Mr. Jean as a symbol not just of success but also of acceptance. His appeal across ethnic lines -- and especially his popularity among African-American youths -- is seen by young Haitians as proof that they too can fit in, be cool and win the respect of their non-Haitian peers.
"He's a hero for us," said Petit Frere, an 18-year-old senior at Springfield Gardens High School. "He makes us feel proud. He's not afraid to say that he's Haitian."
Mr. Jean, who has homes in Manhattan and New Jersey and has made frequent visits to schools in the area, says he wants to use his music to inspire young people and to bridge the gaps between ethnic groups, especially among blacks. But it is clear where his heart lies.
"They're the only ones I love," Mr. Jean said in an interview after the Queens appearance, referring to the Haitian youngsters. "If I can help them be proud of themselves, tomorrow they're going to go to school with a different self-esteem, and it's going to help them accomplish what I accomplished."
The music of Mr. Jean and the Fugees -- including Prakazrel Michel, who is Mr. Jean's cousin and also Haitian, and Lauryn Hill, who is African-American -- is a mix of hip-hop, reggae and rap, including raps in Creole, the language spoken by the majority of Haitians. That trend is even more pronounced on his solo album, "Carnival," on which the other Fugees appear as part of the Refugee All-Stars, his backup group.
Last year, Mr. Jean wrapped himself in the Haitian flag during a performance at the Grammys -- an image that was broadcast across the world and left a deep impression on many young Haitians in the United States.
The experience was a balm for lingering wounds. Edwidge Danticat, a Haitian-American writer whose novels depict her experience growing up in Brooklyn, recalls how some Haitian friends in junior high were beaten up almost every day after school, most often by black classmates. The situation got so bad that teachers had to escort groups of Haitian-American children home, and they were not taken along on class trips, said Ms. Danticat, whose short-story collection "Krik Krak!" was a finalist for the National Book Award two years ago.
A typical insult, she said, was "H.B.O." -- Haitian Body Odor. But Ms. Danticat, 29, said that Mr. Jean's ascension into American popular culture had presented another side of what it is like to be Haitian. "When we think of the Haitian identity, it will always be before Wyclef and after Wyclef," said Ms. Danticat, who has herself become a role model for many Haitian immigrants here.
To some extent, the rift between Haitian students and their peers, including African-Americans, simply reflects the typical cliquishness of teen-agers. And for generations, immigrant children from different parts of the world have found themselves confronting the taunts and fists of classmates who view the schoolyard as their native ground.
But Haitian schoolchildren have had to jump over more hurdles than many immigrants. Besides skin color and language, they find themselves confronting negative stereotypes associated with their deeply impoverished country and even the lingering stigma from the early days of the AIDS epidemic, when Haitians were inaccurately classified as a high-risk group.
Some American-born black students acknowledged that they were not on good terms with their Haitian peers, and they put the blame at least in part on the Haitians, describing them as standoffish. "They're different," said Kevin Peterson, a 17-year-old senior at Clara Barton High School in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. "You try to talk to them, and they turn away, so you just call them names."
At Erasmus Hall High School in Flatbush, Brooklyn, a group of African-American students hanging out on Church Avenue during their lunch break acknowledged that they had "beef" with Haitian students, and some described a continuing animosity.
But when asked about Mr. Jean and the Fugees, their tone was decidedly warmer. "Yeah, we know Wyclef is Haitian," said 17-year-old Yusef Taylor, adding the teen-age stamp of approval: "He's down."
Still, their admiration for the performer has not necessarily softened their overall attitudes toward their Haitian peers. "He's not like the others," Mr. Taylor said. "He's been here for a while."
Such tensions, of course, are not confined to young people. Relations between African-Americans and various immigrant groups in the city have often been strained, in part reflecting the economic stresses of communities that find themselves competing for limited jobs and other opportunities.
Some African-Americans feel that immigrant groups, including Haitians, unfairly reap economic benefits that are denied to American blacks. The immigrants, this argument goes, are given every opportunity to succeed while discrimination continues to confine many blacks to the bottom of the economic ladder.
And many Haitian immigrants are determined to distance themselves from African-Americans, fearing that their own progress will be slowed if they are lumped together with American blacks. Some parents even express concern that black American youths will be a bad influence on their children in school.
"African-Americans are as diverse as Haitians," said Dr. Carole Charles, a Haitian-born sociologist at Baruch College who has written extensively on the relations between Haitian immigrants and American-born blacks. "But Haitians identify them as being at the bottom. The animosity comes because African-Americans react to that."
The irony, Dr. Charles said, is that Haitians and American blacks should be bound together by their common skin complexion and concerns. "Both groups to some extent are victim of a racial system that they didn't invent," she said.
Percy Thorne, the principal of Springfield Gardens High School, said that more than 30 percent of the school's 1,900 students are Haitian, and that the number is growing. Citywide, school officials have identified about 7,000 students as Haitian, but that does not include those who were born here of Haitian parents.
The scorn of other students, particularly African-Americans, has a sharp sting for young Haitians brought up to take pride in their nation's status as the world's first black republic. Indeed, when Haitians first came to the United States in large numbers in the early 1960's, they were mostly well-educated French-speakers from the cities, who were often viewed here as exotic and sophisticated.
"If anything, they thought we were uppity," said Gosette Rimpel-Judkins, a 39-year-old executive who came to the United States in 1969. "I grew up in Bed-Stuy, and strangely enough, the only person who wanted to be my friend was a little white girl."
By the early 1980's, the image of Haitian immigrants in this country began to shift. Continued political repression and economic hardship forced an exodus of rural peasants who fled Haiti in rickety boats, their plight a staple of the nightly news. As AIDS began to take its toll, the Federal Government initially classified Haitians as a high-risk group, along with gay men, intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs. Haitians were removed from the list in 1991.
"You wanted to crawl under a rock and hide," said Herard Severe, a 31-year-old accountant who came here in 1966, referring to the AIDS fallout. "We caught hell."
But on the recent rainy afternoon when Mr. Jean, clad in baggy jeans,walked into Springfield Gardens High School, the Haitian students were not hiding. They came out in full force. "Where are my Haitians?" the musician asked in Creole, to wild cheers. "I want to hear from you."
"I see a lot of them cheering for Wyclef," Loudina Brice, an 18-year-old senior, said of her non-Haitian classmates. "I'm going to remind them of that when they call me 'Haitian.' "
 
Lyrics from the song "San Fizi" in Creole, followed by the English translation, from the album, "Carnival," by Wyclef Jean and the All-Star Refugees:
Lem te kon al lekol, Amerikain te kon jourem
Yo te relem neg nwe, yo relem ti neg fume
Jan yo pale, moin oue yo pa civilize
Jan yo pale moin oue yo pa kon Bon Die.
(When I went to school, Americans used to curse me
They used to call me black boy, they called me Little Smoky
The way they talk, I see they're uncivilized
The way they talk, I see they don't know God.)

HEADLINE: Senators Agree On Forcing Up Cigarette Price

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
After a week of day and night negotiations on tobacco legislation, leading senators have agreed to drive up the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.10 over the next five years, almost double what the cigarette manufacturers accepted in a settlement they reached last June with state attorneys general.
But senators cautioned today that many other elements of the legislation had not been completed and that the negotiations, including the agreement on the higher price, could still come apart. "We plug one hole up and then another one springs open," said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana. 
 The Treasury Department estimated that the price increase and other contemplated steps, including limiting tobacco advertising and outlawing most cigarette vending machines, would result in a 40 percent reduction by 2003 in the number of teen-agers who smoke.
The biggest stumbling block today seemed to be how much authority to give the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products.
In a letter this week to the White House with copies sent to many senators, J. Phil Carlton, a top lawyer for the tobacco industry, declared that the cigarette manufacturers opposed the legislation now under consideration because "it would almost certainly result in industry bankruptcies."
In an odd way, the complaint may have improved prospects for the legislation, and the letter should be considered with that in mind. The tobacco companies are such pariahs in the public's eye that few lawmakers can afford to vote for a bill that the industry endorses.
But the companies are the largest corporate contributors to Republican politicians and are spending millions this year on lobbying, so their political influence remains substantial.
Staff members planned to work on the details of the legislation all weekend. Among those involved are senators from both parties and their staff assistants, officials from the White House and various agencies, public health authorities and representatives of state attorneys general. The tobacco companies do not have representatives in the negotiating room, but they are following developments closely from the outside.
Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is directing the negotiations, said that he hoped to bring a bill before the Commerce Committee, of which he is chairman, next Wednesday.
No other legislation Congress is likely to vote on this year would lead to such fundamental changes in the society. President Clinton has called it the most important public health measure in years.
If the Commerce Committee approves a bill, it will be but the first step in the legislative process, and many obstacles will be ahead. If the committee cannot come to an agreement, then the prospects for tobacco legislation this year are slight.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader, said this week that tobacco legislation must clear the Senate before the end of May if it is to stand much chance of enactment.
The House of Representatives is treading water on the issue, with House leaders waiting to see what the Senate does before they move.
The price of a pack of cigarettes varies considerably depending on state and local taxes. The average price nationwide is $1.94. The $1.10 per pack increase, when added to a Federal excise-tax increase already on the books and expected inflation, would push the average price to $3.58 in 2003, the Treasury calculates.
Politicians generally agree that raising the price of cigarettes is the best way to prevent young people from starting to smoke, but some have cautioned that the price cannot be pushed so high that an illegal market develops.
The Senate negotiators have estimated that the legislation would require the cigarette companies to pay about $500 billion into a trust fund over the next 25 years, significantly more than the $368.5 billion envisioned by last June's settlement with the state attorneys general. The payments would be financed by the price increase and would be passed on to smokers, but the companies would presumably lose revenue because fewer people would smoke.
In exchange for not challenging in court the advertising restrictions and other aspects of the legislation, the industry has insisted on protection from lawsuits based on smoking-related illnesses. One of the industry's main goals is to have a degree of certainty about how much money it will have to pay in legal claims.
The lawmakers seemed receptive to a ceiling on how much the industry would have to pay out in damages each year, with any excess payable in later years. But as of tonight, the matter of further protection -- especially a ban on class-action lawsuits seeking punitive damages for past industry conduct, a prohibition the cigarette companies urgently want -- was still undecided.
Senators said there was broad agreement that the legal protection awarded the companies should be contingent on a drop in youth smoking to specific levels and should be withdrawn if the goals are not met.
In addition, the companies would be assessed a stiff fine if the rate of teen-age smoking did not fall to the levels set in the legislation.
The sense among negotiators tonight seemed to be that those questions could be resolved if they could agree on the matter of regulation by the Food and Drug Administration.
The agency and leaders in the field of public health, like David A. Kessler, the agency's former commissioner who participated in the negotiations Thursday evening, and C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, insist that the F.D.A. should be allowed to regulate nicotine as a drug and cigarettes as drug delivery devices. They want this authority to be codified in the new legislation.
The agency already claims such authority. But in a case now before a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the tobacco companies maintain that it exceeds the agency's current statutory bounds. The case may have to be reargued, since one of the three judges died and another is ill.
The Food and Drug Administration is out of favor with many Republicans in Congress. Two influential Republican Senators, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and James M. Jeffords of Vermont, prefer legislation that would restrict somewhat the agency's capacity to regulate tobacco.

Tobacco Documents Ordered
 ST. PAUL, March 27 (AP) -- Tobacco companies must comply with lower court orders to turn over 39,000 secret documents because a request for individual review of the papers is a "practical impossibility," the Minnesota Supreme Court said today.
The court stayed its order until 5 P.M. Wednesday, giving defendants in Minnesota's tobacco lawsuit time to appeal to the United States Supreme Court. David Bernick, a lawyer for Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, said the defendants would ask the Court for a stay and a further review of the state ruling.
Attorney General Hubert Humphrey 3d of Minnesota said the documents would "expose the full depth of the tobacco industry's law-breaking."

HEADLINE: I Shop, Ergo I Am: The Mall As Society's Mirror;
Scholars Say Where, What and How People Buy Is Changing, and Not for the Better

BYLINE: By SARAH BOXER 

 BODY:
In certain academic circles, "shop till you drop" is considered a civic act. If you follow cultural studies -- the academic scrutiny of ordinary activities like eating fast food, buying a house in the suburbs, watching television and taking vacations at Disneyland -- you will know that shopping is not just a matter of going to a store and paying for your purchase.
How you shop is who you are. Shopping is a statement about your place in society and your part in world cultural history. There is a close relationship, even an equation, between citizenship and consumption. The store is the modern city-state, the place where people act as free citizens, making choices, rendering opinions and socializing with others. 
 If this sounds like a stretch, you're way behind the times. The field of cultural studies, which took off in England in the 1970's, has been popular in this country for more than a decade.
The intellectual fascination with stores goes back even further. When the philosopher Walter Benjamin died in 1940, he was working on a long study of the Paris arcades, the covered retail passageways, then almost extinct, which he called the "original temples of commodity capitalism." Six decades later, the study of shopping is well trampled. Some academics have moved on from early classical work on the birth of the department store and the shopping arcade to the shopping malls of the 1950's and even the new wide aisles of today's factory outlets and superstores -- places like Best Buy, Toys "R" Us and Ikea.
Historically, the age of shopping and browsing begins at the very end of the 18th century. In a paper titled "Counter Publics: Shopping and Women's Sociability," delivered at the Modern Language Association's annual meeting, Deidre Lynch, an associate professor of English at the State University of New York in Buffalo, said the word "shopping" started to appear frequently in print around 1780. That was when stores in London started turning into public attractions.
By 1800, Ms. Lynch said, "a policy of obligation-free browsing seems to have been introduced into London emporia." At that point, "the usual morning employment of English ladies," the 18th-century writer Robert Southey said, was to "go a-shopping." Stores became places to socialize, to see and be seen. Browsing was born.
The pastime of browsing has been fully documented. Benjamin wrote that the Paris arcades, which went up in the early 1800's, created a new kind of person, a professional loiterer, or flaneur, who could easily turn into a dangerous political gadfly. The philosopher Jurgen Habermas, some of his interpreters say, has equated consumer capitalism with the feminization of culture. And now some feminists, putting a new spin on this idea, are claiming the store as the place where women first became "public women."
By imagining that they owned the wares, women were "transported into new identities," Ms. Lynch said. By meeting with their friends, they created what feminist critics like Nancy Fraser and Miriam Hansen call "counter publics," groups of disenfranchised people.
 
Putting Merchants In Their Place
Some feminists point out that as shoppers, women had the power to alter other people's lives. Women who spent "a summer's day cheapening a pair of gloves" without buying anything, as Southey put it, were "fortifying the boundaries of social class," Ms. Lynch said. They were "teaching haberdashers and milliners their place," taunting them with the prospect of a purchase and never delivering. It may not have been nice, but it was a sort of political power.
Women could also use their power for good. In 1815, Ms. Lynch points out, Mary Lamb wrote an essay called "On Needlework," urging upper-class ladies who liked to do needlework as a hobby to give compensatory pay to women who did it to make a living. Lamb's biographer recently noted that this was how "bourgeois women busily distributed the fruits of their husbands' capitalist gains in the name of female solidarity."
The idea that shopping is a form of civil action naturally has its critics. In one of the essays in a book titled "Buy This Book," Don Slater, a sociologist at the University of London, criticized the tendency of many academics to celebrate "the productivity, creativity, autonomy, rebelliousness and even . . . the 'authority' of the consumer." The trouble with this kind of post-modern populism is that it mirrors "the logic of the consumer society it seeks to analyze," he said. Such theories, without distinguishing between real needs and false ones, he suggested, assume that shoppers are rational and autonomous creatures who acquire what they want and want what they acquire.
Another critic, Meaghan Morris, author of an essay called "Banality in Cultural Studies," has faulted academics for idealizing the pleasure and power of shopping and underestimating the "anger, frustration, sorrow, irritation, hatred, boredom and fatigue" that go with it.
The field of shopping studies, whatever you think of it, is now at a pivotal point. In the 19th century, emporiums in London and arcades in Paris turned shopping into social occasions; in the 20th century, academics turned shopping into civic action; and in the 21st century, it seems that megastores will bring us into a new, darker era.
Shoppers' freedoms are changing. According to Robert Bocock, writing in "Consumption," the mall walkers of today do not have the rights that the flaneurs of the 19th century had. "In the United States, 'policing' of who is allowed entry to the malls has become stricter in the last two or three decades of the 20th century."
In superstores, the role of shoppers has changed even more radically. Superstores are warehouses that stock an astounding number of goods picked out at a national corporate level, said Marianne Conroy, a scholar of comparative literature at the University of Maryland. Shoppers educate themselves about the goods and serve themselves. Thus, the superstore effectively "strips shopping of its aura of sociality," Ms. Conroy said. There is no meaningful interaction between the salespeople and the shoppers or among the shoppers. The shoppers' relationship is not with other people but with boxes and shelves.
Does the concept of the shopper as citizen still hold? The real test is to see how the citizen-shopper fares at the superstore. In a paper she delivered to the Modern Language Association, titled "You've Gotta Fight for Your Right to Shop: Superstores, Citizenship and the Restructuring of Consumption," Ms. Conroy analyzed one event in the history of a superstore that tested the equation between shopping and citizenship.
In 1996 Ronald Kahlow, a software engineer, decided to do some comparison shopping at a Best Buy outlet store in Reston, Va., by punching the prices and model numbers of some televisions into his laptop computer. When store employees asked him to stop, he refused and was arrested for trespassing. The next day, Mr. Kahlow returned with a pen and paper. Again, he was charged with trespassing and handcuffed.
When he stood trial in Fairfax County Court, he was found not guilty. And, as Ms. Conroy observed, the presiding judge in the case, Donald McDonough, grandly equated Mr. Kahlow's comparison shopping to civil disobedience in the 1960's. Mr. Kahlow then recited Robert F. Kennedy's poem "A Ripple of Hope," and the judge said, "Never has the cause of comparison shopping been so eloquently advanced."
 
Like Canaries In the Mines
At first, Ms. Conroy suggested they both might have gone overboard in reading "public meaning into private acts," but then she reconsidered. Maybe, she said, it's just time to refine the model.
Ms. Conroy suggested that consumerism should be seen no longer as the way citizens exercise their rights and freedoms but rather as "an activity that makes the impact of economic institutions on everyday life critically intelligible." In other words, shoppers in superstores are like canaries in the mines. Their experience inside tells us something about the dangers lurking in society at large.
What does one man's shopping experience at Best Buy tell us about the dangers of modern life in America? The fact that Mr. Kahlow was arrested when he tried to comparison shop shows that even the minimal rights of citizen-shoppers are endangered, said Ms. Conroy. Not only have they lost a venue for socializing, but they are also beginning to lose their right to move about freely and make reasoned choices.
Without the trappings of sociability, it's easier to see what's what. Stores used to be places that made people want to come out and buy things they didn't know they wanted. And they were so seductive that by the end of the 20th century they became one of the few sites left for public life. But in the superstores, the flaneurs and the consumer-citizens are fish out of water. They have nowhere pleasant to wander, no glittering distractions, no socializing to look forward to and no escape from the watchful eyes of the security guards. If this is citizenship, maybe it's time to move to another country.

Remaindering Baghdad

BYLINE: By Shashi Tharoor; Shashi Tharoor is the author of "The Great Indian Novel" and other works of fiction, and most recently of "India: From Midnight to the Millennium."

 BODY:
I traveled to Baghdad in mid-February, not as an Indian writer but in the course of my "other life" as a United Nations official. The world was largely focused on two dramas at the time, both involving (in very different ways) issues of access to presidential sites -- the Monica Lewinsky investigation in Washington and the crisis over United Nations weapons inspections in Iraq. I had nothing whatsoever to do with America's internal affairs (if the dreadful pun can be forgiven), but the other crisis took me to the Iraqi capital, at very short notice, with an advance team to prepare the visit of the Secretary General of the United Nations. The necessary groundwork completed, there was just enough time away from United Nations business to catch a few glimpses of Baghdad before the political negotiations began.
Where does a non-Arabic speaker go in quest of literary pleasures in Baghdad? The answer, I was told by a senior United Nations colleague resident there, was to what visitors call the "book souk." This is actually a street market on both sides of a long block, rather than, as the word "souk" implies, a full-fledged bazaar. Along Almutanabi Street, old (and some new) publications are laid out for sale on the sidewalks -- magazines and volumes arrayed on sheets, racks and in cartons from a busy intersection at one end to a cul-de-sac at the other. This was not, for a visitor familiar with the third world, extraordinary in itself; it reminded me of the pavement bookstores of Calcutta's College Street. But what was different was the added pathos that many of the books and journals on sale were from the personal libraries of families devastated by life in post-sanctions Iraq, who now had to sell them to buy food. 
 And what a cornucopia there was for the indiscriminate reader! Books and periodicals overflowed the dusty sidewalks. Some were leather-bound, some tattered; first editions of rare books rubbed spines with paperbacks from forgotten best-seller lists; technical textbooks sat alongside primly covered Arabic girlie magazines from a more modest era. The volumes were mainly in Arabic, but the makeshift stalls also featured a multiplicity of foreign publications, especially in English (though German, French and -- according to a Scandinavian colleague -- even Swedish popped up too). Here I spotted a lovingly thumbed reference book, there a set of brittle 1950's Time magazines; 1970's Lebanese reprints of 19th-century British classics sat side by side with out-of-date almanacs and even, bizarrely, an old telephone directory. Many of the English titles seemed incongruous on an Arab street -- a paperback of Leon Uris's "Exodus," for instance, or even more startling, Grace Metalious's "Peyton Place." Though Iraq had long enjoyed a reputation as one of the most secular and cosmopolitan of Arab societies, adversity has begun to breed piety (among those who were buying, if not those who were selling): many of the newer volumes were Korans, some handsomely bound, and they were selling more briskly than the pulp fiction -- or the men's magazines.
I had heard from foreigners of the bargains to be had at the book souk: stories, perhaps apocryphal, were told at the United Nations cafeteria of op-
portunist colleagues like the one who had picked up a first edition of T. E. Lawrence's "Seven Pillars of Wisdom" for the equivalent of 7 cents in Iraq's dramatically depreciated currency (at a penny a pillar, the buyer clearly had little need of additional wisdom). What I had not heard about, however, was the avid interest of the local population in the offerings of the book souk. Even at an early hour on a weekend (I went by on a Friday, the Islamic Sabbath), there was a crowd of Iraqis on the pavement, browsing, chatting, laying out more books in remarkably orderly fashion, eager to share their wares with a visitor. Iraqis are a famously literate people; an old saw about the Middle East has it that "the Egyptians write, the Lebanese publish and the Iraqis read." Here was proof of this, in these apparently often perused, carefully preserved books bought decades ago, many with ownership proudly inscribed on the flyleaf, some lovingly annotated in the margins. It was easy to imagine them on the shelves of middle-class living rooms in educated homes, now brought out by their owners to help fill stomachs where in the past they had only salved souls.
The threat of bombs had been in the air for weeks, and Baghdad was full of journalists looking for news that would be obsolete in minutes. But here in the book souk there was a sense that there is a world beyond the news, that life must go on and that what sustains it is the timeless pleasure that the printed page -- read, re-read, passed on from hand to hand -- will continue to provide.
Perhaps I was being unduly romantic. By my rough calculation, the literary works and the potboilers were both outnumbered by the textbooks, many dauntingly technical and in European languages, some seemingly too old to be authoritative sources of the scientific knowledge they sought to impart. One vendor assured me that they sold well, no doubt because new books were either unavailable or unaffordable or both. And in disciplines where the opportunities for experiment, for practical work and for international exchange are dwindling or have disappeared altogether, textbooks, however old, are all that a student can fall back upon.
Many in the street, however, were just looking. I spotted a man in his early 20's picking up a book at which he had been gazing intently for some time. He held it, opened the cover, put it down again, then stood there looking at it, unable to walk away. Racked by hesitation, he picked it up once more, studying its contents as if weighing them against alternatives in his mind. Then he asked the vendor the price. When he heard the answer he had a hand in his pocket, perhaps fingering banknotes within; but I saw him shake his head sadly, put the book gently down and walk slowly away. I asked an Arabic-speaking colleague what the book cost. "Five hundred dinars," he replied. Thirty-three American cents at the prevailing black market rate of exchange, but a week's rations, perhaps, in a country where the typical middle-class wage is 4,000 dinars a month.
"For every student like that, you'll also find a fat cat buying books by the armload to cash in on the bargains," a diplomat who knows Iraq well later told me. "The book souk isn't kept alive by foreigners. There aren't enough of us here to do that. Iraqis are still doing most of the buying. But what's sad is that those who love books are mainly doing the selling."
With the book souk still on my mind, I took a trip to see the riverside statue of Scheherazade, the storyteller of the 1,001 Arabian nights. Only in Baghdad, said friends who know the Arab world, would there be such a statue at all -- not only of a woman but of a woman renowned for decidedly un-Islamic reasons.
Scheherazade stood 20 feet high in black stone, hands extended, weaving her spell to an equally immense sculpture of her husband, the Sultan Shahryar, reclining entranced at a safe distance. Her eyes were large, her gown flowing, her expression modest; but there was no doubt that she dominated the scene, a woman harnessing the power of fiction to her own salvation.
I walked slowly around the plinth on which the pair had been erected and failed to find a plaque or even a date. Nor was there any other visitor or attendant to ask. The site was deserted, and the park in which the statuary stood was overgrown and ill tended. The city of the fabled Caliph Harun ar-Rashid, patron of the arts, now neglects its own stories -- as if, with harsh reality pressing down upon it, even literary Baghdad can no longer seek solace in the magic of myth.

Clement Greenberg
 A Life.
 By Florence Rubenfeld.
 Illustrated. 336 pp. New York:
 Scribner. $32. 
 CEZANNE said that Monet was just an eye, but what an eye. The so-called New York intellectuals were all opinions, but what opinions, and how fiercely held! Writing about Hamlet, T. S. Eliot famously coined the term "objective correlative" to express the idea of an external dramatic situation that justified a character's inner state. The external drama of exhausting debate was the name of the New York intellectuals' desire.
The biographer who chooses a life among that ardent throng has to liberate it from the sentimental caricature that frequently accompanies the burst of nostalgia the New York intellectuals now enjoy, if enjoy is the word. As a clutch of memoirs attest, their lives were often as involuted as some of their arguments. And just as often, their generalizing, overbearing manner and their frantic competition were the underside to their impassioned, beautifully complex and independent minds.
Clement Greenberg, America's most potent and consequential art critic, is invulnerable to sentimental treatment. In this respect, he makes a good subject for a biography. Born in the Bronx in 1909 to Polish Jews of Lithuanian extraction, he attended Syracuse University and not City College, the fabled stamping ground of many other New York intellectuals. According to Florence Rubenfeld's evidence in "Clement Greenberg: A Life," his father was "rarely sympathetic or compassionate," but he also seems to have encouraged his son's intellectual ambitions. Greenberg's mother, who died when he was 16, arranged life-drawing lessons for him. And Greenberg senior built himself up, even through the Depression, from modest merchant to large manufacturer, becoming a millionaire. Unlike many others in his circle who grew up during those hardscrabble years, Greenberg seems never to have worried about money. In the ideologically troubled and troubling 1930's, he regally rode horses in a Brooklyn park.
Yet Greenberg pined for higher social status. All his life, he courted socially elevated women. In his early 20's, he married Edwina (Toady) Ewing in San Francisco after a three-week affair. They had a son, and then he returned to his father's spacious Brooklyn apartment. Though he sent Edwina money from time to time, he never lived with either her or their son again and later obtained a divorce. In 1956, he married Janice Van Horne, and the two of them soon embarked upon an emotionally bumpy open marriage. Greenberg spent most of his life lurching between solitude and the social swirl, dwelling by himself in a small walk-up in a building owned by his father in Greenwich Village, just a few blocks from where his father lived.
In his 30's, he made his mark simultaneously in intellectual precincts and the art world by means of a single idea. It was all the more effective for its Procrustean simplicity. He laid down its premises in a 1939 essay in Partisan Review called "Avant-Garde and Kitsch." Adopting what would become a trademark air of emergency, Greenberg argued that modern mass society had created two separate cultures: "One and the same civilization produces simultaneously two such different things as a poem by T. S. Eliot and a Tin Pan Alley song." Tin Pan Alley, however, was winning. Low art had appropriated the interest -- and the economic support -- of educated taste. Worse, the sharp idiocies of popular culture were slouching toward democracy's jugular vein. Kitsch, Greenberg wrote, was "vicarious experience and faked sensations . . . the epitome of all that is spurious in the life of our times." It could be "dangerous to the naive seeker of true light." Kitsch posed the fascistic menace of groupthink.
In response, Greenberg argued, high art in the modern period develops an idiosyncratic language it can once again share with an educated segment of the public. It does so by striving to attain an "absolute" value far above modern society's confused content. Avant-garde art, in fact, abandons content altogether, each medium seeking the purest reduction to its formal components. Advanced art therefore becomes synonymous with abstraction. Like beautiful and well-born women, formalist esthetics seemed to beckon to Greenberg from a higher realm of freedom.
Though its originality lay mostly in its dazzling extremism -- the essay was historically inaccurate and conceptually overwrought -- "Avant-Garde and Kitsch" established Greenberg as a figure to be reckoned with. In short order, he obtained an editorial position at Partisan Review, got hired as The Nation's art critic and later became an editor of Commentary. Polished and assured, Greenberg's judgments were gravely weighted with his earlier Marxist faith in historical inevitability. As a critic, Greenberg offered the impression of having just conferred with God on, say, the subject of vigorously gestural brushwork (too tactile and thus "literary") versus pools of paint soaked into the canvas (cool and ineffable and historically correct).
Like many other New York intellectuals, Greenberg was in the process of recasting his politics in esthetic terms. The Trotskyist stance against Stalin became the avant-garde stance against kitsch. From the 40's through the 60's, Greenberg generously championed, and sometimes coldly abandoned, one artist after another as the historical agent who practiced his theory: Jackson Pollock, David Smith, Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko, Helen Frankenthaler (a longtime Greenberg amour), Kenneth Noland, Morris Louis and Jules Olitski.
Unswerving in his vision of art history, Greenberg possessed a signature intellectual style. It made a perfect accompaniment to the signature style Abstract Expressionist painters needed in order to prevail. And like those drinking, brawling, turbulently fornicating figures, Greenberg also played the tough guy, until intense carousing seems to have taken a heavy physical and psychological toll. Artists who didn't fit into his grand scheme he either ignored or scorned. People who disagreed with him he cut off, and if he felt insulted, he occasionally decked them, including women.
The swaggering could have long-term consequences. For years artists have been telling stories, which Rubenfeld cites, about resisting Greenberg's suggestions for radically modifying their work along his esthetic lines. As a result, they claim, Greenberg refused to grant them his imprimatur, thereby extinguishing their careers. Made an executor for the estate of the sculptor David Smith, Greenberg scraped the paint off some of Smith's outdoor pieces, convinced that painted sculpture had no place in the formalist utopia. Later in life, Greenberg, who died in 1994, threw himself into an authoritarian cult called Newtonian therapy, colluding with its therapists, according to Rubenfeld, to control the emotional and sexual lives of the friends and students he intimidated into joining.
Greenberg's financial relationships in the art world were also vexing, especially his business dealings with Morris Louis's widow. After Louis's death, Greenberg "stretched" Louis's remaining several hundred canvases himself -- that is, he decided how much white border there should be between the canvas and the frame, a crucial matter in abstract painting. Then he helped Louis's widow sell the art off at increasingly high prices, making sure after each exhibition to keep one high-yield work for himself. Still, as Rubenfeld observes, Louis had allowed Greenberg literally to direct his esthetic choices. The alternative was to let the posthumous paintings lie in oblivion.
Greenberg's numerous enemies turn such ultimately ambiguous episodes into war crimes, playing down their own worldliness to play up what they insist was Greenberg's venality. Such hostility is not surprising. By the 60's, Greenberg had influenced so many artists, curators and critics that he had become the art world's maker of taste and anointer of kings. Confronted by minimalism and Pop Art, he grew ever more doctrinaire and punitive. His foes, therefore, cherish the evidence of his manipulativeness, shady dealings and dictatorial invasiveness. And indeed, by all accounts, including this one, Greenberg was a supercilious and even sadistic man.
Rubenfeld, a former East Coast editor for New Art Examiner magazine, has ventured a life of Greenberg that is a defense of sorts. It is bound to kick up a stir. Her strategy is to present damning evidence against her subject selectively. (One would think that his notorious put-down, "stupid as a painter," would have been a stumbling block to her sympathy.) Methodically, she adduces counterevidence and then concludes with vindicating explanations. Greenberg, the agile dialectician, would have been pleased.
Unfortunately, Rubenfeld's method, though often colorful, makes Greenberg's ideas, and their cultural context, take a back seat to the admittedly juicier question of his character. The emphasis feels misplaced: Rubenfeld defends the seemingly indefensible man and breezes over the formidable critic. One wants to like her book simply because of the impressive amount of research she obviously has done. Yet for anyone who doesn't know much about the concerns that drove Greenberg, and about the milieus he traversed, this biography will be a big disappointment. For readers who do know about Greenberg and his various contexts, it will be an even bigger disappointment. For one thing, Rubenfeld's language stumbles across the page: The art market "took off so quickly and unexpectedly that neither laws nor longstanding tradition existed to regulate it." People are so careful that they "walked on eggs." And her thinking is juvenile. To take one example, she explains the ambitions of the editors of Commentary magazine, founded at the end of World War II and supported by the American Jewish Committee, in this way: "To the image of the Jew as shyster, shylock or victim, they wanted to add that of the Jew as writer, thinker, scholar, scientist."
She does not handle ideas more reliably. The antecedents to Greenberg's formalism, the arguments of his opponents, other trends operating at the same time as the ones he promoted, are merely glanced at. Aside from superficially discussing several seminal essays, Rubenfeld does not sufficiently analyze or quote from Greenberg's voluminous writings. She rightly notes that T. S. Eliot's critical writing profoundly influenced Greenberg, then proceeds to caricature Eliot's ideas. Alas, her psychological insight also lets the reader down: "Clem had," she notes, "what psychologists call authority problems."
This is not nit-picking. As Rubenfeld gratifyingly insists, Greenberg's ideas make up an important part of American cultural history. He was a valuable, if disturbing, figure, whose eye could be as stunning as his contempt for flatulent thinking was unbridled. His elitism, arrogance and unabashedly tendentious standards kept the art world in a democratic stew of outrage, opposition and fecund creation. His championship of Pollock, as against his archrival Harold Rosenberg's advocacy of gestural "action painters" like Willem de Kooning, fueled one of the most thrilling antagonisms in modern American intellectual life.
William Inge, the acerbic English cleric, once said that a man could build a throne with bayonets, but that he couldn't sit on it. Greenberg lived at a time that allowed him to build a throne with pointed arguments as well as with bayonets. And he sat on it -- cruelly, brilliantly, myopically, belligerently, tenaciously -- for as long as he could. He deserves from his biographer at least as good as he gave.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
A Dreamy Sojourn in Helsinki

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO 

 BODY:
IN the Helsinki Airport, at the start of a long winter weekend in the Finnish capital, I got an interesting piece of advice from the immigration agent who stamped my passport: "You don't get much vacation in America. You should strike."
I could see his point. Who goes to Europe in February, much less to Finland (at the same latitude as Siberia), for just three days? 
 I do, when the price is right -- in this case, $550, from a tour company called Norvista. The package included a round-trip ticket on Finnair from New York (leaving at 6 P.M. on Thursday and arriving at 9 A.M. on Friday, then departing Helsinki on Sunday at 2 P.M. and returning to New York in the late afternoon), two nights at the Hotel Inter-Continental Helsinki, buffet breakfasts, a $100 charge for single occupancy, and $52 tax.
I'd have done Norvista's five-day St. Petersburg package ($802 in February with tax and a single supplement) or an eight-day tour of Lapland ($1,695 in February with tax and a single supplement) had I the money and time. I did five nights in Venice in the winter of 1994 (on Alitalia for $799), two nights in Brussels in December 1994 (on Sabena for $599) and four nights in Madrid in February 1996 (Iberia Airlines for $735). Such winter deals are a great way to see the world cheaply -- provided you're not too jet-lagged to see at all.
When Greg Louganis hit his head on a diving platform at a meet in the Soviet Union in 1979, he blamed it on jet lag -- which takes a toll, as all travelers know. According to a book called "Jet Smart," by Diana Fairechild, a former flight attendant, a full day of recuperation is required for every time zone crossed in the air.
I'd be flying through seven, meaning I needed to confront the jet-lag problem head on. It has two main ill effects, I've found: a zombielike state on the day of arrival, and terrible wakeful 2 A.M.'s thereafter.
I took all my usual precautions, like setting my watch to Helsinki time the minute I boarded the half-empty jet; keeping a mask, earplugs and the sleeping pill Ambien (which I try to take as seldom as possible) at hand, so that once the tasty beef Bourguignon dinner was cleared away, I could curl up and sleep; stretching in the aisle; drinking lots of water, and swearing off alcohol -- a particularly painful step, because fine wine and Finlandia vodka flow freely on Finnair flights.
But this time I went further still, mixing up a vial of energizing essences that I bought in a health store (geranium, eucalyptus and rose) to drop in my morning baths; buying a homeopathic remedy called No-Jet-Lag (made in New Zealand, of leopard's bane, daisy, wild chamomile, ipecac and club moss) to take during the flight; and following the rather less-natural advice of a friend, a music producer who jets around the world scouting bands.
The key to enduring overnight flights is to consume no caffeine before and during the trip, he says. Regardless of how little shut-eye you get en route, you can make it through the next day if you drink about three cups of espresso on arrival.
I'd slept about five hours, so when we landed I felt decent, though as if still in the hold of a dream set in a strange, clean, quiet place vaguely like a sanitarium, with polished wood floors and windows revealing a piney world vanishing under a shower of big wet snowflakes. But this was the very real Helsinki airport, where I had my first hit of caffeine in the deserted shopping concourse.
It was a good thing that little was required of me. There was no line at immigration, and I didn't have to retrieve luggage because I'd carried on my one small bag. In the arrival area, there was a currency exchange booth, where I got all the Finnish cash I intended to spend (812 marks for $150, a rate of 5.4 to the dollar, with a 15-mark commission). Steps away, I found the Hotel Inter-Continental's reception desk, manned by a nice clerk who checked me in and directed me to the Finnair bus that takes passengers to the back door of the hotel in 30 minutes (about $5).
The 552-room Inter-Continental, in a residential neighborhood about a half-mile northwest of downtown, is a blockish nine-story edifice. It is hardly as distinctive as other buildings in Helsinki -- like the head-turning, white-tiled National Opera, which opened in 1993 just across wide, tram-plied Mannerheimintie. Still, the hotel's interior seemed plenty luxurious to me, with pillow-strewn couches in the lobby, two restaurants, the Opera Cafe and the Baltic Bar.
My room on the fifth floor (regularly about $225 a night) overlooked the courtyard and had two single beds covered in soft chestnut-patterned spreads, a comfortable sitting area with lots of pictures and lamps, and a deep tub in the bath. The maid gave me a terry robe for the pool and sauna on the top floor.
I can't think of a better way to shake off jet lag than by swimming laps and taking a sauna ($7.75 before 2 P.M., $17.50 thereafter) -- a health practice the Finnish have perfected, of course. In the wood-lined women's sauna chamber, which looked brand new, with blond wood, squeaky-clean tiled floors, and green mats and chairs, my head cleared and my skin tautened. Then, a gull flew by while I showered by the big picture window high above Toolo Bay, the almost landlocked body of water at the center of the peninsula where Helsinki was established by one of Finland's many Swedish rulers, King Gustav Vasa, in 1550.
Later that morning, a front-desk clerk sold me a two-day Helsinki Card (about $25), which turned out to be a veritable key to the city, entitling me to (among other things) use of the efficient mass transit system, a guided coach tour of the city and entrance to 47 museums. The card began to pay off right away, at the National Opera box office, where I got a $43 orchestra ticket to the Saturday night performance of "The Barber of Seville" for half price.
From there, I could have hurried off to join the bus tour or caught a tram downtown. But though the sky was gray, it had stopped snowing and the temperature was an unusually warm 45 degrees. So I wandered down a path in the sliver of a park that lines the west side of Toolo Bay, noting that the full-sized ice castle on the bank to the south was melting. (Every winter, the city raises a public ice work, like last year's frozen cathedral in Senate Square, where couples were married and babies baptized.)
The city center was my goal, but before reaching it, I stopped at the Carrara marble home of the Helsinki Philharmonic, Finlandia Hall, built in 1975 by Alvar Aalto, the revered Finnish architect. This year, the country is celebrating the centenary of his birth with restoration projects and exhibitions, including the one I saw in the lobby of Finlandia Hall on Aalto's unrealized plan for a total redesign of Helsinki (about $5.75).
Then, I joined a tour (free with my card) led by a guide who kept apologizing for his perfectly understandable but slightly fractured English -- which is how I got to see the exquisite, amorphously shaped auditorium and the upstairs lobby with sveltely minimalistic furnishings by Aalto. "I hope I turned out well," the guide said, patting my shoulder as we finished.
Back on Mannerheimintie, there were almost no people around at midday, as if the 900,000 Finns who live in the city had gone away for the weekend. I felt like a character in an old Alfred Hitchcock film -- "The 39 Steps," maybe. A tram clattered by. So I caught it, landing at the Art Deco entrance of Finland's oldest and largest department store, Stockmann, where I collected the "little gift" promised in my Helsinki Card brochure (a packet of five souvenir postcards), and had a chicken sandwich and cappuccino ($9) at the stylish street-level Cafe Strindberg.
Still feeling fine, if slightly addled, I saw the Academic Book Store next door to Stockmann, another bold Aalto building completed in 1969, with huge, show-stopping skylights; the Esplanadi, a park that evokes fin de siecle Paris and is bounded by two rows of handsome Beaux-Arts buildings housing Helsinki's finest shops, like Artek and Marimekko; Market Square at the east end of the Esplanadi, where a tongue of the ice-crusted Baltic Sea licks into the city, and the gloriously neo-classical Senate Square, pinnacled by Helsinki's imposing Lutheran Cathedral.
This is the historic center, built in the 19th century by Finland's new ruler, Czar Alexander I of Russia, and the German architect C. L. Engel. Cafe Engel, with swagged curtains and framed architectural designs, is on the south side of the square -- a nice place to stop for more caffeine and a slice of sour lingonberry pie (about $7.80).
It was about 5 and getting dark (not much different than New York), though I didn't worry about being out late, because Helsinki is safe, if empty, at night -- but for its sad, weaving drunks, a reminder of the severe recession that hit Finland in the early 90's, when the unemployment rate rose to 20 percent, from 3. I wasn't hungry, and thought a cocktail unwise. So I went to the eight-theater cineplex in the Forum Shopping Center downtown, where it seemed that everyone left in Helsinki had tickets to see "Titanic." I opted for "Anastasia," dubbed in Finnish but still beguiling -- even though I couldn't imagine what thinking Finns made of the Russian Revolution, Disney-style.
Life is strange, and travel more so -- which is why seeing that movie will remain a Helsinki highlight for me. On Saturday, I woke with a chest cold, then almost drowned when I fell asleep during my energizing bath.
The Inter-Continental's vast breakfast buffet (croissants, eggs, porridge and herring en croute), and visits to more architectural landmarks -- like Steven Holl's striking new Museum of Contemporary Art (to open May 1), Eliel Saarinen's mighty Art Deco railway station and the graceful Art Nouveau Hotel Torni downtown -- reinvigorated me. But a free noon classical piano concert at the Sibelius Academy, just east of Mannerheimintie and an hourlong ride on the 3-T tram, which makes a scenic crazy eight around Helsinki, made me sleepy again.
After lunch at the pretty Russian Galleria Hariton, just south of the Esplanadi, where I had blini with sour cream and salmon slivers ($12), I felt revived. Streaks of pale sunlight were filtering into the city, so I caught a ferry at Market Square (free with the card) to the island fortress of Suomenlinna, about a 20-minute ride away.
This great stone fort, begun by the Swedish in 1748, sprawls over four interconnected islets in the Gulf of Finland. In 1808, the Russians took it over, and Suomenlinna faced bombardment by the English during the Crimean War. Today, Helsinkians walk their dogs there, regardless of the weather -- which turned dismal again. Indeed, in the chill wind and rain, I never saw a place so grim.
I thought dinner at the Cafe Carelia, in a narrow, sprucely renovated apothecary shop across from the opera might cheer me up. And because the glass of white Italian wine, salad with pignoli, and fish canneloni I ordered (for $25) were delicious, it did -- together with Rossini's romping overture to "The Barber of Seville."
But I had to resort to a half tablet of Ambien to sleep that night. Shortly after breakfast the next morning, I learned that my flight home had been delayed three hours. So I attended the 10 A.M. service at Temppeliaukio Lutheran Church, an unusual domed structure sunk into a rocky knoll about a 20-minute walk south of the hotel. And though it was utterly sodden outside, I detoured north on my way back to the Inter-Continental to see the modernistic Sibelius Monument in Sibelius Park.
Just a taste of Helsinki, really -- but enough to make me want to return, perhaps on the way to Russia or Estonia. I can't claim that my anti-jet-lag efforts had been successful, but I'd survived and spent relatively little money. In fact, I had just enough marks left over to buy a little vase designed by Alvar Aalto at the Stockmann shop in the airport ($26.50).
On the flight home, I sedated myself with a tot of vodka, put on my earphones and cranked Sibelius up high.
 
A few days of Sibelius, herring and saunas

Lies to Live By

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
"Save social security first," Bill Clinton exclaimed with the thundering-herd scandal hunters at his heels. And thus, the polls record, he first saved himself.
It was a more elegant lie than those that preoccupy the herd. If only the media could spare a few columns to scrutinize all the fraudulent accounting by both parties -- accounting that concerns not sex and perjury or even campaign finances but budget "balances" and "surpluses." 
 Here's an image that pierces those deceptions:
Imagine that you head a family with three kids who will start passing through college about 10 years from now. Even if each were to need only a static $10,000 a year, their education would cost a total of $120,000. But you are clever and affluent, so you begin now to set aside $5,000 a year. You expect your bank and broker to invest that accumulating College Fund so that it eventually yields at least $100,000 to cover your future obligation.
You now feel virtuous as well as prudent. Indeed, having met your most worrisome family responsibility, you proceed to enjoy the good life. You buy a house you can barely afford and move in circles whose parties, fashions, cars and vacations balloon your credit-card debts. Nonetheless, being clever and affluent, you move to avert the absurd interest rates charged by your overdrawn Visa account. You borrow $3,000 against the first $5,000 you've banked in the College Fund. After all, you figure, you're only borrowing your own money!
Presto: At the end of the year, you proudly announce that your family budget is fully balanced. Not a dime has been added to the large debts of the past; all expenses have been covered with available cash! And, you predict, your shrewd bookkeeping will achieve the same happy result every year from now on.
Your oldest kid dares to wonder what will happen to the shrinking College Fund. Not to worry, you reply; your reliable money management -- and a windfall bonus from a pending damage suit -- will keep future budgets in balance. What's more, your boss has promised annual raises of at least $500, maybe even $1,000, and these will yield an annual surplus! You warn the kids that you will not let them squander those raises. Every request for new spending will find you intoning, "Save the College Fund first!"
The college-fund metaphor perfectly explains the Social Security accounting of our leaders. They invoke the most sacred family values -- embedded in words like security, trust, balance, surplus -- to conceal a continuing Federal budget imbalance. In fact, the imabalance will grow under the weight of the Social Security benefits that have been promised to the baby-boomer generation.
Like my mythical College Fund, what is amusingly called the Social Security "Trust Fund" has long been "borrowed from" every year to pay for weapons, highways, prisons and other normal Federal expenses beyond the old-age pensions to which it is pledged. If the fund were really held in reserve to meet future obligations, the Federal budget would continue to show a woeful deficit. (And that's not even counting the promise to cover the next generation's old-age medical expenses.)
Even after all this legerdemain, President Clinton can claim a current balance only by counting the still unhatched chickens of a proposed deal with leading tobacco companies -- a much-resisted deal that would let the cigarette industry buy Federal protection against future damage claims.
For more than 30 years, Presidents and Congresses have pretended that the Social Security Ponzi scheming between the generations will never explode in their lifetimes. By claiming that they have now achieved budget balance and surplus, they only pretend to be fiscally responsible. Worse, they are also discussing new spending or tax cuts. At the President's urging, the Democrats propose to use the tobacco windfall to subsidize more child care and other instantly gratifying social benefits. The Republicans want to just give every family a little more spending money. But the cheers for Clinton's artful bookkeeping are bipartisan. Although in six or eight years the Social Security Trust Fund will run out of money to lend the rest of the Federal Government, both parties take false comfort from assurances that it won't be "fully exhausted" until the middle of the next century.
So the majority of voters have been misled into thinking of the complex Federal economy as if it were the family budget, once out of balance and now in. Thus it was that in the darkest hours of his latest sex scandal, President Clinton could rally the public to his side by celebrating an imminent "surplus" in his State of the Union address and vowing to use it to "save Social Security first."
He was greeted by cheers on both sides of the aisle. Republicans grudgingly applauded the brilliance of the President's ploy and took credit for forcing him to "eliminate" the deficit. The scandal-scarred Democrats cheered because they suddenly saw that they could escape the moral stench around the White House by running for re-election on a platform of economic virtue.
But where are all the truth hunters of the media? The true condition of the budget and the illusory Social Security "Trust Fund" is not so difficult to explain. Yet in The New York Times alone in recent weeks, more than two dozen articles have referred to the Federal Government's budget balance and future surplus, with only an occasional attempt to render a corrective accounting. Most news stories on television and in the press have given the politicians' arithmetic an almost total pass.
Economists have delved into the subject on a few op-ed pages. And some have also properly asked whether budget imbalance is not sometimes desirable at some stages of the business cycle. But the public has been effectively lulled by slogans that would never wash at the family dinner table. Ask any high-school senior worrying about his College Fund.

HEADLINE: Lust at the Top: the Prequel

BYLINE: By Gail Collins; Gail Collins writes editorials for The New York Times. This article is adapted from her book "Scorpion Tongues: Gossip, Celebrity and American Politics," to be published in April by William Morrow.

 BODY:
By the time the Monica Lewinsky drama has run its course, there will probably be more people who can identify Warren Harding's mistresses than the causes of World War I. Americans generally have little interest in history, but whenever the nation's moral bearings seem particularly shaky, we turn hopefully to the past, looking for evidence that the present social disarray is merely part of an old pattern rather than evidence of some long, irrevocable slide into spiritual decay. It's nothing, we yearn to tell ourselves. This has happened before, and we got over it.
Fortunately for our peace of mind, history seldom travels in a straight line. It's more like a kaleidoscope, in which new pictures are created with every turn. The current epoch is unusually colorful, but most of the pieces are still familiar. Previous generations have been exposed to gossip about philandering in the White House, some of which was probably true (Nan Britton's memoirs about having sex in the Oval Office closet with Warren Harding are pretty convincing) and some of which wasn't. Woodrow Wilson, who was not guilty of any White House affair more shocking than premarital sex with his fiancee, was rumored to be paying off an old girlfriend, and rewarding the go-between with a Supreme Court appointment. During his re-election campaign, gossips also said he and the second Mrs. Wilson had murdered his first wife, or at least broken her heart. (Wilson may appear to be a cold fish in the history books, but he had his moments.) 
 There are plenty of other parallels between the present and the venerable past. Politicians in previous eras also had to put up with a yappy media making all sorts of allegations about their private lives. (A late-19th-century copy of The Chicago Tribune compared two potential Presidential candidates, Thomas Hendricks and Oliver Morton, under the headline: "The Former's Name Untrammeled by Lust, the Latter's Reeking With Filth and Slime. A Few of the Hellish Liaisons of, and Attempted Seductions by, Indiana's Favorite Stud Horse.") There were sensational sex trials involving prominent officials and allegations of every sort of forbidden behavior, from sleeping with the housekeeper to cannibalism. Look back far enough, and you'll discover that Daniel Webster, a perennial near-President, was once accused of what we would now call sexual harassment in the workplace.
One aspect of the current scandal that surprised even the cognoscenti, however, was polls indicating a national shrug over the possibility that the President might have been having sex with a White House intern. Public opinion samplings have the shelf life of an open jar of mayonnaise, but it did appear that the American public was saying -- though with many hedges and respectful bows to the seriousness of perjury -- that character didn't really count. "I thought there would be more of a tendency to rush to judgment," said the historian Michael Beschloss, who is still sure voters will turn on Clinton if they find "incontrovertible evidence that the President behaved badly."
He may be right. But the popular response, although surprising, is pretty much in tune with our past performance. The American electorate doesn't have much of a record of punishing politicians for sinning in private. The saga of great men undone by private lust belongs to the sophisticated Europeans. We have no Parnells here. Jefferson, Jackson, Cleveland, Wilson and Clinton were all elected despite an enormous amount of gossip about their private lives. Some of it may have been false, but the public had good reason to think it was true. Somebody at Monticello was fathering young slaves who startled visitors with their resemblances to Thomas Jefferson.
Andrew Jackson had, in his dim past, lived with his future wife while she was married to somebody else, and his campaign's explanation about how it was all an innocent mistake was about as convincing as Rose Mary Woods's demonstration of how she accidentally erased 18 minutes of the Nixon tapes. Grant had a history of drinking problems, and if he did not drink during his White House years, he certainly ran the Government like a man who was half in the bag. Grover Cleveland had taken financial responsibility for an illegitimate child whose mother named it Oscar Folsom Cleveland, and although there was reason to think the candidate was protecting his dead law partner Oscar Folsom, Cleveland never spoke in his own defense. (As President, he married Folsom's beautiful young daughter. Somebody is going to make this story into a movie as soon as the market improves for romances about pompous 300-pound politicians with beady eyes.) The rumors about Cleveland escalated into charges of compulsive philandering, drunken brawling and the mass despoilation of New York virgins. ("Moral Monster," headlined The Cincinnati Penny Post. "A Boon Companion to Buffalo Harlots. A Drunken, Fighting, Roistering Roue.") The public was far from unconcerned -- people had all the familiar debates about how to explain it all to the children, and the need for the Commander in Chief to set a good example. But they were voting, as usual, for what was going to be the lesser of two evils. Taking everything into account, they elected Cleveland by a narrow margin. Despite further gossip about wife-beating and alcoholism, they gave him the most votes in the next two elections as well. (In 1888, the electoral college went to Benjamin Harrison.)
Those same impulses to overlook private behavior for the big picture are very much alive today. The ex-Clinton adviser George Stephanopoulos once asked Ralph Reed, the former head of the Christian Coalition, why the coalition had preferred Ronald Reagan, a divorced man with a record as an indifferent father who was not a churchgoer, to Jimmy Carter, a staunch family man and born-again Christian who spoke openly and earnestly about the importance of faith in his life. Reed said that those things were important to conservative Christians, but that Reagan shared their views on other, more overriding matters, like taxes. When the Clinton-campaign-strategist James Carville said, "It's the economy, stupid," he was not only coining a slogan; he was encapsulating 200 years of American history.
Beyond all that, it's still important to acknowledge that this year's White House sex scandal is more than just a replay of a very old scenario. In one important way, the Lewinsky matter really does take us where no electorate has gone before. We have never had a publicly litigated sex scandal involving a sitting President. To look for previous patterns of public response, we have to set our sights lower, in Congress. There have been plenty of politicians tarred by scandal, but few of them were driven out of office by the voters as a result. Arkansas re-elected Wilbur Mills to Congress in 1974 despite his alcohol-fueled high jinks with the stripper Fanne Foxe, the Argentine Firecracker (a k a the Tidal Basin Bombshell). The Mills scandal was part of a wave of unpleasant revelations during the 1970's about the private deportment of members of Congress, ranging from mistresses on the payroll to soliciting sex from under-age boys. Virtually every one of the men who were exposed, however, was re-elected -- including Representative Robert Leggett of California, whose relationships with wife, second family by a former secretary and lobbyist-mistress were summarized in a Washington Post article titled "Life of Immense Complications." The major exceptions were politicians whose misdeeds went totally counter to the public image they presented to the voters. (Several Congressmen have been re-elected after scandals involving homosexual solicitation, but not Robert Bauman of Maryland, who had run on a conservative, anti-gay platform.)
But it is important to point out that there is a second stage to many of these stories. Politicians emerge from the heat of scandal to win re-election but then frequently resign from office. It is easier to keep your job after being caught in some well-publicized private sin than it is to keep power. Some veterans of the exposes of the 70's, like Mills and Representative Wayne Hays of Ohio, quit after being stripped of their committee chairmanships. Others were indicted, or simply pressured into retiring by their peers. The most spectacular modern example of a politician brought down by a wandering libido, Gary Hart, dropped out of the 1988 Presidential race before a single ballot was cast. Later, when Hart tried to re-enter the field just before the New Hampshire primary, the first polls showed him well ahead of all the competition. But Hart had lost his credibility with the political insiders. He had no money, no staff and, after a few days of notoriety, no media coverage. He quickly faded from voters' screens.
Even politicians who retain power after a public scandal are permanently marked by the experience. Andrew Jackson became so obsessed with the evil of gossip that he spent much of his first term trying to clear the name of Peggy Eaton, a Cabinet member's wife who was being shunned as a slut. When Jackson sent one moralistic minister a handwritten defense of Eaton's reputation, people noted with awe that the 3,000-word letter was longer than his inaugural address.
Bill Clinton has always been blessed by voters' low expectations and an ability to weather humiliating public scrutiny that would send most politicians racing to the shelter of private life. But if the past is any guide, his challenge now has less to do with opinion polls than with the confidence of the nation's power elite. If it appears that the President is no longer able to govern, nothing else will matter. The people's tolerance is certainly being tested on an almost daily basis. But the past suggests that their focus will be less on his private behavior than on his ability to do his public job.

HEADLINE: ART;
Urban and Rural, Rise and Fall

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

 BODY:
YOU can't keep a good museum down. The Yale Center for British Art in New Haven is undergoing renovation, and consequently will have no exhibitions during 1998. Until last year, however, the center's director, Patrick McCaughey, was the director of the Wadsworth Atheneum. Largely due to this link, 43 paintings from the 18th and 19th centuries were taken to Hartford to form an absorbing exhibition, "Canaletto to Constable, Paintings of Town and Country From the Yale Center for British Art." 
Although the show might sound genteel, it is full of substantial issues. The countryside, with its economy was on the wane, and the city, which was on a tumultuous rise during the 18th and early 19th centuries, had a tense co-existence, and the paintings reflect this. But the social issues don't affect the sensation that each picture is its own world. And, to lend the catalogue a wider import, Cynthia E. Roman, assistant curator of European art at the Atheneum, who organized the show, engaged Carrie Roider, a specialist in British hunting poetry, to choose a contemporary selection from English literature to accompany each painting.
The obvious town and country opposition puts a viewer in mind of some other major dualities, such as that of classical and romantic. This opposition is reflected in the outlook of the two headliners.
Canaletto is the name by which Antonio Canal (1697-1768) is known. A Venetian, he went to England for a nine-year stay beginning in 1746, enticed by the prospect of painting metropolitan London for eager patrons. The exhibition has three of his meticulous, perpetually sunny, nearly topographical, views of the brash capital, along with a detailed rendering of St. Paul's Cathedral looming over minutely rendered citizens.
When John Constable (1776-1837) looked upward, it wasn't at the towering architectural marvels going up on the banks of the Thames, but at the cloud-filled sky, mostly over his native Sussex.
A bracing surprise near the end of the show is Constable's "Cloud Study," punctuated only by a few birds. The sky is prominent in other paintings such as "Malverne Hall, Warwickshire," which, though seemingly benign, reveals potential discord between nature and civilization. Ms. Roman asserts that in this painting the balance is weighted in favor of nature, noting the way the trees seem to be encroaching on the mansion. In Constable's attempt at a commemorative painting, "The Opening of Waterloo Bridge," the particulars of the pomp are obscured by energetic brush work.
Canaletto had several British followers, among them William Marlow and Samuel Scott, but in terms of depicting a vibrant London, Canaletto was preceded by Pieter Angillis of Flanders. His 1726 work called "Covent Garden" is loaded with lively vignettes of the mercantile life. At the painting's center is a heap of large vegetables -- the country come triumphantly to the city.
A view of London from long after Canaletto's departure, "Westminster Abbey and Bridge," by Joseph Farrington, painted in 1794, is noteworthy for the sense of calm it projects; boats glide serenely down the Thames, as if the growth of the city is taking time out.
Around the time of Canaletto's arrival there was a vogue for painting ruined buildings in rural settings. John Wootton is represented by two paintings featuring the vestiges of former abbeys, one with farmers, the other with fox hunters. Thomas Gainsborough figures prominently in the exhibition in four paintings that display his determination to preserve the idealism that, since Virgil, had been associated with country life.
Shepherds and peasants are Gainsborough's major heroes, in the middle of bucolic surroundings as far as the eye can see, as if the city weren't on the same planet. The late 18th century witnessed a vogue for picturesque views that included major topographical landforms. Richard Wilson's "View Near Wynnstay" is infused with the kind of poetic golden light that was popularized by Claude Lorraine, the inventor of the picturesque painting in the 17th century.
The dynamic structure of the exhibition means that it never reaches a point of rest. The calm world of Gainsborough is not an end, for the potential for upheaval is always there.
In a painting from 1733, "Boxhill, Surrey, With Dorking in the Distance," George Lambert evokes, in Ms. Roman's words, "a scene of arcadian harmony that recalls pastoral myths of a golden age." But the country prospect has a couple of prominent, disfiguring holes in which a peasant is digging for chalk. This signals the presence of industry.
Joseph Wright of Derby is best known as a chronicler of the Industrial Revolution. The dramatic "Cottage on Fire at Night" (1795-93), features one of Wright's triumphs of Rembrandt-like chiaroscuro. Even though it is not about industry per se, its major theme is immense and unsparing change.
This omen is also present in George Stubbs's "Horse Attacked by a Lion" (1770). Stubbs was a closely observant painter of animals, but this violent scene has social meaning, especially in the context of this show, for there were no lions roaming the English countryside. The horse symbolizes rural life, and the lion is the unknown terror that will savage it.
A more subtly disturbing work is the Alsatian Philip James de Loutherberg's "The Rainbow" (1784), which nevertheless packs a devastating message. A perfect rainbow arches over the landscape, but de Loutherberg's slovenly tourists, who probably were enticed on the trip by the prospect of the picturesque, have their backs to it.
"Canaletto to Constable" is at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford through April 26.

HEADLINE: FILM;
The Movie That First Noticed TV's Grip on Politics

BYLINE: By J. HOBERMAN; J. Hoberman is senior film critic for The Village Voice.

 BODY:
HEGEL saw the ritual reading of the daily newspaper as the secular equivalent of morning prayer. If so, the great televised media events that periodically transfix Americans must be something akin to religious festivals.
Less exalted than the form of collective expression developed in ancient Athens, media events -- watched and parsed simultaneously by millions -- are equally dramatic. Whether the subject is a Presidential cover-up or a trial for double murder, these spectacular narratives are alike in certain key elements: powerful stars crash and burn while supporting players (even members of the chorus) become new-minted celebrities; phrases are turned and buzzwords introduced. Afterward, the images will be recycled and refracted through ancillary deals until the debris-littered national landscape suggests a New Orleans street on the day after Mardi Gras. 
 Such ghosts of media events past haunt "Point of Order," the 1964 documentary assembled by Daniel Talbot and Emile de Antonio from television footage of the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings. Opening Friday for a two-week revival at Film Forum in Manhattan, "Point of Order" is the first documentary feature to treat American politics as spectacle, as well as a portrait of the first American politician to achieve full media symbiosis. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin, the flamboyant hunter of Communists, real and imaginary, built a career on events created to be reported. McCarthy's means were less photo ops and sound bites than tabloid headlines and wire-service bulletins, but long before the term "news cycle" existed, he knew how to manage it. As Richard Rovere wrote in his book "Senator Joe McCarthy," McCarthy "invented the morning press conference called for the purpose of announcing an afternoon press conference."
While televised hearings had made a national figure of Senator Estes Kefauver in 1951, the same format destroyed McCarthy. His problems began with the 1953 inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the installation of the Republican Administration the Wisconsin Senator had helped elect. Having rocketed to fame by denouncing Democratic "treason," McCarthy was disinclined to abandon the issue. He used his chairmanship of the new Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to probe Communist infiltration of the Voice of America, the International Information Administration and, finally, in a direct challenge to the former general now President, the Army itself.
BUT the military was not without its own resources. On March 11, 1954 (two days after CBS fired a shot across the Senator's bow with Edward R. Murrow's critical report on the program "See It Now"), the Department of the Army released documents chronicling the attempts made by a McCarthy aide, Roy Cohn, to obtain special treatment for the newly drafted Private G. David Schine, the subcommittee's erstwhile "chief consultant." McCarthy responded with charges that the Army had tried to forestall further investigation by taking Schine hostage. The Senate authorized televised hearings to begin on April 22.
Media interest was not a given. CBS passed on the telecast; NBC dropped out after two days. The full hearings were carried by ABC, a network then so weak that it had no daytime schedule to pre-empt. This gamble proved to be a brilliant coup. Public response was enormous. As the hearings built to a climax in June, CBS and NBC affiliates dumped their afternoon soaps to pick up the ABC feed while the Gallup Poll reported that an astounding 89 percent of adult Americans were following the show.
On some afternoons, the audience was estimated at 20 million. Among them was Mr. Talbot, then an unemployed writer living in Queens. "I was hooked," he recalls. "I watched every second. I was totally apolitical but this was a fascinating piece of Americana. I read McCarthy as a kind of W. C. Fields character selling snake oil."
Six years later, when he had become the owner of the New Yorker theater, a revival house on the West Side of Manhattan, Mr. Talbot wondered whether it would be possible to present excerpts from the Army-McCarthy kinescopes, perhaps charging viewers a dollar an hour. He joined forces with De Antonio, then an artists' agent, raising $100,000 to secure the rights to all 188 hours of televised footage. Although, according to Mr. Talbot, "neither of us had ever seen a moviola before," the partners spent three years distilling the material to 97 strictly chronological minutes.
"Point of Order," named for McCarthy's frequently employed interjection, remains a remarkable chamber drama. As in "A Midsummer Night's Dream," the narrative motor is the abduction of a princeling; Schine was the scion of a wealthy hotel family. Here too, confusion is rife. As The New Republic's Michael Straight wrote in his 1954 account of the hearings, "Trial by Television," McCarthy "understood that the investigation was not a court proceeding, where order would reign and rules of evidence would prevail, but a vast, disorderly drama whose plot would be shaped and whose end would be written by the actors possessing enough power to take command of the stage."
Who is investigating whom? Generals, Cabinet officers, senators, even lawyers are placed under oath. Senator Karl Mundt of South Dakota becomes the subcommittee's temporary chairman. The chaos produces a series of one-on-one confrontations, predicated less on rational discourse than on volume, quips and personality. The inquiry meanders from Schine to alleged Communist (and homosexual) infiltration of the armed forces, the question of McCarthy's sources and, finally, in a stunning non sequitur, the political associations of a young lawyer who is not part of the hearings but a junior partner in the firm of the Army counsel Joseph N. Welch.
McCarthy is playing to something larger than the committee or even the Senate. The television audience, he says more than once, is "the jury in this case." That the spectacle is being produced for the camera is underscored by the various debates on the quality of color-coded charts and photographic evidence. The crudeness of the television image only serves to render the antagonists more iconic. But although appreciated by his fans as a sort roughneck Mr. Smith gone to Washington to purge the Communists, McCarthy had a sepulchral urgency and a mirthless laugh that proved perversely untelegenic. (So too his 5 o'clock shadow, despite the "cream-colored makeup" noted by Mr. Straight.)
It was the prim and puckish Welch, a skilled trial lawyer (as well as a lifelong Republican), who blossomed under the lights. The Army counsel also badgered witnesses -- alluding even to Cohn's rumored homosexuality -- but where McCarthy specialized in menace, Welch proved a master of deflationary humor. Although the frustrated Senator attacked his nemesis as "an actor" who "plays for laughs," the Army counsel could also take the high moral ground.
The hearings and "Point of Order" reach their climax when, exasperated by Welch's cross-examination of Cohn (and over Cohn's silently mouthed objections), McCarthy exposes Welch's partner Fred Fisher as a former member of the left-wing Lawyer's Guild. This gratuitous guilt by association exposed McCarthy himself to Welch's withering scorn. "Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?" Welch exclaims to a round of spontaneous applause. Variety subsequently hailed him as "one of the great performers ever to appear on the small screen," and Otto Preminger cast him as the presiding judge in his 1959 movie "Anatomy of a Murder."
After seeing "Point of Order" in the 60's, the critic Dwight Macdonald suggested a revisionist view of Welch's cri de coeur: "It seemed to be a spontaneous cry of moral indignation -- 'seemed' because on this viewing, at least, I thought I detected a calculated artistry in Welch's performance."
In fact, according to Nicholas von Hoffman's book "Citizen Cohn," McCarthy had recklessly violated a "back door" -- or should we say "backstage" -- agreement not to mention Fisher if Welch avoided bringing up the subject of Cohn's draft record. Performance defeats character: McCarthy's psychology dictated his divergence from the script. He could not help himself. Nor, perhaps, could Cohn, whose irrational devotion to Schine had dragged the McCarthy juggernaut onto the rocks.
(For a contemporary audience, Cohn -- having already figured as a character in Tony Kushner's "Angels in America" and in Ron Vawter's one-man show "Roy Cohn/Jack Smith" -- may well be the secret star of "Point of Order." Mark Rappaport, maker of the innovative experimental documentaries "Rock Hudson's Home Movies" and "Jean Seberg's Diary," is currently preparing "Roy Cohn, or How I Learned to Hate the Commies." Cohn, Mr. Rappaport explains, is "a key to unlocking repression and denial in the 50's.")
Even before the hearings ended, a week after Welch's outburst, McCarthy was the butt of television comedians like Steve Allen and Milton Berle, who mimicked his constant interruptions and shouted points of order. Although the subsequent subcommittee report was ambiguous, the Wisconsin Senator's hold was broken. On Dec. 2, the Senate voted, 67-22, to censure him. Still, perhaps because McCarthy was America's pre-eminent media politician before John F. Kennedy, his fictional doppelgangers populate the Washington thrillers that characterized the Kennedy era.
McCarthy is reconfigured as a liberal appeaser in "Advise and Consent" and, even more outrageously, as a Communist invention in "The Manchurian Candidate." "Point of Order" is the documentary correlative. The movie had its premiere two weeks into 1964, still the disorienting aftermath of the Kennedy assassination, at the posh Beekman theater in Manhattan. There it played through the end of February -- a run overlapping the Beatles on Ed Sullivan's show, the opening of Barry Goldwater's Presidential campaign and the release of two more political fantasies predicated on the sedition of right-wing generals, "Seven Days in May" and "Dr. Strangelove."
Reviewing the latter for Partisan Review, Susan Sontag called "Point of Order" "the real comedie noire of the season." Indeed, in successfully repackaging "live" political theater as a sort of filmed political cabaret, the movie began new careers for its creators. Mr. Talbot branched out into distribution the following year while De Antonio established himself as a leading political documentary filmmaker. ("Milhouse: A White Comedy," which De Antonio directed and Mr. Talbot released in 1970, landed both men on the Nixon enemy list.)
McCarthy is as far from us today as the red-hunting Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer was from "Point of Order's" original audience. What remains startlingly immediate is the televisual. Treating the Army-McCarthy hearings as a form of found Pop Art, "Point of Order" is a movie about television -- literally. The kinescopes from which it was fashioned were filmed off the television screen. The public drama was already mediated for maximum human interest; its spectacle anticipates C-Span and Court TV as well as Watergate and Iran-Contra.
The most powerful demagogue is not McCarthy at all. Nor is Welch the real hero. An electronic cave painting from the dawn of the media-saturated age, "Point of Order" demonstrates the way that television inevitably recasts news as entertainment, subsumes politics in personality, elevates anecdote to history and, in the final analysis, substitutes its own flickering image for collective memory.

HEADLINE: Q&A: Bill Ayres;
In Forefront of Fighting World Hunger

BYLINE: By SUSAN KONIG 

 BODY:
BOTH body and soul need nourishment in order for man to survive." So says Bill Ayres, and he's taken to these tasks quite diligently. As co-founder and executive director of World Hunger Year in Manhattan, Mr. Ayres is working to eliminate world hunger. As a former priest and host of "The Bill Ayres Show," a call in radio program that airs Sundays at midnight on WPLJ (95.5 FM), he also dishes up plenty of food for thought.
World Hunger Year (WHY) is a nonprofit organization that supports innovative programs to create livelihood, self-reliance, food and economic security through research and education. In this country alone, some four million children live in homes without sufficient food, and 60 percent of them have at least one working parent, the organization reports. 
 Mr. Ayres grew up on Long Island. He earned a degree in philosophy from St. John's University and went on to pursue seminary studies. In 1966, he became a Catholic priest. He spent 10 years at St. Joseph's Church in Babylon before resigning in 1979.
In 1975, Mr. Ayres co-founded WHY with Harry Chapin, the singer-songwriter. In 1983, two years after Mr. Chapin's death, Mr. Ayres became the executive director. He is also on the board of Long Island Cares, a food bank he began with Mr. Chapin, and the Huntington Enrichment Center. Mr. Ayres and his wife, Jeannine, are co-founders of "At the Water's Edge," a series of self-help workshops given across Long Island. He has also written a book called "All You Need is Love" with Pete Fornatele, a WPLJ disk jockey and show host. It will be published in November by Simon & Schuster.
Mr. Ayres lives in Huntington Station with his wife and two teen-aged daughters.
Q. How did leaving the priesthood affect your professional life?
A. I had to resign from the priesthood when I decided to get married but, if given the choice, I wouldn't have left. I loved it. I loved the work, the education and the media. I was on TV and radio all over the country for the church. I was involved in the civil rights movement, hunger and poverty. I counseled people and became very aware of this need we all have to heal. I didn't want to change anything. So, I continue to do what I've always done, just not as a priest. There are three strands which have always made up my life: healing and spirituality, social justice, and media and communications.
Q. You blend spirituality with broadcasting?
A. Yes. I started doing a radio show on WGSM radio on Long Island back in 1968, when I was still a priest. I was working with Pete Fornatele, and he and I have been friends and partners ever since. In 1973, I hosted a show for WABC Radio called "On This Rock," where I would ask rock music performers to discuss the meaning behind their music and not just how many albums they had sold. Then came "The Bill Ayres Show" on WPLJ, a call-in show which is still on. It deals with emotion, healing and spirituality.
Q. How did you get involved in the fight against world hunger?
A. In the 70s, aside from my radio shows, I'd been working on a series of TV shows for Channel 9 about the third world. I came into contact with a missionary order which went all over the world. They had a film library and, one day, I sat and watched four hours of what I call "horror films" -- films of people starving all over the world. I knew about this kind of thing, but I had no idea the extent to which it was going on. It was one of those days that changes your life. I remember sitting in my car afterwards and my head felt like it was just going to explode. I knew I had to get involved, to try and help in some way.
Q. When did WHY begin?
A. Shortly after that occurrence, Harry Chapin was a guest on my radio show. He invited me to his house for dinner, and we became great friends. I suggested that we work on the problem of world hunger together, and he immediately agreed. Harry was a very quick study and had a tremendous amount of energy and intelligence. We formed WHY in 1975, but it was a very unequal partnership because Harry was able to raise a great deal of money, he had boundless energy and he just put his heart and soul into this project.
When he died in a car accident in 1981, I wasn't running WHY; I was on the board. About a year and a half later, the organization was in serious trouble, so I agreed to take it over for a couple of years. Now, 15 years later, I'm still here.
Q. What, exactly, does the organization do?
A. We do a lot of things; educating people and raising money are certainly among them. But much of what we do involves going around the country, listening to grassroots groups that have seen great successes in eliminating hunger and trying to bring them together and duplicate their efforts on a larger scale. For years, people thought there were two ways to deal with hunger. The "conservatives" believed that people needed to take care of themselves and that help should come from private charity, rather than the government. "Liberals" saw hunger and homelessness as community problems wherein we needed to help one another.
We think the answer is in a melding of the two. Self-reliance is an important thing. Harry Chapin loved the saying, "Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day; teach him to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime." That's very important. But, we're trying to take that a step further. A man not only needs to know how to fish, he needs to have the freedom to do it and a place to do it. That's where community comes in. We have to help each other, and we feel government has a very important role therein.
We're trying to create a triangle -- a very powerful triangle -- where grassroots groups, government and business all work together to obliterate hunger. When groups of people listen to one another, they come up with some very innovative solutions. Over the last three or four years, we've helped raise more than $5 million to help feed the hungry.
Q. You say your work with WHY and your radio show on WPLJ were born of the same thing -- a realization that people need to tell their "stories" and begin to heal. Can you explain?
A. In my work with WHY, we listen to success stories that you don't read or hear about in the news; you usually hear about the disasters. But we want to take people's success stories and re-write the "story" of hunger. There are things that have been working, and things we know can work. It may once have seemed like a hopeless story, but we're changing it to a hopeful one. This is healing on a social level.
On my radio call-in show, I listen to individual stories and try and heal people on a personal level. There are specific themes that we deal with: self-identity, relationships, spirituality and social issues. We all have a story inside us and, if we don't tell it, part of us gets sick and may even die. Ultimately, the person may die. We all need a place to tell our story; someone who will truly listen to us -- not try and solve our problems but just hear us. When someone feels they've been heard, it makes an enormous difference in their life. It gives them a sense of confidence. And, often, when you tell your story, you work things out in the telling.
Q. You say society is undergoing a renaissance of spirituality, and that scientists and others who formerly rejected or even ridiculed it are now seeking and accepting it. Can you explain?
A. I think people are genuinely seeking spirituality. There's a simple reason for this. In the midst of the daily grind of life, it's easy to forget we have a spirit, and we can get depressed, even sick. We are spirits as well as bodies, and spirits need nourishment. Many people aren't finding this in their churches and temples; attendance there is down. I think that's tragic, because there is wonderful tradition in all the major religions.
Q. Why do you feel attendance is down?
A. I think it's because the services don't relate to people very well. There are so many competing elements in life now -- people are so busy -- that they really have to make a commitment to their religion and, to do that, you have to see it as something very valuable for you. Unfortunately, I think a lot of people got turned off as kids. They got a dose of fear-based religion, sheer boredom, or both. That's incredibly unfortunate, because the truth is that the traditions religions are trying to convey are anything but boring -- they're very exciting -- and the basic instinct is love, not fear.
Q. You try to help them do this with your radio show?
A. What I do is listen. I don't think you can counsel over the radio, and I'm not a professional counselor. My job is to listen, give some good advice if I can and to make suggestions so that people can get plugged into long-term help. I try to get them connected, whether it's with a good friend, family member, counselor or clergy person. The whole notion of people being connected, rather than isolated, is incredibly important.

HEADLINE: ART;
Collage of Memories and More On Civilians in World War II

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR 

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
I HAVE forgotten the name of the movie but not William Holden's performance in it. He is cast as the captain of a merchant ship who, while shaving, learns that the United States has entered World War II and, without missing a stroke, says, "Which side are we on?"
At the Hudson River Museum here is an account of the civilian response to the same situation. "On the Home Front," as it is called, adjoins "Say Ahh!" the quasi-history of American medicine, like its neighbor, long on information and very short on art. But the similarity ends there, for the medical show is large, flashy and tantamount to propaganda while that about the war is more like a collage of memories. 
 The memories come from eyewitnesses, as imagined by the organizers of the show, who are Yvonne Borelli, Mary Kocy and Laura Vookles. Education coordinator, museum educator and curator of collections, respectively, they were assisted by some students from the Museum Junior High School nearby, and their purpose is to make the war something more than an obscure event recorded in history books and sometimes dramatized on television. Humorously enough, the show is watched over by students who, of course, know only what they have been taught but are happy to share it with visitors, even those old enough to remember the war.
To emphasize the hardship experienced by civilians, the show begins with photographs of objects and materials that were hard to get -- a rubber doll, a toy car made of metal . It also includes statistics that make the current recycling campaign seem like an intellectual exercise. In those days, a label says, 12,000 razor blades were the equivalent of a 2,000-pound bomb and one shovel equaled four hand grenades. Among the more significant relics is a cartoon of a Japanese soldier with the caption, "Honorable Spies Say 'Thanks for the can you throw away.' "
Survivors of the Stalingrad siege would be amused to learn that American civilians "had money in their pockets but nothing to spend it on" -- no refrigerators, no toasters, a precious little toilet paper. On some tables, margarine replaced butter and organ meat and steak and, to insure a supply of fresh vegetables, many citizens raised them in victory gardens. A wall label mentions that soldiers needed candy to get them through "obstacle course training and battles" but says nothing of the Hershey bars that sweetened the American occupation of Europe.
"On the Home Front" is made up of installations, one of which represents the living room, complete with overstuffed armchairs protected by lacy white doilies, another a kitchen with ration books on the table and a third a sewing room. Objects like the wood-burning stove in the kitchen and the women's clothes in the sewing room give the impression that the show is less about the rigors of war than the deprivation caused by economic depression. The outfit displayed in the sewing room consists of a navy blue dress and a bright green cape, both very limp, together with net gloves and a rakish toque covered with pink flowers. Can these really have been made in the country which invented the band box look?
Items calculated to arouse nostalgia in the older generation range from zinc pennies to instructions on what to in an air raid, one of them to park cars "at the curb" before taking shelter. One more engaging demonstration of loyalty is a war bond decorated with Disney animals, which proclaims its owner to be "an investor in the country."
When it comes to bringing home reality, this investigation of inconveniences caused by war may succeed where Goya's etchings of war itself failed, if only because it reaches out to everyone. Thus, restrictions on clothing are symbolized by a label that asks, "What's worse than a mother who doesn't let you choose your own clothes?" and answers, "An Uncle Sam who won't let you buy them."
Rosie the Riveter gets a mention in the pictures of women in factories and there are pictures of women in factories. The star of the female section is a black worker in an aircraft plant who, quoting her sister, says, "Hitler was the one that got us out of the white folks' kitchen." The statement almost makes up for the sparse representation of black people -- two photographs by my count. But in a show that confines itself to the American experience such a lapse is hard to understand (and forgive), but I can only suppose that the support rendered by the National Endowment for the Arts was too modest to permit a wider focus. Still, parochial as it is, "On the Home Front" covers a lot of ground, and together with a slide presentation of war posters drawn from the collection of Seymour Chwast, it will continue to remind, inform and entertain its viewers through June 14. The information number is 963-4550.

HEADLINE: Trophy Properties Top the Recovery in Chicago

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHAROFF 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
THE recovery of the downtown commercial real estate market in major urban centers in the mid-90's has led in Chicago to new ownership at some of the city's choicest office properties.
According to LaSalle Partners, a major downtown brokerage and leasing concern, the number of major transactions, defined as sales of over $10 million, more than doubled last year to 13. LaSalle also estimates that investors spent $2.2 billion for downtown real estate, up from $500 million in 1996. 
 Included in these sales were some of the city's premier office buildings, beginning with the 110-story Sears Tower, until recently the world's tallest building. (It is now, at 1,450 feet, the second tallest, after the 1,483-foot twin Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.)
Several other notable properties have also changed hands, including the Merchandise Mart, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Leo Burnett Building. Earlier this month, the Amoco Corporation, owner of the 80-story Amoco Building, the city's second-tallest structure, announced that it was putting its building up for sale.
"We saw what happened with the sales of the Sears Tower and the Merchandise Mart," said Howard Miller, an Amoco spokesman. "And it is clear that the commercial real estate market is the strongest that it has been in a very long time."
Investors say there are two main factors driving the recovery -- the booming local economy and the influx of money from real estate investment trusts, or REITs.
"There are four great 24-hour cities in the United States -- New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Boston -- where investors know the downtown business district is assured of remaining a vibrant workplace and cultural center," said Michael Reschke, chairman and chief executive of Prime Group Inc., a REIT that has invested more than $240 million in downtown Chicago real estate in recent months. "We see a lot of upside here over the next two or three years."
"There's no question that REITs are a major part of the activity," said Camille Julmy, vice chairwoman of U.S. Equities, a downtown real estate company that leases, develops and manages property. "But at the same time, there is a broad base of investors looking at Chicago."
The largest sale in the last 12 months, the $804 million deal for the Sears Tower, did not involve a REIT. The Sears Tower has been something of a debacle for its owner, AEW Partners of Boston, in the last decade.
AEW Partners had acquired the building in 1989 for $800 million, just as Sears announced it was moving to a new headquarters in the suburbs. The move left about 50 percent, or more than a million square feet, of the tower's rentable space vacant. In the last nine years, AEW increased the occupancy rate to more than 90 percent but has never made money on the building, partly because it was obliged to offer rents that were 30 to 40 percent below market rates.
LATE last year, AEW sold out to the TrizecHahn Corporation, a publicly owned real estate concern in Toronto. "We didn't get the return we wanted," said Thomas Nolan, AEW's managing director. "We're not in business to break even."
The new owner, TrizecHahn, is betting that the downtown recovery will continue for at least four or five more years, allowing it to raise rents to market level. That alone, said Gregory Wilkins, president of TrizecHahn, would increase the value of the building to more than $1 billion. He also said his company would probably sell the naming rights to the building. "I think they would be worth a fair amount of money," he said.
The tower sold for $241 per square foot, top dollar in Chicago at the moment though still below the $300 per square foot that some buildings went for at the peak of the last real estate boom in the late 80's.
Of the 10 largest commercial property sales last year, seven were purchased by REITs and five involved Equity Office Properties, the REIT controlled by Sam Zell, the Chicago financier. Equity's largest purchase was the twin office towers of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Wacker Drive, which it acquired for $462 million. Equity has also announced that it would bid on the Amoco Building, which is expected to sell for more than $500 million.
The competition for so-called trophy buildings, many with dramatic architecture and marble-clad lobbies, is easy to understand, Mr. Zell said. "Given a choice, and if rents are the same or only slightly more, tenants always go for the marble over steel and glass."
But trophy buildings are not the only buildings being snapped up.
Mr. Reschke's Prime Group Realty Trust specializes in acquiring what he calls "B buildings in A locations" and then renovating facades and lobbies to bring the buildings up to A status.
In the last four months, Prime has acquired four such buildings in and around the Loop, including two on LaSalle Street, the traditional heart of Chicago's financial community.
Mr. Reschke said that it was getting harder to find the right property "because there are so many people looking for deals right now."
"Every deal takes a little more work than the last one," he added.
Unquestionably, REITs offer a lucrative opportunity for many owners looking to cash out.
The main advantage is that sellers who accept payment in the form of REIT stock do not have to pay any taxes until they sell the shares. "It's a very attractive capital gains situation right now for a lot of folks," said Christopher Kennedy, whose family recently sold the Merchandise Mart and its across-the-street neighbor, the Chicago Apparel Center, to the Vornado Realty Trust, based in Saddle Brook, N.J., for $575 million in stock.
THE Kennedy family has been a major presence in Chicago since Joseph P. Kennedy, his grandfather and the father of the late President John F. Kennedy, bought the 4.2-million-square-foot Merchandise Mart from Marshall Field's department store in 1945.
Regarding the recent sale, Christopher Kennedy said: "We're not sure that we got top dollar, but that's not what we were looking for. We wanted the best currency." He added that because of the tax situation, stock provided the best return.
The big question mark in downtown real estate today is who will be first with new construction. With vacancy rates in some parts of the Loop at less than 8 percent, the lowest in a decade, and rents approaching what many see as the magic figure of $25 per square foot, most developers say it is only a matter of time before ground is broken for one or more speculative buildings.
"The big issue today in Chicago is large blocks of space," said Thomas Boland, national director of real estate for the accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick, which recently signed a lease for 229,000 square feet of space at 303 East Wacker Drive, which is part of the Illinois Center complex. "If you need 150,000 to 200,000 square feet, you can count the choices on one hand and not use all your fingers."
"There's definitely a shortage of contiguous Class A space," said Earl Webb, managing director of LaSalle Partners. "And that probably isn't going to change until there's some significant consolidation or new construction."
No one, however, is predicting a return to the 80's and early 90's, when more than a dozen large buildings were built in a short time. "The presence of REITs should moderate the boom-and-bust real estate cycles," Mr. Zell said. "Because the companies are public, everybody knows what everybody else is doing. That's the kind of information that has never existed in the real estate market."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
When There's No More Space for the Overflow

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
FROM the outside, the three-story structure on Van Brunt Avenue in Englewood, not far from Route 4, looks like any other office building. But inside, instead of office space, there is a vast collection of cubicles used by families as second attics and by businesses as extra supply closets.
The 41,400-square-foot structure opened last week as part of the three-acre Lackland Self Storage complex, with 1,200 individual storage units in five buildings. It is one of a spate of recently completed, under construction or planned facilities across New Jersey as developers respond to what they say is a demand for storage space with the latest available technology for climate control and security. 
 Among those responding are long-term players who continue to expand in the state, including Lackland Self Storage, a private firm based in Middlesex, and the Glendale, Calif.-based Public Storage, among the nation's larger self-storage real estate investment trusts, or REITs. They are being joined by newcomers that want to increase their market presence, like Shurgard Storage Centers, based in Seattle, which is also a REIT.
Last year there were 26,272 self-storage centers in the country, up from 19,438 in 1993, according to MiniCo Publishing in Phoenix, a company that tracks data for the self-storage industry. In New Jersey, there were 287, up from 239 four years ago.
The current number could double in the next two years if all the projects in various stages of development are realized, said David Haver, president of the New Jersey Self Storage Association, the state chapter of the national trade group based in Cincinnati.
Many of them are planned for the northern part of the state where incomes and populations tend to be higher and developers "feel they can get more bang for the buck," added Mr. Haver. He is also president of Keepers Self Storage, which is based in Manhattan and owns and operates over 1 million square feet of storage space in New Jersey and New York.
The self-storage industry, which is said to have begun on the West Coast in a row of empty garages, developed largely in the late 70's as people moved from from large homes in cold regions to smaller ones in warm regions.
But today, when job transfers and life changes, including marriage and divorce, entail more frequent moves, storage is the answer for families between houses or moving to smaller homes. And for families, as well as businesses in need of more space it is a less costly alternative to buying a bigger house or renting additional office space, industry experts and developers said.
They also said that the new storage structures, unlike the boxy metal buildings of the past, are more likely to resemble office and retail centers to blend in with their surroundings.
The activity in New Jersey started heating up last summer, said Daniel F. Spector, senior managing director at the Schultz Organization, a commercial brokerage in Woodbridge that is working with Shurgard Storage Centers. Several factors, he said, are stoking the push to develop, including the availability of money and the fact that the vacancy rate for storage space in New Jersey is about 7 percent.
In addition, MiniCo reported that the state had only .94 square feet of storage space per person in 1997, making it among the most underserved metropolitan areas in the country. By comparison, the Las Vegas metropolitan area, which is the best served, had 8.87 square feet per person.
ANOTHER factor is the overall improvement of the economy in the state, which is riding "the momentum of five and one half years of steady economic advances," said James W. Hughes, Dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.
That in turn has helped increase the state's housing supply and fill office buildings. Indeed, the number of housing permits issued in the state last year was 27,454, up from 21,521 in 1995, state figures show.
The sale of existing homes also rose, to 157,247 from 138,300 in 1995, according to the New Jersey Association of Realtors in Edison. And at the end of last year the 11-county northern and central New Jersey Office market registered an overall vacancy rate of 12 percent, the lowest in 25 years, reported the Sitar Company/Oncor International, a real estate services firm based in Woodbridge.
But land prices are rising as self-storage operators compete for prime sites, said Jerry Putterman, a senior vice president at the West Orange office of Grubb & Ellis, the national brokerage, which works with Lackland Self Storage. And rents for storage units, added Mr. Haver, are "stagnant." Moreover, some developers and industry analysts fear oversaturation.
Lackland has 17 self-storage centers in the state, of which four were built in the last two years. This year it expects to start construction on four more projects, each with 100,000 square feet and 750 units, said Michael Lackland, who manages the family-owned 21-year-old company.
In terms of production pace and style "we've moved along with the demand in the state," said Mr. Lackland, adding that the demand today was for "humidity-controlled space" and buildings with elevators.
A case in point is Lackland's newest building in Englewood, which has elevators and a front office with a central monitoring station linked to a security system. Of the 350 storage units at the newest building, 200 have heating and cooling, as do half of all 1,200 in the entire complex. The units range in size from 25 square feet to 300 square feet and rent for $61 to $360 a month.
The other four future projects, one each in Fair Lawn, Upper Saddle River, East Hanover and Clifton, will be similarly designed and comparably priced, said Mr. Lackland.
A window of opportunity now exists, said Mr. Lackland. But, he added, "it's scary" how crowded the playing field has become. "My biggest concern," he said, "is that the market will be oversaturated in 12 months."
Public Storage still sees New Jersey as a good market, "because of the supply and demand imbalance," said Harvey Lenkin, its president. Of the company's 1,100 self-storage centers 31 are in New Jersey, most of them clustered in the southern half near Philadelphia and the northern half near Manhattan.
"The market is competitive, but New Jersey's economy is good" said Mr. Lenkin, "And given our past success we will continue to add to our presence in the state as long as the demographics are there."
PUBLIC STORAGE'S latest project is a six-story building that opened last May on the northbound side of Route 17 in Rochelle Park. The project, which Mr. Lenkin said is prototypical for the company, features an extensive security system and contains 62,000 square feet and 628 storage units. The 25- to 300-square-foot climate-controlled units rent for $61 to $360 a month.
Mr. Lenkin said his company had two more sites under contract in North Jersey, which he expects to close on by this summer.
Shurgard, which has 300 self-storage centers in the nation, entered the state at the start of the year. "We see New Jersey, as the rest of the New York metropolitan region, as having great viability," said James Goonan, the company's regional development manager for the Northeast. "It's a hot market."
Typically, Shurgard builds 65,000- to 80,000-square-foot structures with 400 to 600 storage units protected by a buildingwide security system, Mr. Goonan said. All also bear the company's logo -- a 35-foot lighthouse. The company looks for development sites or existing commercial buildings "in the thick of things -- along Main Streets and close to shopping and residences," he said, noting that contract negotiations were under way on six sites, many in North Jersey.
"At some point the market will reach saturation," Mr. Goonan said. "But right now no one seems to be holding back."

HEADLINE: Q&A/Stuart Kessler;
From a Tax Man, Thoughts on Old Image

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
ON various levels the Federal tax code and the Internal Revenue Service have been under attack. Last year, Congress held hearings on reported I.R.S. abuse. Earlier this month, Vice President Al Gore called for a friendlier I.R.S. There is talk of eliminating the income tax entirely and replacing it with a national sales tax, and seemingly everyone decries how complicated the tax code is.
Stuart Kessler of Ardsley, a certified public accountant, lawyer and senior tax partner at the Manhattan firm of Goldstein Golub Kessler & Company, recently became chairman of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. He said he hopes to change the image of accountants -- he is not, he wants people to know, a bean counter -- and begin outreach programs to encourage minorities to enter accounting. 
 The association recently started approving sale sites on the Internet, assuring the public that the sites provide the services they claim and that credit cards are being protected. Mr. Kessler, a C.P.A. for about 40 years, was named one of the country's leading tax practitioners by Money magazine in 1997 and was listed among the 100 most influential people in accounting by Accounting Today in 1995. Here are excerpts of a recent conversation:
Q. You make a point that you want to change the image of the C.P.A. What is that image and why is it the wrong one?
A. It is really our grandparents' image that was handed down to our parents and down to us -- that of somebody who is basically a number cruncher, who is conservative with a green eye shade and rolled-up sleeves. I've been trying for over 20 years to bring to the public's attention the fact that we're a different breed now. We are now computer literate. We're broad thinking. We look to do things for business and individuals that are far beyond what our grandparents thought we did.
In fact, the students today don't learn to add in any college; they use computers. They used to use adding machines. But today, even on the C.P.A. exam you can use a calculator. When I took the exam, we'd spend half our time adding and subtracting and multiplying. That's no longer. We're business consultants. We bring a lot to the table for individuals and businesses: estate planning, financial planning, systems and health care. We're all over the place. I've long felt a great TV show is in the waiting dealing with C.P.A.'s. I think it could be compelling TV drama dealing with technology and human relations.
Q. Congress recently had hearings on I.R.S. abuse. Were the horror stories just anecdotal, or are problems of abuse widespread?
A. I'm a modest I.R.S. defender. They have a duty to perform, and they get their marching orders from the Congress. Many Congress people pound on the I.R.S. and blame the tax code. But what they do is based on what Congress promulgates. Congress puts in a myriad of crazy laws, which they did last year -- 804 pages of complications. And then they say, Boy, you guys in the I.R.S., you should simplify it. The Congress people are the ones that create the mess.
I say all the time that a Congressman or Senator should not be permitted to vote on a tax bill until they've prepared their own tax returns. In around 1989, for example, they did this terrible thing putting on a 15 percent excise tax on retirement funds, in addition to the state tax and income tax. I said at the time this will not fly when Congress people start to retire. And that's exactly what happened. When they started to retire they saw this heinous tax could in effect bring people over the 100 percent tax point. It was repealed last year. As for the I.R.S., there are abuses; there are aggressive agents; there are aggressive managers. By and large they're like any of us. We try to do our best.
Q. You say that people who make these laws often don't know the ramifications of what they're adopting? How do we get around that?
A. I'll tell you a really far out way of doing it. I think somewhere along the line, in the year 2050 when none of us will be opining on this, there probably will have to be a domestic president and a foreign policy president; a domestic Congress and a foreign Congress. The breadth of knowledge to run the country is so incredibly vast that we can't expect an ordinary man or woman to go up to Capitol Hill and learn all about commerce, industry, agriculture, taxes, foreign affairs -- all of those things. We're in a era of specialization. Just to know the tax code itself -- we have to go back to Wilbur Mills, the famous Wilbur Mills that got caught in the fountain in Washington with Fanny Fox, to find someone in Congress that knew the tax laws inside out.
Q. Can flat-tax proposals for the income tax really simplify things?
A. There are a couple of issues. They figure that those who do simple forms can use a postcard for filing. The postcard doesn't leave room for the listing of dependents. Before listing dependents by name and with Social Security number was required, people were writing in all sorts of dependents. I had an experience about 14 years ago of a woman who when I asked who her dependents were, said "Only Tommy." And I said, "Is that your child?" She said, "My cat." She had been claiming the cat as a dependent. If you eliminate the requirement that dependents be identified, the fraud will just go exponentially where it was.
Let me tell you another scenario to show how ludicrous the flat tax would be. You use a car for business. Let's say the flat tax comes in the year 2000. You buy a $40,000 small Mercedes, let's say. And you use it that year for business. That's legitimate and under the flat tax you'd be able to deduct the full $40,000 in that year. The following year, you decide you don't need to use the car any more for business, so you convert the car to personal use. There is no recapture of the deduction. In the third year, you decide to sell the car and you sell it for $40,000. It has kept its value. There is no capital gain that you would have to pay under the flat tax proposal. That's just one example. What they should be doing is simplifying the tax code itself -- get rid of 19 different depreciation rates. Get rid of the 35 or 40 effective dates. Make life easier for everyone. Make it simple for people whose income is $50,000 or less.
Q. What do you think of the idea of a national sales tax, which would replace the income tax?
A. We already have a New York State sales tax and we know how badly most people feel about it. When they took the sales tax off of clothing, people literally flocked to the stores to buy. If you had a national sales tax, if you're selling a sweater for $50 and now you pay, let's say, a 7 percent sales tax, that's $3.50 and people don't mind it too much. We're sort of used to it. If you add a Federal sales, tax, which is estimated at the beginning to be 27 percent, that's 34 total sales tax. That's a tremendous change. Stu Kessler is not going to buy that sweater.
That's just one little part of it. Look at what it does to the state. New York State has an income tax, which is based on the Federal. If there is no Federal income tax, we're going to have to change our whole method of collecting that. And state tax administrators tell us that it's much more difficult to collect sales tax fairly than income tax. We'll have to have somebody to collect it, and it's much more difficult than an income tax.
Q. Difficult in the sense that there are more ways to evade it, like buying things off the books?
A. Exactly. By the way, anyone who is talking about national sales taxes is not saying, Do away with the payroll tax -- the Social Security, Medicaid, unemployment taxes. Some people pay more in these taxes than they do in income taxes. Something has to be done about Social Security. We're balancing the budget with Social Security funds. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants is doing a study about what should be done.
Q. What is the current law on mail order and sales tax?
A. If you have any presence in another state -- and a presence can be an office or a person -- you generally have to collect sales tax in that state. They're getting to a situation where in the foreseeable future there will be a tying together of all the states where you will not be able to evade the sales tax by catalogues. I would guess within the next five years or so.

HEADLINE: L.I. Sound Benefiting From Rise In Support

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
STANDING along the wind-whipped shores of Long Island Sound earlier this month, Gov. George E. Pataki waxed poetic about the once foul estuary, describing it as potentially one of the major environmental comeback stories of the decade. Other New York politicians, too, took bows that stormy morning as millions of dollars from the state's Clean Water, Clean Air Bond Act came to their constituencies for projects in the Sound.
While a downpour pummeled the great waterway behind him and washed up around his shoes, the Governor, standing under the cover of a tent, happily announced that $14 million would be allocated for 18 cleanup projects along the Sound in Westchester County, on Long Island and in New York City. 
 "Protecting and restoring New York's waters to health is the heart and soul of the Clean Water-Clean Air Bond Act, which devotes more than $1 billion to water-quality protection and improvement," Governor Pataki said on March 19 at Harbor Island Park in Mamaroneck.
After years of neglect, much loved but also much polluted Long Island Sound is showing signs of recovery, thanks in part to the fact that being green is politically correct these days. "I'm passionate about the environment," the Governor said last week, "and that's a passion shared by many."
With the climate more receptive to environmental causes, the ranks of those rallying on behalf of Long Island Sound has swelled -- now including not just advocacy groups but also representatives of state government, elected officials, lawyers, fishermen and many of the more than 8 million people who live within 50 miles of the coast.
As the Governor observed on his visit to Mamaroneck, the story of the Sound's revival is one that gladdens many sectors of society, including labor, a group once pigeonholed as anti-environment.
"This funding will allow work to begin on badly needed environmental projects, bringing new life to our natural resources and putting New Yorkers to work building a cleaner, healthier and more productive future," Mr. Pataki said.
Like Mr. Pataki, County Executive Andrew J. Spano is an ardent campaigner for the environment. "I'm a guy who has done a lot of clamming and oystering on the Sound," Mr. Spano said recently, pleased that the county received $3.8 million from the bond act for a demonstration project at the Mamaroneck Sewer District to remove nitrogen and other pollutants entering the Sound.
"The waterway is a priority for all of us," he said.
This year's allocation for the Sound also includes $34,500 from the bond act to restore the native vegetation in a marsh area in Mamaroneck. For New Rochelle, there is $50,000 for aquatic plantings to reduce runoff and sediment in one area and $141,000 to reduce the amount of sediment washing into the city's harbor.
David J. Miller, executive director of the National Audubon Society of New York State, observed that the time was right in many respects to call attention to pressing environmental issues. "It's not only the politically correct thing, but economically and environmentally right," said Mr. Miller, who is co-chairman of the Citizen Advisory Committee for the Long Island Sound Study, a Federal interstate and intergovernmental project.
While politicians, environmentalists, labor and other organized groups have gone to the mat for the Sound, its continuing comeback can also be attributed to the efforts of individuals like Peter Studwell, a tough-talking sports fisherman who grew up along its shores in Port Chester.
Two years ago Mr. Studwell declared war on the commercial boats that dredged bait fish in the Sound and left the waters barren of blues and striped bass. Mr. Studwell said that all that was left once the large vessels departed was a watery desert where his anchor sank into emptiness.
Just days before large commercial fishing vessels were due in the Sound last spring, Governor Pataki signed a law banning the boats from plying the western waters of the Sound. Connecticut followed suit with a two-year moratorium on commercial menhaden fishing. Menhaden are the small fish that make up part of the diet of the sport fish, and they are used commercially in pet food and as fertilizer, among other things. If Connecticut does not impose a permanent ban on commercial fishing before the end of the two-year moratorium, commercial fishing vessels might return to the Sound.
"It has been a long and hard fight," Mr. Studwell said, "but people are finally speaking up."
Friends of the Sound Alliance, an organization formed in 1996 by Mr. Studwell, received a conservation award in January from the International Game Fish Association, a 60-year-old organization based in Pompano Beach, Fla., which names Ernest Hemingway among its founding members.
John W. Atkin, president of Save the Sound, an advocacy group in Stamford and Glen Cove, said it was "unusual for someone with an idea to be able to get legislators' ears in two states and have them adopt laws the first year the problem came before them."
"This was a real success story," he said of Mr. Studwell's efforts.
In other developments, there was more good news announced for the Sound in March when Federal and state environmental officials at a meeting of the Long Island Sound Policy Committee in Bayville unanimously adopted a 15-year, $650 million plan to upgrade sewage treatment plants along the New York and Connecticut shoreline.
The plan seeks to reduce nitrogen discharges, linked to reduced levels of dissolved oxygen in the Sound. Nitrogen acts as a fertilizer for algae blooms, which eventually sink to the floor of the Sound, decompose and consume oxygen in the water, severely stressing marine life.
The officials also adopted a plan to reclaim and restore at least 2,000 acres of habitat along the shores of the Sound over the next 10 years.
"We're at a turning point," said Mark A. Tedesco, technical director of the Federally run Long Island Sound Study office, which involves the cooperative efforts of the Government, two states, interstate and local agencies, universities, environmental groups, industry and the public.
The initiatives adopted on Feb. 5 are part of the Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan for Long Island Sound, which was first approved by state and Federal agencies in 1994. The management plan followed a $15 million Federal study of ways to clean up the estuary, which was initiated in 1987 amid fears that the Sound might be dying.
Terry Backer, the Long Island Soundkeeper and director of the nonprofit Soundkeeper Fund, which has offices in Oyster Bay and Norwalk, has described the Sound as a fragile body of water "with a microsystem that reacts like a game of dominoes." A report several years ago by the American Oceans Campaign, a nonprofit public policy group, said that the Sound and other estuaries -- bodies of water where freshwater from rivers and streams mingles with ocean saltwater -- are being overwhelmed by unchecked development and population growth.
Written in conjunction with Save the Sound and the Long Island Soundkeeper Fund, the report said fewer than half of the shellfish beds of Long Island Sound can be harvested because of pollution.
The Soundkeeper Fund filed a lawsuit this month in Federal District Court in Brooklyn accusing New York City of illegally polluting the Sound. The suit seeks enforcement of a permit issued in 1994 under the Clean Water Act, which required the city to reduce its discharge of nitrogen from its four East River treatment plants.
On Monday, Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut announced that his state would join that lawsuit. And the state's Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, accused New York City of using the Sound as a cesspool.
New York City is also named in a suit filed on March 9 in Supreme Court in Manhattan by Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco of New York State. In that suit, the State Department of Environmental Conservation charges that the city exceeded the limits of its state discharge permit at eight of its sewage plants.
"We're obviously telling the city it has to do more," said John P. Cahill, Commissioner for the State Department of Environmental Conservation. "The Bond Act helps, but we want to make sure that all the municipalities are doing their share."
"Westchester also has to do more," Commissioner Cahill said. "We'll be pressuring them as well." The county is under a consent order from the state to reduce storm water infiltration and inflow from municipal and county sewers.
As Mr. Spano conceded last week, "We still have a long way to go." He agreed that the sewer and storm water problem was a No. 1 priority for the Sound and his administration.
Looking toward the future, Mr. Atkin at Save the Sound said, "We're getting there, but no one can afford to sit on their hands."

HEADLINE: Appetite for Talent, Fed With Flexibility

BYLINE: By DIANE SIERPINA 

 BODY:
WHEN Lisa Benne left her job as a seller of medical diagnostic equipment two years ago to join the Essential Data Corporation, a Stamford consulting firm, little did she expect to get breakfast at the office every morning, not to mention massages and other eclectic thank-you's, courtesy of her boss.
And when Suzanne Haas needs to get her creative juices flowing at the Atlantic Group, a Norwalk-based printing and marketing firm, she takes a midday break to shoot some pool. The boss thinks it's great. 
 The evidence is everywhere. Connecticut's business environment may not be as relaxed as Silicon Valley's, but it's certainly moving in that direction. With a national reputation as a center of culture and brainpower, it's a no-brainer that companies around the state, large and small, are discovering that being as creative as possible with benefits and workspace is the key to attracting the skilled employees they need.
"Connecticut tends generally to be behind the trend," says Cathy Woolley, senior vice president of administration for the Hutensky Group, commercial real estate developers based in Hartford. "It is the land of conservative habits. But I think we're going to see companies bend a great deal."
At Hutensky, she said, "The one thing we are doing more of is paying attention. We are listening to our employees as to what works for them and trying to figure out how to make the work work around that."
Human resource professionals around the state agree that, no matter the size or type of company, the biggest problem facing Connecticut companies is recruiting -- and, even more importantly, retaining -- employees with scientific and technical skills.
"An ounce of retention is worth a pound of recruiting," warns Bruce Tulgan, president of Rainmaker Inc., a New Haven consulting firm that teaches corporations how to attract and retain skilled Generation X employees. Those who go unchallenged or whose needs go unattended, he says, go out job hunting.
Companies are listening -- through surveys, employee committees or direct contact --to learn what their staff members need to get the job done and still have a life outside the office. Yes, there are increased salaries and benefits, but there are also child care and health and fitness centers, casual dress, allowing staff to rearrange their workspace or listen to music, and giving a day off for winning the company's baby picture contest. In between, companies are offering flexible hours, telecommuting, job sharing and additional training.
"I tell my clients that they've got to create opportunities for people to reinvent themselves over and over again," says Mr. Tulgan.
And what do the companies get in return? Increased productivity, experts agree. "It's really about recognizing that workers are people, too," Mr. Tulgan says.
Large and small companies may approach the problem in different ways, but, at a minimum, they're looking for guidance.
"The tight labor market has upped the ante. Companies have to do more," says Robert D. Noonan, vice president and counsel for management services for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.
The association will offer a special session at its annual two-day conference on Employment, Law and Human Resources Management in June to focus on recruiting and retention strategies. "And I expect it will be very well attended," says Mr. Noonan.
An association survey on personnel policies of 200 Connecticut companies last year indicated that up to half are paying rewards to existing employees for referrals, 90 percent provide training and development opportunities for salaried employees and one-third offer 100 percent tuition reimbursement for undergraduate courses. (The number goes up to one-half for graduate courses.)
Many are shortening or eliminating waiting periods for health benefits, providing medical coverage for domestic partners, accelerating raises, expanding leave policies and subsidizing child care and adoptions. "Flexibility varies with the industry," says Mr. Noonan.
The more progressive companies also find visibility and community service powerful tools for attracting new employees and invigorating current staff.
Small, private firms like Essential Data, a $12 million company that provides technical writers and documentation trainers to businesses, and the Atlantic Group, with 50 marketing, creative and print production employees, can offer even the quirkiest policies and benefits.
"I try to make my associates feel appreciated," says Antoinette Allocca, president of Essential Data. "And that can't just be in the pocketbook." When she notices a staff member is under particular pressure, Ms. Allocca says, she may prescribe a massage or a round of golf. Birthday parties are celebrated and breakfast is available daily.
Stephanie Primm, president of the Atlantic Group, says her philosophy has always been to keep the office atmosphere loose, creative and full of team spirit -- especially when looming deadlines add to the stress level.
"People need to be allowed to be themselves," says Ms. Primm. "They need to have a little down time. I think playtime fosters greater creativity."
At Atlantic Group, an antique electric train on the lobby ceiling can be set in motion by a switch at the receptionist's desk. The billiard table in a space off the lobby and another on the second floor are in use most lunch hours and often after work.
A nearby bar is a hangout after work hours and the center of happy hour style get-togethers with staff and clients. Ms. Primm's two dogs, a beagle and a golden retriever, often roam the offices and sometimes have animal visitors.
Suzanne Haas, associate creative director, and Heidi Adair, senior account executive, agree that the Atlantic Group's unstructured environment makes for great camaraderie and job cooperation, but it may not work for those who aren't self-motivated, they warn. "We grew up with this place," says Ms. Adair. "That's why there's such a comfort level here. The wackier GenX'ers -- maybe they went to the city because they felt they needed to be there."
At the Hutensky Group in Hartford, which employs 55 people in four states (45 in Connecticut), the staff likes half-day Fridays in the summer. Desks are cleared off by 1 P.M. Friday, says Ms. Woolley, the senior vice president of administration.
Staff members make up one half hour each day from Monday through Thursday, either at the beginning or end of the work day. Clients appreciate the extended office hours, says Ms. Woolley. "It's not a benefit; it's a productivity tool," she explains.
The Bushnell, which operates the performing arts center in Hartford, also uses contests, gift certificates, days off and complimentary show tickets to reward its 45-member staff, says Diane Bruno, director of human resources. And any suggestions made by its employee committee are definitely considered.
"Some of the things we asked for when we entered the work force were unusual, too," she remembers.
Large companies too are trying to be more innovative and they have more resources to back up their changes.
The Xerox Corporation in Stamford, a regular on Fortune and Working Mother magazines' lists as one the top 100 United States employers. is getting calls on how to do it. In recent months, five to 10 companies a week -- most of them large -- call Marilyn Timbers, Xerox's life cycle program manager, to get details about the company's practices. "Never before have I gotten these kind of calls," says Ms. Timbers of the volume.
Xerox, among many other things, provides each employee with a bank account of $10,000 that can be used over his or her work career for child care, extended health care coverage or first-time mortgage assistance. Other applications, including elder care and college tuition assistance, are being considered. The company also offers free referral services for child care, elder care, parenting skills and education.
"When all is said and done," says Ms. Timbers, "what employees really want is flexibility and empowerment. Everybody doesn't have the same needs. One-size benefits don't fit all."
Last fall, Xerox rewrote the employee motivation and satisfaction survey it distributes annually to reflect more life/work balance issues. Managers are evaluated based on the anonymous results, says Ms. Timbers.
BankBoston, meanwhile, in addition to its regular benefits package, offers a minimum 100 shares of stock options annually to each full-time employee.
In October, the end of the first year of the program, the value had risen by $42 a share, meaning a minimum gain of $4,200, says Karen Schwartzman, BankBoston's spokesperson.
"BankBoston is doing exceedingly well," she explains, "and we wanted to share the wealth and to give employees a stake in the performance of the company." BankBoston has 1,150 employees in Connecticut.
Next, in response to staff requests, BankBoston will extend family medical benefits beginning in July to domestic partners or one other dependent residing with the employee.
"It's important to have progressive benefits programs because people have choices," says Ms. Schwartzman, "It's a tight labor market. We have found time and time again, if our employees are happy and appreciated and valued, they do better for the company and the company does better for its shareholders."
And at the Bayer Corporation's pharmaceutical division in West Haven, the company recently opened a child care center and created a lactation program for breastfeeding mothers as a result of a survey of the needs of its 2,000 employees.
The lactation program, which provides pre- and post-natal counseling as well, has allowed mothers to return to work sooner and will be offered at Bayer's other sites around the country, says Laura Malis, a Bayer spokeswoman. Fifty-five women have taken part in the West Haven program.
"At Bayer, we spend a lot of time talking about what it means to be an employer of choice," says Kim Carpenter, vice president of human resources. "We like to think we're open to good ideas."
Perhaps the closest Connecticut workplace to Silicon Valley is Hyperion, the Stamford-based software company that had only 200 employees six years ago and now has 1,300.
"Our challenge," says Bill Hewitt, vice president of marketing, "is to maintain the culture of a smaller company."
In a large, still expanding fitness center, television sets provide programming from around the world by satellite hookup. Workspace has been rearranged to provide common meeting areas. And a billiard room and game room supplied with pinball machines, Nintendo and other games are almost always in use. The company encourages it as a means for hard working staff to clear their heads, says Mr. Hewitt.
"It's a good way for people in different departments to get together," he says. "People work out ideas; they work out problems there. Especially in a company growing as quickly as ours, communications is key."
With developers who work odd hours, Hyperion makes sure it keeps the pantries around the company well stocked with sodas, water, juice and coffee. "To keep people fed and happy -- and supplied with lots of caffeine," says Mr. Hewitt.
Connecticut's technology companies must compete with high-tech centers around the nation for the skilled workers they need to grow. But the state's reputation as a defense and insurance headquarters has hurt its image, says Tom Bradley, spokesperson for the Connecticut Economic Resource Center, a nonprofit agency whose mission is to attract new companies to the state and help existing ones grow.
Last December, the center began a print and radio campaign in technology trade publications and major newspapers touting Connecticut as a hotbed of technology activity. After all, 17 percent of the work force is employed in technology, the largest ratio in the nation according to Federal Labor Department statistics, says Mr. Bradley.
"The campaign is a lot funkier and geared to a younger audience," he says. "We're reaching the skilled worker."
So what if Silicon Valley companies allow animals in the workplace, stock refrigerators with beer, and let employees walk around barefoot? Do these things increase job satisfaction, motivate workers and add balance to their lives?
"These lavish perks seem sort of frivolous" says Brent Laymon, a spokesman for Xerox. "I'm not sure the people looking for them are, in the long run, the ones who are going to make you competitive."
But it doesn't hurt to be more worker friendly. Says Mr. Hewitt of Hyperion, "people want to come to work and be productive. And anything we do to make that happen is to our benefit -- obviously!"

HEADLINE: School Aid: State Has Promises To Keep

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
MAYOR NANCY VALENTINE of Ansonia says the state has put her city in a bind. Rising school enrollment and state mandates are increasing the cost of public education but the state won't pay what it promised. Instead, the money comes out of Ansonia's property tax revenue.
Ansonia is not alone. There seems to be little disagreement between state and municipal officials that the state is short-changing many cities and towns on financial assistance for public education. The amount of the shortage, and what to do about it, are, however, in dispute. Last year, the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities estimated the shortfall to be $868 million a year. Legislative leaders say it is far less. The co-chairman of the legislature's Education Committee, Senator Thomas P. Gaffey, a Democrat of Meriden, wants to use the anticipated state budget surplus to make up the difference, while Gov. John G. Rowland has proposed establishing a task force to study what an appropriate amount should be. 
 But Ansonia and 11 other municipalities have filed a lawsuit asking the courts to order the state to pay the full amount they claim it has promised. They charged that the state is violating the State Supreme Court's Horton v. Meskill decisions of the 1970's and 1980's that found that Connecticut's over-reliance on local property taxes to support education was unconstitutional.
The suit, filed in Hartford on March 18, names seven children from six communities as plaintiffs. In addition to Ansonia, the municipalities suing include Bridgeport, Coventry, East Hartford, East Windsor, Manchester, Meriden, New Britain, New Haven, Seymour, West Haven and Windham.
Robert DeCrescenzo, a former Mayor of East Hartford who is representing the plaintiffs, said the two Horton decisions cited a provision in the Connecticut constitution that makes the state responsible for public education. In its Horton decisions, the Supreme Court ordered the legislature to develop a school aid formula that eliminates the advantages that wealthy communities have over poor ones.
The legislature took that step in 1988 when it established the Equalized Cost Sharing grant program, with the goal of providing half the money for public education across the state. It uses a complicated formula that channels more of the money to poorer cities and towns based on their needs and their ability to raise revenue.
Around the same time, the legislature enacted the Minimum Education Requirement, setting a minimum sum per pupil that school districts must spend, and another mandate for for special education. To offset the special education spending mandate, grants were established that, like the Equalized Cost Sharing grants, also gave larger sums to poorer towns.
At the outset, the Equalized Cost Sharing grants provided 45 percent of the total spending for public education in the state, well on the way to the legislature's goal of 50 percent. Then Connecticut slid into recession, an enormous deficit appeared in the state budget, and the legislature began to move in the other direction, providing a smaller and smaller percentage each year.
In 1989, 1990 and 1992, the legislature revised downward a part of the Equalized Cost Sharing formula that determines the level of property wealth of a community that is considered sufficient to support the local share of public education spending. In effect, poorer towns were redefined as wealthier, and their education aid grants were reduced.
Since salaries and other educational costs usually rise each year, an original assumption of the Equalized Cost Sharing program was that the foundation level of per pupil spending in its formula would have to be raised periodically. But the last time the legislature authorized an increase was 1992, and since then it has not kept up with inflation. It is now nearly $600 per pupil less than it would have been under the original formula.
Furthermore, in 1992 and 1995, the legislature imposed caps on the amount any municipality's Equalized Cost Sharing grant could rise, further preventing them from keeping pace with inflation.
Also in 1995, the grant programs for general and for special education were combined. This act produced revisions in the formula that further limited growth in state aid to local school districts. That last revision opened the shortfall the most between the actual grants and the 50 percent reimbursement goal, said Ben Barnes, an expert on the education funding issue for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.
"It's been ongoing," he said, "but it's been particularly acute since 1995, and I expect it's grown this year, though I haven't figured it out." But based on the grants for the 1996-97 fiscal year, he said, the shortfall was $868 million a year, and the state's reimbursement level had gone down below 40 percent.
Ten years after the legislature acted to equalize spending, the highest-spending towns in the state spend about twice as much per child as those who spend the least. The largest cut to a municipality was borne by Bridgeport. "Bridgeport received $57 million less than if the state had followed the court-ordered funding schedule," said Mayor Joseph Ganim. If he had that money, he says he believes his city's schools would have smaller class sizes, more computers and more children getting pre-school education, among other things.
Mr. Ganim says he doesn't believe the legislature has the political will to restore the original Equalized Cost Sharing formula and its goal of providing 50 percent of public education costs, which necessitates the lawsuit.
"We're only going to court as a last resort," Mr. Ganim said. "We'd rather this be settled in the state house than in the courthouse."
Mayor Ganim and Mayor Valentine of Ansonia are facing municipal budget difficulties. Bridgeport's teachers were recently awarded a 4.9 percent pay raise in binding arbitration that Mr. Ganim says his city cannot afford.
Ansonia's Board of Aldermen last month cut $200,000 from the school budget proposal, which, if allowed to stand, will lower that city's per pupil school spending to below the level mandated by state law.
Ms. Valentine said Ansonia would have received $13 million under the original Equalized Cost Sharing formula, but under the current formula will receive only $9 million. "We're short $4 million," she said.
Although she is a Republican, Ms. Valentine criticized Mr. Rowland's proposal to use $120 million from a state budget surplus by mailing income tax rebates to all state taxpayers next October. "If we have such a large surplus, why aren't we funding education?" she asked.
Dean Pagani, Mr. Rowland's spokesman, defended the Governor's education plan, noting that it includes $93 million to hire 300 more elementary school reading teachers, help build more classrooms and schools, offer grants for educational innovations and improve the vocational/technical school system. Also, since the state is now in the middle of a two-year budget cycle, it isn't possible to increase spending on the magnitude that the lawsuit demands, he said.
But, Mr. Pagani said, Mr. Rowland would propose a task force study the formula and determine if it should be revised during the 1999 session of the legislature.
To which Senator Thomas Gaffey, co-chairman of the Education Committee, replied: "I don't think we need a task force to remedy this problem. This is not a complex issue."
Mr. Gaffey said only $150 million is needed to remove the caps limiting Equalized Cost Sharing grant increases, and he believes that sum can be found. It would mean sacrificing Mr. Rowland's tax rebates.
State Senator Judith Freedman, the ranking Republican on the Education Committee, noted, however, that there are constitutional restrictions on the use of budget surpluses that may impede Mr. Gaffey's simple solution.
Ms. Freedman also said she felt it is, indeed, a complex issue. There are 46 different elements in the Equalized Cost Sharing formula, and she said that every time one is changed it creates a ripple somewhere else in the formula. She said she thought convening a task force was a good idea.
Ms. Freedman also criticized the lawsuit for excluding wealthier towns, thus making its case stronger. Towns in lower Fairfield County in particular were discouraged from participating, even though they receive lower equalization grants every year.
Mayor Valentine, said, however, that no community should worry about the lawsuit, because it will help all of the state's cities and towns if it's successful. She said she doubted whether Mr. Rowland's task force would make much of a difference.
"What is a task force going to tell us?" Ms. Valentine said. "Uncap the formula." "If it's a mandate, then the state's got to pay it,"
She added, "I've got taxpayers to answer to, and education to provide to the children."

Hawthorne Motel Owner Razing It to Build Anew

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

DATELINE: HAWTHORNE

 BODY:
DIRECTLY opposite the exit to this hamlet off the Saw Mill River Parkway, a 50's-style motel sits unobtrusively on a hill overlooking heavily trafficked Route 9A. For 42 years, it's been a part of the landscape, often the first thing motorists see when they come into Hawthorne.
But faced with the threat of losing his Quality Inn franchise unless he embarked on a substantial upgrade, Jeffrey H. Zelekowitz has proposed razing what was originally the Hawthorne Circle Motor Inn and replacing the three-structure complex with a three-story modern motel. 
 His proposal, now before the Town of Mount Pleasant's Planning Board, calls for a 40,000-square-foot commercial building and a free-standing restaurant in addition to the new motel, at a total cost of $10 million.
Mr. Zelekowitz said that he was currently seeking "institutional financing" for his project."
"This kind of project is representative of the kind of investment owners are making in hotel properties all over the county today," said John D. Williams, president of the Westchester Hotel Association. "It's just one of several multimillion-dollar projects either being discussed or under construction."
Mr. Williams attributes the activity to the fact that "business is good as a result of a stable local economy," he said. "We get good weekday business from I.B.M., Texaco, MasterCard and Pepsi and other local corporations. And business has also been good on the weekends, with bar and bat mitzvahs, graduations or just weekend getaways from the city."
According to the Westchester Convention and Visitors Bureau, based in White Plains, taxable hotel sales in Westchester were up 25.7 percent in 1997 over the previous year.
Of the 62 counties in New York State, Westchester was second only to New York City in taxable hotel sales and first in growth in 1997, compared with the previous year.
The Renaissance Westchester Hotel in Harrison has just completed an $8 million renovation of its 350 rooms. "We added several conference rooms and installed two phone lines in every room as well as speaker phones and data ports," said Mr. Williams, who is also manager of the hotel.
Similarly the Tarrytown Hilton is in the second phase of a $5 million renovation, which will eventually include a complete redesign of its 250 guest rooms, according to Jeff Voorhees, the manager. "The rooms, which are now typical hotel style, will have a more country type decor, with sleigh beds and granite-top dressers."
The renovation will also include the building of an Irish pub, which will have a "modified Victorian design, almost like the kind of pubs you see in Ireland, the ones that look like a country store," Mr. Voorhees explained.
As testament to the health of Westchester's hotel market, the Quality Inn in Hawthorne continued to be busy despite its vintage design, according to Emily Kirwin, the manager.
Built in 1956 by her father, it is the style of motel where every room has its own exterior entrance and a guest pulls his car right up to the door.
"We've always catered primarily to a business guest," Ms. Kirwin said, "and business has been steady over the years." Room rates are considered reasonable, between $85 and $95 a night for a single. But they are expected to go up once the new motel is built, said Ms. Kirwin, who is staying on as manager. She declined to say, however, what the new rates would be.
"I was kind of hoping they'd be able to renovate it instead of replacing it," said Ms. Kirwin. "It has great curb appeal. I'm going to miss it."
MR. ZELEKOWITZ noted that the existing 69-room motel, which has an outdoor pool, takes up all of his nine-acre property. "Renovation just didn't make economic sense so we decided to start from scratch," he said. "By building a taller motel, we can add 16 rooms and still have room for a commercial building and a restaurant. It makes much better use of the land and adds value to it."
The property has already been rezoned to allow for the mixed-use project, according to Robert F. Meehan, Supervisor for the Town of Mount Pleasant. "The old zoning, which was adopted in the 50's, required exterior entrances to all the rooms with parking in front of the units, which is how the existing motel was designed," Mr. Meehan said. "The rezoning was necessary in order to build a new modern motel with one single entrance."
A public hearing on the site plan is scheduled for Thursday, but Mr. Meehan does not anticipate any major opposition.
"It's really a welcome proposal," he said. "It will modernize a highly visible and important intersection in town."
Mr. Zelekowitz has agreed to make some road improvements at the intersection of the motel property and Route 9A, which parallels the Saw Mill River Parkway. An internal road will connect the hotel with an existing office building and a 24-hour diner on Route 9A.
"It will bring all traffic out to a turning signal on Route 9A, which is a definite improvement over the present situation," explained Nat Parish, a planning and environmental consultant who is working on the project.
"Right now people exiting the diner and office building have to make a very dangerous turn onto Route 9A with no light," he added.
The motel's design will be "post modern with a porte-cochere focus with an articulated roof and Palladian design," according to Gary Warshauer, principal with Warshauer Mellusi Warshauer Architects of Hawthorne, which is designing the project.
The stucco facade will be done in earth tones and beiges, he added, "to blend in with the woodsy surroundings."
The two-story commercial building, which will have 20,000 square feet of retail on the ground floor and 20,000 square feet of office space above, will be designed in red brick and stucco, Mr. Warshauer said. "This will tie in with the restaurant, which is expected to be developed by Appleby's," Mr. Warshauer said, adding that it would be done in red brick with green awnings.
The exterior detailing of the buildings will be carried into the inside of the hotel, which will have stonework and a two-story lobby with a peaked roof.
"The backdrop to this project is a woodsy area so we want to use natural materials and have the project sit in the property as unobtrusively as possible," Mr. Warshauer said.
Scott Benson, of Benson Commercial Realty in White Plains, is marketing the retail portion of the project and hopes to attract a discount retailer for the lower level and a medical complex for the office space upstairs.
"We see it as a stand-alone retail property, rather than as a complementary space to the hotel," Mr. Benson said. "It's a very visible location and would be ideal for a destination-type retailer."

HEADLINE: The Computer Age Began in a Barn

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
IN 1948, 20-year-old William B. Wenning of Stamford, fresh out of a two-year technical college in New York City, was looking for a job. An acquaintance suggested he try Remington Rand.
"I had never even heard of Remington Rand," Mr. Wenning says today. But in post-World War II America, with an economy adjusting to peacetime and millions of ex-G.I.'s also out looking for jobs, any suggestion was appreciated. Just before Christmas he showed up at Remington Rand's research center in Norwalk and, in a manner of speaking, walked into a new frontier: the computer. 
 The man who hired young Mr. Wenning was Loring P. Crosman, whom he admired then and still, not only for his business vision but also because he was a good guy, quiet-spoken, and appreciative of his workers.
"He hired me and had me come in right away so I could get holiday pay," Mr. Wenning says. You don't forget a gesture like that, even after close to 50 years.
In the middle of World War II, Mr. Crosman had interested James Rand, the chairman of Remington Rand, in a new venture. The company, then situated in Brooklyn, N.Y., was a major manufacturer of office furniture, machines and systems and Mr. Crosman saw the future in an electronic machine that could add, subtract, multiply and perform other functions much faster than digital calculators. Such a marvel didn't even have a name -- but computer, or computer machine, would do.
Remington Rand had to wait until the end of the war to get into such a new venture. It also had to wait until Mr. Rand, who lived in Darien, got around to establishing a new corporate headquarters in Connecticut.
He had become enamoured of an splendid property in the Rowayton section of Norwalk. It was the James A. Farrell estate, known as Rockledge, a huge fieldstone mansion set well back on one side of Highland Avenue with an equally impressive Tudor building on the other side of Highland. The latter was a stable.
Mr. Farrell, who went to work in a factory at 15, had risen in Horatio Alger fashion to become president of U.S. Steel, and of his own steamship line. As such, he had enough money in the pre-World War I era to build a home, and stable, to rival the showy mansions, and stables, in Newport, or anywhere else. He needed a staff of eight to keep the place comfortable.
Both Mr. Farrell and his wife died in the early 1940's and Mr. Rand purchased Rockledge, the mansion to become corporate headquarters, the stable to be used for research. And with the end of the war, the company could settle down for some research into new prospects.
When Bill Wenning arrived in late 1948, he reported to Mr. Crosman in the old Rockledge stables, joining eight other men, all older than he, who had dubbed their workplace "the barn."
Life in the barn had a certain air about it, Mr. Wenning reflects today. "One guy said he could still smell manure there but I never did." Rather, the air was one of a certain excitement, a feeling that something new was happening. It was an adventure. At the same time, he said, nobody in the group was really aware of the ramifications of what they were doing.
Indeed Remington Rand itself might not have been fully attuned to the potential. There was no security at the barn in the early years. "When we got through for the day we just shut the door," Mr. Wenning says. Sometimes, he adds, when the group opened up on Monday mornings, it was obvious that the caretaker's kids had been playing in the barn.
The workers at the barn did just that, work, Mr. Wenning says, and improvised, and enjoyed it all. "In 1950 to 1951 we worked 12-hour shifts and we didn't get paid for that. We did it because we wanted to."
While the work was going on, changes were piling on changes in the postwar business world as companies scrambled for shares of the new peacetime market, at home and abroad. At Remington Rand, even the name changed. It became Sperry-Rand after a merger with the Sperry Corporation. And James Rand had added some important men to the top echelon of the corporation -- Gen. Leslie R. Groves, who had headed the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb; Gen. Douglas MacArthur, famed for leadership in the Pacific during World War II and then for being fired by President Harry Truman in the Korean Conflict.
Mr. Wenning says he guesses that General MacArthur was hired as a figurehead but he did create a few more legends there. One was about corporate officers reporting to work early. "He would stand at the front door across the street at 8 in the morning and wait for the vice presidents to check in," Mr. Wenning says. "They would drift in at 9 or so at first but eventually they got the message."
General MacArthur also enjoyed having his picture taken, with everyone. When it came to Mr. Wenning's turn, he stood on the floor, he says, and a little platform was provided for the General to stand on. Mr. Wenning is a fairly tall man. General MacArthur was not. But the General looked up to no one.
In 1951, the first prototype of a working business computer, known as the 409, was unveiled to potential customers and the second prototype was installed at the Internal Revenue Center in Baltimore.
To compare the 409 with any computer today, personal or business,would be ludicrous. The 409, Mr. Wenning says, was more than 7 feet long, 2 feet deep and 5 feet tall, "and generated lots of heat." In addition, it was accompanied by a punch card unit, to feed it information, and that itself was as big as a refrigerator.
Today, he adds, any home computer "is a million times faster and better, and a thousand times cheaper."
But the 409 was first. What the group in the barn had done, Mr. Wenning says, was to take a concept, that of a computer just for business, and bring it to reality. "There was no precedent for it. We went from an idea to a finished product," he says.
There was no question of demand. "There were so many customer orders that in late 1949, the company stopped taking orders," he says.
In the competitive that followed, International Business Machines became the major player, while Sperry-Rand started to turn out business computers under the name of Univac, another company it had absorbed.
In 1961, Mr. Wenning was picked as program manager on a project to bring a much more sophisticated business computer, the Univac 1004, to market. amid so many doubts that it would fly, that it was code-named Bumblebee. Aerodynamically, it should be impossible for a bumblebee to fly, Mr. Wenning explains. But fly it did, becoming the most successful punch-card computer in the company's history.
By then, dozens of other companies -- soon to be hundreds, then thousands -- had jumped into research and production of computers. And security had become so tight at the barn, crowded with 185 people at one time, that many people at the mansion had no idea of what was going on across the street.
Mr. Wenning left Sperry-Rand in 1962 and went to work for Pitney Bowes of Stamford, became a corporate vice president, and retired from there in 1986. He now lives in a hilltop home in Old Lyme, with a fine view of the Connecticut River where it meets Long Island Sound.
And Sperry-Rand eventually left the state, absorbed into the Unisys Corporation of Pennsylvania. The old Farrell mansion became a private school for young women, then was owned by the Continental Can Corporation and is now headquarters for Hewitt Associates. The barn became the Rowayton Library on one side, the Rowayton Community Center on the other.
The computer industry has also changed more than a bit. From a few dozen companies in the early 1960's, the industry has grown to more than 10,000 companies around the world today. By the turn of the century it is expected to be the second-largest industry in the world, exceeded only by agriculture.
Last year, Erik H. Rambusch, a management consultant to the information industry and also president of the Rowayton Historical Society, discovered something that dismayed him: there is virtually no written history about the infancy of the computer in Rowayton.
He arranged for a meeting of eight of the men who had worked in the barn in the late 1940's and early 1950's. They sat around for hours, talking about that time and being tape-recorded. Another session has been planned for next Sunday, to observe the 50th anniversary of the first working model of a business computer, and to reminisce a bit more about being on the threshold of a massive change in technology. "One guy last year said it was the best time of our lives," Bill Wenning says.

HEADLINE: Our Medicine Chest

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
SAY Michigan and the automobile business comes to mind. To think of Texas is to think of the oil industry. And North Carolina still means big tobacco.
But say New Jersey, and the word "pharmaceuticals" hardly leaps to the tongue. The Rodney Dangerfield-ing of the state has extended to its mightiest manufacturing industry, which can't get no respect. 
 "People know that our companies are here, but they have no idea what an important industry we are," said Raymond V. Gilmartin, the chief executive of Merck & Company. "We haven't gotten the focus or attention that we might have deserved."
And yet the state's 186 pharmaceutical companies, with their 60,000 jobs, have spawned an influential corporate culture and an exploding, highly skilled talent pool. The drug makers have transformed nearly every aspect of New Jersey, ranging from the consumption of pizza in Nutley and the proliferation of rural executive subdivisions to making key early contributions to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark.
Thanks to an accident of geography and history, the industry is the state's largest manufacturing sector, according to the New Jersey Department of Commerce. The giant, research-based pharmaceutical companies' global war is increasingly being waged from New Jersey turf. And the state's role is growing: In December, for example, Pharmacia & Upjohn, of Kalamazoo, Mich., the maker of Rogaine hair restorer and Nicotrol nicotine patches, announced that it would move its worldwide headquarters and 700 jobs to Bridgewater Township this year.
Fred Hassan, the company's chief executive, said the move would place the company's headquarters "within the global center of gravity of the pharmaceutical industry." Yes, New Jersey.
Certainly the industry's vocal critics in environmental groups and labor unions, who have bitterly fought the pharmaceutical companies for decades, charge that the drug purveyors have all too much power in the statehouse and in the Legislature. They call for more regulatory focus on the dark side of the business.
But the industry is gearing up to foster an image-building campaign that would make "New Jersey" and "pharmaceuticals" synonymous. Last year the state's largest companies, including Merck & Company, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Johnson & Johnson and Hoffmann-La Roche, each paid dues of $50,000 to set up a trade association, the 16-member Health Care Institute of New Jersey.
Drawing on statistical and financial information never before released by the implacably competitive and often secretive companies, Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting and consulting company, was hired by the institute to compile a statewide portrait of the business. It conclusively supports the notion that New Jersey is the "Medicine Chest of the Nation," as the institute perkily puts it:
* New Jersey has the nation's largest concentration of businesses that produce prescription pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter medications, generic prescription drugs, vitamins, diagnostic drugs and medical devices.
* These companies inject more than $8 billion into the state's economy, including $3.2 billion in wages.
* The state's drug makers are currently targeting 60 major ailments, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease and AIDS. A third of all new drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration during the last five years have come from New Jersey-based pharmaceutical companies (Pennsylvania and California came next).
* New Jersey companies produce at least 43 percent of the pharmaceuticals sold in the United States. Last year, 17 of the 48 most significant new drugs approved by the F.D.A. originated from New Jersey companies.
Nary a nook or cranny in the state is untouched by the industry. The pharmaceutical companies channel $1.4 billion to New Jersey vendors ranging from temporary-employment agencies to security guards. They include not only computer suppliers but also the Park Pub in Nutley -- a cozy, barn-beamed watering hole directly across from the main gate of Hoffman-La Roche on Kingsland Avenue -- and the Crocco Brothers New York Pizza and Restaurant, just around the corner.
"We recently sent over 150 pies for an office party," said John Crocco, the restaurant's co-owner. "They account for 80 percent of our business during the day," he said. "Sometimes the scientists will even order in pies at midnight."
For knowledge workers, at least, the life style can be thoroughly rewarding. The average salary of full-time workers at the top 15 companies is $58,380, and senior researchers make $150,000 and up.
The New Jersey talent pool "is like something out of the Middle Ages, where all the shoemakers worked on the same street," said Dr. Daniel O. Hauser, who heads pre-clinical research for Novartis in Summit. "New Jersey is the equivalent of the Pharmaceutical Guild, the place where you find the talent."
In attracting top scientists to the region, "the access to academic institutions, museums and fine restaurants is important," said Dr. Alan J. Main, director of pharmaceutical research at Novartis.
For the drug makers, the problem with everyone-into-the-talent-pool is that close proximity fosters headhunting, and recruiters draw employees into a human-resources merry-go-round. "The job market is very tight, very competitive," said Jim Bishop of Burke, O'Brien & Bishop Associates, of Princeton, an executive search firm. "Companies are looking for executives with science and marketing backgrounds, and they aren't that easy to find."
To remain competitive, the major pharmaceuticals offer a robust array of flex-time, job-sharing, child-care and elder-care options. "We are model employers in terms of compensation and benefits," said Wayne P. Yetter, chief executive of the American subsidiary of Novartis.
And for the past few months the pharmaceuticals have been racing to sign up new Ph.D.'s in a competition "like the N.B.A. draft," said Dr. Thomas N. Salzmann, head of chemistry research at Merck's Rahway center. The rookies' starting salary? About $70,000.
 
Meetings in the Car Pool, Married Competitors
While some workers live near their offices, most employees are dotted about the state like beads in a time-release capsule.
"Amazingly, there are three of us within five houses of each other," said Jeffrey A. Soper, a public-affairs manager for Roche who lives in bucolic Sparta in Sussex County, 43 miles from Nutley. Next door is a manager from Knoll Pharmaceutical Company and down the street is a research scientist for Merck.
There are so many Roche co-workers in Sparta that they head to the office by car-pool, dubbed the Sparta Express. "We work on the same product," said Mr. Soper of his colleagues Al Masucci and Phillip Villavicenzio, "so we've made our drive into an extended office meeting."
At times, the serendipities of the labor pool are positively weird. Once Dr. Salzmann was engaged in an intense scientific discussion with a colleague at a seafood restaurant in Westfield. "H. C. Brown has a brilliant way of doing this," he was saying of a Nobel Prize-winning chemist's research procedure. Someone tapped Dr. Salzmann on the shoulder.
"Thank you," said a stranger who introduced himself as the laureate, Dr. Brown.
"We've all gone to conferences together, or worked together, or gone to school together," said Dr. Victoria Rusiecki-Lombardo, a chemist at Merck who works on diabetes.
This is true of her husband, Lou -- they met while getting their Ph.D.'s in chemistry at Yale -- and they form a not unusual industry pairing: a dual-career couple working for fierce pharmaceutical rivals.
"Luckily we're both working in different areas," said Mr. Lombardo, a group leader in anti-cancer chemistry at Bristol-Myers in Lawrenceville.
"It's sort of a James Carville, Mary Matalin thing," said Mrs. Rusiecki-Lombardo. "For us, we find that there are a lot of topics off-limits."
Secrecy is a never-ending concern. "You will notice a significant phenomenon on the 7 A.M., 8 A.M. and 9 A.M. Continental shuttles from Newark to Washington," said Ronald Califre, head of clinical development and regulatory affairs at Novartis. "I'd bet 80 percent of the people on those flights work for pharmaceutical companies. But none of them is talking shop."
As scientific, technical and financial jobs have been added in the industry, blue-collar jobs have been lost.
"Now, probably no more than 20 percent of pharmaceutical jobs in New Jersey are unionized," said Mark Dudzic, president of the Distict Eight Council of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International, which represents the largest number of pharmaceutical workers in the state. "The companies have moved more and more toward outsourcing, and have moved a lot of jobs offshore to Puerto Rico."
He estimated that about 5,000 New Jersey jobs were lost from the 1970's to the 1990's because of a tax loophole, which has now been closed, permitting Puerto Rican tax writeoffs for the companies.
Currently the disintegrating State House dome in Trenton is being refurbished by a consortium of companies led by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. The drug makers' critics see that as a symbol of the industry's domination in Trenton.
The companies "always hold out the continual threat that 'we'll pull out if we don't get this tax break or this grant,' " said Anthony Wright, program director for New Jersey Citizen Action, a consumer group.
State Assemblyman Bob Smith, Democrat of Piscataway, often an opponent of the industry, said the companies "are very powerful, but they don't own the Legislature." He added, "They don't have the same influence as oil does in Texas, but the pharmaceutical companies contribute hugely to legislators in both parties."
"I only wish we were so powerful," said Patrick J. Zenner, president and chief executive of Hoffmann-La Roche. Indeed, the companies have suffered legislative losses on environmental regulation and on restrictions governing generic drug makers.
"We haven't really leveraged the power of the industry," said William H. Tremayne, president of the companies' Healthcare Institute. "The reality is that there hasn't been much of a public presence of the industry as a whole in the state."
At the local level, the companies' influence has always been significant. The impact of the industry's varied philanthropy is profound, amounting to more than $300 million, according to Corporate Giving Watch, an independent nonprofit newsletter.
"And it's hard to get away from the word 'Johnson' in New Brunswick," said Curtis Fisher, executive director of the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group.
Bob Wilson, the vice chairman of the Johnson & Johnson board of directors, speaks proudly of the company's role in its community. "We made a commitment to New Brunswick 20 years ago, and have tried to improve education and health and amenities there," he said, adding: "We've tried to be very responsive and not make it a company city."
 
Environmental Issues Draw Foes' Criticism
 It is the environmental issue that draws the most fire from the industry's foes. "They've fought every health and safety measure kicking and screaming, and if they're good citizens in the state it's because they have to be," said Bill Kane, president of the New Jersey State Industrial Union Council, an umbrella organization for 40 unions representing 260,000 workers.
One of the state's most notorious Superfund toxic-waste sites is in Toms River at a plant formerly run by Ciba-Geigy; the company was assessed a $3.5 million fine. The Oil, Chemical and Atomic union charged management with covering up a higher incidence of cancer among workers, which the company (now Novartis) strongly denied.
The industry "has had environmental problems, but earlier in the century our knowledge base was not as great, and we didn't have an understanding of what these things did," Mr. Zenner said of toxic substances. "We have an exemplary record now."
The pharmaceuticals "have cleaned up their act to an extent," said Mr. Fisher of the Public Interest group, but he contended that the companies "are still putting large amounts of chemical carcinogens and reproductive toxins into their products, and releasing them into the environment."
New Jersey's pharmaceutical pre-eminence is an accident of history. "Pennsylvania and Missouri could have been the nation's pharmaceutical centers, but ultimately they couldn't offer the market concentration and talent pool of New Jersey," said Louis Galambos, a professor of business and economic history at Johns Hopkins University.
In the 19th century, German and Swiss pharmaceutical companies established East Coast operations to sell to the American market. When they began to produce chemicals, they looked to the nearby, low-cost farmland of New Jersey.
The most famous early pharmaceutical migration was that of the Johnson brothers, who left New York to search for a suitable factory in New Jersey. One day in 1886, one of the brothers, James, was riding a Pennsylvania Railroad train, which slowed to cross the Raritan River at New Brunswick. "He looked out the window and spied a To Let sign on a four-story red brick building," according to a corporate history. "This would soon become the first home of Johnson & Johnson."
By World War I, many companies were forced to sever their ties to German corporate parents or have their assets seized as alien property. "By the 1940's, New Jersey was solidly established as the nation's leader," said Professor Galambos.
It is likely to remain so, for now. Currently the pharmaceuticals "are going through a new product cycle, unit volume is up 4 percent and dollar sales are up 10 percent" over the same quarter last year, said Hemant K. Shah, an independent pharmaceutical industry analyst.
A frenzy of high-tech research-facility construction is going on now in New Jersey, and more than 5,000 new scientific, managerial and financial jobs are expected to be added in the coming years.
The cost of research is increasingly prohibitive. It takes an average of 14 years and more than $200 million before a drug is approved by the F.D.A.; the failure rate of new compounds is 90 percent. Such extreme expense has driven ever new mergers of companies that affect operations within the state.
"More mergers are inevitable," said Jack Lamberton, an independent pharmaceutical analyst, "and workers at companies in New Jersey should expect that layoffs will be involved."
Over the next decade, the patents will expire on more than 150 big drug brands, opening them to knockoff competition from generic drug manufacturers -- some of them in New Jersey -- peddling low-cost copycat prescriptions. If this is cheering news for consumers, it gives the giant research-based companies perpetual agita.
As bright as the short-term picture looks here, "no industry is forever," said Professor Galambos, adding: "The New England textile factories were built with 18-inch granite walls because they thought they'd be there forever. Now only the walls remain. Industries always move where they feel it is in their best interests to go."

HEADLINE: Manhattan Strength Lifts All Boroughs

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
DONALD PIERRE could not find the home he wanted for the price he could pay in his old neighborhood, Crown Heights, Brooklyn -- the one that would work for his growing family and bring in a bit of rental income.
But three miles east, in once-notorious East New York, Brooklyn, he found a three-family building on a 40- by 100-foot lot. And, in October, Mr. Pierre closed on the $165,000 deal and moved in with his wife and two small children. 
 "I got what I wanted: a driveway, a yard, two rentable apartments," said Mr. Pierre, a 33-year-old native of Trinidad.
"It's all changing," Mr. Pierre said of East New York, a community that, during the crack wars of only five years ago, had been dubbed by some the "murder capital" of New York City. "East New York is coming around."
Indeed, say real estate observers and brokers who serve neighborhoods like East New York, Bushwick and the South Bronx, they are all coming around -- a bit. The high tide churned by the Manhattan residential sales market -- with its bidding wars, price leaps and the squeeze of too many bonus-bearing buyers seeking too few properties -- has rippled through the other boroughs, with price increases trickling even into poorer neighborhoods.
According to a comprehensive survey conducted by Case Shiller Weiss, a real estate statistics firm in Cambridge, Mass., house prices rose last year in all but 14 of the 130 ZIP-code areas in the boroughs outside of Manhattan. In 1996, when the city's recovery from the real estate recession of the early 90's was already under way, more than twice as many (29) ZIP-code areas in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island experienced price depreciation.
One of them was East New York. Last year, however, the community rebounded with prices appreciating by up to 2 percent.
To be sure, it is not as though East New York is suddenly paradise found. There remain rubble-strewn lots and the hollow-stare windows of abandoned buildings. Fifty thousand people live in the neighborhood's 23 towering housing projects. R.I.P. murals still dot brick walls.
But in a community that, despite its blighted image, boasts long blocks of primly kept homes, there is a sense that, just maybe, a corner has been turned.
Crime is down. There were 35 homicides in the 75th Precinct last year, a 72 percent drop from the 126 that set a city record for a single precinct in 1993. "The streets are cleaner," Mr. Pierre said. "A multiplex, stadium-seating theater is being built 10 blocks away. It's getting better."
The Bronx, too, is getting better, said Harry Baksh, president of ERA Besmatch, a brokerage with offices in the Castle Hill and Wakefield sections. "There's so much happening," he said. "I see opportunities to sell in the Bronx now that I didn't see 10 years ago.
"Even in the South Bronx, there's been improvement," Mr. Baksh said. "If you drive through the area, you'd see that many of the properties that were abandoned have been refurbished or are in the process of being refurbished. It's not just a few blocks. It's not just some showpiece development."
Across the city, boards of realtors reported a range of price increases in 1997, from 15.4 percent for a two-bedroom apartment below 96th Street in Manhattan to 6 percent for a single-family home in Queens and 4.1 percent on Staten Island.
A broadbrush profile of sales volume for the city, another indicator of market strength, was less calculable, primarily because statistics gathered by realty boards in the Bronx and Brooklyn were unreliable.
Still, as a measure of the pressure cooker that the Manhattan market has become, total sales of condominiums and co-ops selling for $75,000 or more in Manhattan below West 116th Street and East 96th Street increased to 7,114 in 1997, according to the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report, an 18 percent jump from 6,037 transactions in 1996.
In the Bronx, where Mr. Baksh conducted his own survey, based on transfers of deeds recorded at the Bronx County Courthouse, there were 1,797 transfers in 1997, a 12.1 percent increase over the 1,603 in 1996.
And on Staten Island, where development of remaining expanses of open land provides powerful allure for newcomers, there were 2,565 sales last year, according to the Staten Island Board of Realtors, an 11.8 percent increase over the 2,205 in 1996.
Only in Queens did the numbers indicate a slackening of sales volume -- a 6.7 percent drop to 3,804 from the 4,080 sales in 1996. But that slippage indicated a leveling off from the 2.4 percent increase the year before, and from the 84.8 percent climb since 2,058 sales were reported in 1991.
Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, which primarily represents Manhattan, believes the rebound of the Manhattan market over the last three years has rippled through the other boroughs. "We have surpassed the late 80's in terms of value and the competition for apartments in Manhattan," he said. "It has spread to the other boroughs. We're actually seeing developers look at the possibility of building in the boroughs.
"Soon somebody is going to use the word gentrification as a dirty word again."
For 13 years, Headley Barrett, president of HB Realty in East New York, has been juggling and struggling with supply and demand in his community. "You've got to remember that most of the people that we service are low-income." Mr. Barrett said. "When they don't have money, we suffer like hell. But the way things have been shaping for this session, it looks good.
"Now, we are seeing people who are hunting houses like crazy. Now, we are more affordable than most areas and people understand that, so they come. You get people from Flatbush over here to buy."
IF Manhattan is at the core of concentric circles, so, too, is it and the rest of the city riding a far larger wave.
A national record for sales of existing single-family homes was set in 1997, according to the National Association of Realtors. The 4.2 million homes sold last year represented a 3.1 percent increase over the 4.08 million sold in 1996 -- the previous record.
National sales of new homes hit 803,000 last year, according to Census Bureau data, a 6 percent increase over the 757,000 sold in 1996. And last year's numbers were the third highest ever.
The nation's home-ownership rate set a record in 1997, the Census Bureau reported, when 66 percent of the households in the country owned their own homes.
All of that, of course, has been powered by a robust national economy, the nation's lowest rate of unemployment in a quarter of a century and that real estate ignition fuel: low mortgage rates.
In January, said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage data company in Butler, N.J., interest on a standard 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 7.05 percent -- not much above the nation's 28-year low of 6.83 in October 1993.
The nation's unemployment rate dropped to 4.7 percent in December, a 25-year low. And while the unemployment rate for New York City remained considerably higher at 8.5 percent, said John L. Weiting, the regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, it, too, was improving. It had been 9.6 percent in 1996.
"The national expansion is 84 months long," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Rutgers University School of Planning and Public Policy. Pointing to those and other indicators of a stellar economy -- including the lowest inflation rate in 32 years, 2.2 percent -- Dr. Hughes said, "The home-buying stars are in full alignment."
Paul Hergenroeder's reading of the real estate constellation indicated that it was time to sell his one-bedroom Upper West Side co-op and buy somewhere else in Manhattan. It didn't quite work that way.
"There was a sense of wanting to cash in on increased value," said Dr. Hergenroeder, a physician who works at a long-term care facility for AIDS patients. Three brokers gave him varying price appraisals -- $130,000 to $210,000. "I went with the higher one, a little reluctantly because I thought they were high-balling to get the listing," Dr. Hergenroeder said. "Lo and behold, I got two offers for the maximum price.
"The only trouble with selling is you then have to buy."
Along with his companion, who then lived separately, Dr. Hergenroeder "looked at lofts in SoHo," intending to spend $300,000 to $400,000. "For a spacious two-bedroom or a loft, the prices were closer to $500,000, $650,000," he said. "For less than that we were able to get a brownstone in a promising neighborhood" -- Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. They paid $570,000.
"Brooklyn Heights was unaffordable," the doctor said. "The same brownstone there would have cost a million."
So goes the Manhattan squeeze.
According to the Douglas Elliman Market Report, prepared by the appraisal firm of Miller Samuel, the average price for Manhattan condominiums soared 30 percent last year, from $376,251 in 1996 to $489,228.
CO-OP price changes were more complex. While the overall average for Manhattan co-ops dipped by 7.6 percent, to $424,365 from $459,569 in 1996, there was wide fluctuation according to apartment size.
The average price for a one-bedroom dropped 15 percent, from $205,292 in 1996 to $174,499 last year, the Elliman report said. But studios increased 10.3 percent, from $99,301 to $109,544. Two-bedrooms rose 7.2 percent, from $427,990 to $458,705. Three-bedrooms increased 7.8 percent, from $1,116,000 to $1,202,646. And apartments with four bedrooms or more increased a whopping 33 percent, from $2,360,625 in 1996 to $3,139,585.
The reason for the drop in overall prices for co-ops, said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, was a virtual doubling of the number of less expensive studio apartments sold in Manhattan last year -- from 305 in '96 to 602 in '97.
Divining real estate trends by the numbers is, at best, a murky exercise. To begin with, co-op sales are not officially recorded because, technically, they are securities transactions involving the selling of shares, and not transfers of title. Condominium sales, however, are officially recorded. As a result, studies of co-op data compiled by brokerage houses and appraisal concerns do not claim to include all transactions in the market.
Single-family home sales are reported by local realty boards. But not all real estate agents are members of the boards, and not all sales in a given area are recorded. At the same time, one board may use median prices -- meaning half the sales are above that figure and half below -- while others calculate an average. Still, the numbers, along with anecdotal impressions, can offer indications of market patterns.
Clark Halstead, founder of the Halstead Property Company, has a novel market barometer. "We've had our web site for three years and it seemed like a sinkhole into which we were pouring funds," he said. "Suddenly, traffic has increased radically, up to 22,000 hits in one week."
Barbara Corcoran, founder of the Corcoran Group, said demand has been so great that "the unwanted children of Manhattan" are being scooped up: "the cookie-cutter one-bedrooms, sponsor sales, fringe neighborhoods like the East Village -- where the response used to be, 'Live there?' "
Pressure from the Manhattan squeeze has been felt in the co-op market in the other boroughs, said Stuart Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives. "They are reporting many sales, whereas two years ago there was no activity at all."
Mr. Saft pointed to a co-op on Pelham Parkway in the Bronx where an apartment bought for $20,000 two years ago recently sold for $60,000.
Beginning three years ago, said Christopher Thomas, the William B. May Company's vice president for Brooklyn, "Prices in Brooklyn Heights started rising in response to Manhattan prices. And through last year, the rise in Brooklyn Heights prices prompted a rise for neighborhoods further into Brooklyn -- Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, Boerum Hill and Park Slope."
Comprehensive numbers for Brooklyn sales were not available because the borough has no central realty board. But, by another measure, the Case Shiller Weiss survey, the trend was apparent.
Case Shiller Weiss has devised an index to track price fluctuations. The survey is based on a table showing the average price of all single-family homes sold in ZIP-code areas, year by year. To determine price fluctuations in 1997, for example, the survey took the purchase price of each home sold in each ZIP-code area during the year just ended, compared it to the price that the house brought when it was last sold, and then, using the annual index, adjusted the earlier purchase price to what it likely would have been had it sold in 1996.
OF the 36 ZIP code areas in Brooklyn, only one experienced price depreciation last year; 10 showed appreciation up to 2 percent, 24 appreciated 2 to 4 percent and one appreciated by 6 percent or more.
A year ago, Mr. Thomas said, sales in Brooklyn Heights and the prime areas of Cobble Hill ranged from $1.3 million to $1.7 million. "By the end of '97, we had marquis listings -- the best properties in the best locations -- listed as high as $5 million. The resulting impact in Park Slope is that houses that were trading in the $750,000 to $900,000 range are now listed from $900,000 to $1.3 million."
Jacob Shayovitz, president of the Brooklyn Board of Realtors, said that "in a lot of areas, younger buyers are squeezed out by higher prices." By Mr. Shayovitz's estimate, prices "in Mill Basin would be $225,000 to $300,000; in Flatbush, $200,000 to $275,000 for the same 40- by 100 lot, and in Bed-Stuy, Bushwick, $150 to $235."
For some buyers, the Brooklyn crunch has exacted an extra toll -- on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.
Donna Connelly, a commercial printer, couldn't afford a condominium in Bay Ridge, where she had been renting. "Under $100,000, you're lucky to get a studio," she said.
Ms. Connelly said she looked "for a good year," in Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, Bay Ridge. "So I crossed the bridge. Did not want to do it, because I drive to work.
"But once I went out there," she said, "for $70,000 in the Bullshead section, I got a two-bedroom, central air, full attic in a town house" -- the Staten Island term for a row house -- "a front yard and an assigned parking space."
Ms. Connelly's mortgage is $451 a month; her maintenance is $130 a month -- for a total less than her $721 rent in Bay Ridge. "The best thing is," she said, "I haven't gotten a ticket for alternate-side parking since I moved here in January."
In Bay Ridge, Ms. Connelly said, "I got, on average, two tickets a month, which comes to $110. I'm saving a fortune."
According to the Staten Island Board of Realtors, 2,465 homes were sold on the island last year, up 11.8 percent from 2,205 in 1996. The median sales price was $158,200, 4.1 percent more than the $151,940 price in '96. All 12 ZIP-code areas on Staten Island experienced price appreciation last year.
"It's very frustrating," said Gerry McClean, president of the Staten Island Board of Realtors. "We don't have enough inventory."
Ms. McClean estimated that a one-family detached house "in one of our affluent areas like Todt Hill" would sell for between $500,000 and $1.3 million, while the average single-family home might cost $186,000, "about $11,000 more than last year."
In Queens, according to the Long Island Board of Realtors (which covers the borough, as well as Nassau and Suffolk Counties), the average single-family home price was $172,393 last year, a 6 percent increase over the $162,686 price in 1996. That trend was supported by the Case Shiller Weiss findings that all but 11 of the 57 ZIP-code areas in Queens experienced price appreciation last year.
Ed Gitlin, a broker at Benjamin Realty in Forest Hills, said that in his community "lower-end houses" that sold for $200,000 a year ago now bring about $230,000. "Fancier homes in areas like Cord Meyer, along the Grand Central, average $500,000," he said.
Even the Queens co-op market, long depressed after a spate of sponsor defaults in the early 90's, is showing signs of revival. Mr. Saft of the Council of New York Cooperatives cited a building in Sunnyside where three-bedroom apartments sold for $42,000 in 1996. "Today they're going for $53,000." And at a complex in Flushing, a two-bedroom "went for $30,000 in 1996, and a year later it's at $40,000."
Mr. Gitlin pointed to a luxury condominium in Forest Hills, the Pinnacle, "that was bankrupt a few years ago, and now a three-bedroom goes for over $400,000."
"These are folks from Manhattan coming in," Mr. Gitlin said, "or older people who have sold their homes on Long Island."
Prices for single-family homes in the Bronx, according to Mr. Baksh, who conducted his own survey, "remained in the same range last year compared to 1996" -- between $145,000 and $180,000. In fact, according to Case Shiller Weiss, there was slight appreciation of up to 2 percent in 20 of the 25 Bronx ZIP-code areas.
Mr. Baksh has noticed, in particular, that "there are a lot of investors in the market -- purchasing properties, mostly ones that need work, rehabbing them and reselling. In the South Bronx, two-family houses have been selling for $200,000, believe it or not. They can receive a city subsidy, so they end up paying about $40,000 less."
Much of the upward pressure on prices throughout the city, said Michael Schill, director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law, is attributable to the dearth of new housing construction.
IN recent years, Professor Schill pointed out, an average of 12,000 housing units a year have been lost due to demolition, abandonment or the merging one apartment with another, according to data from the city's 1996 Housing and Vacancy Survey. And in each of the last two years, the Department of City Planning has issued building permits for about 9,000 units.
"So, we are experiencing a net loss of 3,000 units a year, despite the fact that our population has been growing," Professor Schill said. "It's wonderful for the people who are getting increased prices when they sell, but the flip side is that it's not so wonderful for middle- and lower-income New Yorkers who, if they are lucky enough to find housing, must pay extremely high prices."
To beat the squeeze, Marc Levitt and his fiancee, Danielle Bedell, came up with a simple solution -- stay put.
The couple had been subletting a one-bedroom co-op near N.Y.U. for $1,650. "Due to rising rents, it winds up being less expensive to buy," said Mr. Levitt, who works in video conferencing for the MCI Communications Corporation.
"Frustrating would be the word," he said of viewing about 50 apartments. "For over $200,000, we saw one-bedroom apartments where the bedroom was barely big enough to hold a queen-size bed -- I'm not kidding."
Ms. Bedell, a human resources worker at J.P. Morgan, complained of brokers who hyped apartments "that would be nothing that we could live with."
"We walked into one place that was a duplex and they told us it was a bath and a half," she said. "There was a full bathroom downstairs, but upstairs, where the bedroom was, it was a sink on the wall."
In the end, Mr. Levitt and Ms. Bedell decided to buy -- for $170,000 -- the apartment they were renting. "We don't think we're settling," Mr. Levitt said, "but we were looking for our dream apartment and realized that it was not within our means.
"You've heard the stories, but until you go through it you don't realize."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL;
Go West: New Sport Brutes Square Off on the Utah Buttes

BYLINE: By JIM McCRAW 

DATELINE: BLANDING, Utah

 BODY:
MONUMENT VALLEY, that collection of impossibly beautiful buttes, mesas, canyons and valleys in southeast Utah and northeast Arizona, is an excellent place to test the mettle of sport utility vehicles. There are great roads, good roads, bad roads, rocky roads, dirt roads and no roads, with natural wonders waiting no matter which route you take.
Three couples, including four automotive writers, gathered in Southern California in late January with a mission: We would take the pulse of five newborn sport utility vehicles on a 2,200-mile trip through the desert Southwest, seeing how they compared in the kind of environment for which they are designed (but all too rarely see). 
 Once assembled, we headed north and east from Los Angeles on Interstates 10 and 15 to Las Vegas, then on to Gouldings, a complex of motel, museum, store, restaurant and gas station off Highway 163 in Monument Valley near the Navajo reservation.
The director John Ford made his headquarters here, starting in 1939, while making films like "Stagecoach," "My Darling Clementine," "Fort Apache," "She Wore A Yellow Ribbon," "The Searchers," and "Cheyenne Autumn," his last in Monument Valley, in 1964.
We went there to see where the stars worked and to give these trucks a thorough workout. This included a trip to Four Corners, where Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico come together; through the Valley of the Gods, a huge, red sand gulch; up and down the treacherous Mokee Dugway road, with its switchbacks, silt-and-gravel surface and lack of guardrails. We looked over the Muley Point precipice; took a guided tour of the Navajo Recreation Park, a nature preserve laced by trails, and rode on the road where Forrest Gump stopped running.
At the end of a week in the wilderness, we drove to Flagstaff, Ariz., and began the long return trip to Los Angeles on interstate highways. Our trip included urban congestion, long stretches of interstate travel and extensive off-road driving. We went from sea level to an elevation of 7,400 feet and back down again, and had plenty of time to sort out our opinions of these vehicles:

DODGE DURANGO The largest truck in the group, the Durango is built on the Dodge Dakota pickup chassis. The test model had an optional third-row seat, expanding seating capacity to seven; a raised roof, and the most storage room. The second and third seats fold flat into the floor for cargo.
The Durango comes with a choice of engines: a 3.9-liter, 175-horsepower V6; a 5.2-liter, 230-horse V8, or a 5.9-liter, 245-horse V8. Either part-time or optional full-time four-wheel-drive systems are available. Thus, the Durango can be matched to a family's towing and hauling needs in ways the four others cannot.
The silver Durango SLT test vehicle went down the road like a determined freight train. It is as easy to drive on broken pavement and dirt as on the straight and narrow. It did not ride as comfortably as some of the others, but the steering was direct and accurate. It was also the longest truck with the longest wheelbase, making it a bit of handful in tight places, both on and off the road.
The Durango is a big, honest truck, but it showed inattention to detail. The quality of the plastics and the way they fit together trailed the other domestic vehicles, and especially the import brands. After a sunset photo session, one of my companions reported on the radio that when he pulled the headlamp switch, it came out of the dashboard.

GMC ENVOY The Envoy is a new version of the GMC Jimmy, loaded with luxury and convenience touches and, at $35,000, priced accordingly. The Envoy is thoroughly American and plenty big -- though not as large as the Durango -- and is powered by a 4.3-liter overhead-valve V6 and heavy-duty four-speed automatic transmission. The Envoy's part-time four-wheel-drive system is G.M.'s sophisticated electronic unit. A dashboard switch lets you select two-wheel-high, four-high or four-low range.
The plush Envoy also had Onstar, a dealer-installed global positioning system and cellular telephone that links you to a travel center. The operators there can tell you where you are and where you are headed, make hotel and restaurant reservations, unlock your car if you've locked the keys inside, send emergency or medical help and do a host of other tasks, for an installation charge of $995 and a fee of $22.95 a month.
Amenities included high-intensity-discharge headlamps; an optional dash-mounted CD changer; load-leveling suspension with on-board air compressor to inflate recreation equipment, and three 12-volt outlets to run power gadgets simultaneously.
Although the Envoy shares its clean, practical interior layout with several Chevrolet and GMC models, it has more and better wood trim and wonderfully comfortable leather-trimmed seats. Its on-road manners were exemplary -- the vehicle is quiet, smooth and good-handling. But it was a bit unwieldy off the road, bouncing far too much and refusing to track straight ahead over rough spots.
 
HONDA PASSPORT The Passport is a clone of the Isuzu Rodeo, made in Japan by Isuzu and finished to Honda's specifications, and both versions have been redesigned for 1998. One of the world's largest and most successful makers of medium-duty trucks, Isuzu builds its lighter trucks with guts and gusto.
While the Passport/Rodeo twins do not offer V8 engines, they have capable, civilized powertrains. A 3.2-liter, overhead-cam V6 turns out 205 horsepower; a dash-mounted selector switch turns on the part-time four-wheel-drive system and selects high or low range. The Passport can be had in either two- or four-wheel-drive versions, with a manual or automatic transmission, in either LX or fancy EX trim; the EX is also available with a leather interior package.
The Passport suspension combines torsion bars in the front with leaf springs at the rear. It is smooth on the highway and surprisingly comfortable off road, even on the desolate, bumpy Valley of the Gods Road.
I didn't care for the Passport's outside spare tire, mounted to a bar that must be swung away for access to the rear; the conservative Honda front-end styling (the Isuzu version looks much more aggressive and adventurous), and the fact that the rear seats will not fold all the way down to make a flat cargo floor. These quibbles aside, I found the Passport a solid performer.

LEXUS RX 300 This new sport utility is built on a modified platform from the front-drive ES 300 sedan, and it has a unit, or one-piece, body like a car -- not a body on a separate frame, like most trucks and sport utilities. The RX 300 comes in front- or all-wheel-drive versions, but unlike the other vehicles in this group, it has no low range for serious off-road work.
Hence, the Lexus was the least truck-like vehicle in this group. Designed to appeal particularly to women, it is more of a high-riding station wagon, for occasional off-road use, than a true sport utility. It has a very luxurious interior; a good, quiet ride on pavement, and a long list of appointments including side air bags, an air-filtration system and an optional six-disk CD changer.
The 3-liter, 220-horsepower V6 was smooth and quiet, like all Lexus engines; the rest of the powertrain was exemplary.
The RX 300 was comfortable and cozy, and the instruments were well done with the exception of a tan-on-blue information screen at the top of the dash. The screen's displays were ugly and clashed with the gauges. Their information -- like distance to empty and average mileage -- was skimpy, given the screen's size. An electronic compass would have served better.
The shifter console, which sticks out of the bottom of the dash instead of taking space between the seats, was a nice idea, except we collided with it every time we climbed in.
My biggest problem with the RX 300 was its appearance. The dinosaur-like grille -- complete with slanted bars as teeth -- and the overwrought multi-element headlamps and taillamps were just too much for me.

MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 Built in Tuscaloosa, Ala., the ML320 uses a 3.2-liter single-overhead-cam V6 with twin spark plugs, dual-channel fuel injection and a host of other high-technology ideas to meet strict emissions standards. It is the only compact sport utility with an independent rear suspension, which provides a pleasant, car-like ride on the road and enables either or both sides of the suspension to climb over rocks, trees and other obstacles off the road.
It has the only five-speed overdrive automatic transmission available on a sport utility, and its four-wheel-drive system is distinctive. Instead of using locking or viscous differentials, which are expensive, heavy and complex, the Mercedes has a lighter, cheaper open differential that sends torque in equal measure to all the wheels. It controls wheel slippage with the anti-lock brake system, which acts as a four-wheel traction control. The setup is simple, it keeps the price down, and it works wonderfully in most terrains and weather conditions.
Inside, the ML320 looks like every other Mercedes, with many of the same switches and controls; the same simple, sane instrument cluster, extremely comfortable heated leather seats, and some important safety equipment including standard side air bags in the front. The Mercedes decor was interrupted here and there by some cheap-looking trim items. (Then again, the ML320 starts at $34,000, so corners had to be cut somewhere.) A V8 version, the ML430, will be along later this year, but I found the V6 was adequate in all conditions.
In ranking these vehicles, I placed the Lexus RX 300 at the bottom. Aside from the styling, I found it too small and wimpy for rugged use. The Honda Passport came next, held down by a lack of power, despite its ideal size, great comfort, fine instruments and a reasonable price under $30,000. In the middle of the pack was the GMC Envoy, a truck I really enjoyed driving on the highway. But it seems expensive for what it offers, and it felt clumsy off the road.
I ranked the Durango second, for its looks, the way it covers distances and its ability to swallow cargo. And my overall favorite was the Mercedes. It has the most advanced technology; an economical, low-emission engine with guts; an interior that makes you feel you're riding in a tall E-class sedan, and plenty of usable room at a nice price.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Cincinnati Fund Looks No Farther Than Its Backyard

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
CINCINNATI'S dated nickname -- Queen of the West -- says a lot: it has been a long time since the city that invented air mail (by balloon), professional baseball and Ivory soap made waves as a driver of innovation and growth. In fact, Mark Twain remarked, "If the world would end, I would come to Cincinnati for everything happens here 10 years later."
So, if someone said, "I've got a great idea: give me some money, and I'll put it all in stocks of Cincinnati companies," few people would probably leap at the chance. And investment advisers say such a fund is probably not a good idea because the universe of potential investments is too limited. 
 Don't tell that to Cincinnati. Since Gateway Group, a fund manager based in the city, set up its Cincinnati fund in late 1994, investors who subscribed have done quite well even though J. Patrick Rogers, the fund's manager, is restricted to just more than 100 public companies that are based in or near Cincinnati or have significant operations there.
Mr. Rogers's neighborhood consists mostly of midcap companies, but it does include a few giants like Procter & Gamble. For the three years ended March 20, the Cincinnati fund's annualized rate of return was 29.3 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago.
That trailed the 32.7 percent return of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for the same period. But it fairly trounced the 25.7 percent return of the average fund in Morningstar's midcap blend category, which consists of funds that invest in medium capitalization stocks but are neither growth nor value oriented.
The Cincinnati fund earned five stars from Morningstar at the end of 1997, the highest such rating, but has lost a star since then because it gained just 9.8 percent during this year's strong rally, below its peers.
"We haven't really been tested by a major bear market, but our risk profile is surprisingly low for a fully invested fund," said Mr. Rogers, who has seen the fund's assets jump to $25 million from $4 million. "Cincinnati's history has left it with a very diversified economy."
The Cincinnati fund is part of a small but growing group of mutual funds that focus on different parts of the country, individual states and, in a few cases, metropolitan areas. At first glance, it seems to be the most narrowly targeted fund yet -- the only other metropolitan area boasting such a fund is Washington -- but direct comparisons are tricky.
"The key in looking at a regional fund is what kind of out have they given themselves," said William Rocco, who follows both international and regional funds for Morningstar. "Most, like Cincinnati, allow themselves to buy companies that have a significant presence even if they aren't headquartered there."
Thus, while the Cincinnati fund's biggest bets at the moment are all local -- including a grocer (Kroger), consumer products giant (P.& G.), phone company (Cincinnati Bell), electric utility (Cinergy), commuter airline (Comair) and publisher (E. W. Scripps) -- the portfolio also includes General Electric, which has an aircraft engine plant in the area, and Delta Air Lines, which uses the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport as a traffic hub.
The argument for regional funds is that their managers can get to know companies in their neighborhood more thoroughly and see values that outsiders overlook. "It might hold somewhat in areas like California, where there is so much high technology, but there can't really be that much of an edge these days with so many funds out there looking for opportunities," Mr. Rocco said. "Generally these things are long on marketing and short on raison d'etre. The problem is they are likely to attract the same people who already have a lot riding on the local economy in their jobs and homes."
Gateway, which manages about $700 million in all, does no marketing of the fund outside its hometown and very little in it, Mr. Rogers said. The fund grew out of local interest in the strong performance over several years of an index of local stocks Gateway published for its clients.
"We started this as a service to existing fund clients and have no plan to create a family of city funds," Mr. Rogers said. "It's a very narrow niche. We are not trying to be cute."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLATBUSH;
Food Co-op Ate Its Spinach, and Now Is Bursting Its Seams

BYLINE: By MARCIA BIEDERMAN 

 BODY:
Barry Smith, a founder of the Flatbush Food Co-op and its general manager for 21 years, remembers a time in the 1970's when New York had 20 food cooperatives. Some were small home-based buying clubs. Others operated in storefronts.
Then in the 80's, conventional grocery stores entered the health food arena, and most of the co-ops fell victim to their own distaste for competition. But the Flatbush Food Co-op used hardball business tactics -- reducing employees' pay and benefits, as well as benefits to members -- to stay afloat. 
 "It was a nightmare," Mr. Smith said, "but if we hadn't done that, we wouldn't be here."
Not only is the Flatbush Food Co-op still standing; it is bursting out of its 1,500 square feet of retail space on 1318 Cortelyou Road.
"We have no room to receive, to work, to sit," Mr. Smith said.
At the annual members' meeting, scheduled for next Sunday, the co-op's directors plan to broach the idea of expansion: either buying a larger store or opening an additional site.
From the outside, the co-op, which is open to the public, looks like a standard health food store. Nonmembers pay full price for its products, while its 1,400 dues-paying members get discounts ranging from 3 percent to 16 percent, depending on whether they contribute labor.
For the last five years, gross sales have grown about 12 percent annually, to a total of $2 million in 1997, Mr. Smith said. The number of shoppers, between 2,600 and 3,000 a week, has also increased, as has the average purchase, which is now between $18 and $20.
Yet Mr. Smith doubted that there would be a vote this year on whether to expand the co-op, though a special meeting could be called for that purpose. First, he said, members must be informed about the space crunch. And though he thinks that the co-op's growth will suffer if it fails to expand in the next few years, he supports the time-consuming process.
"Cooperative means you have to get the members on board," said Mr. Smith, who is 48 and a veteran of the war in Vietnam.
Mr. Smith and 10 other people founded the co-op in 1976 in the basement of a house he then shared in Midwood. By 1978, with 100 members, it operated out of a tiny storefront on East 16th Street. It opened to the public in 1980 and moved to its current location five years later.
Each move was controversial, Mr. Smith said, as he predicted opposition to any suggestions about leaving the economically and racially diverse neighborhood that is home to more than 80 percent of the co-op's shoppers. "We'd like to stay if we can expand," he said, but that might not be an option. The present space is rented, and the building is not for sale.
But he seemed confident that a decision would eventually be reached. Though many supermarkets sell organically grown food, he said, they have not drawn away co-op customers.
"If anything, it legitimizes what we've been doing for the last 20 years," he said. MARCIA BIEDERMAN

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Students Who Make the Grade and Make Money

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
FOR most college students, the chance to manage real money is as rare as a professor who never assigns homework. But then there is the University of Northern Colorado.
Each semester 12 seniors in a popular investment class there are given responsibility for managing more than $500,000 of the university's $37 million endowment. Letting students oversee endowment money is not a new idea; graduate business students sometimes do so. But the University of Northern Colorado, a 10,600-student state school in Greeley, is one of a few colleges that give undergraduates such authority. 
 And the students seem to have a grown-up awareness of the stakes. "We feel the responsibility 24 hours a day," said Adam Saenger, a senior.
Indeed, the students have done well. They started in 1992 with $200,000 from the University of Northern Colorado Foundation, which manages the endowment. The foundation gave $100,000 more in 1994, after the students' returns beat those of professional money managers with similar assets. From 1995 through 1997, the portfolio, which has stocks, bonds and cash, gained an average of 20 percent annually. And as of March 20, with no more infusions of foundation money and no expenditures, and with dividends reinvested, it was worth $546,700.
"The students have done consistently well," said Zona Felderman, vice president at the foundation.
Of course, the students have benefited from the long-kicking bull market. And they do not have completely free rein. The foundation sets a variety of conservative investment restrictions that apply to them and to its other money managers. The managers must avoid foreign stocks, high-yield bonds and bonds with less than a single-A rating, for example, and no holding can constitute more than 5 percent of assets.
The students also must keep much of their money in bonds, so they can learn about both fixed-income investments and portfolio diversification. As of March 20, stocks were 62 percent of the fund, cash was 6 percent and bonds were 32 percent.
"I won't let them get under 30 percent," chuckled John Clinebell, head of the university's finance department, about this relatively boring asset category.
For the first several weeks of the semester, the students develop a series of economic forecasts to guide them in allocating assets, apportioning their equity holdings among growth, value and income stocks and choosing industries to explore. Then they can, and do, invest, and along the way they learn to use tools like Reuters Instanet, Compustat and the Internet.
If the students who were interviewed are any indication, the class seems born to the business. For example, John Edwards, a senior, watched the defunct Financial News Network when he was in the eighth and ninth grades. And when the students met with U S West's pension managers in Denver recently -- they often travel -- they pined for the professionals' analytical tools, like access to real-time trading information.
"The grass is always greener on the other side," sighed Mr. Saenger, much as another student might hanker after a snazzy car. He hopes to work in mergers and acquisitions.
Other students spend weekends scrutinizing investments. "You have to push it away for a while because it becomes all-consuming," said Lori Barta, a senior who wants to go into corporate financial analysis.
This semester's crop of students have already made some moves with their stock holdings, which include Coca-Cola, I.B.M. and Staples.
In February, they sold half their 400 shares in Sun Microsystems to further diversify their computer holdings. (Along with health care, technology is heavily represented in the portfolio.) They used the money to buy 100 shares of Dell Computer, which has since risen 13.4 percent, to a split-adjusted $67.50.
The decision wasn't easy. The students wrestled with how they could invest in Dell, then trading at about 43 times its earnings per share, when Sun, a company they still liked, was trading at only 17 times earnings. But Sun's Unix operating system is facing a tough battle against Microsoft's NT, they reasoned, and Dell, in turning over its inventory in just seven days, should be able to continue to offer the latest technology and to be shielded from the price discounting common in computers.
In February, the students also sold 150 shares of Union Pacific. They had grown concerned that the retooling of the railroad in light of its 1996 merger with Southern Pacific would take longer than expected. The tip-off was a similar merger, in 1995, of the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe.
"It took Burlington two years to incorporate their acquisition, sort out their rail lines and get their logistics in order," said Mr. Edwards, who initiated the sale. "So, from a short-term perspective, we felt strongly that Union Pacific wasn't going to meet its projections."
The students may have acted just in time. On Friday, Union Pacific's stock, which they sold at $62 a share, closed at $55.25.
One of the students' riskiest moves was their recent purchase of 500 shares of Boston Chicken, at $8.125 each. Many analysts aren't optimistic about the company; indeed, its stock plummeted 82 percent last year. But the students, who have put less than 1 percent of their assets into the stock, thought the company's current revamping efforts made its stock an attractively priced turnaround play. They also noted that the company's insiders haven't flown the coop. On Friday, the stock closed at $5.5938.
Some of the students' choices have not panned out. Last fall, for example, they predicted that interest rates would rise. They then rejiggered their bond holdings to have more short-term debt, which earns less interest than longer-term investments but is also less subject to price drops when rates climb.
The theory was sound, but the facts did not cooperate: rates stayed low.
The students also face a temptation commonly seen among professional money managers -- seeking quick results.
"The hardest thing is to not focus on timing the market," said another senior, Jeff Hybiak. "We all want to look good when we go before the foundation's board at the end of the semester, but that can be hard when you're expected to follow a three-to- five-year investment time frame." (Students can spend more than one semester in the class, in which the grading is pass-fail and is determined by quality of analysis and class participation, not returns.)
The students are weighing other moves, including increasing their holdings of value stocks. Now, 60 percent of their equities are in growth, 20 percent in value and 20 percent in high-dividend securities.
And they are honing their investment skills. For example, they began setting target sale prices for their stocks after Bruce Wilson, their faculty adviser this semester, noticed they were unloading securities only after the price had declined.
"We've talked about improving the students' sell discipline," Mr. Wilson said. "Once a stock meets expectation, they need to see if the value is still there."
Still, for Mr. Wilson, a former assistant treasurer at U S West who is now retired, the class has been an eye-opener. "Frankly," he said, "I didn't expect the investment maturity that I ended up finding."

HEADLINE: Rough Sailing for South Street Seaport

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
THEY came by the thousands on that bright day in July 1983, eager to take part in the event: the opening of the Fulton Market Building, which was built above the still-operating Fulton Fish Market and was to be the centerpiece of the long-awaited rehabilitation of the South Street Seaport.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo quoted Walt Whitman. Mayor Edward I. Koch urged the crowd to have a bite at one of the market's dozens of food stalls. There were cheers as confetti rained down from gloriously sunny skies. Blue and orange balloons rose on breezes that flapped the sails of the tall ships anchored nearby. 
 What a difference 15 years can make.
Today, the four-story, 75,000-square-foot Fulton Market Building is nearly empty. At Pier 17, the nearby East River shopping mall that opened in 1985, one finds mostly chain stores like the Gap, Express and Sharper Image, along with souvenir shops and generic food court vendors.
Despite a city requirement that the Seaport promote businesses featuring "maritime and sea-related activities and products" in its various buildings, only the fish market, a seashell store and Captain Hook, a purveyor of maritime bric-a-brac, fit the bill. But Captain Hook will be leaving in December, after years of court battles with the Rouse Company, the developer of the Seaport.
Rouse says that the Seaport will get a face lift and that new stores will open in the Fulton Market. The South Street Seaport Museum, which occupies historic ships at the waterfront and a bunch of disconnected galleries, will finally build the headquarters it planned years ago.
But on late winter and early spring days -- admittedly not the Seaport's best season -- the place looks like a ghost town. Nearly a quarter of the retail area is vacant, though Rouse says roughly two-thirds of the empty spaces in the Fulton Market are leased.
"It's a shame," said Captain Hook's owner, Joe Hill, who opened his shop in the 1970's. "People come here for a seaport and what do they get? A shopping mall, just like they have at home."
Born of the dreams of waterfront preservationists, South Street Seaport was a revolutionary idea when it was conceived in the 1960's: urban renewal based on the restoration of landmark buildings.
"We saw the barren, windswept plazas that were being built downtown, and we knew we were racing the bulldozer," said Peter M. Stanford, who started a group called Friends of South Street in 1966 with his wife and a few friends and became the museum's first president in 1967.
Aided by influential people like Jakob Isbrandtsen, a wealthy shipowner who became chairman of the museum, they succeeded in getting the city to landmark an 11-block area just south of the Brooklyn Bridge and designate it for urban renewal, with the museum as the owner.
 
A Populist Vision For the Waterfront
 Their goal was simple. The Seaport was to be "for the people and about the working life of the waterfront," Mr. Stanford said. But Sol G. Atlas, a developer who owned much of Schermerhorn Row, a block of early 19th- century buildings on Fulton Street, sued to overturn the landmark designation. He withdrew his opposition only after a complex transfer of air rights that allowed him to build a skyscraper nearby. But the wrangling cost the museum and its backers millions, much of it borrowed from banks, Mr. Stanford said.
By 1973, he said, he and Mr. Isbrandtsen decided it would be best for the museum, and for the "public purpose" of the project, to return the land to the city and lease it back. But the museum board's focus had changed. When Mr. Stanford left the board in 1976, he said, it decided that commercial development of the Seaport should be carried out by a commercial developer.
Enter the Rouse Company. Fresh from its success at Boston's Fanueil Hall, a so-called urban festival marketplace that opened to great acclaim in 1976, and in the midst of developing Baltimore's Harborplace, Rouse, based in Maryland, proposed a similar project for the Seaport. It was supposed to pay for the restoration of the area and support the museum, which was still floundering financially.
Paul G. Harnett, the general manager of the Rouse subsidiary Seaport Marketplace, said revenue predictions at the time were high, enough to include millions of dollars annually for the museum. But those projections were never realized.
"The late 1970's and early 1980's were times of high inflation and high interest rates," said David L. Tripp, Rouse's director of investor relations. It also took longer than expected to get the Seaport going (Pier 17 was built over a subway tunnel, for example, and there were construction complications), and building costs mushroomed. "As a result," Mr. Tripp said, "a lot of expectations were not achieved."
And when Rouse finally opened Pier 17 in 1985, its location on the waterfront proved to be more of a draw than the landlocked Fulton Market, whose stores and food outlets soon began to lose customers to the new mall.
The financial structure by which Rouse, the city and the museum were supposed to prosper was one of interlocking leases and subleases. By the early 1990's, that structure had begun to crumble.
When Rouse arrived on the scene, the land and buildings the museum had returned to the city were leased back to the museum for a minimum base rent of $2.40 a square foot, plus a percentage of gross receipts from the marketplace. The lease was then assigned to the nonprofit South Street Seaport Corporation, whose members included the museum and which was formed to run the Seaport, including the fish market.
Rouse, which promised to invest at least $75 million, leased its space from the corporation under a complicated formula that essentially provided for a minimum rent of $3.50 a square foot or 15 percent of gross receipts, less expenses, whichever was greater.
The difference between what the museum paid in rent and what Rouse paid was supposed to cover the museum's needs. "But there was never enough revenue from the leases to fund the corporation's activities, let alone the museum's," said Peter Neill, president of the Seaport Museum since 1985. After various attempts to prop up the deal, the South Street Seaport Corporation eventually defaulted on its obligations, Mr. Neill said. And in 1996 the city took back the lease.
That left the museum to raise funds in the traditional manner, from donors and members. And it left Rouse a direct tenant of the city. But Rouse, still paying $3.50 a square foot though it was charging retail tenants $50 to $200 a square foot, seldom turned a profit, Mr. Tripp said. That, he said, is because "we have large interest expenses and administrative expenses for things like common charges, payroll, marketing and bad debt." And urban marketplaces, he added, typically cost far more to run than suburban malls.
A public company that owns dozens of urban and suburban shopping centers, including Baltimore's Harborplace, the Staten Island Mall and Paramus Park and Woodbridge Center in New Jersey, the Rouse Company had $933 million in total revenues and $181 million in earnings last year. The company would not provide figures for the Seaport, though the president of Rouse, Anthony Deering, said it had been profitable "for the last couple of years."
Though the amount of money the city receives in rent from Rouse is based in part on a percentage of gross revenues from its Seaport subsidiary, the Economic Development Corporation would not reveal revenue figures either, saying that Rouse should release that data.
Rouse says it invested more than $100 million in the initial development and construction of the Seaport, which cost more than $350 million to build. (About $61 million of that was Federal, state and city money.)
But the company lost what Mr. Tripp said was "a fair amount of money" on the Seaport in the late 1980's, and it wasn't only because of the 1987 stock market crash. The opening of the World Financial Center drew many people to the Hudson rather than the East River. And the upgrading of the mall at the World Trade Center in recent years may also have drawn business away.
To stem the tide of red ink, Rouse tried a little bit of everything. It replaced many food vendors in the Fulton Market building with chain stores like Doubleday, Sam Goody and Hoffritz. When that strategy failed to improve sales, Rouse cleared the building, leaving only two tenants.
But despite rumors that a so-called big box tenant like Warner Brothers would move in -- it has opened a Studio Store in the World Trade Center -- and an offer of the entire second floor to the Strand bookstore, the Fulton Market has been largely vacant for more than two years. Strand, a branch of the famed Greenwich Village store and a longtime tenant on Front Street, left the Seaport in 1996, moving up the block to the corner of Fulton and Gold Streets, where the store's manager, Stephen Maine, said it got a "much better deal."
All the while, Rouse and the museum have bickered, each blaming the other for not meeting expectations, and fighting about things like promotion and financing. A member of Community Board 1, Gary Fagin, recalled that at a public meeting a few years ago, the museum's president, Mr. Neill, and Rouse's former seaport manager, Joseph E. Ochs, got into a shouting match over docking space for historic ships. And Mr. Stanford, the museum's first president, remembers Rouse officials telling him in the late 1980's, as he put it, "We're waltzing with a corpse."
Charles Millard, the president of the Economic Development Corporation since 1996, confirmed the longstanding tension between the museum and Rouse. "It's not surprising that there would be mistrust," he said. "That always happens when people are operating under untenable numbers."
As the Seaport's two titans pointed fingers, tenants complained that promotional efforts were inadequate and that maintenance standards were sliding. (In a 1995 article in The New York Times, about one of the last remaining tenants in the Fulton Market, a reporter noted that "the women's rest room was dirty and smelly, the men's room putrid" and that the place "smelled faintly of sewage.")
Some merchants left voluntarily; others were evicted. Angry words were traded in many court proceedings. For example, in a bitterly contested bankruptcy filing, Burger Boys of Brooklyn, the last occupant of the Fulton Market food court, charged that Rouse was deliberately obstructing access to its premises and leaving tables dirty. Rouse denied the allegations.
Mr. Tripp, Rouse's director of investor relations, acknowledged that the company "tried to cut costs" where it could. But company officials deny that there were lapses in maintenance or promotion, and say they did not try to force out tenants in their efforts to remake the retail mix. They say that many disgruntled tenants, like Captain Hook's Mr. Hill, did not have their leases renewed because they did not meet sales requirements, and that others making claims against the company were drumming up excuses to justify not paying rent.
Moreover, despite the accusations made in lawsuits, tenants seem keen to stay when given the chance, according to Mr. Harnett, the general manager of Rouse's Seaport Marketplace. For example, he said, the principals of Burger Boys have settled their differences with Rouse and are involved in two new food businesses on Pier 17.
Though several food court merchants interviewed recently complained about what they said was deferred maintenance and lax promotion of the Seaport, they all refused to be identified, saying they feared retaliation. Yet there are also merchants who say they are happy with the management of the Seaport. Gerry Nally, who has been at Pier 17 since 1985, and now has two stores there selling watches and jewelry, said that though maintenance declined in the early 1990's, it has improved greatly.
"We're doing very well," he said. "Business was up 20 to 25 percent for the first two months of the year."
 
10 Million Visitors And Lots of Shopping
 The Seaport attracts 10 million visitors a year, according to Rouse. Yet many New Yorkers remain ambivalent about the place because they "disdain shopping malls instinctively," said Paul Goldstein, the district manager for Community Board 1, who lives nearby.
And there are those who think the combination of historic preservation, tourism and shopping was problematic from the outset.
"How much shopping can you do?" asked M. Christine Boyer, a professor in the architecture department at Princeton University who has studied the Seaport. "There's nothing special about attractions based on shopping." She pointed out that by the time South Street Seaport opened in 1983, stores occupied three-quarters of the space that was originally supposed to go to the museum.
Kent Barwick, former president of the Municipal Art Society and former chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, said the zoning laws of the 1960's, which placed few restrictions on construction downtown, were to some extent responsible for how the Seaport turned out. At the time, he said, developers were buying large tracts and planning to put up office buildings. That is what Sol G. Atlas had in mind for Schermerhorn Row. To save the buildings there, the museum bought neighboring properties at relatively high prices and in effect traded them for Schermerhorn Row.
But that kind of spending, Mr. Barwick said, could be made up only through more large-scale deals, like the one with Rouse. And Rouse, in turn, has needed chain stores to make its investment pay off, he said.
Kathryn Freed, the City Councilwoman whose district covers lower Manhattan, says she is not surprised that the Seaport has had difficulty finding its way.
"Of course, they were bound to have problems," Ms. Freed said. "New York is not Baltimore or Boston, and there are plenty of things to do here besides going to the Seaport. There has to be a reason to come."
But even at Harborplace, and especially at Fanueil Hall, both tourist magnets in cities far smaller than New York, similar problems have arisen. The downtown "festival marketplace" concept seems to have fallen out of fashion, and Rouse hasn't built one since 1988. More often than not, small local merchants at the older marketplaces have struggled as tastes in shopping have changed, and national chain stores, like Disney in Baltimore and Boston, have replaced them.
"A concept in retailing can only last so long," said Carl Weisbrod, former head of the Economic Development Corporation and the president of lower Manhattan's Business Improvement District, the Alliance for Downtown New York. "It's not in the slightest bit surprising that it should have to evolve."
That is little comfort to merchants who suffer from changing retail trends. Disgruntled tenants in Boston sued Rouse twice, first in the 1980's and again in 1995. The first suit ended when Rouse agreed to rebates of a few million dollars to its tenants, while the most recent suit, accusing the company of rent overcharges and management neglect, was withdrawn last November. Mr. Deering, the president of Rouse, said it was now undertaking "millions of dollars" worth of renovations.
Rouse is also planning to spend millions more in New York.
"A few years ago, we decided to take a hard look at our properties," Mr. Tripp said, commenting on the turmoil in Boston and the situation here. "We decided to upgrade and expand where it was worthwhile, and to get out of those where we didn't think the investment would pay over time." South Street Seaport, he said, was one of the places where Rouse decided to stick it out.
Not that Rouse really had all that much choice. In addition to the millions it spent on construction and upkeep over the years, there was also the $89.5 million mortgage it had taken to finance development, which it would have had to pay had it walked away from the project. Although Rouse was able to renegotiate the loan in 1995, and break it into two parts, payable sequentially, Mr. Tripp conceded that Rouse had to agree to invest in the Seaport as a condition of the refinancing. Had it not done so, and instead tried to sell or leave, he said, "We would have lost a lot of money."
Meanwhile, the city's take from South Street Seaport is still little more than the minimum rent, "something in the range of $1.5 million to $2 million a year," Mr. Millard said. Yet he said the city is satisfied with Rouse's stewardship of the Seaport.
"Sure, we'd like to see more rent and more and better market activity," Mr. Millard said. "But we believe they are fulfilling their lease obligations consistently with their ability to draw tenants."
Mr. Harnett is optimistic. "We have people lining up for every vacant space," he said. "But we want to choose the right tenant, and that can take time."
Of the roughly 277,000 square feet of retail space available once the Fulton Market building is reconfigured, Rouse says, a total of 23,900 square feet is empty with no tenant. Another 42,200 square feet is unoccupied but leased.
The Ark Restaurant chain, which owns the Sequoia restaurant at Pier 17, as well as such well-known places as Lutece and the Bryant Park Grill, plans to open a Southwestern-style restaurant this spring in the space formerly occupied by another restaurant, Gianni's.
And Mr. Harnett said he will announce the arrival of two big new tenants for the Fulton Market building in the next few weeks. He would not identify them, but there has been talk that a Crunch fitness center and a Barnes & Noble bookstore are moving in. Neither Crunch nor Barnes & Noble would comment.
Meanwhile, the museum has seen its efforts at refocusing pay off. "We had to go out and justify our existence as a cultural institution in New York," Mr. Neill said, "and we have." The museum now has around 450,000 visitors annually, he said, putting it just ahead of the United Nations as a city tourist attraction. Enough money has been raised for the central museum on the upper stories of Schermerhorn Row, and construction is scheduled to begin by the end of the year.
The museum and Rouse have agreed that visiting historic ships can dock on the south side of Pier 17, where they will be most visible to tourists. Last year, commercial ferries docked there, leaving the historic ships on the less noticeable north side of the pier. This year, all the boats, including ferries to Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium, will be sharing the space.
As well they should, Mr. Neill said. "Historically," he said, "the Seaport is all about the union of culture and commerce."
Yet if national trends are making the Seaport more like other shopping centers, can anything be done to give the commercial operations there the special maritime character promised in the original deal?
As Mr. Neill points out, when an Ann Taylor store replaces Sweet's, the old-fashioned seafood restaurant established in 1842, or when local merchants like the Caswell-Massey apothecary give way to stores selling Godiva chocolates and Guess jeans, the Seaport only moves further from the sea. All of that has taken place on Fulton Street over the last several years.
"People have always been drawn to the Seaport because it is real," he said. "Everyone's success here depends upon maintaining that historical authenticity."
Still, there are those who think there is virtually nothing real left of the Seaport. These include Joe Hill, who will be reluctantly closing his store at the end of the year and who sees the future of the Seaport as "desolate." Or Mr. Stanford, one of the first to imagine the possibilities of a revived Seaport.
"The commercial development is all trash," he said. "It's international airport-style junk."
 
UP CLOSE
Museum Looks Ahead
The South Street Seaport Museum has seen plenty of rough seas since its first president, Peter M. Stanford, his wife, Norma, and their friends met at a drugstore counter in 1967 and each contributed $1 to the cause.
At first, things went well. The museum won its battle to landmark the area south of the Brooklyn Bridge. It acquired ships -- the barque Peking, the fishing schooner Lettie G. Howard and the lightship Ambrose -- and docked them at Piers 15 and 16 near its headquarters on Fulton Street. And the public responded. At one time, the museum had some 25,000 members.
But by the mid-80's, it had lost its way as well as many of its donors and members, who now number about 4,000. Amid budget cuts and layoffs, ship maintenance was deferred, Pier 15 crumbled and had to be closed and the lights that shone on the ships at night were turned off because the museum, which gets no direct financing from the Rouse Company, the Seaport's commercial operator, couldn't afford to keep them on.
Today the museum is making a comeback, says its president, Peter Neill. The ships are being restored, and Pier 15 will be rebuilt, with help from a Federal grant. Sailing and educational programs draw more than 40,000 schoolchildren a year. Though its exhibit space is still scattered in several locations, consolidation along Schermerhorn Row, planned for next year, should do much to restore the museum's sense of identity, Mr. Neill said.

Why Not Look in the Gift Horse's Mouth?

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
WHO doesn't love it when department stores hand out mystery gifts? Shoppers searching for cologne or lipstick get the fun of a secret prize, a pretty box concealing a tote bag or an umbrella. Of course, no matter how nice the present, no reasonable person buys something they don't want so they can get a gift with a value they can't judge.
So, why is it the care used in purchasing toiletries sometimes gets tossed out the window when shopping for investments? 
 For an example, look at the SLH Corporation, based in Kansas City, Kan. Mostly, SLH is a real estate company that is unloading those assets and stashing the cash into investments like Treasury bonds.
That doesn't sound like a business that makes investors' pulses race. But, in addition, SLH offers a mystery gift: its 32 percent stake in a private company called Syntroleum. The energy company, based in Tulsa, Okla., has developed a technology to convert natural gas into liquid products like diesel fuel. And SLH is expecting to use all the money it raises from selling its real estate to promote Syntroleum, according to its annual filing.
Now, the folks at Syntroleum seem to be pretty smart and may have invented a better mousetrap. Oil companies are beating a path to their door, either to study their technology or to sign licensing agreements. And for good reason: Oil companies' reserve portfolios are stuffed with natural gas too far away from any market to be transported profitably. That means they can't even be booked as assets. But, if converted into transportable liquid, those finds would be transformed into cash.
Already, giants like ARCO and Marathon Oil have signed deals with the small company. And, in one of the biggest developments, Texaco signed an agreement with Syntroleum in December to pursue the first commercial gas-to-liquids plant.
Some market watchers are very impressed. "What we're talking about here is a technology that could more than double the world's total existing oil reserves," gushed the Oil & Energy Investment Report last July.
The developments have helped push the share price of SLH -- the only publicly available way of investing in Syntroleum -- through the roof. In the last 12 months, the stock has ballooned from $4.75 (adjusted for splits) to as high as $36.50, closing Friday at $26.25.
So what's the problem with all this?
Well, investors who snap up shares in SLH as a means of getting a stake in Syntroleum are essentially investing their money in guesswork. Because it is a private company, Syntroleum does not have to disclose the kinds of information -- quarterly profits and losses, terms of licensing agreements, outstanding litigation, risk factors -- that any smart investor needs to figure out a value for SLH's stake.
Instead, investors must settle for dribs and drabs of information that may raise questions without resolving them. For example, the most recent SLH quarterly report says little about Syntroleum, but it does say that in the company's second quarter, "losses reduced SLH's book value in Syntroleum to zero."
O.K., losses are expected at development-stage companies like Syntroleum. But the recent deals with oil companies must be producing big profits now, right?
Not yet. Randall Johnson, the chief financial officer of Syntroleum, said that the licensing agreements "have provided adequate cash flow for our operations." But none of that money can be booked into revenue yet because it is an advance on licensing payments that will only be made once new plants are running. And if the plants don't perform, the agreements "could call for us to refund cash" paid upfront, he said.
Some of the companies say they are paying little cash. "We basically are providing in-kind support, like people and equipment," Chris Gidez, a spokesman for Texaco, said of its licensing agreement.
And there are still hurdles to building the first plant. In testimony earlier this month at a Congressional hearing on diesel technology, Ronald J. Robinson, the president of Texaco Technologies, said that the original agreement provides for a feasibility study, with design and construction only beginning after that point. While Mr. Gidez said that does not mean Texaco will not be building the plant, for investors it's one more risk.
The testimony also disclosed some problems, such as lower fuel economy and poor lubrication for fuel-injector systems, that still must be overcome in order to use the Syntroleum process to make diesel fuel. Mr. Robinson said that the problems are not insurmountable, but that Texaco needs to address them "if synthetic diesel fuel is to become commercially successful."
What of all the hoopla about doubling the world's oil reserves?
Well, if investors happen to run into the folks at Syntroleum, they might take that forecast with a grain of salt.
"All the hype has been one of the problems that has plagued us, all these statements about making the Middle East unimportant," said John Ford, communications director at Syntroleum. "That is not going to happen. Not all that gas is going to be converted."
What does it all mean? For one, the folks at Syntroleum appear to be an admirable breed who will shoot down hype about their own prospects by calling it "hype." But like any company, Syntroleum has risk factors and other issues that have to be incorporated into any calculation of the value of SLH. Responsible investors can't just assume that the ultimate fair price for SLH is "more than I just paid for it."
The unconvinced should just ask Mr. Ford. "There is not enough information to establish a legitimate, bona fide value that you can document with dollars and cents," he said.
So what should investors do? Well, if they want an umbrella, wait until there's one for sale. Syntroleum has been mumbling since last year that it might go public. If it does, examine its disclosure statements, and if the price seems right, buy it. That's not only the smart way to shop. It also means that nobody gets stuck with anything -- from a case of lipsticks to a portfolio of real estate -- that they don't really want.

HEADLINE: South Africa's Bitter Pill for World's Drug Makers

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG

 BODY:
AMERICANS who need to visit a doctor here notice it right away: the price of the appointment is a pleasant surprise, far less than it would be in the United States. But the prescription afterward is a shock -- sometimes double the charge for the doctor's time.
The national Health Department says South Africans, most of whom live in poverty, pay some of the highest drug prices in the world. But its effort to force down prices has set off a pitched battle between the Health Minister -- a doctor and Zulu princess named Nkosazana Zuma -- and the powerful global pharmaceutical industry. The stakes are so high that President Clinton put the dispute on his agenda last week during a stop in South Africa on his six-nation African tour. 
 At issue is a new law that gives Dr. Zuma sweeping powers to open the country to cheap imports, encourage the use of generics and sharply curb the markups that pharmacists charge.
The law is crucial to the mission the new Government has assigned her: to turn inside out a health care system that has given high-quality care to whites while forcing most blacks to wait in crowded public hospitals or turn to traditional healers. Not only have prescription drugs consumed a huge portion of the public health budget, but half of all drugs in public hospitals are stolen, winding up in the high-priced private sector. At the hospitals, meantime, the cupboards are so bare that some provincial doctors said recently that they could no longer give AIDS patients expensive antibiotics for brain infections.
None of this, however, is why President Clinton cares about what has come to be known as the Zuma law. Rather, American pharmaceutical companies, which control nearly half of the $2 billion-a-year drug market here through subsidiaries, see it as a threat to their patent rights.
They say the law -- which was signed in December and is now tied up in a court battle over its enforcement -- seems to arm Dr. Zuma with the power to undo international patent protections and give anyone here she chooses the green light to make pirate versions of prescription drugs.
If the law is allowed to stand, the companies worry that other countries will follow suit. And why stop with drugs? American companies have billions in other intellectual property to protect -- from movies to music to software -- and the principles involved are essentially the same.
"If the Health Minister thought it was in the interest of public health that those $10,000 AIDS cocktails be cheaper, she could just rip off the patents and set up a factory in Cape Town to make them," said a Western diplomat who is fighting the law. "And if the Minister of Health says this is O.K., then the Minister of Education will be able to say, 'Well, affordable computers are in the interest of public education, but Windows is just too darn expensive, so we're going to buy knockoff copies.' "
The Health Ministry denies having any such designs, and insists that it is only trying to cut prices. "The minister has said constantly that we have no intention of abrogating patent rights," said Dr. Ian Roberts, a British consultant to Dr. Zuma who drafted the new law. "We respect the fact that they have an economic value."
On Thursday, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, visiting with Mr. Clinton, discussed the American objections to the law with Dr. Zuma. Both continue to disagree, a diplomat said, about the meaning of the section of the law that the pharmaceutical companies and the United States Government say they cannot live with.
In this battle, it is hard to spot the good guys -- or even a neutral player. There is no consumer lobby here, no Ralph Nader or Consumer Reports magazine, so patients are at the mercy of big business and big government. The local press has been lax, dutifully retyping the propaganda from both sides without explaining the issues to nervous readers. And there has been more than enough brinkmanship to go around.
Merck & Company, the New Jersey-based drug giant, has dropped a $10 million investment, openly blaming the new law. Britain's SmithKline-Beecham said it was rethinking expansion plans. Since the legislation was introduced last May, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pharmacia & Upjohn and Eli Lilly have all closed their South African factories. While they didn't openly blame the bill, the closures "were partly in response to uncertainty surrounding the legislation," acknowledged Mirryena Deeb, executive director of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of South Africa.
In Washington, 47 members of Congress recently signed a letter asking the United States trade representative to "pursue all appropriate action" against the law.
And an industry group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, lumping South Africa with Argentina and India as "global centers of patent piracy," asked the Commerce Department to put all three on Washington's highest-level list of countries that discriminate against American exports -- the first step toward imposing sanctions. (South Africa got off the list only two years ago, when the Government helped stop a Durban hamburger outlet from stealing the McDonald's name.)
The South African Government, on its side, is threatening to bypass the pharmaceutical companies and import cheaper drugs. If drugs don't get less expensive, Dr. Roberts said, Pretoria could up the ante by mandating the use of generics or even directly setting drug prices.
The battle is greatly affected by the quirky, stubborn personality of Dr. Zuma, whose husband is a power broker in the ruling African National Congress party. More important, Dr. Zuma enjoys the absolutely bulletproof support and affection of President Nelson Mandela.
The dispute is also bitter, and driven by deep suspicions. Virtually everyone interviewed quietly suggests -- off the record -- that the other side is hatching a plot. Some examples: The Health Ministry is the tool of a World Health Organization cabal that thinks patents on medicines are unethical -- or a tool of Indian pharmaceutical companies that want new markets for their pirate products. The A.N.C. health specialists are Marxists who want revenge on multinationals that evaded sanctions in the apartheid era. The American drug companies are being misled by their local subsidiaries, which have formed cozy cartels to keep profits up.
The two sides disagree even about whether medicines here are cheap or expensive, and they interpret the same words in the law differently. A great deal will depend on how Dr. Zuma enforces the law. That is, assuming it withstands a pending challenge in the courts here and a threatened one before the World Trade Organization, and that the Government doesn't bend to American and European pressure to amend it.
SOMETIMES maternal, sometimes shrill, Dr. Zuma is a human lightning rod beside whom even C. Everett Koop, the combative former United States Surgeon General, seems a milquetoast.
She is pro-abortion, which is not very controversial here, and anti-smoking, which is. Infuriating the big tobacco companies, she threatened to ban all cigarette ads. She is widely praised for building rural clinics and strengthening primary care. But her threats to close costly transplant units to pay for simpler needs like cataract surgery have angered surgeons, who still boast about Dr. Christian Barnard's pioneering heart transplant in 1967. Meanwhile, she has survived several scandals.
She threw away $3.3 million of public money on "Sarafina II," a flop sequel to the Broadway hit musical that offered an anti-AIDS message, then lied to Parliament about where the money had come from. To stop news leaks, she invoked an apartheid-era national security law.
Later, she invited a group of University of Pretoria researchers who claimed to have discovered a miracle cure for AIDS to bypass the Medicines Control Council, the local equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration, and bring some of their "cured" patients directly before the Cabinet to plead for funding. Medical experts were aghast when they discovered that human trials had been performed secretly -- especially when they learned that the compound, called Virodene P058, contained a poisonous solvent.
Dr. Zuma still defends Virodene. Her critics, she said recently, hate A.N.C. supporters. "If they had their way," she said, "we would all die of AIDS."
Yet her critics in the drug industry say she cuts off dialogue with them, reneges on promises and rammed her drug reform bill through a Parliamentary subcommittee full of A.N.C. allies. Dr. Roberts disagreed, noting there were six days of hearings -- "hardly ramming it through," he said.
President Mandela has angrily rejected repeated calls from newspapers and opposition politicians for Dr. Zuma's dismissal.
For her part, Dr. Zuma says she is misunderstood. "Sometimes when people talk about me, they refer to this power-hungry minister who wants to dictate to everybody," she said in a November interview with reporters from the country's largest newspaper chain. "Sometimes when I read the newspapers, I don't recognize myself."
And she denied simply targeting the drug companies. "My fight is for the people out there who need medicine," she said. "Government must also pay less so we can distribute the medicine to the poor. The fight with the multinationals is a consequence of the real fight."
BUT the two sides can't even agree on the dimensions of the problem.
The Government says that drugs here are exceedingly expensive. For example, the same drugs in pharmacies in next-door Zimbabwe are frequently half the price or less, because many are Zimbabwe-made generics. Prices in New York can also be cheaper. A tablet of Amoxicillin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, sells for 50 cents here, compared with 30 cents in New York and just 4 cents in Zimbabwe.
Dr. Roberts, the health ministry consultant, did his own study in 1996 of drug expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product. It showed South Africa as No. 2 in the world, after Portugal.
But the South African drug makers' association replies that public hospitals, which buy 80 percent of the nation's drugs, pay rock-bottom prices through competitive bidding. Its studies show public-sector prices equal to or below those obtained by international aid agencies. The problem, the drug makers say, has to do only with the other 20 percent of the drugs, earmarked for private pharmacies and "dispensing doctors."
These two views are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Nor is it the case that the high prices affect only the well-to-do. The poor are victims because the huge profits available in the private sector leach drugs off hospital shelves, forcing patients at times to do without or to pay more.
The drug makers blame the distributors for this situation. The drugstore industry has long had a cartel arrangement typical in South Africa -- wholesalers mark up about 21 percent and pharmacies mark up 50 percent more. (In the United States, the distribution chain typically marks prices up only 25 percent, pharmaceutical makers said.) Drugstores don't post prices and there are no discount chains.
Dr. Roberts calls the 50 percent markup a "perverse incentive" to sell the most expensive drug. The new law authorizes replacing the markup with dispensing fees that will result in the same modest profit on a cheap prescription as on a costly one.
But the most important change in the law is probably the simplest: Pharmacists must tell customers when a cheaper generic exists, and must sell that medicine unless the doctor or the patient forbids it. (As elsewhere in the world, 95 percent of the most commonly prescribed drugs here have generic equivalents.)
The law also forbids manufacturers from offering cash, vacations or other incentives to doctors who prescribe their drugs. And it requires doctors who sell drugs, often as a lucrative sideline, to get licenses to do so.
The figures are disputed, but some experts estimate that fewer than 20 percent of prescriptions here are for generics, compared with more than 50 percent in Britain and the United States.
Indeed, critics say the drug companies encourage fear of generics. Last June, in full-page newspaper ads showing a weeping baby under the headline "Health Warning! Remain Silent and the Unsafe Control of Medicine Could Cost You Forever," the local manufacturers' association described its opposition to the Zuma bill.
Although the ad said the association did not oppose high-quality generics, it contended that the bill would "ease the entry into established markets of counterfeit, fake, expired and harmful medicines."
Dr. Aslam K. Dasoo, policy director of the group that lobbies for South Africa's health insurers, called the ad campaign "one of the most inappropriate and bungling exercises I've seen -- it rings so hollow when they say they're defending the poor."
But Mrs. Deeb, executive director of the manufacturers' association, said she "completely rejects the notion that we used scare tactics." Unsafe imports are a real threat, she said, and she remains proud of the ad, which helped get the first draft of Dr. Zuma's bill withdrawn for rewriting.
FEARS, real or otherwise, are also at the center of the fighting over so-called parallel imports. Typically, a multinational company makes the same pills in several factories around the world, then designates which lots go to which countries, setting different prices in each. South Africa wants to buy a drug wherever it is cheapest. "That's free trade, isn't it?" said a World Health Organization doctor.
But the 1994 treaty on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which South Africa has signed, gives patent owners a "right of importation." The language is hazy, however. Patent owners say it lets them set prices in every country. The Government says manufacturers "exhaust" that right after selling to the first wholesaler. South Africa's law will test that theory.
The United States bars parallel imports, partly out of deference to patent holders and partly because the F.D.A. feels it could not analyze a potential flood of foreign fakes. Britain allows parallel imports, but only from within the European Community.
The Health Ministry says it is foolish to assume it will buy unsafe drugs, adding that it will insist on a paper trail proving the drugs are genuine. But detractors point to the Virodene mess and say Dr. Zuma has deliberately weakened the Medicines Control Council, which tests drugs for safety. In fact, the new law authorizes her to ignore its rulings. Just last week, a panel she picked recommended that the council be abolished, and the local press reported that its officials were being dismissed.
Moreover, the critics say, South Africa's border guards are unable to stanch the flow of illegal immigrants, cocaine, endangered species and even rustled cattle.
"How are they going to catch counterfeit drugs, or drugs that have expired and were supposed to be destroyed but were just repackaged?" asked Thomas Bombelles, spokesman for the American pharmaceutical makers lobby. "Or boxes that sat on a dock in the hot sun for eight weeks?"
TWO adorable 3-year-old orphans in the nursery at the Cotlands Baby Sanctuary and Hospice here drop their lunch bowls as a visitor enters to run and hug his knees. Like many HIV-positive children, they have swollen glands below their ears, but otherwise seem healthy and happy. Minutes later, the head nurse, Kathy Volkwyn, almost bursts into tears as she answers a whispered question. "Yes," she says, "these babies are probably all going to die."
For Cotlands, the cost of drugs is an enormous issue. The anti-AIDS cocktail that could keep the children alive costs an unthinkable $1,000 a month. Cotlands -- which by South African standards is quite good at fund-raising -- can barely pay the $40 a month it takes to treat each child's ear infections with Ciprobay, a patented antibiotic for which no generic exists.
"We have a hard time paying for milk and nappies," said Reva Goldsmith, the assistant director. "Many medicines become out of the question."
Dr. Zuma's law may bring at least some of those medicines within reach. But things could definitely get worse if the dispute with the big drug companies goes too far.
The companies are most upset at one scrap of a phrase in Paragraph 15C(a) of the law. "To protect the health of the public," it says, the Health Minister may approve the use of more affordable drugs, "notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained within the Patents Act," a reference to the 1978 Patents Act of South Africa, which binds the country to international patent protections.
Drug companies, members of Congress, the American ambassador here and some European governments have all told the South African Government that they think the paragraph abrogates all patent rights.
MR. ZUMA says it does not, but she adamantly refuses to change the wording. The Government's official position is that the provision only authorizes parallel imports. Parallel importing honors patents, even if it snubs the patent holder's right to control worldwide prices.
Feeling increasingly threatened, the drug makers are becoming increasingly threatening, openly hinting that they may refuse to sell here their future discoveries for treating AIDS or cancer.
Asked if the companies were literally threatening to let people die if the law stands, Mrs. Deeb, of the local manufacturers' association, hemmed a bit, then answered: "In so many words, yes. It's very clear -- when countries start tampering with patent rights, the new innovations aren't released there."
Drug makers shun India, she said, citing a hypertension drug that must be consumed immediately upon unwrapping, before sunlight begins to make it toxic. In India, she said, it is sold on the street in jars. "If they can't control how it's made and sold, they won't sell," she said. "They can't afford the liability lawsuits."
Asked if such harsh threats were really a wise tactic, she answered: "Health is a very emotive topic. When one party is totally unreasonable, the other becomes totally unreasonable. It becomes tit-for-tat. It's playground tactics, I'm afraid."

HEADLINE: Reason for Dramatic Drop In Crime Puzzles the Experts

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
Crime has declined dramatically for six years, but new studies prepared for a national conference of academic experts on crime suggest that criminologists are no closer now to understanding the reasons than when the downturn was first detected.
"The closer we look at the drop in crime, the more complex it gets," Eric Monkkonen, a professor of history at the University of California at Los Angeles, said in an interview before the conference, which took place in Chicago yesterday. 
 "It's like cancer," said Professor Monkkonen, an expert on the history of homicide in American cities. "The more we know, the more what looks like one problem becomes a series of problems."
The papers commissioned by the The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology at Northwestern University School of Law, restated most of the favorite explanations offered for the drop in crime: improved police tactics, more criminals behind bars, a better economy and a revulsion by young people in the nation's inner cities against the culture of drugs and guns that spawned much of the violence of the late 1980's.
There were some novel ideas suggested: that the decline in violence could be traced to a drop in alcohol consumption, or that the reduction reflects a return to greater social stability after the upheavals in politics, the economy and the family in the 1960's.
But there was no consensus on an explanation -- even as mayors and police commissioners across the country are taking credit for their falling crime rates.
"Our ultimate concern is policy," Professor Monkkonen said, "but now we see there can't be any one single policy" that resolves America's crime problem.
The policy problem is exacerbated because crime is local, with enormous variations in crime rates from city to city, and even from block to block. The reasons crime has declined in New York may be very different from why it has dropped in Los Angeles -- or why it has increased in some places, including Baton Rouge, La., and Indianapolis.
Nevertheless, several of the papers propounded what seems to be an increasingly dominant view among criminologists that there are multiple causes for the drop and that they center on a reversal of the dynamic that drove crime rates higher in the 1980's.
At the heart of this line of explanation is a recognition that what accounted for the sudden growth in homicide, with the advent of the crack cocaine epidemic in 1984, was a rise in murder by young people, most of it committed with handguns.
Homicides by adults age 25 and older actually have been declining since 1980, said Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie-Mellon University and Richard Rosenfeld of the University of Missouri at St. Louis.
"All of the increase in the level of homicide in the United States during the growth period of the late 1980's and early 1990's," they wrote, "was due to the trends in the younger ages, because homicide rates for those 25 years old and older did not go up."
Similarly, because murder by adults was already declining, the biggest reduction in homicides since 1991 has been by young people, Professors Blumstein and Rosenfeld said.
The experts regard the killings of four students and a teacher at a school in Jonesboro, Ark., as an indication that juvenile violence remains a troublesome issue, far higher than it was in 1984 before killings by young people made a sharp increase, even though the rate of juvenile violence has declined for three years.
The professors found that just as murders by juveniles using handguns increased more than 100 percent between 1985 and 1994, the drop in homicides by young people is almost entirely a result of fewer killings involving guns.
Because there have been two different trends -- the long-term decline in murder by adults, and the sudden increase and then drop in killings by juveniles -- there are different factors at work in each trend, Professor Blumstein said in an interview before the conference.
For adults, the crucial reasons are a decline in murder of spouses as American society has changed; a reduction in traditional barroom brawls as the neighborhood tavern has disappeared, and more people in prison, he said.
For young people, the causes appear to be a change in drug markets, as older, more established dealers have taken control, and the impact of new police tactics that focused on seizing guns from young people, Professor Blumstein said.
In a separate paper examining the drop in homicide in New York City, Jeffrey Fagan, a criminologist at Columbia University, and Franklin Zimring, the director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of California at Berkeley, found a further complexity -- a sharp divergence between the trends for murders committed with a gun and those without a gun.
From 1985 to 1992, in the middle of the crack epidemic, homicides without a gun began to decline steadily, dropping 35 percent, while murders with a gun doubled, they wrote. Since 1992, both rates have fallen.
The early and consistent drop in murders without a gun at least partly undercuts Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's claims that his use of tough police tactics is responsible for New York's decline in violence, the professors note, and it "remains a pleasant mystery that shrouds the whole explanation of variations in New York City homicide in fog."
One factor may be a change in behavior by young people themselves, said Richard Curtis, an associate professor of anthropology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. In a paper based on 10 years of observation of residents and drug dealers in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, he said that many young people there, frightened and sickened by the spate of drug deals, killings, arrests and epidemic of AIDS, had turned away from the violence of street life and found legitimate jobs starting in 1993.
Professor Curtis gives Mayor Giuliani's police little credit for this transformation, viewing their repeated sweeps through Bushwick and arrests of its residents as largely angering the young people. Left unsaid is what would have happened without such police pressure.
Still another theory was put forward by Gary LaFree, a sociologist at the University of New Mexico, who believes the decline in crime nationwide results from a return to stability, with people more confident in government, more affluent with an improved economy, and more settled as society has come to accept a variety of nontraditional family arrangements that began in the 1960's.
Particularly important, Professor LaFree suggested, is that more young people than ever before are in school, from pre-kindergarten to college, as schools have replaced many of the functions of the family.

HEADLINE: The World;
Singing the Cartel Blues

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN the glory days of OPEC a quarter-century ago, a decision to cut oil production and raise the price of the world's lifeblood commodity invariably shook markets around the globe. There would be endless speculation about what it all meant for Mideast peace, the North-South power games between the industrialized nations and the under-industrialized, America's inflation rates, Japan's growth prospects and the price of plastic garbage bags.
So last weekend, when Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and a non-OPEC nation -- Mexico -- announced in Riyadh that they would cut production to lift remarkably low oil prices, what happened? Surprisingly little. 
 The price of crude oil did jump, from about $13 a barrel to $16, which made it the biggest victory in years for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. But many analysts doubt the higher prices will hold in these days of oil glut. Wall Street shrugged. The question in the Middle East was not whether this would alter the balance of power between the Arabs and Israel, but whether Saudi Arabia, already running a $5 billion budget deficit, might now gin up the revenues for much-needed improvements in health care and education.
And while motorists across America may not be burning off 90-cents-a-gallon gasoline this summer (the price spotted last week at stations in the Washington suburbs), few economists predict that rising prices will choke off the nation's boom times.
"In the old days the question was low or high prices, and everything rode on those numbers," said Daniel Yergin, who has long chronicled the geopolitics of oil. "Now the question is low or very low prices."
The cartel, accustomed to power moves, has been forced to desperation moves, Mr. Yergin noted, as countries "try to readjust to the new realities of supply and demand."
Some of those realities are temporary, starting with the warming effects of El Nino and the industrial slowdown brought on by the Asian economic crisis. Others are far more long-lasting, chiefly the emergence of new oil producers that are using computer technology to dramatically reduce the cost of exploration, and drilling technology that reaches deeper, far more efficiently.
All this has changed the politics of oil considerably. During OPEC's heyday, starting with the 1973 oil embargo, the cartel controlled half the world's production, a statistic that turned King Faisal of Saudi Arabia into a one-man economic superpower. And respected economic opinion makers (and the Saudis) saw nothing but more price increases in the future. After all, oil is the ultimate scarce resource.
Twenty-five years later, the economics look different. Today OPEC commands about 40 percent of world production, about the same as the combined production of the United States, Russia and China. The OPEC-engineered price increases of the late 70's and early 80's brought in a host of new, more independent producers. And cheaper technology meant that almost everyone could play, with much of the new activity in the Atlantic Basin, from Angola to Colombia. The result is that the ratio of known global reserves to annual global production is now far higher than it was in the late 70's.
 
Market Forces
That doesn't mean the world's oil problems are over -- far from it. But it does mean that market forces rule. "The world is dramatically changed," said Robin West, chairman of the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington. "It is really transparent and efficient."
Just look at what has happened in the past year. First, the United Nations began letting the Iraqis produce again in small amounts, with the nation's output likely to increase if it fulfills the weapons inspections commitments it made last month. (The State Department said last week the initial inspections were going "very well.")
In November, OPEC raised its official production quota, because so many countries were cheating anyway. Bad timing: The Asian financial crisis hit at exactly the same moment, reducing demand in the world's fastest-growing energy market by half a million barrels a day.
Then came El Nino, everyone's favorite scapegoat, which further dampened demand during the winter. It got to the point where the world was running out of storage space for all the oil that was building up. Prices dropped 40 percent, to nearly their lowest level, when adjusted for inflation, since around the time OPEC came into existence.
Suddenly a lot of oil-producing countries looked vulnerable. Mexico feared that its recovery from the peso crisis of three years ago could be imperiled, which prompted it to take a leading role in pressing for last week's cutbacks. Russia, desperate for revenue (because it is incapable of collecting taxes), worried that the oil-price decline would hurt an economy that can barely stand the shocks of ordinary commerce.
 
A New Psychology
Indonesia, a longtime OPEC member, was counting on oil -- one of its few exports priced in dollars -- to bring in hard currency that could support its hemorrhaging currency. In fact, the budgetary assumptions behind the International Monetary Fund's rescue plan for Indonesia are being recalculated because of the collapse in oil prices.
Indonesia is symptomatic of the psychology of oil producers these days: While they are desperate to see prices go up, they are fearful of cutting production only to discover that the market is still glutted. "We do not want to reduce production to find out that other countries, especially those which do not adhere to quotas, are flooding the market and taking our valuable customers," Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister, Ali al-Naimi, said recently, sounding like a man whose job used to be a lot more fun.
Actually, Indonesia did a relatively good job of diversifying its economy -- a better job than most of the Persian Gulf states. Mr. West notes that the gulf nations have turned in some of the worst economic performances in the world over the past decade.
But the Suhartos and the Saudi ruling family still have a common problem. Easy money, which is what oil money used to be, bought what could pass for loyalty. It kept peace among the Saudi tribes and the distant Indonesia islands. But when the money evaporates, so can stability.
OPEC's days are certainly not over: markets swing to extremes, and when they do it accentuates perceptions of who is powerful and who is not. In the 70's, the Persian Gulf looked ready to inherit the world; in the 80's that title went to the oil-less Japanese, and these days, with the microprocessor the world's latest indispensable product, it's impossible to walk around Washington without hearing someone talk about how the rest of the globe is lining up behind the "American model" of capitalism.
Big revenue flows have a way of leading people to bold, if not always accurate, predictions.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Issues of Self-Interest;
Suddenly, Nonprofit Work Gets Profitable

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
THE idea that the private sector can teach the public sector a lot has wide appeal in this country. Peter Drucker and other management gurus have long argued that universities, hospitals, charities and governments could all benefit by becoming more efficient, more focused, more entrepreneurial -- in short, more businesslike.
But some executives of nonprofit organizations may be learning that lesson all too well. Some of them are now paid millions of dollars as part of their efforts to run affiliated and successful for-profit enterprises. As these groups rush to embrace the tenets of capitalism, virtue no longer seems to be its own reward. 
 Charities and other nonprofit organizations have become increasingly innovative in how they pay top people as a way to keep the "best and the brightest," according to Stacy Palmer, the managing editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy. An annual survey on nonprofit compensation by the chronicle shows the median compensation for a chief executive last year was nearly $200,000, although some made significantly more. Some of the groups pay a variety of bonuses.
Last week Minnesota Public Radio announced that its president, William H. Kling, who also runs its for-profit sister company, Greenspring, will receive $2.6 million as part of the sale of a for-profit catalogue business to Dayton Hudson Corporation for an estimated $120 million. Minnesota Public Radio plans to award another $4.7 million to other executives at Greenspring.
 
Incentives
 Also last week The Wall Street Journal reported on the lucrative compensation awarded to certain employees of Citizens Energy Corporation, a Boston nonprofit organization founded by Representative Joseph Kennedy 2d that also owns numerous for-profit ventures. Some of its employees, including the late Michael Kennedy, who ran the corporation, were given compensation and stock options worth millions of dollars.
"We're going to see more of this kind of compensation and these issues," said Sheila Fishman, an assistant attorney general for Minnesota, who investigated the relationship between Minnesota Public Radio and its for-profit businesses and the compensation for its for-profit executives.
The proponents of these innovative ventures tend to cast their efforts as a twist on capitalism, what Mr. Kling of Minnesota Public Radio called "social purpose capitalism." The idea is to use successful business ventures to finance charitable activities, like public radio programming or heat assistance for the poor.
The Greenspring Company contributed $40 million to Minnesota Public Radio over the last decade. Although Greenspring also owns radio commercial stations and a publishing division, its main business is the catalogue company, which sells a variety of wares, including some related to Garrison Keillor's program "A Prairie Home Companion." Citizens Energy, on the other hand, is not a charity or foundation, and relies solely on the money it makes from its for-profit ventures to finance its good works. It argues that it needs to compensate its executives competitively.
But when leaders of nonprofit groups earn such large sums, questions arise about whose interests are truly served. "Every additional dollar of wages paid was a dollar less that was paid to the charity," said Burton Weisbrod, a professor of economics at Northwestern University, who is the editor of a forthcoming book about the commercialization of nonprofit organizations.
At Minnesota Public Radio, Mr. Kling was not the only individual to make a substantial sum from the catalogue deal. Thomas J. Kigin, who serves as the general counsel for both the nonprofit and the for-profit sides, stands to make $1.4 million, and his wife, Donna Avery, who heads the catalogue business, is believed to be getting another $2.6 million.
The only protection against potential conflicts of interests, and self-enriching deals, is the nonprofit organization's board of directors. In the case of Minnesota Public Radio the board said it considered Mr. Kling's compensation just reward for building a thriving business. The state attorney general's office, while concerned about potential conflicts, concluded that the board had acted independently when developing its compensation plans. A spokeswoman for Citizens Energy, Jean Fleischman, said that its board consulted outside experts about issues of compensation, and is currently reviewing them.
Charity experts, however, warn that these boards really answer to no one. "You don't have the ultimate mechanism of accountability that shareholders bring you," explained Charles M. Elson, a professor of law at Stetson University. Shareholders can oust directors if they are not doing their job properly, he said, while no one, with the exception of regulators, can remove the directors of a nonprofit group.
Without such accountability, linking pay to performance can be problematic, especially since measuring the performance of a nonprofit organization can be difficult. Nonprofit group executives, especially if their main goal is to take home large pay packages, may focus on the wrong priorities. "The more involvement they have with these ancillary activities," Mr. Weisbrod said, "the more they lose sight of the mission" of the nonprofit side.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Spin Cycle;
Round and Round in the Search for Meaning

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
ALMOST from the moment the bullets stopped flying outside Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Ark., the explanations and analysis began whizzing by.
It was guns. It was the violent culture of the South. It was the violent culture of American media. It was bad parenting. It was the breakdown of the family caused by liberal politics or economic stress. It was violence against women. It was lax juvenile justice laws. 
 There was much that was true and valid in the instantaneous groping for meaning that followed the horrendous shooting incident in which two young boys are accused of killing four girls and one teacher, and wounding 10 others. But to many students of American culture, there can be something sadly diminished, and ultimately misleading, in the ritualized rush to instant judgment -- or the rush to instant spin and advocacy -- that now follows each cataclysmic lurch of the news cycle. And it is worth asking amid the flood of questions that the shootings leave in their wake whether the babble of interpreters provides insight or just sows more confusion and cynicism.
"Not only in the media but in the so-called helping services -- the shrinks and social workers and counselors and the proliferation of support groups -- we now have a mob of meaning makers and interpreters of why things happen," said Larry Rasmussen, a professor of social ethics at Union Theological Seminary in New York. "There was a time when the religious community was the locus for that, but now it happens all over the place. The question is whether that provides more clarity or whether something serious is lost amid all the verbiage."
There is, no doubt, something entirely natural and even valuable in the anguished analysis that events like the Jonesboro shootings set in motion.
In some ways, it helps fill an intrinsic need for coherence and meaning in the face of unfathomable events. In his book "News Values" (University of Chicago Press, 1996), Jack Fuller, the former publisher of The Chicago Tribune who is president of the Tribune Publishing Company, argues that at a time of information overload, making sense of events, rather than just reporting them, is an increasingly critical part of the journalistic franchise.
"It can be an invitation to be banal or insufferably preachy, but done well, people need to have some context, need to make sense of an event," Mr. Fuller said.
"The more profoundly resonant the event, the more people need to fit it somehow into an emotional or moral context."
But the profound resonance of the Jonesboro shootings has not always lent itself to equally profound responses. Antigun groups leaped on the incident as an occasion for activism and spin. "Our children's teddy bears are subject to more regulation than are the firearms causing this public health epidemic," said a spokesman for an antigun group sponsoring a day of protest May 2 on behalf of the 50,000 young victims of gun violence over the last 10 years.
On one of the television shows endlessly dissecting the event, Oliver L. North, the former Iran-Contra figure-turned-politician-turned-radio-personality, said it was "unconscionable" for gun-control advocates to try to make political hay out of the tragedy. Then he substituted his own spin, saying that as a life member of the N.R.A. and as someone who grew up "with a .22 rifle in one hand and a fishing rod in the other," the tragedy proved that the responsibility for raising kids rests with parents, not Federal, state or local governments.
It is a reminder how much of what passes for analysis is really little more than advocacy.
"Instead of just going there and yanking on the heart strings, we've now got armies of pundits ready to hold forth on a moment's notice with various simplistic notions of what just went down," said Mark Crispin Miller, who teaches courses on the media at New York University. "We don't use the word 'propaganda' much anymore, but the constant heavy drone of knowing voices out there is largely a chorus of propagandists talking at us."
 
The Long View
And while the Arkansas shootings struck many as an entirely appropriate vehicle for examining important issues, particularly gun use and violence, many of the pat explanations fell flat.
The South may in fact have more guns than the rest of the nation. But given that the legacy of guns and violence dates from colonial times, that does little to explain the recent rash of shootings in Jonesboro or Pearl, Miss., or Paducah, Ky.
And just as House Speaker Newt Gingrich drew much criticism with his pronouncements that Susan Smith killing her children in South Carolina or a gruesome killing in Chicago a few months later were arguments for electing Republicans, many observers said the search for quick meanings in complicated events can get in the way of the search for deeper ones.
"One thing religion has, which is not very popular in the media, is the long view of history," said Donald W. Shriver, president emeritus of Union Theological Seminary, who teaches a course on religion and the media at Columbia University. "Jews, Christians and Muslims rely on documents 2,000 and 3,000 years old, not on today's headlines. I wish news people were able more often to raise serious questions about the long-range meaning of events without trying to answer them. That would be a better contribution to moral and religious reflection than premature moralizing."
Others say that in the rush to instant judgment, it's not just the answers that fall short, it's also the questions.
 
It's Noisy Out There
June Jordan, a professor of African-American studies at the University of California at Berkeley, notes that the overall frame for the coverage in Jonesboro -- How could it happen in a nice small town like this? -- differs sharply from similar inner-city tragedies, where the context is often the inherent depravity of the urban environment and its inhabitants.
"So much of what we hear through the media, comes through such a racialized prism," Professor Jordan said.
Mr. Fuller and many journalists argue that the noise level of contemporary society is so high and the quantity of information so heavy that the question is not whether those in the media and elsewhere should struggle to make sense of it, but how well they do it.
"We need to make sense of things, but that doesn't give you a license to be simple minded or leap to cosmic conclusions based on virtually nonexistent facts," Mr. Fuller said. "The way to do this properly, and the way it's done by people who do it best, is to take a situation as it is, complete with the elements of uncertainty, and deal with it on that level. It's not to make sweeping generalizations based on trivial pieces."
It may well be that people are perfectly capable of sifting out what is spin and what is more important and seeing an episode like Jonesboro both as an occasion for valid -- even essential -- arguments about gun control and a case with broader dilemmas beyond knowing.
Many people are skeptical about putting concise meanings on very complex events. Thus, when asked the inevitable -- "Why?" -- Karen Curtner, the principal of Westside responded, "That is a hard question, and I don't think there is an answer out there that we are looking for."
This rush to quick judgment is unlikely to end. In a society addicted to fast food, E-mail and ever-faster computer chips, a demand for instant analysis seems inevitable, even logical. The real question is whether that coexists with a more questioning scrutiny that realizes the pat answers and spin are only part of a much bigger picture.
George Steiner, the literary critic and classicist, is one who is doubtful.
"I think the sound-bite mentality cheapens thought," he said. "Imagine Dostoyevsky. There are some incidents like this, two boys killing other children, in his famous diary. Imagine what Dostoyevsky would do with that. He would deal with the transcendentally important question of evil in the child. Today the editor would say 'Fyodor, tomorrow, please, your piece. Don't tell me you need 10 months for thinking. Fyodor, tomorrow.' "

HEADLINE: Puzzling Over Productivity

 BODY:
"America's Treadmill Economy" (March 8), Louis Uchitelle's article about productivity and the pressure on companies to increase quality as they fight to hang onto customers, drew a large response from readers. All the letters discuss -- and illustrate -- the divergence over what is or should be measured, and how.
 
To the Editor: 
 I understand that productivity, as it now is measured, well might increase if we did not keep adding hundreds of thousands of jobs each month. But I wonder how much better off our national economy would be if we had to support those extra millions of unemployed that otherwise would have accumulated over the last several years.
A more relevant measure of national productivity might be the constant dollar output per capita, whether a person is employed or not. This method would not provide a way to measure productivity industry by industry or company by company, but it would take into account the value society -- as opposed to social experts -- does or does not place on product improvements.
Another relevant point is documented in a study, "Where There Is Choice There Is Value," published by the Advertising Research Foundation in 1972. The study shows how product improvements in many industries over several decades have resulted in lower prices for the preceding product versions than would have been possible without the innovations -- thus making the earlier versions more affordable.
Also, the transfer of costs from production to marketing is not unproductive. Unconsumed products and services provide no value. The Soviet Union's failure to see this and its consequences for the living standard there should have taught us that.

All the letters discuss -- and illustrate -- the divergence over what is or should be measured, and how.
 
To the Editor: 
 The article uses Bureau of Labor Statistics figures to show that from 1975 to 1991 the average annual productivity growth rate shrank. But the figures for the 1990's simply cannot be believed. Even Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last year that the productivity figures were probably understated. Many economists think the error is +1 percent or more because of the way the bureau discounts the value of quality improvements.
In computers, cellular telephones and many other items, since 1990, prices are down while features and capabilities are way up. Also, warehouse clubs have had huge growth in the last two decades, bringing prices down by cutting usual retail margins. This gain in retailer productivity means big savings for millions of customers. I doubt that these gains in retailing productivity and consumer purchasing power are included in the statistics used.
Mr. Uchitelle seems concerned that some companies are spending more to give better services to retain customers and lure new ones, which he regards as economic waste. We in business call market share the core of American capitalism, a fight for survival and growth resulting in better products and services for less.

 The article comes hair-raisingly close to solving the puzzle of what caused the drop in productivity growth after 1973. It misses only because it makes the error of letting the how of productivity growth get tangled up with the why.
An employer who seriously wants to increase productivity can find many ways to do so. But what makes them seriously want to increase productivity? Economists intone the mantra, "Employers seek to minimize costs." In fact, employers raise productivity only when, and only to the extent that, they must. The compulsion that made productivity growth so much higher before 1973 than afterward came from wage pressures -- the fact that the spread between wage rises and price rises was much wider before 1973 than afterward, because workers had much more bargaining power. But the depression of 1974-75 fractured that bargaining power, and the depression of 1980-82 flattened it.

HEADLINE: Puzzling Over Productivity

 BODY:
"America's Treadmill Economy" (March 8), Louis Uchitelle's article about productivity and the pressure on companies to increase quality as they fight to hang onto customers, drew a large response from readers. All the letters discuss -- and illustrate -- the divergence over what is or should be measured, and how.
 
To the Editor: 
 When politically convenient, economic commentary has been all in a sweat lately about age bulges in demographics and about Consumer Price Index faults. But both have been critical to almost all measures of economic change for decades. They are of such particular importance to productivity indexes that it is remarkable to see them ignored in most discussions of productivity.
The flood of inexperienced young baby boomers into the work force, which reached a peak in the late 1970's, was a major brake on productivity gains. To this must be added increasing participation of women. When relatively recent entrants predominated among working women, productivity indexes were depressed. Subsequently, there were upward pressures on the measures from the increasing levels of experience of the female work force component.
And the faults of the current C.P.I., significant as they are, are extremely modest compared with the false exaggerations of inflation in the 1970's or inattention to effects on the changes in the index -- including measures of housing costs and consumer expenditures -- in the 1980's.

Is Your Rent Controlled?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
In more than 12 years of studying housing in New York, Douglas P. Hillstrom, the executive director of the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, has decided at least one thing. "Real estate in New York is totally insane," he said. But a Web site, he reasoned, might introduce some sanity.
Every year, the board sets the percentage that New York landlords can raise rents for the nearly 71,000 rent-controlled and nearly 1.1 million rent-stabilized apartments in the five boroughs.
(Rent control typically applies to apartments built before 1947, and rent stabilization to units built between 1947 and 1968, as well as others built under certain tax incentives. Landlords can raise rents of rent-controlled apartments up to 7.5 percent per year but often don't raise the rents at all.) 
 In May 1996, Mr. Hillstrom set up the board's Web site, Housing NYC, mainly to showcase the seven-member staff's housing research. But Mr. Hillstrom quickly found that a growing number of tenants seemed to be hungry for information, especially in the currently hot real estate market. He soon added features like a landlord-tenant guide and a search engine to sift through thousands of pages of reports. The site gets about 24,000 visits a week.
 
WHAT YOU SEE -- The average citywide monthly rent in 1996 was about $600, a surprise to anyone in the current market trying to find an apartment for less than $1,200. But holding down the average are large numbers of apartments that are government-subsidized and thus hard to qualify for, like Section 8 housing.
Surveys have found that only 40 percent of tenants in rent-stabilized units know that their apartments are rent-stabilized. So the Web site includes a handy list of every rent-stabilized building in New York, organized by ZIP code. One caution: an individual apartment may not be rent-stabilized even though most of the units in the building are.
Whether the rent is illegally high is another common question. To help answer it, the site offers a relatively easy-to-use tool called a "vacancy lease calculator." (It works best with the latest versions of Netscape and Internet Explorer browsers; earlier versions are slow or may crash.)
The rent calculator is especially useful because one consequence of last year's bruising fight in Albany to renew the city's rent laws is a relaxation of the point when regulation ceases. For example, if a $1,500-a-month one-bedroom apartment is vacated after eight years, and if the landlord installs a new $10,000 kitchen, and a few other factors apply, the rent could legally leap past $2,000, in which case stabilization would no longer apply.
Visitors to the site can also E-mail the staff. Mr. Hillstrom recalls a "particularly sad" message from a roommate who said he forgot to sign the lease. When the other roommate decided to move, the remaining roommate had no rights to the apartment. "In this hot market, if you're a roommate and you don't watch out, you could find yourself on the sidewalk," Mr. Hillstrom said.

THE ECONOMY
Corporate Profits Falter
Corporate profits fell 2.3 percent in the last quarter of 1997, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $483.7 billion, the Commerce Department reported, while the gross domestic product rose at a 3.7 percent annual rate -- less than the 3.9 percent reported earlier -- because consumer spending for services was less robust than first calculated. But numbers for February were far stronger. Sales of existing single-family homes rose 8.7 percent to a record annual rate of 4.75 million, and, excluding aircraft, orders for durable goods were up half a percentage point; over all, orders for big-ticket items fell 1.7 percent in February. 

MARKETS
Stocks Stumble; Rates Rise
The stock market, recently red-hot, chilled out, just as some in the media were gearing up to report on a 9,000 Dow. By late in the week, that milestone looked elusive, as the average ended at 8,796.08, down 110.35 from last week. One reason was earnings disappointments. Another was an upturn in the price of oil, which depressed airline and other transportion stocks. A third was a rise in interest rates and fear that the Fed would eventually push up rates to avert inflation. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended the week at 5.96 percent, up eight basis points.
 
WALL STREET
Heady Days for Big Firms
Enjoying some of the most favorable financial market conditions in years, Goldman, Sachs & Company, the last big investment banking partnership on Wall Street, reported a 13 percent gain in quarterly pretax earnings to a record $1.02 billion. Lehman Brothers Holdings reported an unexpectedly strong 30 percent rise in net income to $187 million, led by fees from advising on corporate mergers and other investment banking services. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company reported a 21 percent gain in net income to $691 million, or $1.10 a fully diluted share, 4 cents above analysts' estimates. But earnings on its Discover credit card business were down 21 percent, to $99 million.
 
PEOPLE
A New Chief at Intel
Andrew S. Grove, 61, left, will pass the chief executive's mantle at Intel to a well-groomed successor, Craig R. Barrett, the 58-year-old president, but will continue working full-time as chairman. Intel's microprocessors are the "brain" in more than 80 percent of the world's personal computers. . . . Roger A. Enrico, Pepsico's chairman and chief executive, is giving up his salary -- $900,000 last year -- to pay for scholarships for employees' children. . . . Time Warner granted its chairman, Gerald M. Levin, stock options that would allow him to collect $25.2 million in 2003. . . . Kim B. Edwards resigned as president and chief executive of Iomega, maker of the Zip disk drive, less than two weeks after the company warned that it expected a loss.
 
DEALS
U.S. Sues Lockheed
The Justice Department sued to block Lockheed Martin's purchase of Northrop Grumman, contending that merging the two military contractors could hurt innovation and undermine national security. Lockheed said it would fight the suit. . . . Arch Coal agreed to buy ARCO's domestic coal operations for about $1.14 billion. An ARCO deal with Beacon Group, a New York investment firm, collapsed recently . . . . Cendant agreed to buy National Parking of Britain for $1.34 billion, and, as expected, American Bankers Insurance Group for $3.1 billion. . . . Hilton Hotels and Circus Circus Enterprises called off merger talks that would have created the world's largest casino company. . . . Connecticut legislators defeated a bill that would have helped Echlin Inc., an auto parts maker based in the state, repel a hostile $3 billion bid from a smaller rival, the SPX Corporation.
 
PUBLISHING
Achtung! Lesen Sie Gut*
The largest English-language publisher of trade books would be neither English nor American, but German, if a blockbuster deal is completed. Bertelsmann A.G. agreed to buy Random House for an estimated $1.4 billion. Combining Random House with its Bantam Doubleday Dell division, Bertelsmann would have some 10 percent of the $21 billion American book market. The Newhouse family, which has owned Random House since 1980, appeared to be getting its businesses in order for the next generation. Some authors and agents were dismayed, fearing there would be less competition for books and less demand for literary works that lack best-seller potential, but Peter W. Olson, standing, chairman of Bertelsmann's North American book group, and Thomas Middelhoff, seated, the company's chief executive, were all smiles.

BANKING
A Blow to a Banking Bill
Investment banking and commercial banking have been separated in the United States since 1933, when the Glass-Steagall Act was passed as part of Depression-era measures aimed at eliminating abuses thought to be responsible for the nation's financial collapse. And if the powerful American Bankers Association has its way, they will stay separated. Although its member banks differ on the bill, the group announced its official opposition to the Republican-sponsored Financial Services Act of 1998, which would allow securities firms, insurance companies and commercial banks to merge and would expand the Federal Reserve's regulatory authority. The bill will go to the House floor for a vote on Tuesday.
 
TAXES
Overhauling the I.R.S.
The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, unveiled his long-awaited bill to rein in the I.R.S. and grant oversight authority to an independent board. His proposal goes further than a version passed by the House last year to prevent what critics say is widespread abuse of taxpayers by overzealous I.R.S. agents. Although the goal of overhauling the I.R.S. has wide support in Congress and the Administration, the bill faces a number of obstacles. For example, Senator Roth sees foregone revenue of $9.5 billion over 5 years and more than $20 billion over 10 years.
 
SPORTS
Investors Cry Foul
H. Wayne Huizenga, left, who owns three of South Florida's four professional sports teams -- the football Miami Dolphins, the baseball Florida Marlins and the hockey Florida Panthers -- insists that his baseball and hockey franchises are losing money. Still, he has found ways to profit. There is a cable television station, and he owns Pro Player Stadium, where the Marlins and the Dolphins play. And, in an original turn, he took the Panthers public and used the team's stock as currency to begin building another diversified enterprise. As a result, his original investment in Florida Panthers Holdings has nearly tripled in value, to $150 million. But investors -- unless they got in early -- have not done nearly so well, and shareholders have filed three class-action lawsuits.

HEADLINE: Dangerous Inertia in Japan

 BODY:
Japan is sinking ever deeper into economic stagnation and confusion of purpose. Every day brings fresh news of another anemic financial rescue effort or an embarrassing disclosure of corruption or suicide in elite circles, including the Finance Ministry. Yet Japan is not just another Asian country in trouble. With an economy twice as large as the rest of Asia's, Japan's health is crucial to recovery in the region and stability throughout the world. It cannot afford to muddle along.
At the core of Japan's problems is the Government's failure to cope with the staggering weight of more than $600 billion in what are euphemistically called "problem loans." Some experts believe the number to be higher, since Japanese financial institutions often hide liabilities off the books. In the "bubble economy" of a decade ago, when the value of real estate in Tokyo was greater than the wealth of many countries, too few experts realized that lending was based on endlessly rising land values, rather than on potential return. 
 When the economic downturn hit in the early 1990's, Japanese authorities did not force banks to insure that their loan portfolios reflected the real value of their assets. Instead, Japan cut interest rates nearly to zero to stimulate the economy, which led to even more lending. Much of the lending flowed to Asia, and to companies with corporate links to the lending banks. Reality caught up in the form of currency swings a few years ago, which made it hard for the Asian loans to be repaid.
A similar crisis of non-performing loans paralyzed the American savings and loan industry in the 1980's. In a model of what Japan needs to do, the American Government stepped in to force ailing thrifts to write off their bad loans. Many institutions were shut down or merged.
Japanese officials have begun moving in the same direction, but their efforts are ineffectual. The Government's $238 billion bank bailout, for example, is designed to use taxpayer money to raise the banks' capital strength, restore the confidence of depositors and ease the Japanese credit crunch. But the Government has been reluctant to demand more disclosure, mergers and shutdowns. Instead, it is doling money out as if its primary interest was to protect weak banks from embarrassment.
As for stimulating the economy, pump priming has a bad reputation in Japan. A spending spree a few years ago was widely discredited because of corruption. After hundreds of billions of dollars in deficit spending, the economy is still idling.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto is now reportedly preparing a new $124 billion spending program to stimulate the economy, though its timing and ingredients remain unclear. He needs to act quickly to get Japan back on its feet so that it does not try to export its way to prosperity, which would aggravate tensions with the United States. In fact, Japan needs to import more from Asian countries so they can solve their problems. Coming under outside pressure and criticism is uncomfortable for Japan. Yet if it is to live up to the world's expectations, it has no choice but to act more decisively.

HEADLINE: In Philadelphia Transit Talks, Uncertainty Rules

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, March 26

 BODY:
Despite its cherished reputation as the City of Brotherly Love, Philadelphia is accustomed to nasty labor disputes, and the latest one has been irritating people here for nearly two weeks.
The three-year contract between the city transit workers union and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority expired on March 15, touching off threats of yet another citywide strike and fears of widespread inconvenience throughout the region. The union workers, who drive and maintain city buses and subways, have walked off the job eight times in the last 23 years before reaching settlements. 
 With little progress after months of halting negotiations, union leaders say their 5,000 members are ready to strike again, even if it means the usual consequences of gridlock, scarce parking and irate commuters. The union is, perhaps, emboldened by history: as pressures mounted in previous disputes, the transit authority conceded on many vital issues, leaving union members feeling strong and victorious.
But this time, that could change.
Negotiators for the transit authority, which is known as Septa, have staked out a rigid bargaining position, a tactic that has become increasingly common among companies and governments around the country as rising costs are forcing them to do more with less.
Management negotiators here say they need fundamental changes in workplace rules to keep the nation's fifth-largest transit system, and one of the country's oldest, operating at peak efficiency. They cite decreasing Federal transportation subsidies and declining ridership -- down 5 percent since the last strike, 14 days in 1995 -- as major reasons to rewrite rules that, in some cases, have been on the books for more than 50 years.
David L. Cohen, the authority's chief labor strategist, offered an actual case as an example. A cashier booth at a subway station on the north side of the tracks was unusable one morning because of construction, and the cashier for the booth on the south side was absent.
"The logical thing for the supervisor to do was assign the north-side cashier to work in the booth on the south side," Mr. Cohen said. "But under terms of the contract, the north-side cashier was sent to a cashiers' lounge until the problem with the booth was fixed, and the empty booth was filled by calling in someone we had to pay overtime."
The management position reflects, in effect, the same tough stand that city labor negotiators, led by Mr. Cohen, took in 1992 when Philadelphia teetered on insolvency. By holding firm, the city won major concessions from its four municipal employees unions, initiating a new era of labor relations in a city where unions in government and private industry have historically been strong.
But officials of the transit union, Transport Workers Local 234, are not buying management's assertion that Septa is in financial trouble, with a projected accumulated deficit of $180 million by 2000.
Union officials argue that incidents like the one Mr. Cohen described rarely happen, and management is only using them to deflect attention from what they believe is the core issue of the dispute, Septa's desire to squeeze $15 million in savings out of workers' wages, pensions and benefits.
"They want to cut their operating costs at our expense," said Bruce Bodner, a union spokesman, hastening to add that the union would never accept such a demand, and management's failure to recognize that makes a strike "highly probable."
Or does it? Another sign of the changing dynamic in the workplace -- certainly here, if not across America -- is a growing perception that the union's willingness to keep working even during acrimonious, unproductive negotiations reflects the union's weak bargaining position and expectations that a strike would cost the system even more riders and, eventually, jobs.
As previous transit contracts expired here with no agreement, strikes began immediately, four times lasting more than a month. Now, union leaders have gone so far as to promise the riding public that members would not walk off the job once a workday began. Also, union officials say a strike is not likely before Septa's two contracts with suburban transit workers of local 234, about 320 people in all, expire early next month.
"To me, that indicates a softness in the union," said Clyde Summers, a professor of labor law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. "It also indicates that the union really doesn't want a strike."
In addition to negotiating a contract, representatives of Septa and the union are waging an aggressive public relations campaign. For weeks, each side has run advertisements and issued position papers.
Union leaders and outside labor experts cite Mr. Cohen's role in negotiations as the surest sign that management does not intend to bow to union demands. As chief of staff to Mayor Edward G. Rendell until last year, Mr. Cohen became the city's labor negotiator at a time when serious budget deficits were forcing city officials to cut back everywhere.
Mr. Rendell, who was re-elected to a second term in 1995, plays no formal role in the transit negotiations because Septa is a regional authority. He has told the union publicly, however, to "take the offer that's on the table," according to his spokesman, Kevin Feeley.
"For the union," said Arthur Shostak, a professor of industrial sociology at Drexel University, "Cohen is the dark shadow over these negotiations. He made his mark in the municipal strike, and to the transit union he is young, brash, arrogant and unyielding."
At a rousing, hourlong rally today in front of Septa's downtown offices, one of a half-dozen the union has held recently, Mr. Cohen was roundly criticized as a union-busting hired gun. With about 400 unionists from Local 234 and other industries cheering him on, Steve Brookens, the 234 president, attacked Mr. Cohen's bargaining position. He also said that the logical time to strike would be after the suburban contracts expired, but ever vigilant to public sentiment, he stopped short of saying when, or even if.
That kind of uncertainty has left many commuters uneasy and scrambling to line up alternative ways to get to work, like car pools, van services and regional light rail trains, which would not be affected by a transit strike.
In any case, with the regional economy improving and unemployment falling, few among the area's 425,000 daily bus and subway commuters have much sympathy for workers who earn as much as $40,000 a year.
Gilbert Sweinman Jr., a cab driver for 30 years, said he did not want a strike. "You know what that means? It means 100 million cars on the streets. Rush hour gets extended to 10:30, 11 o'clock. Besides, these people are making $20 an hour now. Is that chopped liver?"

HEADLINE: Dole, Still at Watergate, Plays Offense

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
After Republicans burglarized the Watergate in 1972, a hometown reporter sheepishly asked Senator Bob Dole whether he had hidden the break-in tools in his one-bedroom apartment in the complex. (He said he had not.)
Twenty-six years later, from the same first-floor apartment, Mr. Dole again finds himself a footnote in a scandal that has overtaken the White House. From Apartment 112, his new role is as a trader of gossip about sightings of the next-door neighbor in Apartment 114, Monica S. Lewinsky, the former White House intern who is alleged to have had a sexual relationship with President Clinton. 
 "I did see Monica, got a glimpse of her Saturday night," Mr. Dole reported, sparing no detail, including her forays to the pool. Speaking admiringly of her newly cultivated skills of dodging the press, he added, "She had some groceries and she found a way of getting to the Safeway and back without the press."
Mr. Dole's current platform is a far cry from that of two years ago when, as the Republican Presidential nominee, he tried to persuade Americans that Mr. Clinton did not have the moral fiber to deserve re-election.
"Where's the outrage?" he bellowed again and again in 1996.
These days, from his law offices in downtown Washington, his miniature schnauzer, Leader, a bit frail and suffering from vertigo but still yapping, the former Senate leader from Kansas says the answer has finally sunk in: there is no outrage.
"There was a survey after the election that over half the people that voted for Clinton didn't trust him," said Mr. Dole, who is 74. "Which didn't say much about me. That's the part I've never understood."
But this week, in his first interview since the Lewinsky scandal erupted two months ago, Mr. Dole, who as Republican Party chairman was one of President Richard M. Nixon's most outspoken defenders in the Watergate crisis, recalled the early days of that scandal and said it might be a matter of time before the accusations catch up to Mr. Clinton. He said the President's claim of executive privilege and reluctance to release documents could haunt Mr. Clinton, just as they did Mr. Nixon.
"It's not the sex," Mr. Dole said. "It's the pattern of all these different things: the stonewalling and all this stuff about not furnishing documents. It's a pattern that will eventually disturb people. It wasn't the burglary in the Watergate. That was our spin -- a 'third-rate burglary.' "
Mr. Dole recalled that Mr. Nixon carried 49 states in the 1972 election, five months after the break-in at the Democratic Party's headquarters in the Watergate office and apartment complex, and that "his numbers were pretty high" until the political tide began to turn by early 1973.
Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton have mended relations since the election; Mr. Clinton even awarded his former rival the Presidential Medal of Freedom and dispatched him to Bosnia.
"Do you sit around and say, 'I'm going to get that guy?' " Mr. Dole asked. "Spend my next four years going after Clinton? I wasn't defeated to be America's No. 1 critic of Bill Clinton."
But several times in the 90-minute interview, Mr. Dole could not stop himself from speaking out about a scandal that he said "feeds the cynicism that is out there -- not just about the White House but about politics."
Although Mr. Dole stopped short of calling Mr. Clinton a liar, he raised questions, through quips and barbs, about the President's veracity.
"I thought Willey was credible," Mr. Dole said of the interview of Kathleen E. Willey, one of the President's accusers, on the CBS News program "60 Minutes."
Mr. Dole also castigated women's groups that attacked Clarence Thomas at his confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court and Senator Bob Packwood as sexual predators but have remained relatively quiet about Mr. Clinton.
"Maybe Packwood should be reinstated," he said of the Oregon Republican who quit in 1995 after the Senate Ethics Committee voted unanimously to recommend that he be expelled over accusations that he had forced himself on women.
But Mr. Dole said he had no regrets that he did not delve even deeper into character questions in the 1996 Presidential campaign.
"That's a pretty dangerous line you walk there," he said. "It generally backfires when you go out and attack somebody personally."
Of Mr. Clinton, he said, "People said, 'He's married to the same woman -- that's more than Bob Dole can say.' "
Mr. Dole has run the circuit of late-night talk shows, and seems to be cultivating, with some success, an image as a wisecracking elder statesman who is not depressed about his loss. In fact, he still seems to be more bitter about his upset by George Bush in the New Hampshire primary in 1988 after defeating Mr. Bush in the Iowa caucuses.
"I must say, I still think more about 1988 and what happened in New Hampshire," Mr. Dole said. "I thought '88 was sort of my year, anyway."
As for what went wrong in 1996, Mr. Dole said, "You can sit down all day long and figure out what happened." He obviously has. He still complains about how Steve Forbes pounded him with commercials in the primaries, how "every ad showed me and Newt joined at the hip," and how Mr. Clinton outspent him in the general election.
So far, Mr. Dole said, Mr. Clinton has not been hindered by the scandal because "everything's rolling along" with the economy and there seems to be a feeling of "leave the guy alone -- he's not going to run again."
"He's been a photo-op President in the last several months, surrounded by children and some environmental scene," he said. "And that's all people need."
The former Republican standard-bearer did not restrict his criticism to Democrats. Trying, perhaps, to soften his reputation after his appeals to the right wing in his run for President, Mr. Dole spoke angrily of religious conservatives.
"What do these guys want?" he asked. Speaking of abortion, he said: "We keep getting caught in these one-issue things. They keep raising the bar. If you've got a 99 percent rating, well, then, somehow, you're flawed. I don't understand it."
Asked who might get the Republican Presidential nomination in 2000, Mr. Dole surprisingly mentioned two supporters of abortion rights: Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and Gov. George E. Pataki of New York. He said he did not know what his running mate, Jack F. Kemp, had in mind. And he has stopped pushing his wife, Elizabeth Hanford Dole.
"I can't say we've had any real serious discussions about it," Mr. Dole said. "I think she probably thinks about it -- she gets a lot of encouragement."
Though chipper, Mr. Dole seems to long for his old job on Capitol Hill. "I just miss being there," he said. "I like the back and forth and being in the eye of the storm."
But often these days, the eye of the storm seems to be back at the Watergate. He is thinking of expanding his own apartment by buying the apartment that Ms. Lewinsky and her mother are renting. "Haven't heard from my real estate guy," he said.
(For the record, Yah Lin Trie, Mr. Clinton's friend who is a central figure in the fund-raising scandal, is down the hall from the Doles, as is Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg of the Supreme Court.)
"I feel a bit sorry for her, trapped in that apartment," Mr. Dole said of Ms. Lewinsky. He said her lawyer, William H. Ginsburg, "had a TV addiction that didn't seem to be in her interest," unless "he has some strategy that normal lawyers hadn't thought of."
For all his interest, Mr. Dole said he did not linger every time he saw his famous neighbor. "I walk by fast," he said. "I don't want to be subpoenaed!"

HEADLINE: Allure of 'Titanic,' Minus Ice, Is Packing Cruise Ship Cabins

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
After they marry in September, Colleen Murphy of New York and John Brady of Parlin, N.J., had planned to fly to Fiji or Paris on their honeymoon. But about six weeks ago the young couple -- she is 27, he 32 -- saw "Titanic." They quickly changed their plans and booked their first cruise, a 12-day Mediterranean trip aboard the Norwegian Cruise Line's venerable Norway.
"It was such a romantic movie," Ms. Murphy said. "It made the idea of a cruise irresistible." 
 Romantic? Well, yes. But at a certain point, movie fans might recall, formal dinners and ballroom dancing gave way to a cinematic Armageddon of crashing chandeliers, flooded cabins and passengers plunging into the freezing water. And of the 2,200 passengers having that grand romantic time, more than 1,500 died.
No matter. For potential cruise passengers, the fictional love story is outshining the factual 1912 tragedy. Most big cruise lines report stronger-than-usual bookings this year, and while other factors are at play -- such as the strong economy and eight new cruise ships scheduled to ply the seas this year -- "Titanic" has clearly given the industry a lift. Holland America said its bookings were running 15 percent ahead of last year, and the Cruise Lines International Association, the marketing arm for most North American cruise lines, is projecting a 7 percent increase for 1998.
"Friends and neighbors who never, ever asked me how the industry was doing now want to know all about cruising," said Arthur Sbarsky, executive vice president of Norwegian Cruise Line.
The average age of cruise passengers has been falling steadily -- it is now 44, down from 56 a decade ago -- but because of the movie, there is a surge of interest from travelers in their 20's.
Heather Costa, 25, a student at Johnson & Wales University in Providence, R.I., was undecided about where to spend spring break this year until she saw "Titanic" -- then took a five-day Caribbean tour from Miami aboard the Carnival Ecstasy.
"About six of us," she said, "wanted to get to the front of the ship so we could 'fly' " -- mimicking the actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. But "we never could get to it," a disappointed Ms. Costa said. Passengers are not permitted at the bow on most cruise ships, an area laden with ropes, winches and cranes.
Not that cruise fans are oblivious to safety. The question most often asked, said Diane Hockensmith of the Cruise Shop in Fort Wayne, Ind., is, "Are there enough lifeboats?" Gerry O'Brien of Cherry Hill, N.J., who with her husband, Mike, will be making her maiden voyage this summer, to Alaska on the Princess Cruises' Sun Princess, made no bones about it. "The first thing I'm going to do when I get aboard," she said, "is count the lifeboats." But she also saw and enjoyed the movie.
Not everybody enjoyed the movie. Jessica Miller, 27, of Philadelphia, who works for a travel management company, said: "As I was sitting in the theater watching the Titanic go down, I was thinking, I will never, ever take a cruise as long as I live." In fact, she and her fiance, John Cassady, plan to fly to Hawaii on their honeymoon in September.
While many bookings inspired by "Titanic" are to warm-weather climes, passengers seem to have no apprehension about crossing the North Atlantic, where the supposedly unsinkable Titanic had its fateful encounter with the iceberg. On the contrary, the QE2's first three crossings of the North Atlantic this year, beginning April 15, are sold out, and bookings are strong for the other 16. Peter Bates, a spokesman for Cunard, which bought the White Star Line, the Titanic's owner, in 1934, said the movie had undoubtedly enhanced the popularity of the QE2's crossings.
In addition, the Cunard Web site, which was averaging 110,000 hits a month, recorded 963,000 hits in December, when the "Titanic" hype began in force, and a half-million more over the next two months. "To spike that way," said JoNell Modys of Cunard, "something unusual had to have been happening."
It was. Still, the new popularity of cruises caught some people off guard. "The cruise industry was very concerned about the movie at first," said Capt. James Garrett, a Coast Guard safety official. "But they found it very effective P.R."
It clearly worked on Carole Jaquis. "What a movie," she said. "That love story and all those priceless artifacts on the ship." She and her husband, Tom, who own a moving company in St. Petersburg, Fla., had planned to spend their vacation with relatives in Lake Placid, N.Y. -- until they saw the movie. Now they are booked for their first cruise, 14 nights from Barcelona to Miami aboard the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's Splendour of the Seas.
Today's cruise ships, of course, cannot match the opulence of the Titanic, making some industry officials worry that newcomers might be disappointed. New, ultramodern ships do have soaring atriums, deluxe spas and theaters bigger than some on Broadway -- but not the extensive rich wood, crystal, fine china and well-appointed drawing rooms of Hollywood's version.
That opulence was costly: a first-class ticket on the Titanic cost $4,350, or $87,000 in today's dollars, according to the American Society of Travel Agents. Third-class passengers, the ones who found gates between them and the lifeboats, paid $30, or about $600 in current dollars.
The eight new ships scheduled to join the industry fleet this year include the first two Disney ships and the 2,600-passenger Grand Princess of Princess Cruises, whose 17 decks will rise 28 feet higher than Niagara Falls -- and whose $450 million price tag is 60 times the $7.5 million cost of the original Titanic. (Even adjusted for inflation, it is three times the cost.)
But the surprise factor is cruising's unexpected lift from a movie that ends with a veritable sea of floating bodies and the "unsinkable" pride of the White Star Line at the bottom of the ocean, broken in two.
"I don't think anybody in the industry anticipated the movie would be this great for the cruise business," said Tom Jackson, owner of the World Travel Bureau in Santa Ana, Calif. "In fact, a lot of people were holding their breath, expecting the worst. But because it romanticized cruising, people are not hung up on the tragedy."
Mr. Jackson is one of almost two dozen travel agents in more than a dozen states who said "Titanic" had helped increase their bookings.
"We're having the best year in our history," said Vicky Cannavale, owner of Cruise Shops Travel in Albuquerque, N.M. "In the first three months of this year, with that big help from the movie, we've sold as many cruises as we sold in six months last year."
"Crazy as it sounds, we're getting bookings for cruises all over," said Dottie Baum, a travel agent at Ahoy Cruise and Travel in Egg Harbor Township, N.J. "People like all the elegance in the movie, and they figure the tragedy was years ago and couldn't happen again."
Captain Garrett of the Coast Guard would not go quite that far. "But I'm impressed with the advances in safety of cruise ships," he said, ticking off a half-dozen safety features that did not exist 86 years ago. They include radar, fire alarms and sprinklers, better-trained crews and land-based computers that can detect water leaks aboard ships at sea.
And icebergs are of scant concern -- not because those mountains of ice have been rendered harmless, but because they are detectable by radar, and the few cruise ships that venture anywhere near them give them wide berth.
Fourteen percent of agents surveyed by the American Society of Travel Agents said the movie resulted in greater consumer interest in cruises, while only 1 percent said the movie made clients less interested.
Only after the Titanic disaster were cruise ships required to carry enough lifeboats and inflatable life rafts for every passenger on board. The Sun Princess, for example, which can carry 3,196 passengers and crew, carries lifeboats and life rafts for 3,996 people. Life rafts aboard cruise ships, incidentally, can hold up to 100 people. They also carry provisions and a radio, and are supposedly impervious to tipping over in high seas.
Some things, however, have not changed since 1912. In keeping with the "women and children first" tradition, some cruise lines -- including Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line -- request that men stand behind the women and children during the evacuation drill.
But tradition is apparently all that keeps that custom alive. "We've looked to see where it says women and children first," Captain Garrett said, "and we can't find it anywhere in maritime law."

Students in Quiet Town Discounted Boys' Threats
Jonesboro, Ark., is a conservative, pious, family-oriented town. But the two boys accused of fatally shooting five people and injuring 10 others at a school there last week seemed not to fit in at school. One of the boys appeared to have recently become aggressive and both were overheard by students on their school bus making plans to kill someone. 1
 
Incumbents Keep the Edge
As Republicans struggle to retain the narrowest House majority held by any party in the last half-century, they may benefit in this year's midterm elections from incumbents' high popularity ratings, the sturdy economy and a dearth of contentious issues, leaving many challengers with no foothold. 1
 
Drop in Crime is Puzzling
Crime has declined dramatically for six years, but new studies prepared for a national conference of academic experts on crime suggest that criminologists are no closer now to understanding the reasons than when the downturn was first detected. "The closer we look at the drop in crime, the more complex it gets," said Eric Monkkonen, a professor of history at the University of California at Los Angeles. 16
 
Philadelphia Labor Dispute
Despite its cherished reputation as the City of Brotherly Love, Philadelphia is accustomed to nasty labor disputes, and the latest one has been irritating people here for nearly two weeks.

HEADLINE: Ray Scott, 78, Voice of Packers During Glory Seasons in the 60's

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, March 24

 BODY:
Ray Scott, the voice of the Green Bay Packers during their dynasty years of the 1960's, died on Monday at a Minneapolis hospital after a long illness. He was 78.
Scott's resonating voice became synonymous with the National Football League as its television popularity exploded in the 60's. He was the voice of the Packers from 1956 to 1967. 
 He was paired with a young Pat Summerall as CBS's No. 1 announcing team after the N.F.L. merged with the American Football League, and he broadcast four Super Bowls, including the first A.F.L.-N.F.L. title game in 1967.
After being dismissed by CBS in 1974, Scott did play-by-play for numerous teams, including the Minnesota Twins and Vikings, Penn State, the Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
He also anchored coverage of major bowl games, golf tournaments, National Collegiate Athletic Association and National Invitation Tournament basketball, and baseball's World Series.
He was host of a nationally syndicated radio show until illness forced his retirement in 1997.
Scott, a western Pennsylvania native, was known for his economy of words.
"There was a highly respected high school coach there by the name of Pop Wenreich," Scott said in a 1996 interview with The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
"He said: 'Ray, don't insult my intelligence when you broadcast a game. Tell me something I can't see.' I've never forgotten that.
"My philosophy has always been let the action speak for itself. It doesn't need me getting in the way."
He was voted by his peers as the national sportscaster of the year in 1968 and 1971. Scott was elected to the National Sportswriters and Sportscasters Hall of Fame in 1982, and named sportscaster of the year 12 times in Minnesota, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
In the last seven years, Scott had a triple bypass, a kidney transplant, knee surgery, two hip replacements and prostate cancer, said Sarah Janacek, his daughter-in-law.
Scott, who lived in Edina, Minn., is survived by his wife, Bonnie, and four sons and a daughter from a previous marriage.

HEADLINE: Report Points to Next Battle at CUNY

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
In yet another attack on the embattled City University of New York, a new study charges that most of CUNY's senior colleges are denying their students a proper academic grounding by not requiring core courses in basic areas like mathematics, science, history and literature.
The report by two conservative interest groups, the Empire Foundation for Policy Research and the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, seems likely to turn curriculum into one more battleground at the university, as it grapples with criticisms that its standards are too low in other areas like remedial education, grade inflation and graduation rates. 
 While Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Herman Badillo, the vice chairman of the board of the university, embraced the report, CUNY officials and some educators outside the university immediately denounced it, calling it a polemical document whose conclusions about the necessity of core curriculums were baseless.
Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Badillo said the report was valuable and that it offered one more illustration of the university's failure to set appropriate standards.
"This creates a new credibility gap for CUNY that requires our attention," Mr. Badillo said. "If and when we deal with remediation and grade inflation, then we will have to cover curriculum next."
And Mayor Giuliani, in a statement accompanying the report, said that "to become a first-class university system," CUNY must make sure that all students learn about math, science, history and many other core subjects before granting them diplomas. Other necessary steps, he said, include ending remedial education and taking attendance every day.
But in a memorandum to CUNY presidents on Friday, Louise Mirrer, CUNY's vice chancellor for academic affairs, said the report contained "inaccuracies and misrepresentations, both in the presentation of data and in the general discussion, that lead to erroneous conclusions about the core curricula of CUNY's colleges."
Matthew Goldstein, the president of Baruch College, considered one of CUNY's strongest colleges, also dismissed the report's criticisms. "To say a university doesn't have standards because it doesn't require every student to take economics or philosophy is ludicrous," he said in an interview. "That's a big jump to make, to say that not requiring certain courses shows a lack of quality."
Some educators outside the university also challenged the report, calling it a political document based on a model of education that only 10 percent or fewer of American colleges employ.
Arthur Levine, president of Columbia Teachers College, a strong proponent of a required core, called the report a "political polemic" that was entirely arbitrary in the courses it held out as standards. Besides calling for mathematics, history, literature, composition and two courses in basic science, the report also said all students should take economics, philosophy, art and three years of a foreign language.
"Why is economics more important than politics or sociology or psychology, and why is there no technology on their list?" he asked. "Moreover, not having looked at the content of the courses, how could they evaluate the quality?"
Mr. Levine also said that by the standards of the authors, CUNY should have been applauded, since two out of the nine colleges, or 22 percent, had clearly established core curriculums, putting it well above the national average of about 10 percent.
The study gave high marks to only two colleges, Brooklyn and City, saying that they required students to take classes in most of the areas it deemed important. It said two others, York and Medgar Evers, had appropriate requirements in about half of the areas it considered important.
The study criticized the remaining colleges (Baruch, Hunter, Lehman, Queens and Staten Island) for giving their students such latitude that they could avoid courses in important areas like math or science or take courses that did not provide a broad, basic grounding in areas like history or literature.
"Allowing students to graduate with gaping holes in their preparation does a particular disservice to those students for whom a college education is a route to upward mobility," the authors said.
The idea that colleges should have a clearly defined core of learning that all students share is one that falls in and out of favor, Mr. Levine said, adding that while 3 percent of colleges impose no requirements at all, most of the rest have a menu approach in which they designate broad curricular areas, like the sciences or the arts, and let students choose what courses to take within those areas.
English composition was the only area where all nine colleges met the report's approval. The only areas where all nine colleges were deemed to fall short were economics -- none require it -- and foreign languages.
Other fields were more mixed. In mathematics, the report said that all of the colleges but City, Hunter and Queens had appropriate requirements. In philosophy, only Brooklyn and City met its standard for a required survey course. In the arts, Brooklyn, City and Medgar Evers were the only ones requiring a broad survey course. And in literature, the report approved of the requirements at Brooklyn, City, Medgar Evers and York.
In the sciences, Lehman, Queens and Staten Island all fell short. And in history, the report said that only Brooklyn, City, Medgar Evers and Staten Island had appropriately broad survey requirements.

HEADLINE: Candidate Scores an Upset In Straw Poll for Governor

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ITHACA, N.Y., March 28

 BODY:
A vote today by upstate Democratic leaders further muddied the race for the Democratic nomination for governor as Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, the front-runner in the polls, did poorly, and a little-known former state official, James L. Larocca, ran away with the contest.
At a convention here of the Democratic Rural Conference, the balloting in the United States Senate race produced a mild surprise, with Mark J. Green, the Public Advocate for New York City, besting former United States Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, by far the best-known candidate. Representative Charles E. Schumer had pulled out of the straw poll, anticipating a poor showing. 
 Mr. Larocca, who has worked for more than a year courting upstate Democrats, and Ms. McCaughey Ross, the best-known Democrat running for governor, were widely expected to fare best in the straw poll of county leaders and state party committee members from 41 counties. But Mr. Larocca gained more than twice as many votes as the Lieutenant Governor, leaving her a distant second, barely ahead of the Speaker for the New York City Council, Peter F. Vallone, who has barely begun to campaign upstate.
Mr. Larocca, a former state energy and transportation commissioner, got 56 votes, to 27 for Ms. McCaughey Ross, 24 for Mr. Vallone, 17 for Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, and 3 for Richard A. Kahan, former chairman of the state's Urban Development Corporation.
The results bode well for Mr. Larocca's chances of clearing the first significant hurdle of the campaign: winning an automatic place on the primary ballot by getting 25 percent of the delegates' votes at the state party convention in May. Many of the people casting ballots here today will be among those delegates. Candidates who fail to reach the 25 percent threshold have to collect tens of thousands of signatures to get on the ballot, and this process is expensive and difficult.
Although the counties represented here today, in an area stretching from the Hudson Valley to Lake Erie, account for just one-sixth of the statewide vote, candidates saw the poll as an important test of strength. All the Democratic contenders for governor, United States Senate and state attorney general attended and made speeches, and most spoke about the weak upstate economy.
Democrats are acutely aware that Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, won in 1994 by outpolling Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat, upstate nearly three to one. "In order to win statewide, we have to do better in these counties," said Michael Schell, the Jefferson County Democratic chairman, an organizer of the event.
Ms. McCaughey Ross, a Republican until last September, leads in the public opinion polls related to the primary, and her campaign has more than $2 million, most of it provided by her husband, Wilbur Ross, a financier. But she has little support from the party leaders who can help her at the convention and provide the foot soldiers for a campaign.
Mr. Vallone, second in the polls, has raised $2 million. With strong party backing in New York City and the surrounding counties, where the bulk of the primary vote lies, he is the only candidate all but guaranteed 25 percent support at the convention. Yet he was unable to win the consensus support of party leaders from downstate counties, and he remains little-known upstate. Mr. Hynes is third in the polls, but he has raised little money.
Today's results gave a boost to Mr. Larocca, who has campaigned longer and harder than anyone else in the field, but has raised little money and has not broken out of the single digits in the polls. A Long Islander who headed that region's largest business group, the Long Island Association, for several years, he has support from party leaders on the Island, as well as upstate.
"This is the first real test of sentiment among people who will make the decision in the party," Mr. Larocca said. "I see it as a very big step forward."
Ms. McCaughey Ross said she was not concerned about her showing. For her, failure to get 25 percent at the convention would not be a fatal setback. She has enough money to go the petition route -- estimated to cost $500,000 or more -- and she could use it to her advantage, casting herself as the outsider.
But the Lieutenant Governor has virtually no support from party leaders in New York City and the counties around it, and has been counting heavily on backing from counties north of Westchester.
Today's results were less significant in the Senate race, where Mr. Green, Ms. Ferraro and Mr. Schumer, who are looking to unseat Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican, are all virtually assured of winning automatic places on the ballot at the state convention.
But the outcome could not have pleased Ms. Ferraro, the former CNN commentator and 1984 vice presidential nominee, who came here confident, noting that in the 1992 Senate primary that she lost, she carried 36 of the 41 counties represented here today. She may have been hampered by her late entry into the race, in January, while Mr. Green has been running for a year.
Mr. Green won 70 votes, Ms. Ferraro 51, and Mr. Schumer 4.
In the race for attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, a wealthy former prosecutor who ran unsuccessfully for the office in 1994, got 54 votes, while State Senator Catherine M. Abate of Manhattan got 49. G. Oliver Koppell, who was Attorney General in 1993 and 1994, but lost the Democratic primary four years ago, won 19 votes, while Evan A. Davis, former counsel to Mr. Cuomo, got 4.

HEADLINE: REPUBLICANS HOLD AN EDGE IN KEEPING CONTROL OF HOUSE

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WICHITA, Kan., March 27

 BODY:
As Republicans struggle to retain the narrowest House majority held by any party in the last half century, they may benefit in this year's midterm elections from something of a political security blanket: Incumbents around the nation are savoring high popularity ratings, and the sturdy economy and dearth of contentious issues has left many challengers with no foothold.
Although the two parties are also wrangling over 36 governorships and a third of the Senate, the early signs point to one of the most serene midterm election seasons in years, even in districts like Representative Todd Tiahrt's here, which have seen pitched battles in each of the last two elections. 
 Democrats concede that they have no chance to regain the majority in the Senate this year, while Republicans do not count on reaching the 60-vote margin needed to cut off a filibuster. Democrats also expect that Republicans will hold on to most of the big-state governorships. That leaves most of the attention on about 75 of the most competitive House seats.
Most political analysts agree that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their House margin, but their 11-seat edge is so slim that no one can speak with confidence about the outcome. Even if the House does not change hands, the result will be important in determining the extent of President Clinton's negotiating room over the next two years.
The quiet campaign environment may be deceptive. The wild card looming over the electorate is how -- or even whether -- the White House sex scandal will play. It could bring out angry Republicans in November. Or if the House Republicans conduct impeachment hearings, that could embolden Democrats who could view it as excessively partisan. Another possibility is that the issue will not sway voters one way or another.
Though incumbents are mindful of the possibility of a dramatic event that could alter the political forces, they are enjoying what many of them said in interviews is the most stress-free pre-election period in years. Here in Wichita at this time two years ago, Mr. Tiahrt (pronounced TEE-heart) was in a tight re-election battle as unions were bombarding the district with television commercials portraying him as eager to slash Medicare. His campaign headquarters was in full swing in downtown offices, and Mr. Tiahrt was furiously calling supporters for donations.
This year, Democrats have yet to find an opponent for Mr. Tiahrt -- and they might not do so. The only semblance of a campaign in Mr. Tiahrt's Fourth Congressional District is in the basement of Linda Arensdorf's modest clapboard house in west Wichita. She is the campaign's only paid staff member thus far. Instead of frenetic volunteers, the only background noise is Rush Limbaugh on the radio.
"This is it," Mrs. Arensdorf said as she surveyed the quarters from which she responds to letters from the Federal Election Commission and sends mailings to supporters. "Pretty impressive, huh?"
Reminding her visitor from the East that "we have tornadoes in this part of the county," she fretted that the basement was so cramped that "we'd have no place to go." Still, Mrs. Arensdorf said it was a welcome change from two years ago, when "the feeling I had was that we were trying to repair a car while we were going 60 or 70 miles an hour down the highway."
No one seems more appreciative or, more accurately, relieved, than Mr. Tiahrt, a conservative who in 1994 upset Representative Dan Glickman, a Democrat who had held the seat for 18 years and is now Secretary of Agriculture. "Last time I was fighting for my life," said Mr. Tiahrt, who won with only 50 percent of the vote in 1996. "Now, I'm enjoying the products of hard labor. Instead of fighting negative ads, I'm basking in the satisfaction of being able to do something for my district."
Mr. Tiahrt is not alone. While Kansas is a largely Republican state, local officials in both parties said they could not remember so little competition against the Republican incumbents. Gov. Bill Graves, who was in a hard-fought race four years ago, has no opponent. Nor does Senator Sam Brownback, who was elected in a bitter battle two years ago to fill the seat vacated by Senator Bob Dole. Of the four members of Congress from the state, only one, Representative Vince Snowbarger, appears to have a serious challenge.
The lack of competition extends far beyond the plains of Kansas. In Pennsylvania, six years ago, Senator Arlen Specter found himself in an intense struggle after his role in the confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas as a Supreme Court Justice. And four years ago, Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania was in a costly, high-profile race. This year, those two Republicans face only token opposition.
In Texas, the race for Governor is the least competitive in years. Gov. George W. Bush has an enormous lead in early polls over Garry Mauro, the State Land Commissioner. Former Gov. Ann Richards was also popular, but that did not stop Mr. Bush from taking her on four years ago.
"It's going to be a huge incumbent's year," said Representative Joe Scarborough, a Florida Republican. "It's going to be monstrous. I think 98 percent will return" to office.
Since most incumbents are Republicans, that would be encouraging news for the party. But Democrats can also take solace in that, thus far, there are no signs that the party will suffer huge losses, as often occurs for a President's party at the midpoint of his second term.
Contributing to the lack of apparent volatility is that there are fewer open seats for the House and Senate. Only two incumbent Senators are widely considered to face spirited challenges: Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, and Carol Moseley-Braun, Democrat of Illinois.
But in two states where incumbent Democrats are retiring, Arkansas and Kentucky, the contests are expected to be particularly competitive.
Officials in both parties said one reason they could not convince more prospects to take on incumbents was the perception that there were no great ideological divisions between the parties this year. That may leave candidates waging very locally oriented campaigns.
"Nobody seems to have any traction," John J. Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont-McKenna College in California, said of challengers this year. "In order to bring about change, you have to have traction. And this is a campaign being fought on an oil slick."
Martin P. Wattenberg, a political science professor at the University of California at Irvine, put it this way, "If I were thinking about running for Congress or advising anybody, I would say, 'This is not a good time to be running -- unless you want to make a four-year commitment, knowing that you'll lose the first time.' "
Another striking development is that while Republicans have to defend 24 of 36 gubernatorial seats, few Democrats were willing to take them on, in part because they are so popular. In Arizona, for example, Gov. Jane Dee Hull did not take office until August, but a recent poll put her job-approval rating at a comfortable 71 percent.
The only incumbent Governors who appear to have competitive races are Parris N. Glendening of Maryland, a Democrat, and three Republicans: Argeo Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts, who is filling out the term of William F. Weld; Fob James Jr. of Alabama, and John G. Rowland of Connecticut. But the Democratic challengers in big states like New York, Texas, Pennsylvania and Michigan are far behind in early surveys.
Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, vice chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said he and Mr. Clinton had tried mightily to recruit three Governors to run for Senate this year: James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Zell Miller of Georgia. "I did not have one success," Mr. Torricelli said. "The Democratic Governors in each of those states could have almost walked in to the United States Senate. Not one would make the race." His explanation? "The atmosphere in Washington."
All signs suggest that despite the years of vilification of incumbents, incumbency may be in vogue. With no burning issues to draw challengers, incumbents can still scare them off by amassing large campaign war chests and boasting of their experience helping the state or district.
In Wichita, for instance, Mr. Tiahrt takes credit for helping channel $35 million in Federal money to the district for railroad overpasses to relieve streets clogged with traffic. And Mr. Tiahrt has not let his lack of a challenge daunt his fund-raising efforts.
Dave Hanna, Mr. Tiahrt's district coordinator, said the campaign could easily match the nearly $1 million it raised in 1996. But until there is an opponent, he said, the campaign can preserve its resources. Snapping his fingers, Mr. Hanna said of the prospect that a rival could materialize, "If they want to run, we can click this thing into gear tomorrow."
For all the confidence, the one certainty in the midterm elections this year is that nothing is certain yet, and the scandal surrounding the President or some unforeseen national crisis could intervene in the blink of an eye.
"This White House scandal puts an element of uncertainty into it for every incumbent," said Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who appears in such good shape that he was practically making excuses for having to stage a two-day formal beginning next week for his re-election campaign. "Now you're not sure what mood the country is in. Before this thing happened the approval of Congress was high. People were satisfied with their lives."
The scandal "could generate a high anti-incumbency attitude on the part of voters because when they think we're crooked or they get angry," Mr. McCain said, "People have a hard time distinguishing between Democrats and Republicans."

HEADLINE: Retail Center Is Proposed In East Harlem

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Amid intense government efforts to lure commercial development to the blighted manufacturing areas of Harlem and the South Bronx, city and state officials will announce a plan today to replace an abandoned East Harlem wire factory with a three-block-long shopping complex.
The project, to be announced jointly by Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, is to include two large retailers -- Home Depot and Costco -- several other stores, parking for 1,100 cars and a separate building dedicated to small entrepreneurial companies at the site of the former Washburn Wire plant. It will cover six acres on the west side of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, from 116th Street to 119th Street. 
 Officials said construction of the shopping complex, budgeted at $87 million, could begin next year and be completed by 2001.
If built as planned, they said, it would create 2,000 jobs, a large retail outlet in an area where residents frequently drive to the suburbs to shop, and fresh impetus for other commercial ventures in Harlem, Washington Heights and the South Bronx.
The Washburn Wire site, which city and state officials have repeatedly cited as a top development priority, is within two overlapping economic development zones -- one state, one Federal -- providing an array of benefits like tax credits and low interest loans for whoever builds there.
The proposed shopping complex "will be the anchor of the economic renaissance of Harlem," Governor Pataki said. Mayor Giuliani, describing the Washburn Wire site as "a symbol of our city's decline," said the project would be "another example of our city's resurgence, and more importantly, a sign of East Harlem's rebirth."
The complex, to be called East River Plaza, is to be built by the Blumenfeld Development Group, a Syosset, N.Y., company that bought the site at a foreclosure auction in 1996 for $3.1 million.
That followed a checkered history that in many ways mirrored the decline of manufacturing in East Harlem. The 100-year-old plant, a hulking red-brick structure that has been abandoned since the early 1980's, was once one of New York City's largest, employing 600 workers. But after closing in 1982, it had been the focus of a succession of failed development schemes, including plans for a movie production studio.
Under the plan to be announced today, Home Depot, the home improvement chain, and Costco, a chain of discount "club" style department stores, are to be the largest tenants in the complex, taking up a combined total of 240,000 square feet. An equal amount of space would be available to other tenants.
Randy Daniels, senior vice president of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's development agency, said executives of Blumenfeld Development were in discussions with several other national retail chains, including the Old Navy clothing chain, about taking space in the complex.
He said a separate four-story, 40,000-square-foot building to be built by Blumenfeld but controlled by some form of community advisory board that has not yet been appointed, would be designated as an incubator for small businesses, providing commercial space at low rent.
Despite the support of the Mayor and the Governor, the project could face roadblocks. Since the site is now zoned exclusively for manufacturing, it would have to be rezoned by the city for commercial use.
Such a change may meet resistance from East Harlem residents, because of the traffic the complex would generate. "The project is a home run," said one senior adviser to the Mayor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But it may have to be scaled down."
Another senior city official who has been involved in the negotiations said that the developer would have to pay to rebuild the southbound exit off the F.D.R. Drive at 116th Street, which is too narrow to accommodate a fresh infusion of traffic. Northbound exits would not require reconstruction, he said.
Other difficulties could arise because the site will provide only about 75 percent of the land sought by the developer. State officials plan to use the state's power to condemn property to acquire adjacent lots for the project.
But even though Blumenfeld Development has agreed to pay for those lots, officials said, recent cases in which the state has used its condemnation rights -- particularly in Times Square -- have shown that lawsuits can raise the price of condemned property far above developers' expectations.
About 50 homes and 150 tenants in the neighboring lots could be affected, said Eddie Baca, an East Harlem resident who is president of the Local Development Corporation del Barrio and the former chairman of Community Board 11 there. He said there is uncertainty about how the project would affect lives and existing businesses.
The project would be welcome, he said, "provided that it protects the homeowners who are there now."
Mr. Baca also said he was concerned because there have been no guarantees that jobs created by the project would go to local residents. Without such assurances, he said, there is uncertainty. "They've made no effort to outline plans for the residents and people are frightened," he said.
Still, the project has attracted powerful government backing, particularly because of the wire factory's central location in two economic development zones.
If the shopping complex is built, it would be the largest project in the large Empowerment Zone created by Congress in 1996 and administered jointly by city, state and Federal officials, in parts of Harlem, Washington Heights and the South Bronx.
That zone provides developers with several financial incentives, including tax breaks for hiring people who live within the zone or in another depressed neighborhood.
The other economic development zone, created by the state in 1988, provides developers with such things as investment tax credits to defray some construction costs, and discounts on their electrical bills.

State Comptroller Faults Development Agency

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
A state comptroller's audit has criticized the Department of Economic Development for failing to measure whether its economic development zones are succeeding, but a spokeswoman for the agency says a system to do so is nearly complete.
The spokeswoman, Caroline Quartararo, said the review has been time-consuming because it covers 92,000 workers in 40 economic development zones. 
 The audit, released last week by the office of State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, criticized the department for failing to fully implement several suggestions Mr. McCall made in 1996 to gauge the success of the zones. The department, he said, does not have a system to track whether businesses that get tax breaks in economic development zones are creating new jobs.
Ms. Quartararo said that the program's achievements are clear. "This program is a major success," she said. "We've seen 800 new companies create 8,500 new jobs and invest $1.6 billion in 1995 and 1996."

$271 Billion Roads Bill Draws Clinton's Wrath

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
The six-year, $271 billion highway bill pending in the House is drawing fire from President Clinton, who calls it a threat to "both our fiscal discipline and our commitment to education and other critical investments in our future."
The bill has the backing of the House leadership, and the majority whip, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, predicted on Friday that it would pass easily when it comes before the full House in a few days, The Washington Post reported today. 
 A group of Democrats and conservative Republicans plans to offer amendments on the floor to trim the bill by $18 billion, the paper also said. But Mr. DeLay said he expected that effort to have little effect.
Mr. Clinton made his remarks in an undated letter to the House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, calling a well-constructed highway and transit system "an important domestic priority and critical to our economic success" but citing a need to "strike a balance."
The Senate passed its version of the highway bill nearly three weeks ago. It calls for $214 billion in spending over the next six fiscal years.

HEADLINE: When Life After Death Is the Company's Lot

BYLINE: By ERIC HUBLER

 BODY:
THERE'S no good time to get bad news, but some times are worse than others. Nicole Maxwell was the humand resources director for Barrington International Hospitality Inc., an upstart hotel-management company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., eight months pregnant - and had moved the previous day to a new house in a new neighborhood - when the word came: The plane carrying her boss and father, Barry L. Conrad, on a United States trade mission to the former Yugoslavia was missing.
 
 While the nation focused on the loss of Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown in the April 3, 1996, crash near Dubrovnik, Croatia, Ms. Maxwell faced a double burden of grief: to comfort and be comforted by her family, but also to respect the unsentimental, unrelenting demands of profit-making and get back behind her desk.
 For her, as for all the employees, aides, customers and shareholders of the 12 companies with executives on the flight, the days and months after the crash yielded unwanted but unavoidable lessons in how to keep a company alive in the face of a sudden death at or near the top. Two years later, a look at two of the companies that lost their chief executives reveals many of those lessons, which executives and board members at other companies would do well to heed.
 Apart from their interest in helping to rebuild the former Yugoslavia, the companies could not have been more different.
 The privately held Barrington, an eight-employee company only 14 months old, was so tightly identified with Mr. Conrad, 55 at his death, that it had not had time to create, let alone fill, several key positions, and had no crisis plan; it could well have followed its founder into oblivion.
 By contrast, ABB Inc., a $5 billion, 22,000-person United States subsidiary of ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., the Swiss-Swedish engineering conglomerate, had a many-tendriled hierarchy that it could tap to compensate for the loss of Robert E. Donovan, its 54-year-old chairman, president and chief executive.
 And while their approaches to recovery differed greatly, too, there were some striking similarities. At both companies, the death has been looked on not just as a loss to be mourned but as a business challenge to be overcome. At both, there is an openly acknowledged conflict between the desire to be faithful to the fallen leader's wishes and the need to innovate. And at both, there is a sense of being poorer for the loss but richer for having undergone the trial.

Barrington International
No Dreamer,
No Dream
 The words "dream" and "vision" recur too often in conversations with people close to Barrington not to be taken seriously.
 Although the leisure industry had been hospitable enough to Barry Conrad - he had risen to leading positions at Trusthouse Forte, the British hotel company, and Burger King - he had grown disgusted with the lack of personal loyalty in the corporate world, and especially disgusted with himself when he had to lay people off.
 Barrington was supposed to be different. People would be valued. There would be no sinecures, but the company would be Mr. Conrad's moral and financial legacy to his children. Bot his daughters went to work for him, as did Nicole's husband, Todd Maxwell, the senior vice president for finance and accounting. Mr. Conrad's youngest child, Brent, studied hotel management at college in hopes of doing likewise. Even the name Barrington, a play on Barry, was a form of immortalization.
 The company started as a 50-50 joint venture between Mr. Conrad, who had the knowledge and skill, and Paulo de Brito, a Brazilian rancher and investor, who had the money. Mr. Conrad knew he wanted to do something in the emerging economies of South America - operate Burger King franchises, he thought, but McDonald's turned out to be too well entrenched. He turned instead to hotels, securing the master franchise in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay for Choice Hotels International's Clarion, Comfort, Sleep Inn and Quality brands. Such a franchise would give Barrington equity in or outright ownership of the hotels.
 But the company needed a source of short-term income to finance its long-term investment in Latin America. And that's where Croatia came in.
 The hotels along the magnificent Adriatic coast had, after a half-dozen years as little more than refugee centers, pretty well forgotten how to be hotels. Croatian Hotels and Resorts, a joint venture of Barrington and partners from Croatia and Austria, supplied management services - mainly Mr. Conrad's expertise. Contracts covering 68 hotels were in place by the time of the Brown mission.
 Mr. Conrad's widow, Patricia, recalls their final conversation, on the eve of the crash, in which 35 people died: "He called me the night before saying, 'Can you believe it? We're actually going to be able to save a country.' "
 With Mr. Conrad's death, the Broatian revenue source was in peril. The first and most pivotal meeting of Barrington's leaders after the crash was a soul-searching discussion in a cafe at the Marriott Hotel in Miami several weeks later. The topic, according to Mr. Maxwell, who served as secretary to the board, was, "How do we carry on a develop this thing, or do we let the dream die where it was?"
 Mrs. Conrad had no formal experience in the hotel business. But as the heir to Mr. Conrad's 50 percent stake and his seat on the four-member board, she felt so strongly about keeping about keeping the company running that within weeks of his funeral on April 15, 1996, she went to Hungary, seeking to save a nascent management deal that ended up falling apart.
 In some cases, the Barrington team tried to appease a nervous client by pledging more time or money to a project; in others, Mrs. Conrad said, "we just decided simply to let go because there seemed to be too strong an identity with Barry rather than the company, and we were not comfortable with their level of expectation."
 If anyone had a motive to bail out it was Mr. Brito, the investor, who had never intended to play an active role in the company. Instead, he assumed Mr. Conrad's position as chairman. "We had a very good understanding that the company had to proceed so we didn't lose all the effort that culminated in the loss of his life," Mr. Brito explained.
 Two months after Mr.Conrad's death, Barrington recruited a new chief executive - Paul J. Sistare, a hotel industry longtimer, who was nominated by Mr. Conrad because he had worked with her husband off and on for 20 years and considered him a mentor.
 The two had been out of touch. But in a bit of company lore that varies somewhat with each telling, a note was found after the crash in Mr. Conrad's Zagreb hotel room in which he reminded himself to call Mr. Sistare to sound him out about joining Barrington. The note, discovered after Mr. Sistare had already begun interviewing for the job, amounted to Mr. Conrad's succession plan.
 Mr. Sistare's first task was to closet himself in his late friend's office for several weeks, reading Mr. Conrad's notes in an almost seance-like effort to gain guidance from beyond. "Who knows what plans were floating around in Barry's head?" Mr. Sistare said. "The guy was a visionary. But fortunately, he was also a very careful note taker."
 Personnel decisions were fairly easy: Mr. Sistare quickly brought in experienced marketing and technical executives, for example. But what to do about Croatia - a time-intensive operation that generated $70,000 in monthly revenues but created no lasting assets for Barrington - was another matter, and here began a series of decision that changed the nature of the company. Barrington stopped seeking new business in Europe and is now in the final stages of selling its take in Croatian Hotels and Resorts. The company will reap "a very significant profit," Mr. Sistare says, but it means the end of the venture that cost Mr. Conrad his life.
 With Croatian Hotels and Resorts out of the picture, where would the money to build and operate hotels in South America come from? Again it was Mr. Brito who came up with the answer - in the middle of the night, as one Barrington executive tells the story, so Mr. Brito had to ask his wife to remind him of his brainstorm in the morning.
 The angel was Gregory J. Ryan, a fellow Brazilian who had already unwittingly shaped Barrington: He was the McDonald's franchiser whose success in South America had kept Burger King at bay. Mr. Ryan bought 40 percent of the company and became chairman; Mr. Conrad and Mr. Brito now own 20 percent each, and Mr. Sistare remains president and chief executive; the remaining 20 percent is spread among various corporate officers.
 Mr. Ryan endorses and tries to emulate Mr. Conrad's style of running the company, with, as he says, "the formality that's required by law and the informality that leads to good conversation" among the shareholders. But he acknoledged that his investment in Barrington is "a pure business move," and that he has no personal connection to the Conrads and no responsibility to provide for them as a father would. The company, which has grown to 28 employees, will continue to sell bits of itself to outside investors he said.
 Mrs. Conrad says her decision to water down her stake in the company was correct, but adds that she did not depart from her husband's vision without regret. "We as a family had to accept the idea that this would no longer be able to proceed according to his plan," she said.
 "As a legacy, it's pretty much gone," said her daughter Nicole, who remained with Barrington for more than a year but now stays home caring for her two sons. Nicole's sister also has left the company.
 Mr. Conrad knew he needed a succession plan, his widow said, but the company had grown so quickly that there simply had not been time.
 "I think you have to have a recovery plan for not just having lost an individual, but also the emotional impact on the company and the people they do business with," Mrs. Conrad said. A succession plan, she added, is "not something you ever complete."

ABB Inc.
From a Tragedy
Comes Cohesion
 On the floor and a half of a quiet Norwich, Conn. office complex that serve as ABB's American headquarters, the question was never whether to carry on, only how.
 Fortunately, ABB people are engineers, so "how" is the question they feel best qualified to answer. When Bob Donovan's lieutenants heard that his plane was missing, they leaped quickly from watching-the-news mode to devising a plan of action. There was no crisis document to guide them, but the executives instinctively turned themselves into a task force, as if mentally executing a schematic.
 "We're project people, and we're used to taking very complex logistical situations and managing them, so that really played right into the things we do and the things we are," said John Sullivan, a staff vice president who handled the daunting details of Mr. Donovan's funeral for the company.
 The task force included one man who, technically, did not work for the company. Richard J. Slember had retired the previous week as head of ABB's worldwide nuclear business and was in the office just to finish his packing. He was dispatched to the Donovans' home in Fairfield to hold vigil with the family and talk to reporters. He also agreed to go to Manhattan the next morning for a interview with CBS News.
 In the car on the way to the city, Dr. Slember's role took a sudden turn from peripheral to central. Percy Barnevik, ABB's chairman, called from Zurich, asking Dr. Slember to come out of his three-day retirement and take Mr. Donovan's job. "It was such a natural thing, with my back-ground and availability - it just felt like the right thing to do," Dr. Slember recalled. "Later, I thought, 'Well, what am I going to tell my wife?' "
 But guiding ABB, even without a crisis at hand, would not have been easy. Created as a by product of the 1988 merger of Sweden's Asea and Switzerland's BBC Brown Boveri, the American operation promptly had gone on a buying spree of its own, acquiring two venerable but aging companies: Westinghouse Transmission and Distribution, which provided services and equipment to local utilities, and Combustion Engineering. Neither was doing terrifically, and it didn't help, Dr. Slember said, that as a result of the recession and utility deregulation, "the market went south."
 In short, the American operation "required major, major restructuring," he said, a restructuring that was just nearing completion when Mr. Donovan died after only two years as chief executive.
 Part of the problem was the difficulty, common to merged companies, of meshing systems and corporate cultures. "When I came to ABB in 1990 I had, I think, eight electronic-mail systems, none of which communicated with any of the others," Dr. Slember said. "Same with financial software, word processing, communications, spreadsheets - everybody had their own."
 ABB executives say Mr. Donovan's death hastened a process that could have taken years even for the most talented executive: bringing the company together. The corporate communications department, by then able to get messages to the entire company, made its heaviest use ever of Lotus Notes to keep ABB locations across the country up to date. As soon as Mr. Donovan's death was confirmed, Mr. Sullivan was deluged with requests to attend the funeral, at St. Luke's Church in Westport, Conn., and the interment at Mr. Donovan's alma mater, West Point.
 "There was just a grass-roots up-rising of, 'Could we get into this?' 'Could we see?' and 'Where's the church?' " Mr. Sullivan said. "It became apparent that if everyone comes, we're just not going to able to fit everyone." His solution was satellite hookup to five locations, allowing as many employees as possible to grieve together.
 That was not the end of Mr. Sullivan's chores, however. The entire ABB executive committee, including Mr. Barnevik, planned to attend, so there were flights and airport pickups to arrange, as well as transportation from the funeral to the interment. Making sure that such seemingly minor details went smoothly was, in retrospect, one of the most important things that could have been done.
 "The fact that this tradegy brought in everbody was a tribute to how people saw this guy," Mr. Sullivan said. "And then seeing them here was some solace. It was viewed very positively by all of the people that were going through the trauma that had known Bob for an extended period of time."
 The emergence of a sense of cohesion, until then missing at ABB, was tangible. "This was bonding experience," said Karin Quinland, who has served as senior executive assistant to four chief executives of the American unit in the last six years. "All senior management came to the funeral and everyone is kind of unmasked, and it really created a bond that needed to be created at the time. A tragedy brought us all closer together, and I think we understand each other a lot more as a result of what happened."
 By the time Zurich headquarters announced Mr. Donovan's permanent replacements, the company had a better sense of itself and was more ready to be led than it had been when Mr. Donovan had taken over in 1994.
 Succeeding Dr. Slember in September 1996 were Howard Pierce, head of ABB China, as chairman, chief executive and group executive vice president for the Americas, and Peter S. Janson, formerly one of Mr. Donovan's executive vice presidents who would report to Mr. Pierce as president, with responsibility for the United States.
 Splitting the position in two "was a very good move, as the position as it was before was a man-killer," said the re-retired Dr. Slember.
 "You were moving constantly, you can imagine, with the area that needed coverage," he said.
 If Dr. Slember, and then Mr. Pierce, kept ABB together, it was Ms. Quinlan who kept the two men in one piece. Among the American chief executive's responsibilities is attending executive committee meetings in Zurich every three weeks, a massive briefing book in tow. The chief executive's assistant, unappreciated in many companies, wasn't unappreciated at ABB. "Mr. Pierce came here to this office and did not know anyone here," Ms. Quilan said. "He did not know his own staff very well. So he would ask me about who does that project, who does this, how is this relationship - you know, relying on my knowledge."
 Mr. Sullivan represented ABB in a follow-up mission three months after the crash, retrieving a few fragments of the plane to give to Mt. Donovan's widow and resuming the pursuit of several power projects on which ABB was bidding. "We were not successful," Mr. Janson said. "We are participating, but not to the extent that we would rather be. But that's part of the competitive nature of our business."
 Thought ABB executives decline to say how extensive a succession plan was in place for Mr. Donovan, the experience clearly pushed the matter up a notch on the priority list. "We've been active in the last couple of years doing succession plans," Mr. Janson said. "It's a management responsibility to discuss succession planning for each individuals."
 Like most companies, ABB always had a policy letting key executives travel together. Today, Mr. Janson said, it is applied "a little more strictly."

HEADLINE: Kofi Annan's Next Test

BYLINE: By James Traub; James Traub has written for The New York Times Magazine about Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Webster Hubbell, Floyd Flake and others.

 BODY:
A few minutes before noon on sunday, Feb. 22, three black Mercedes sedans pulled into the U-shaped driveway of the Baghdad villa in which the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and his staff had been quartered since their arrival in Iraq two days earlier. These were not the same drivers who had taken Annan to his repeated negotiating sessions at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; these were Saddam Hussein's personal drivers, among the very few people permitted to know the Iraqi President's whereabouts. They had come to take the Secretary General to his climactic negotiating session with Saddam. Annan was told that he could take no more than three aides and his bodyguard. He was not told where he was going. He didn't seem fazed;
Annan never seems fazed. Ahmad Fawzi, the spokesman for Annan's delegation, asked one of the Iraqis where the Secretary General was being taken. "He looked at me like I was a cockroach," Fawzi said later. "I think he wanted to take me out back and have me shot." 
 Here was a moment scripted by Hollywood. Whatever moral romance is associated with Annan's job stems from its essential powerlessness. The Secretary General steps into a situation bristling with menace, armed only with his mandate and his moral authority. He has something of the Pope's spiritual status, but of course he has no church -- no army of believers. He is a small, solitary figure
silhouetted against a vast backdrop. And here, in Baghdad, Kofi Annan -- "the soft-spoken, gentle lamb," as I heard him once mockingly call himself -- had been whisked off to meet the most evil tyrant on earth.
In reality, of course, the Secretary General is seldom truly unarmed. In this case, Saddam Hussein knew that the United States stood prepared to bomb his country to kingdom come if he did not open his eight "presidential sites" to U.N. weapons inspectors. But Saddam had not submitted so far; no one knew which way the seesaw would tip. The atmosphere at the villa as the Annan caravan sped away was a crackling mixture of helplessness, hope and sleep deprivation. Elisabeth Lindenmayer, who has worked with Annan for many years, paced back and forth for hours, waiting for the Mercedes to pull back into the driveway.
As it turned out, Annan was only a few minutes away, over at the Republican Presidential Palace, where he met with Saddam for three hours and, while the two men smoked cigars, persuaded him to accept what the Iraqis had said they could not accept -- unlimited access to the eight sites previously designated completely off-limits. At least for a time, Annan had averted the war that only a week earlier seemed almost inevitable. And he had done so without offering anything more than a few symbolic concessions. It might well have been the most dramatic achievement by a Secretary General since the era of Dag Hammarskjold.
Annan left Baghdad believing that he had achieved not only personal but also institutional vindication -- vividly demonstrating the merits of diplomacy and multilateralism. Then he arrived back in the United States and heard himself denounced as a latter-day Neville Chamberlain by the Senate Majority Leader, Trent Lott. The Clinton Administration, which he had arguably saved from itself, issued not so much as a thank-you. The atmosphere improved in the weeks that followed, as the Iraqis complied with the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding. But Annan's hope that he could cash in the settlement, and his modest reputation as a reformer, for an American promise to finally repay the $1 billion it owes the U.N. in back dues began to look ill founded. The U.N. desperately needs the U.S., but the feeling is scarcely mutual. On a flight to Washington, where he went earlier this month to plead his case, he said of Congress, with an air of impatience quite unusual in him, "We have delivered; I want to know when they will deliver." The answer appears to be: Not in the foreseeable future. Just now, as Annan has discovered, Washington may be less amenable to reason than Baghdad.
The Secretary Generalship is one of the world's oddest jobs, half moral witness and half C.E.O. Actually, the division is more like 10 percent and 90 percent. The Secretary General is the chief administrator of an international parliamentary system and the boss of 10,000 international civil servants; he is expected to coordinate, though he does not control, the activities of affiliated groups like Unesco and the World Health Organization. But Article 99 of the U.N. charter also gives the Secretary General the right and obligation to bring to the attention of the Security Council any issue that threatens international peace and security. The drama of the position, and the possibilities for heroism and humiliation that go with it, lie entirely in the peacemaking role.
The job has produced, by common consent, only one great man: Dag Hammarskjold, the Swedish statesman who served as the second Secretary General for eight years beginning in 1953. It's instructive that Hammarskjold was chosen because, as a former Dutch representative to the U.N. later wrote, he was mistakenly believed to be a "careful and colorless official" who would tend to administrative business without inserting himself into issues of war and peace. Traditionally, the smaller states want an activist Secretary General willing to speak for their interests and take on the great powers. The great powers themselves, who control the U.N. through their permanent membership in the Security Council and the veto power that comes with it, want a man who is, as the saying goes, more secretary than general. It was Hammarskjold who fostered the atmosphere of moral charisma that surrounds, or used to surround, the office of Secretary General. It wasn't only that he put himself in harm's way all over the world -- and died a martyr's death when his plane crashed during a peace mission to the Congo in the fall of 1961 -- but also that he understood and expressed his role in transcendent terms. When he traveled to China in 1955 to win the release of 15 captured American airmen, he explained that his authority lay not simply with the member states that he represented but with the U.N. charter itself, a novel interpretation that came to be known as the Peking Formula.
The shadow of Hammarskjold has hung over the U.N. ever since. It's clear, in retrospect, that it was the cold war, and the fear of another world war, that made his achievements possible; the superpowers, no matter what they said, needed him to put out at least some of the fires they had started. But it's also true that the Secretary General's peacekeeping role is so vague and improvisatory that the characteristics of the incumbent matter enormously. And Hammarskjold's successors have not measured up. As Rosemary Righter, the British author of a history of the U.N. called "Utopia Lost," tartly puts it: "U Thant was invisible; Waldheim was a liar; Perez de Cuellar was a man of whom Vernon Walters once said, 'He couldn't make waves if he fell out of a boat,' and Boutros-Ghali was completely impatient with the job." Boutros-Ghali became the first Secretary General to be denied a second term when the Clinton Administration vowed in 1996 to veto his candidacy. It was a display of sheer muscle on America's part. Boutros-Ghali, after a promising start, had shown little appetite for reducing the U.N.'s legendary bureaucracy, and he could never quite put a lid on his anticolonial rhetoric, famously accusing the West of being preoccupied with "a rich man's war" in Bosnia rather than with the genocide in Rwanda. He may not have recognized the passing of an era when the West, and particularly the Americans, were willing to tolerate the rhetoric of the third world.
At the time Boutros-Ghali's fate was being settled, Kofi Annan was serving as a special U.N. representative in the former Yugoslavia. Annan, who is from Ghana, had started at the U.N. 30 years earlier as a P1, the lowest professional designation. He first ran the personnel department, then the budget department before serving as comptroller, and he distinguished himself in every job for his efficiency, his exquisite tact and his slightly mysterious powers of persuasion. If any single person embodied the institution, it was he. Jean-Pierre Halbwachs, who has worked with Annan off and on for 20 years and now serves as the U.N.'s comptroller, says, "He has this uncanny ability to get people to shift their position without feeling threatened or without any tension." He is, in this and many other regards, the living opposite of Boutros-Ghali. In fact, it was widely believed inside the U.N. that Boutros-Ghali had sent Annan to Yugoslavia in 1995 in the hope of removing a potential competitor as he sought renomination. He wound up giving his rival a new stage. The NATO countries, and especially the Americans, were impressed by how coolly and efficiently Annan handled the transition from U.N. to NATO troops. As one American involved in the Bosnia issue told me, "The discussions were just more sensible when he was involved than with some others."
At the same time, a question hung over Annan: Was he too nice a guy? As one veteran diplomat from an American ally says: "Kofi is conflict-averse in all his personal relationships and perhaps more broadly. There's a danger of allowing things to slide because they may involve conflict." Annan's association with one of the greatest debacles in the history of the United Nations inevitably raises the question of his toughness. He spent much of the period from 1992 to 1996 working on Bosnia, first as deputy for peacekeeping, then as head of peacekeeping, then as Boutros-Ghali's special representative. Sir Marrack Goulding, who was the head of peacekeeping when Annan served as deputy, says that Annan didn't express his doubts about policy "nearly as vociferously" as he himself did, since "it wouldn't come naturally to him to express strongly dissenting views about what the Security Council wanted to do." But Annan says that whenever he met with the representatives of the countries that contributed soldiers to the U.N. peacekeeping force, he pressed them to rethink the troops' limited mandate. As for the ruinous "safe havens" policy, which he was forced to administer, Annan said that the U.N. had asked for 34,000 troops and got 7,600. In any case, he says, "Screaming and getting bitter and being angry is negative energy, and takes a lot out of you, and doesn't help any."
Annan became Secretary General in January 1997, when he was 58. He was chosen because he was, like the spurned Boutros-Ghali, an African; because the Americans, and specifically Madeleine K. Albright, who was then the United States representative to the U.N., wanted him and because practically everyone else liked and respected him. And it didn't hurt that he seemed like the kind of inoffensive figure who would be more secretary than general.
An obvious way of stating the central predicament that Annan faced in his role as Secretary General is that he stood for multilateral solutions in a world dominated by one country with a strong unilateralist bent. But it was more complicated than that. Both Perez de Cuellar and Boutros-Ghali served in the era of American hegemony, but they benefited from the interval of comity that came with the sudden demise of Communism. As Fareed Zakaria, the managing editor of Foreign Affairs magazine, says: "There were two golden ages of the U.N. -- right after the end of World War II and right at the end of the cold war. What you had in both cases was a great power consensus in the shadow of victory. In both cases, the U.S. foreign policy was ratified out of fear and awe. That consensus frayed very rapidly after World War II owing to the emergence of a single rival. It's fraying in a much more haphazard and jerky way now, as you have three or four rival power centers emerging."
Annan's problem was to accommodate American demands for U.N. reform and the American ambition to serve as the world's policeman without losing everyone else. And it was this delicate position that made the Iraqi crisis an exercise in multidimensional diplomacy. From the outset, it was plain that only the Americans were enthusiastic about a bombing campaign; the British supported the use of force loyally but uneasily, while France, Russia and China -- the other permanent members of the Security Council -- were strongly opposed.
I first talked with Annan in mid-February, two days after he had convened a meeting of the representatives of the permanent five in the conference room adjacent to his office. "I think what is important," he said, "is that the permanent five are talking among themselves. Until Wednesday, they were talking past each other." Annan is so soft-spoken that though we were sitting next to each other on a couch in his wood-paneled office, I later found that I could barely hear his voice on my tape recorder. He has an elegance that comes less from dress than from equipoise; he barely moves when he speaks, and he never hurries either a gesture or a word. Very few people have ever seen Annan lose his temper, and I found him virtually unprovokable. When I said that I heard that the U.S. representative to the U.N., Bill Richardson, had been very skeptical about the prospects of a peace initiative, Annan said, "That was the first meeting." Annan pronounced the word "meetin' "; he has a soft and slowly unfurling way with English that almost sounds more Caribbean than African. "When you start these things," he added, "you don't expect miracles and a rapid result."
It appeared, at this point, that the Clinton Administration still wanted war. At the same time, one Administration official told me, there was a real fear that a war Washington prosecuted virtually on its own could destroy the coalition that had supported sanctions, which was the core of U.S. policy to contain Iraq. As it became clear how little support there was for bombing -- even in this country -- Annan's diplomatic initiative began to look like a way off the limb the Administration had climbed onto, which is precisely the service that a Secretary General alone can perform. But Annan had also, in a subtle way, forced the Americans' hand. The Administration official said that "there was a strong chance Kofi would go anyway" -- even if the Americans asked him not to. "So we concluded that the wisest course was to shape the trip to serve the purposes of our policy." Annan confirmed for me that he would have gone even if the Americans opposed. "I had a constitutional duty to avert this kind of tragedy if I can," he said, in an echo of Hammarskjold's Peking Formula. When I asked him if it was an accident that he had created a dynamic that the Clinton Administration found irresistible, he laughed and said, "To some extent, no, it wasn't."
Still, by mid-February, with U.S. forces massing in the Gulf, the process had not yet produced a solution that Annan could bring to Baghdad. The sticking point involved the weapons inspectors in Iraq from the U.N. Special Commission, known as Unscom. The French had proposed that the Secretary General choose a separate team of inspectors for the presidential sites and that they be accompanied by foreign diplomats stationed in Baghdad. But both the Americans and the British had vowed to reject any proposal that compromised the integrity of Unscom. After a third meeting of the permanent five on Feb.16, Annan met in his office with his staff. He sat behind his desk with his arms crossed and mostly listened. The British and the Americans were still holding out, and Iqbal Riza, the chief of staff, suggested that Annan put forward proposals from the draft they themselves had devised. Annan said: "I don't think so. It would muddy the waters at this point. We need to have a good night's sleep and see what comes out of the capitals. At this time, the elements are not in our hands." Someone asked what would happen if the Americans didn't budge. Annan said, "Then we have 'Mission Impossible.' " There was a nervous laugh, and everyone repeated the phrase "Mission Impossible."
And then, the following afternoon, the logjam broke. An American diplomat now says that the Administration concluded that it could live with the idea of a team appointed by the Secretary General, so long as it was not seen as undermining Richard Butler, the chairman of Unscom. The Americans had also wanted Annan to leave with written instructions -- and Annan had vowed to go to Baghdad with unified backing -- but it proved impossible to produce a document that the Russians, Iraq's strongest supporter among the five, could sign. Instead, he received what Britain's U.N. representative John Weston called agreed advice. This was not altogether bad; Annan did not have a "mandate," but neither did he fly to Baghdad merely as a messenger. Saddam Hussein could see Annan as an independent actor; he could comply with Annan's terms without appearing to knuckle under to the Americans. Annan had managed, somehow, to come out from under the American shadow without losing the appearance of collective will that he needed to force Saddam's hand. And he had emerged with just enough flexibility to afford the Iraqis a face-saving solution.
On his way to Iraq, Annan told reporters, "I have all that is necessary to negotiate." This was greeted with widespread skepticism. One diplomat was quoted as giving Annan's mission a 20 percent chance of success. It appeared that the Americans still wanted to bomb, and perhaps Saddam, for his own reasons, preferred to be bombed. Annan, however, has an almost mystical faith in positive outcomes. Elisabeth Lindenmayer recalls flying with him to Baghdad in 1990, on the eve of the gulf war, to negotiate the release of foreigners held hostage. "I said to him in the plane: 'What if it doesn't work? What kind of contingency planning can we do?' And I remember him saying: 'Don't ever speak to me negatively when I'm about to negotiate. We'll make it -- and I don't want to hear that we may not make it.' " This is, Lindenmayer points out, a highly useful motivational strategy: "It's a bit like parents who say to a child, 'I know you can do it.' "
It is also, of course, a matter of temperament. Annan is a modern and thoroughly worldly man with an essentially archaic personality. He is descended from tribal chiefs on both sides of his family; three years ago, tribal elders asked if he would be willing to be considered for the position of Paramount Chief of the Akwamu region. (He politely declined.) Annan's father, though not a chief, was a hereditary noble who served as commissioner of the Ashanti region. Annan describes his father as forceful but reserved. He was an educated man who worked for a subsidiary of Unilever, and, Annan says, "My family moved in and out all the time from a traditional to a modern urban setting." Annan grew up, as he says, "atribal in a tribal world." When I asked him how his character was shaped by this world, he said, "I've always tried to lead a simple life, which in fact gives you more freedom and room to maneuver in adjusting to any setting in which you find yourself."
As a child, Annan was sent to Ghana's leading boarding school, and he later enrolled in the College of Science and Technology at Kumasi, a provincial capital. He wasn't active in Ghana's independence struggle; he wasn't even a member of a political party. He was a bright young man who would help lead Ghana into the modern world. At 20, he won a Ford Foundation scholarship that allowed him to complete his college education at Macalester College in St. Paul, an internationally minded school that, Annan recalls, flew the U.N. flag at all times. Annan was very happy there. Though he recalls one frightening incident, in which he narrowly escaped being assaulted for walking with a white girl, he also recalls that the Mayor of Minneapolis sent him a personal apology on official stationery. Annan always speaks fondly of America, though it is true that he speaks fondly of practically everything.
As a young man, he assumed that he would return to Ghana, but he says that a job he had been offered at a Pillsbury flour mill there fell through at the last moment; he may have also felt unwelcome in Ghana's increasingly undemocratic atmosphere. Instead, he took a job at the United Nations and moved to New York. In 1972 he got a degree in management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Annan has worked in Geneva, Addis Ababa and Cairo, but he has always returned to New York. He has two children, who are now in their 20's, from his first marriage to a Nigerian. In 1985 he married Nane Lagergren, a tall, beautiful Swede who, by some sort of cosmic configuration, is the niece of Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat famous for saving thousands of European Jews. Friends describe them as an almost magically harmonious couple.
Unlike Hammarskjold, or Boutros-Ghali, Annan is not an intellectually formidable figure; his tact often keeps him from saying anything even remotely interesting. Annan is not, in any case, an abstract thinker. Iqbal Riza, his chief of staff, says that the Secretary General "goes more on instinct and intuition than on calculation." His gifts are the gifts of character -- attentiveness, self-possession, clarity, an utter lack of pretense and a kindness that seems to spring from an impulse of protectiveness. One reporter I met in Baghdad told me of being pushed around by an Iraqi security agent and how, when Annan saw this happening, he detached himself from a knot of diplomats and gently touched the man's shoulder to get him to stop, which he did.
Annan comes from a world in which self-restraint is a fundamental attribute of strength. In ours, of course, it tends to register as a lack of gumption. He told me he was "amused" to be asked over and over if he was tough enough to face down Saddam Hussein.
Annan landed at the Saddam Hussein International Airport just outside of Baghdad at 6:30 on the evening of Feb. 20. A violent orange sun was just setting over the Tarmac, which was utterly empty and split here and there by weeds. He was met by Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, in military uniform -- not an encouraging sign of the Iraqi posture. Annan and Aziz each made brief remarks to the media and then were driven to the villa that had been assigned to the Secretary General, a big whitewashed structure with plaster chipping off the veranda. Over the next several days I would pass a good many hours in the villa's foyer, which was filled with such marvelous bits of racy European kitsch as a three-paneled painted mirror featuring a Regency dandy with a curled wig and a glass of punch. Four Iraqis from the protocol department squeezed together on one of the couches, chatting and drinking sweet tea.
When the negotiations began the following day at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Aziz and Annan were supposed to meet for half an hour and then join their staffs. Instead, they met for an hour and 20 minutes, occasionally calling in their legal counsels to mark up the draft agreement that Annan had brought with him. After months of intermittent conversations, both understood quite clearly where the limits of the possible lay, and they were able to clear lesser issues out of the way. The Iraqis had restated their position on the presidential sites, which Shashi Tharoor, one of Annan's closest aides, characterized as, " 'Come in, look at them, satisfy yourself thoroughly, see what they are and leave us in peace.' " This was a formulation that Annan couldn't accept. The "agreed advice" he'd been sent off with plainly stated that there could be no time limits placed on the inspections. Tharoor also said that he still had no idea where or when the Secretary General would meet with Saddam Hussein.
I spoke to Annan that afternoon in the large, scruffy garden behind the villa. He turned his chair to face straight into the sun; he has a phototropism that seems to amount to a form of homesickness. (When he lived in Geneva, Annan says, he used to light a fire every day to simulate sunshine.) Annan asked how the journalists were doing; he wanted to know if our hotel was all right. Given the immense pressure he was under, he seemed almost eerily calm. I was reminded of Tharoor's description of him as "a yogi." Annan had clearly made a leap of identification that morning with Iraqi sensitivities over the inspection of the presidential sites, which they had presented as a matter of not only national security but national dignity as well. "Talk to some of your Arab friends," he said to me, "ask them to talk about dignity. It's like Chinese losing face -- it's that important. It's not a joke. The sense of humiliation or losing your dignity or losing face -- they would die or go to war over that." Annan might have added, but of course did not, that he himself came from a culture in which dignity was paramount.
I asked about the pressure he was feeling from the Clinton Administration. Before he left for Baghdad he had spoken with both President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright. Clinton was reported to have told Annan not to "jam" him. Annan, however, denied that Clinton had admonished him and said that the White House had promised to correct that impression. (It never did.) With Albright, he conceded, "the tone was different." She had admonished him not to be taken in by Iraqi lies. Some in Annan's camp considered Albright the leader of the war party. "Is it unfortunate that she called Saddam the most evil man since Hitler?" I asked.
"Who?"
"Albright." Annan's eyebrows shot up, and he said, "Well," and then he thought better of saying anything at all, and he started to laugh. Annan often wound up staring warily at my tape recorder when I asked him about Albright. Annan is deeply grateful to her for the central role she played in his nomination, and in any case he would never breathe a syllable of derogation about her. But for a man so exquisitely attuned to matters of personal dignity, Albright's relentless questioning must have been grating. "Her style is a bit demanding," says an official close to Annan, "and he's at the receiving end of those demands." And an American official close to Albright says that she was worried that the Secretary General would give in to his yielding nature; she saw her job as yanking him back.
The negotiations that began Saturday morning lasted until 2 A.M. At that time, Shashi Tharoor considered the chances of success about 51-49; Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's U.N. representative, says that he would have laid similar odds. Both sides had known from the beginning that only President Hussein could reverse the Iraqis' insistence on limited, once-and-for-all inspections of the presidential sites. That night, Tariq Aziz finally let it drop that Saddam Hussein would see Annan the following day. There was a brief meeting at the Foreign Ministry that Sunday morning, and then Annan's team returned to the villa to wait for President Hussein's motorcade. Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, asked him about arrangements with the media, and Annan snapped, "You guys just don't understand" -- the only time throughout the long weekend that a wavelet disrupted his smooth surface.
Soon after reaching the Presidential Palace, Annan suggested to Saddam that they meet without their aides. "The Secretary General was extremely wise to have requested to see him alone," says Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian Foreign Minister who was serving as Annan's personal envoy in Iraq and who has known Saddam since 1973. "If you told Saddam Hussein, in front of other people, 'Unless you do this, a strike is inevitable,' he's the kind of man who would say: 'I can't give in to threats. So be it, and goodbye.' But in private you can tell him about it."
Saddam may have felt that he could make concessions to an African that he could not bring himself to make to a Westerner. Annan says that Saddam's manner was "very correct, very calm, almost serene." Perhaps Saddam had already accepted the principle of open-ended inspections of the presidential sites before they even sat down. The Russians had already told Hussein that even they would not support him if he insisted on time limits. But he made it clear, as Aziz had before, that he was making concessions out of a feeling of personal trust for Annan. In the coming months, as the Iraqis look to Annan to make the case for ending sanctions in exchange for compliance, this trust may create a burden of expectations that Annan will not be able to satisfy.
The following morning, I showed up at the villa at 8, and Annan agreed to meet with me briefly. He had been up late telephoning heads of state and foreign ministers to brief them on the Memorandum of Understanding. At 2:30, while he was trying to get a little sleep, Albright had called and insisted he be woken up. Most of the leaders he spoke with were euphoric, Annan told me; Albright was not. He didn't get much sleep after that.
I was ushered into an elegant sitting room, where I found Annan sitting bolt upright on the edge of an Empire couch, as if in rigid defiance of his obvious exhaustion. When I asked how he felt about the negotiations, his face lighted up with a combination of bewilderment and delight. "It's really quite something," he said. "The concentration and attention, the creativity that you need to move people along and to convince them." Annan's diplomacy of self-abnegation required a draining sensitivity to the moods and psychic needs of others. As Hammarskjold once wrote, "The others' 'face' is more important than your own."
Sitting with his hands in his lap, as elegant and immobile as always, he went on to say: "What comes out of this, in my sense, is, We say Iraq is isolated from the international community, but the international community is also isolated. We want them to comply, but I'm not sure we make the effort to understand what is going on. I believe that we have demonized Iraq, and maybe with some justification. But to not go beyond that.. . ." Annan wanted the world, and especially the Americans, to engage Iraq as he had.
That morning, Annan also had a meeting with the Iraqi Vice President, Taha Yassin Ramadan, to discuss the U.N.'s oil-for-food program. The program permits Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil; the U.N. uses the proceeds to buy food and medical supplies. Recognizing the catastrophic effect of the sanctions, and looking perhaps for a carrot to offer in exchange for compliance on the inspections issue, the U.N. Security Council had recently voted to permit Iraq to pump $5.2 billion worth of oil over the next six months, up from $2 billion. But the Iraqis had complained that their oil industry was too crippled to pump all that oil and had asked to meet with Annan to renegotiate the deal. I was able to slip into this meeting with the Secretary General's delegation. Ramadan cracked a few jokes about the international media, and the Ministers of Oil, Trade and Foreign Affairs laughed heartily. Ramadan lectured the Secretary General on the terms of the new oil-for-food regime. The Ministers for Oil, Trade and Foreign Affairs corrected the translator every minute or so. The Secretary General flexed his fingertips and said nothing.
Then it was Annan's turn, and he said: "I was so surprised and even frankly disappointed at the note which came after approval of the $5.2 billion. . . .After the discussions that we had gone through, I would have expected at least a little thank-you for those people here who worked hard and helped make it happen." He told Ramadan, "You should try to moderate your language." He was lecturing the Iraqis on manners! It was a bracing spectacle, and Ramadan took it in perfect, and possibly stunned, silence. Fred Eckhard said afterward that he had never heard his boss talk that way. Some of the people around Annan believe that he "revealed himself" in Baghdad -- that he had begun to act more like a general than a secretary.
It is now widely agreed that Annan made one blunder in the long course of his diplomatic demarche: in his initial press conference on his return to New York from Baghdad, he said, "I think I can do business with" Saddam. It was this comment that moved Trent Lott to denounce not only Annan but also President Clinton, who Lott said had "subcontracted" American foreign policy to the forces of appeasement. Annan says he was only stating a fact -- he just had done business with Saddam. But the reaction proved how pointless it would be for the Secretary General to try to convince America that it is as isolated from Iraq as Iraq is from it.
Annan's triumph would be a personal one, not a vindication of multilateralism and the principle of diplomatic engagement. An Administration official asked him to knock off the Saddam-is-human line, and he agreed.
But Annan never really became radioactive; it was simply too obvious that the agreement he had signed included everything the Americans had asked for and nothing they had feared. An Administration official says that Annan supplied explanations of the agreement, including reassurances that Richard Butler, the chairman of Unscom, would not have his role compromised by the inclusion of "diplomatic escorts" on inspection teams at the presidential sites, nor by the Secretary General's new role in appointing members to those teams.
Butler's own reaction to the agreement was pivotal. He had been privately skeptical of the added diplomatic contingent, and he could have easily torpedoed the plan. But Annan met with him immediately after returning to New York and assured him that his role had not been diminished. He also asked Butler to appear on several of the Sunday television talk shows to which Annan himself had been invited. I asked Butler if he took this invitation as a public gesture of confidence, and he said, "I took it as such, and he meant it at such." Butler went on to lavish praise on Annan. "He brought home the bacon," he said. No less important, the Iraqis behaved according to the letter of the agreement in the first tests of the new procedures.
Bill Richardson credits the agreement to "Annan's personal diplomacy coupled with a formula that only he, through his stature, could sell to the Iraqis." By the time Annan went to Washington, he was a man to be embraced rather than shunned. President Clinton said that he "deserves the thanks" of the American people. Clinton also said, "If we expect to play a leadership role, we have to pay our U.N. dues."
Annan shed peace and gentility all over town. When he emerged from a conference room to greet Senator Jesse Helms, he was followed by a knot of reporters and staff members, and he said, "Don't worry -- we're a large force, but we're a friendly force." On Iraq, Helms told him, "Given what you had to work with, you did a very good job" -- a staggering concession, given Helms's usual views. Annan has plainly made inroads with the crusty chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: He paid Helms a visit soon after being named Secretary General, and Helms ultimately co-sponsored legislation that would have repaid much of the U.S. debt to the U.N., albeit with a series of crippling conditions (including a proviso that the General Accounting Office would be allowed to examine the U.N.'s books).
Still, Helms is scarcely a convert to multilateralism. When the two men emerged from their meeting, a reporter asked the Senator if the U.S. owed the U.N. a debt of gratitude, and Helms shot back, "The question is, Does the U.N. owe the United States and American taxpayers a debt of gratitude?"
Still, Annan and his staff were ebullient. The President had said that he was committed to getting the arrears paid. Not only Iraq, but even U.N. reform, which had been used in the past to justify withholding funds, was a nonissue. After a long day courting Administration figures and senators, Annan returned to his hotel and said: "A lot has happened between last year and now. As I mentioned to Senator Helms, when we met last year, I said that the U.N. needed reform and needed to be more efficient. At that point, it was promises. Now we've done quite a lot of the things we said we would do." Annan had cut a thousand jobs from the bureaucracy, appointed highly respected officials to top posts, created a cabinet to replace the system in which autonomous officials reported only to the Secretary General. He had, as he said, delivered.
If this had been a popularity contest, Annan would have won. But of course it wasn't. Last year, a group of conservatives led by Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey had insisted that legislation authorizing back payments to the U.N. be accompanied by language prohibiting financing of groups that lobby foreign governments to liberalize abortion law. President Clinton had vowed to veto any bill containing the abortion language, thus killing the whole package. The same thing appears to be happening now. (As of last week, a bill was scheduled to go to conference.) Annan's political advisers were hoping that if the legislation died or was vetoed, Speaker Newt Gingrich would step in and reintroduce the repayments legislation on its own. Gingrich is clearly trying to establish his credentials as an internationalist, but when I mentioned this scenario to a Congressional staff member who has been deeply involved with the issue, he said, "I wouldn't bet the mortgage on it." Representative Smith would oppose such a bill, and he would very likely carry the House. "Whatever the Speaker wishes," he said, "there's no way out." Article 19 of the U.N. charter stipulates that any member who falls more than two years behind in dues loses its vote in the General Assembly. Absent Congressional action, the U.S. will fall afoul of the rule by next January.
It's tempting to blame the whole mess on American politics, as some people in the U.N. do. But this is to forget the larger ideological atmosphere within which the U.N. operates. It's unreasonable to expect any nation with the dominant position America now enjoys to embrace the U.N.'s multilateral principles. But American moralism and exceptionalism only make it harder to accept the self-restraint that comes with collective decision making. As Secretary of State Albright said recently: "We are the indispensable nation. We stand tall. We see further into the future." Why should such a nation permit its vision to be cramped by diplomacy? Why should it stand by while the U.N. satisfies a tyrant's craving for dignity? Senator Lott wasn't the only conservative outraged by Annan's role. When I asked John Bolton, an Assistant Secretary of State in the Bush Administration, about Annan's role, he drew a distinction between the good multilateralism of the gulf war, when the U.S. rallied the U.N. to its position, and the bad multilateralism of today, when the Administration acts as if the U.N. "has a life or existence outside of what the U.S. wants it to do." Bolton would have had the U.S. send Annan to Iraq to deliver an ultimatum, as Perez de Cuellar did in 1991. (Hussein humiliated the Secretary General by keeping him waiting outside his office for hours.) Now, he says, "you can't put the Secretary General back in the closet when it's inconvenient."
Unilateralism is the anti-U.N. position of the conservative foreign-policy elite. At ground level, what's more common is the isolationism of a continental nation. Roscoe Bartlett, a Republican Congressman and one of 13 signatories of a bill proposing to end American membership in the U.N., says that many of his constituents oppose U.N. membership. "They think that our participation in the U.N. is infringing on our sovereignty, infringing on our personal property rights," he said. "They are appalled when they enter one of our national parks and see a sign that says, 'You are entering a U.N. Biosphere Preserve' " -- a reference to a Unesco program. "There are people who genuinely believe that our interests are best served if we become weaker and weaker," Bartlett added, "and the U.N. becomes stronger and stronger, so they ultimately have a bigger army than we do so they can keep the world peace. These people are called globalists, new-world-order, one-world-government people. Our President is a globalist."
Annan had invited me to lunch in his private dining room a few days before his trip to Washington. We ate salad with gravlax and rib lamb chops -- first white wine, then red -- and we were served by a waiter in black tie. Annan was, as always, genuinely warm and utterly unrevealing. Only when I told him about my conversations with Bolton and Bartlett did he show sparks. "I don't know what else they expect," he said. "We have gone through reforms, and then I go to Baghdad and try to defuse the crisis, which is what the U.N. is about. . . .That becomes another reason for not paying. I know Americans, because I've lived here. Americans don't like to be deadbeats. I feel frustrated and saddened, because this is not the America I know. Americans are a generous people, and they like to keep their commitments." He quoted an official of the European Union as saying what Annan himself would never say directly: " 'The way the U.S. is behaving on this issue is destroying trust among nations.' " He was waving a bony index finger at me. It was the closest thing to a sustained outburst I ever heard from him.
What Annan is trying to point to, within the limits of his politesse, is the insincerity of the American, or at least the Republican, position. Annan has, as he puts it, delivered. He has made meaningful headway on reform, though he does have a long way to go. He did not sell out America in Baghdad. He called his critics' bluff, and it turns out to have been, in the end, a bluff. The real point is that for virtually any American politician, the U.N. is utterly expendable. No one will ever lose any votes by bashing the U.N.
It is no longer easy to say what it means to be a great Secretary General, as it might have been 30 or 40 years ago. The great powers, and specifically the United States, would not tolerate another Hammarskjold even if one arose. And the quagmire of Bosnia has offered unforgettable proof of the limits of U.N. peacekeeping efforts in the absence of great-power commitment. What the U.N. needs now, in any case, is not heroism but purpose. Last year, Razali Ismail, a Malaysian diplomat and a former president of the General Assembly, spoke of the danger of "creeping irrelevance." What he meant was that as states define their interest increasingly in economic rather than political terms, institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank come to the fore and the U.N. recedes.
Kofi Annan does not, of course, buy this line of analysis. "My sense is that we need the U.N. today perhaps more than ever," he says. "And despite the perception that the U.N. is under siege, I think the world is going to realize how much we need this organization as we move toward the millennium. We need to insure that we have the norms to regulate relations among states, and we need to take on the whole range of issues that no country, no matter how powerful -- even the U.S. -- can deal with by itself, whether it's the environment, drugs, terrorism, health or sustainable development."
Yet right now, the U.N. plays a secondary role even in most of these matters. Annan has to make the case for the U.N.; he almost has to embody the case for the U.N. This will not be easy for him. Self-advertisement is contrary to his nature, as is melodrama. He is a rather wooden and platitudinous public speaker. I recently heard him give a brief speech in which he used the phrase "joking aside." Only then did I realize that he considered his previous line a joke.
One often hears the idea that Annan must not only embody but transcend the U.N. if he is to rescue the organization from its own marginality. Mark Malloch Brown, a World Bank official who has known Annan since the early 1980's and recently served as chairman of an advisory group for him, says of the Secretary General: "Here's a guy who has been a creature of the U.N. for 30 years, and yet all his life he's been a little bit bigger and greater than those around him. And now you see him flashing in and out of being limited by the U.N."
Not long ago, Malloch Brown says, he warned his friend about the dangers of becoming "a first-year U Thant" -- a kindly, respected figure who allows himself to be confined by "the diplomatic salons on the East River." Iraq, says Malloch Brown, "is the first major step out of the box." But the mission to Iraq, and the colossal diligence and patience and tact it required, may come more naturally to Annan than the mission to the United States he now must undertake. Hammarskjold had it easy by comparison.

HEADLINE: The da Vinci of Data

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SHAPLEY 

 BODY:
It is well past noon and the 286 Manhattan office workers have been kept in their chairs all morning with another four hours to go. Still, they're hooting in guilty laughter as they stare at the confident emcee, who is striding around in front of a large pair of screens.
A blank blue rectangle appears on each screen behind him. "Here it is," announces Edward R. Tufte, the author of three books on information design. "The lowest resolution information interface known to humankind. The dreaded overhead projector." His audience laughs. 
 Now Mr. Tufte reads, sonorously, the four words that have appeared in white type. "Action Plan. Part A." More laughter.
Then Mr. Tufte turns angry, saying that such displays are no better than striptease. "They don't tell the audience anything," he says, adding that presenting information this way is "denying, censoring, masking information, not telling what's really going on."
Thus runs the well-honed sermon of one of the information age's admired prophets, a man who succeeds at proselytizing, winning converts and turning a profit in the process.
Mr. Tufte, who has made his name first in the world of statistics and then in the world of graphic design, has become a one-man industry. In an age when information is a commodity, he is on a quest to recast it as something unique. The quest, thus far, has grossed about $25 million.
In March, while on spring break from Yale University, where he is a professor of political science, Mr. Tufte (pronounced TUFF-tee) packed from 300 to 500 listeners at each of four all-day seminars. Each paid $300 to attend. Mr. Tufte has given 25 to 30 such seminars a year since 1993, grossing an estimated $9 million.
A take of about $390,000 for four days of work might seem enough. But the sessions have an additional benefit. His clients, who receive free copies of his books, sometimes end up serving as surrogate salesmen for the works of Mr. Tufte's Graphics Press, a homegrown imprint he operates from the garage of his home in Cheshire, Conn., and from a warehouse.
He published the first book, "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information," in 1983, after withdrawing it from Harvard University Press, because, he said, it would not let him participate in the design. He took seven years to prepare the second, "Envisioning Information," published in 1990, and another seven years for the third, "Visual Explanations," published last year.
The 1997 and 1983 books were No. 7 and No. 8 on the 1997 best-seller list for the on-line bookseller Amazon.com. His 1990 book was No. 36. The three have sold 505,000 copies, he said, including 100,000 copies of the newest book. They retail for $40, $48 and and $45 respectively, putting his gross take at $16 million -- a figure he does not dispute.
This for a man who 15 years ago was best known for four titles on political economy, who did some election-year statistical consulting for organizations like The New York Times and who had to take out a second mortgage on his house to publish "Visual Display."
The question is why, in the late 1990's, are these oversized, pricey books on data art, one of which is 15 years old, selling like hot cakes? The answer is that his skills seem uniquely suited to the moment: he knows how to turn seas of information into navigable -- even scenic -- waterways.
The answer he himself gives shows an ego as multidimensional as any of his graphics. The books sell, Mr. Tufte said, "because they are such beautiful books." What he seeks to do is produce collectors' items: a map of Swiss mountains in the second volume had to pass though the printer's press 23 times before Mr. Tufte was satisfied.
But analysts in the publishing industry say Mr. Tufte has followed the path of other successful self-publishers. Vanity presses and small publishers have generated more and more sales while the top publishing houses' share of the market has shrunk. The number of self-published books has tripled over the last 10 years, said John Kremer, the editor of Book Marketing Update.
To sell his first book back in 1983, Mr. Tufte designed an advertisement and published it in Scientific American. Within days, his post office box in Cheshire was jammed with orders, giving him enough income to put covers on the first print run of 5,000.
His second book, "Envisioning Information," cost $700,000 to design and produce, he said. The take from its sales could be $5 million.
The books are successful, Mr. Kremer said, because "Tufte has titles he is passionate about.
"He's going to a target market he knows will be passionate about the same subject," he said.
Bonnie Scranton, graphics director for Newsweek magazine, who worked for Mr. Tufte for three years, said: "With the invention of desktop publishing, and more access to data banks that people couldn't access before, more people are using visual solutions. There's an information explosion. So he appeals to people who are scientists, or lawyers, people in all sorts of professions who never had to do design before."
The crowd that heard Mr. Tufte in the Marriott Grand Ballroom this month was testimony to this new aspect of American work. Mark Hicks took a co-worker from the New York Stock Exchange because they use screen displays to monitor the placement of orders from the trading floor.
There were also two neuroscientists from New York University, an airline executive, and a vice president at J. P. Morgan.
Audiences become silent as Mr. Tufte leads them through the part of his new book that reproduces the faxes Morton Thiokol engineers sent to NASA on the eve of the 1986 launch of the space shuttle Challenger. If the engineers had shown the correlation between low air temperature and damage to rocket O-ring seals in past launches in a single chart, NASA might have agreed not to launch the shuttle in what the space agency knew would be record cold weather, Mr. Tufte contends.
Mr. Tufte also rails about most World Wide Web sites. His main complaint: that computer executives and programmers take away most of the screen space with buttons and banners. Because content is ignored, "the most common activity at Web sites is fleeing the Web site," Mr. Tufte told his New York audience.
Then he opened his new book to a graphic showing bad page design and an information-rich Web page he had designed. One of the sites he recommends because it delivers more information on the early screens is amazon.com -- which happens to feature his books.
After his presentation, Mr. Tufte seemed exhilarated. "Just as I did with publishing, I am expanding my teaching to reach people directly," he said.
There was a rare silence before he answered a question about making so much money. Then he said: "The economic success is a happy byproduct of doing the books and telling people about them. It's fine to be productive economically, but I would do it anyway because I believe in this."

HEADLINE: For $19.95, Slate Sees Who Its Friends Are

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
It is a clear, shining day in Washington, a world away from the Seattle rain. The budding cherry blossoms hint at spring. And Michael Kinsley, the editor and creator of Microsoft's on-line magazine Slate, is pacing the bare parquet floors of a one-bedroom apartment, considering whether to rent it.
Mr. Kinsley has been feeling out of touch with the buzz of the Beltway these days and, perhaps to reconnect, he has agreed to occasionally return to his chair on CNN's "Crossfire," where he became a celebrity liberal for butting heads with the conservative Pat Buchanan. 
 An apartment rental? Crossfire redux? Is Michael Kinsley getting cold feet? Has the uncharted boundlessness of cyberspace left him pining for the knowable confines of the capital?
On the contrary, Mr. Kinsley, 47, insists. He has become a zealous convert to the Pacific Northwest -- Slate is based in Redmond, Wash. He bought land. He carries one of those wallets that closes with Velcro.
He recycles. He has even taken up snowshoeing.
Nevertheless, Mr. Kinsley could be forgiven for feeling a little skittish at the moment. Earlier this month, the gate came down on free visitors to Slate; now people who want to read the magazine have to pay for it.
It is not a lot of money in the scheme of things: $19.95 for a year's subscription and the magazine still offers a free "front porch," its home page.
But paying anything at all is radical stuff for the Internet, and the venture is being watched closely as a test of the potential profitability of the Internet.
"The going price on the Internet now is free, and to charge anything more than that you have to have a project that is very unique," said Bill Bass, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., a technology research company in Cambridge, Mass. "A lot of the stuff that's worked well on line has a financial purpose or is a game or pornography. And Slate doesn't fall into any of these categories."
Slate (www.slate.com) is radical in its way -- not just because it is trying to get readers to pay but because it has set out to help define a category that did not exist, a product straddling several worlds. It arguably has the depth and analysis of print, the immediacy of radio and television, the bells and whistles of Web sites. Some articles are carefully conceived, some go out on the Web without editing. Slate calls itself a weekly yet updates its contents daily.
Mr. Kinsley says he is learning as he goes along, about things like how to strike the right tone.
"There is a voice of the Web that's developing -- I've taken some hits for complaining about its insularity and smugness," he said. "But there is also its casualness and informality, and we certainly have evolved over the last year and a half more in that direction and away from traditional magazine pieces."
There are print-oriented people who find Slate too "Webby," cyber-savvy people who find it too mired in old models. "It's still to me very inside the media elite -- it's like they're ricocheting things off each others' computers," said James Wolcott, a media critic who was tough on the magazine in Vanity Fair last year. "One of the things really missing from it, what Salon really has, is a pop sensibility."
In going to paid circulation, Slate is largely out there on its own. While a few publications like The Wall Street Journal and the Economist charge for their on-line versions, general interest publications with Web sites are in a wait-and-see mode. The economics seem attractive -- no paper, printing or postage costs -- but there have already been casualties. Recently, the webzines Word and Charged folded before even trying paid subscriptions.
And over the last few months, the Microsoft Corporation has scaled back its Internet media efforts, including layoffs at Sidewalk, its on-line city guides. As a result, many people in the publishing world are wary of placing their bets on the future of Slate. "If they pull it off, there are going to be a lot of publishers out there dancing in the streets," Mr. Bass said, "because nobody on the content side is running profitably right now."
Mr. Kinsley said navigating such new territory "makes this very interesting but also very hard."
"It's as if you were founding a paper magazine and said, O.K., we chopped down the trees, now what?" he said.
Slate has planned to go paid since its inception in June 1996. Mr. Kinsley backed away once before -- in February 1997. Finally, the moment felt as right as it ever would. "It seemed to me, we'd been putting it out for over a year and it was time to fish or cut bait," Mr. Kinsley said. "It's important to us to break even and to be a business, not someone's charity case."
To Microsoft, the move is not just philosophically important but financially necessary. Advertisers are proceeding with caution when it comes to Slate because the audience numbers remain relatively low.
"It became clear that, on an ad-only basis, it wasn't going to work," said Peter Neupert, Microsoft's vice president of news and publishing. "I didn't see it scaling big enough and the ad marketplace accepting it quick enough to meet our objectives in terms of turning the corner."
Slate and Microsoft said they had already received more than 17,000 subscription orders and hoped to reach 20,000 over the next few months. But that number is a far cry from the 95,000 circulation enjoyed by The New Republic, where Mr. Kinsley worked on and off for almost 20 years. Or the 218,000 currently enjoyed by Harper's, where Mr. Kinsley briefly served as editor in 1981. How much readership Slate has lost since the transition on March 9 is difficult to gauge because of the vagaries of Internet measurement. In January, when the Monica Lewinsky story first broke, the site received 270,000 visits, many from repeat readers.
The current subscriber response gets the magazine to a mere $340,000 in revenue; Slate's annual operating costs have been estimated at $5 million by analysts. The subscriber response is not a number that gets advertisers excited. Slate would not disclose ad revenue figures.
"We're not even talking about critical mass here," Paula Brooks, the media director at the ad agency Margeotes/Fertitta & Partners, said. "A magazine with 100,000 circulation is not truly viable."
Slate will now have to spend money to win new readers, just like print publications; it plans to market the magazine with ads on other sites and with targeted E-mail. And given the hurdles ahead, Rogers Weed, Slate's publisher, said he is prepared to ultimately accept defeat.
"It's very possible that the Web is just not the place for publications like Slate that have a more limited appeal," he said.
Slate's writers, many of whom have left mainstream publications for cyberspace, may be less quick to surrender. It has been hard enough to see Slate's audience drop since going paid, however unavoidable.
"This is much more of casting your bread upon the waters," said Jodie T. Allen, Slate's Washington editor, who came to Slate from The Washington Post and covers Congress. "The aides don't know who I am anymore."
While Slate has developed a loyal following among many people in the news media and politics, some say the magazine has yet to develop real influence. "Mike Kinsley could make the earth move with his column in The New Republic," said Stephen G. Smith, the editor of National Journal. "He can't do that with Slate."
To gain more clout, Mr. Kinsley has to figure out how to make the new medium work for the largest possible audience -- i.e., how to get people to read long pieces in a fast-moving medium that you can not easily curl up with on the couch. "That's our biggest problem," Mr. Kinsley said. "You have to reward people. You have to offer them things they can't get on paper to compensate."
That is why Slate offers audio poetry readings along with its featured weekly poem, film clips with some movie reviews. And why, in its printed edition -- which has a circulation in the low hundreds -- Slate often reminds readers what they are missing out on electronically.
Slate has also tried to be more Web-specific, offering "hot links" to let readers click on interesting tangents. In an essay on Gertrude Stein, for example, readers were invited to "Click here for an excerpt from 'Lifting Belly,' a witty unpublished love poem she wrote to Alice B. Toklas."
"In print, these would have to be footnotes," said Judith Shulevitz, Slate's New York editor. "But on the Web, they come off as a secondary level of discourse."
Depending on whom you talk to, Slate's move to paid subscriptions is either brave or foolhardy. "They may make it because they have the deep pocket to wait out the market until it matures," said Stefanie Symon, the co-founder and executive editor of the Web magazine Feed, who also expects to switch to paid subscriptions eventually.
While Microsoft and Slate may have been eager to develop a new revenue stream, both said they expect that bringing Slate into the black will take patience.
"I have made it clear to them that the experience of the magazine world is that it takes seven or eight years," Mr. Kinsley said. As to whether he will stick around until then, he said: "I could well, I could well not. Have I ever done anything for seven or eight years?"
Mr. Kinsley said he began feeling a little bit out out of the loop when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke. "The average person on the street in Washington can do about eight layers of interpretation on Lewinsky," he said. "So you sort of feel out of it if you can only do five or six. It reinforced the notion that it's important to spend more time here."
For the moment, however, Mr. Kinsley said he likes hiking in the mountains and wearing plaid flannel shirts to the office. And despite continuing speculation about whether he will grow restless, the editor's colleagues say his commitment is passionate. "People do not have any idea how much work he has put into this," Ms. Shulevitz said. "And how hard it would be to walk away."

HEADLINE: Equal Work, Less-Equal Perks;
Microsoft Leads the Way in Filling Jobs With 'Permatemps'

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash.

 BODY:
They hold high-prestige, high-technology jobs at Microsoft's plush campus. They often do the same work as the Microsoft Corporation's permanent employees, developing CD-ROM's, designing World Wide Web sites and writing software manuals. Yet they do not qualify for Microsoft's coveted stock options, and their health and vacation benefits are pale imitations of those enjoyed by regular Microsoft workers.
They are long-term temps -- a seeming oxymoron, but in fact a new and growing phenomenon in the American work force, embraced by many corporations, especially high-tech ones, including Microsoft, AT&T, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft's Seattle neighbor, Boeing. 
 Microsoft is perhaps the leading practitioner of the trend, employing about 5,000 temps, including 1,500 long-term ones, meaning they have worked for the software colossus for at least one year. These temps work next to Microsoft's 17,000 domestic employees.
Some prefer the flexibility and the higher take-home pay that temp status affords, but many assail temping as a backdoor way to create a two-tier work force. The benefits that the lower tier loses out on, many temps say, far outweigh whatever extra pay they take home.
"It's a system of having two classes of people and instilling fear and inferiority and loathing," said Rebecca Hughes, who worked for three years as a temp at Microsoft, helping edit its CD-ROM on health care.
With work lives strung together by three-month contracts, some temps have worked at Microsoft for more than five years and have seized on an awkward term to describe their awkward status: permatemps.
John Schussler has received a half-dozen promotions since going to work as a tester for Microsoft in 1992, looking for bugs in the endless lines of computer code that make up the company's software products. Now a program manager, he oversees the 18 people who run Cinemania and Music Central On-Line, the company's movie information service and 24-hour music store.
But he does not have the one thing he wants most: a permanent Microsoft job and the benefits that go with it. "Why is it that the guy next to me, who does the same work as me, is a permanent employee and can afford to buy a house, and I'm still in an apartment?" he asks.
Microsoft insists that Mr. Schussler's temp agency, Rho Tech, is his employer, although he works on the Microsoft campus, is supervised by Microsoft managers and uses Microsoft equipment. He says he has almost no contact with Rho Tech, which deducts his taxes, sends his paycheck and provides a bare-bones health plan.
In this era of intense competition and change, management theorists have recommended that corporations stick to their core capabilities and maintain core work forces. The corollary is that companies should hire out for noncore activities.
Microsoft's temps may feel their contingent status more keenly than other temps, largely because the software giant's well-known policy of giving stock options to employees has made many of the temps' co-workers millionaires, thanks to Microsoft's soaring stock price.
From the start, Mr. Schussler said in a recent interview, he made clear to management that he wanted a permanent job, known as "headcount" in Microsoft jargon. "Everyone knows headcount at Microsoft is the Holy Grail," he said.
But his managers repeatedly told him that while they were eager to keep him because of his good work, they wanted to fill the limited number of permanent slots allotted them with the scarcest commodity in high tech: programmers.
Sharon L. Decker, director of Microsoft's Contingent Staffing Group, defended the company's use of temps, saying many would rather be temps than permanent employees.
"There's a recognition that this kind of free agent approach is growing -- people want to be able to negotiate their own employment," she said. "These workers like the flexibility. They like the ability to work for six months and then go skiing."
But Ms. Hughes, the editor, said Microsoft used temps principally to skimp on benefits. "If Microsoft cannot afford to treat all its employees well," she said, "then no company in the history of the world could."
 
The Math
Filling Jobs, Saving Money
 In 1986, the number of temps employed each day was 800,000, but, according to the National Association of Temporary and Staffing Services, the number soared to 2.5 million last year or about 2 percent of the work force. At least 200,000 of them are long-term temps.
By some estimates, temps now represent at least 10 percent of the work force at one-fifth of American corporations.
Managers argue that using temps is ideal for the modern market's demands for efficiency and flexibility. Many employees say it dovetails with their desire for independence and for stimulating challenges.
Peg Cheirrett, president of the Wasser Group, which supplies temps to Microsoft, said using temps in a volatile industry was humane because they had no false expectations. "When people know it's a temporary arrangement," she said, "someday when the assignment ends, there's not a sense of a broken trust."
Ms. Decker rejected the idea that the company used temps to save money on benefits. Microsoft, she said, is encouraging temp agencies to provide more generous benefits. But even the improved benefits pale next to Microsoft's.
Ms. Decker also asserted that many temps earned more an hour than regular workers -- an assertion many temps challenge. Temps may earn $18 an hour as testers and $50 an hour as hot-shot programmers.
A technical editor might earn $30 an hour at Microsoft. This means the worker will cost about $70,000 a year -- $60,000 in basic wages and $10,000 in benefits, including Social Security and unemployment taxes and bare-bones health, 401(k) and vacation benefits. If the temp works 200 hours overtime, that could mean $9,000 extra, although workers complain that a new Washington State regulation allows companies to stop paying computer professionals time-and-a-half for overtime.
In comparison, a permanent editor might have a $57,000 salary, but could cost Microsoft $94,000 a year -- $17,000 for a richer benefits package, including vacation, holidays and generous 401(k) contributions, plus discount stock purchase plan and stock options that might be worth $20,000 or more. Salaried employees do not receive overtime pay.
In this way, Microsoft might save $24 million for every 1,000 temps it uses, excluding overtime.
Irene Pasternack, a technical writer at Microsoft, said she preferred temping to a permanent job. "I have two small children at home, and this gives me much more flexibility than a regular worker has," she said. "The other benefit is it's easier to take more time off for vacation."
Under the law, corporations are free to use long-term temps, but these workers are increasingly suing companies, asserting that they deserve the same benefits as regular workers. The temps' claims touch on a murky area: whether their employer is a temp agency or the agency's client, that is, the company where they work. The courts and the Internal Revenue Service are wrestling with these issues; the answer hinges on who controls the worker.
In interviews with more than three dozen long-term temps -- most insisted on anonymity for fear of being dismissed -- many complained that companies relied on temps to loosen their ties to workers. Employers, for instance, do not have to pay severance to laid-off temps.
"It's one more strategy in which companies are seeking to avoid their responsibilities to their workers," said Amy Dean, the A.F.L-C.I.O.'s chief organizer in Silicon Valley.
 
The History
A Ruling Leads To Reclassifying
Microsoft and many other companies embraced the use of long-term temps in the early 1990's, after the I.R.S. told the companies that they had erroneously classified thousands of people who were working full time at company facilities as independent contractors. After the I.R.S. found that these workers were common-law employees, it ordered the companies to pay overdue taxes.
In response, many companies switched these contractors to temp status, often telling them to sign up with a temp agency, which then sent the workers to their old companies and old jobs.
Microsoft is locked in a five-year-old legal battle with hundreds of independent contractors and temps who insist they should be considered regular employees and receive the same benefits as regular employees.
Ms. Decker said 30 percent of Microsoft's temps have worked there for more than a year, and 8 percent for more than two years.
Microsoft officials suggest that the large number of long-term temps is an accident, noting that the company has dozens of nearly autonomous groups, with many using temps who are expected to leave when a group finishes with them. But many temps hop between groups.
John McGowan Jr., a Cleveland lawyer who advises companies on temps, said: "If you're talking about recruiting, on a regular and recurring basis, a whole work force that you're saying are not your employees, you're opening a Pandora's box. If you're doing it as an end run around employment laws, it can come back to haunt you."
 
The Law
Issues: Back Pay, Future Status
 In January, the Supreme Court dealt Microsoft a major setback by refusing to hear its appeal in a lawsuit that raises daunting questions about high-tech America's widespread use of temps.
Stating that Microsoft's contingent workers were regular employees, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco ruled, en banc, last July that Microsoft had wrongly denied millions of dollars in benefits to hundreds of workers who were independent contractors.
The plaintiffs' lawyers assert that the court also ruled that Microsoft owed benefits to thousands of temporary employees, too. But Microsoft is challenging this interpretation.
The stakes are high, because the circuit court has stated that the plaintiffs -- the former independent contractors, and perhaps the temps, too -- are entitled to participate in Microsoft's discount stock purchase plan, which has provided participants with fabulous returns.
Under that plan, regular workers can buy its shares at a discount of 15 percent or more. The plaintiffs argue that if they were treated as regular employees instead of contractors, they each would have bought hundreds of shares when the stock sold for a tenth of today's price. The plaintiffs are seeking an award of hundreds of millions of dollars from Microsoft.
The appeals court also ruled that Microsoft was arbitrary in excluding contingent workers from its 401(k) plan, in which Microsoft provides a 50 percent match, up to 6 percent of an employee's income.
The court rejected Microsoft's argument that the plaintiffs did not deserve benefits because they had signed agreements stating they had no employer-employee relationship with Microsoft and were not due company benefits. The court ruled that since the workers were common-law employees, they should qualify for benefits because the benefit plans said they covered all common-law employees.
Frightened by the implications, companies and industry groups rallied behind Microsoft. "These people are earning more on a per-hour basis than regular employees to help them pay for benefits," said Mark Nebergall, vice president for tax policy at the Software Publishers Association. "They can't complain that they're getting higher salaries and then turn around and say they deserve regular benefits, too."
In arguing that long-term temps are due the same benefits as regular Microsoft workers, the plaintiffs say that temp agencies differ little from payroll services that merely send paychecks and deduct taxes. "A payroll agency is not an employer at all," Stephen K. Strong, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said. "They work on Microsoft's campus. They work full time under Microsoft supervisors. They are producing Microsoft products. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. They are undeniably Microsoft employees."
 
A Temp's-Eye View
Painful for Some, Fine for Others
 In Microsoft's corporate directory, temps have an "A--" before their E-mail addresses to designate them as agency employees. In Microsoft parlance, they are called "A dashes," but many dub themselves "alien dashes" and "dash trash."
During peak periods, many temps have to work 70- and 80-hour weeks. This has caused some temps to complain that Microsoft cavalierly chews them up because it has scant loyalty to them.
"There is such a painful human impact," said Richard Pauli, who spent five years as a temp at Microsoft. "When you know these are temp positions, there's this attitude of really burning people out."
Phil Huston, who recently completed two and a half years as a technical writer at AT&T Wireless, likes temping. "I don't have to sweat the office politics the way you do when you're a permanent employee," he said. "And because I've moved from company to company, I've learned a ton of skills."
Yet the differences, however petty, are manifest. Permanent workers wear blue badges, temps orange. Temps are not invited to the annual picnic, do not get discounts at the company store and are not supposed to use Microsoft's basketball courts.
"You don't get an outside office if you're not a blue badge," Mr. Schussler said. "That means you don't get to see daylight."

HEADLINE: Study Criticizes Illinois's Rules For Legislators

BYLINE: By BILL DEDMAN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 28

 BODY:
In the Illinois State Capitol, in Springfield, farmer-legislators write the agriculture laws. Doctor-legislators propose the laws on H.M.O.'s. The beer-distributor-legislator sponsors a law limiting beer sales over the Internet.
Like most other states, Illinois has little regulation of the economic interests of legislators and relies on public disclosure to keep the lawmaking honest. But a new study has questioned the rules that govern such citizen lawmakers. 
 "The law is so ridden with loopholes that it leaves the entire system institutionally suspect when it comes to conflicts of interest," said Charles Lewis, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity, based in Washington.
In conducting the study, the center sent researchers to Springfield to analyze the economic disclosure statements of the 178 members of the General Assembly. It hopes to do the same in all 50 states. The study found such situations as these:
*Legislators routinely propose and vote on legislation that affects their pocketbooks. Bankers, soybean farmers and product-liability lawyers, for example, are involved in setting rules for their industries.
*The law does not require disclosure of many potential conflicts. Business interests of legislators' spouses and dependents are not disclosed and neither are the amounts of stock holdings. Lawyer-legislators are not required to disclose their clients.
*The state ethics law is little enforced. The center found many instances of legislators' failing to disclose business interests. None have been disciplined, state officials say.
Unlike the United States Congress, which mostly forbids outside employment, state legislatures are generally composed of people with other careers. As legislative pay has risen, however, more legislators are working full time. In Illinois, where legislators are paid $45,000, plus as much as $10,000 for leadership work, about half are full-time politicians.
As in most other states, Illinois law cautions lawmakers against voting on matters in which an economic interest "presents a substantial threat to his independence of judgment." Clearly, most states forbid lawmakers to vote on legislation affecting, for example, a single company when they own the company. But on legislation affecting an entire industry, states let the lawmakers decide what is a substantial interest.
Some see the issue differently. What the Center for Public Integrity finds objectionable is "newsworthy but not unethical," said Robert Stern, administrator of the Council on Governmental Ethics Laws, which drafts model legislation on ethics for states.
And the center's viewpoint is opposed by Alan Rosenthal, a professor at Rutgers University who has written on state ethics laws.
"That point of view is based on distrust because you assume someone is feathering his own nest," Mr. Rosenthal said. "But you don't have to be a teacher to vote for higher wages for teachers."
In Illinois, the Governmental Ethics Act gives two options to legislators with a conflict: abandon the financial interest or abstain from voting. Legislators interviewed on Friday said they did not know of any colleague who had taken the first route. Some legislators do recuse themselves. Others announce that they have a conflict and then vote.
"I do not consider refraining from action," said State Representative Ron Stephens, Republican of Troy and a pharmacist, who has proposed rules on who can write prescriptions. "The whole purpose of the act is just to reveal the information, so the voters can judge that as they may."

HEADLINE: Moynihan Backs Vallone In Primary for Governor

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 29

 BODY:
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the elder statesman of New York Democrats, will endorse the New York City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, for governor on Monday, giving Mr. Vallone the imprimatur of someone who is popular in all regions of the state and with voters of all parties.
Aides to both men said today that the endorsement -- an extremely rare gesture for Mr. Moynihan -- would take place in Buffalo, at a windshield wiper factory that is moving jobs out of state. The site offers the sort of imagery that is likely to fill the campaign as Mr. Vallone and other Democrats attack Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, over the weak upstate economy. 
 The setting and the endorsement also underscore Mr. Vallone's recent efforts to strengthen his standing upstate, where he is largely unknown, and where public opinion polls show him trailing far behind Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross for the Democratic nomination.
Mr. Moynihan has a stature in the region that no other Democrat can match. A longtime resident of Delaware County, he routinely carries solidly Republican towns and farming areas upstate that rarely vote Democratic, and that overwhelmingly supported Mr. Pataki in 1994.
"This endorsement is important, because people respect Moynihan," said Kevin McCabe, Mr. Vallone's chief of staff. "When the rest of the state is as familiar with Peter Vallone as the Senator is, they'll be equally supportive."
Mr. Moynihan seldom makes an endorsement in a contested primary, and indeed, he tends to hold himself aloof from electoral politics. In the 1992 Senate race and in last year's New York City mayoral contest, he did not back anyone until after the primaries, and then did not campaign for his party's nominees against the Republican incumbents, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
"Senator Moynihan thinks highly of Peter Vallone and his positions on job creation and education, the kinds of things that are needed to rebuild New York State, particularly the Southern Tier, western New York and the rural north," said Tony Bullock, Mr. Moynihan's chief of staff.
In taking sides so early -- the primary is more than five months away -- Mr. Moynihan may be trying to help an old friend emerge as the clear leader in the field so that Democrats can avoid the sort of tough primary that has hampered them in the past.
Party leaders say the Senator may also be looking to short-circuit the candidacy of Ms. McCaughey Ross, a Republican-turned-Democrat who is the only primary contender ahead of Mr. Vallone in public opinion polls. Many of the state's top Democrats doubt the sincerity of her party conversion after a long feud with Mr. Pataki, and they argue that she would be a poor standard-bearer, spelling disaster for other Democrats running on the same ticket in November.
The endorsement is the second setback in just a few days for the Lieutenant Governor, who finished a distant second Saturday in a straw poll of upstate party activists gathered in Ithaca. The event was seen as a harbinger of upstate sentiment at the state party convention in May, where Ms. McCaughey Ross, unlike Mr. Vallone, will be relying heavily on upstate delegates to win an automatic place on the ballot. If she does not get 25 percent of the delegates' votes, she can get on the ballot only by collecting tens of thousands of signatures, a difficult process that can cost more than half a million dollars.
Mr. Vallone and Mr. Moynihan have a warm relationship that predates Mr. Moynihan's first election to the Senate in 1976. Mr. McCabe described Mr. Vallone as being the same sort of centrist Democrat -- or at least as pragmatically liberal -- as Mr. Moynihan, albeit without the Senator's famed erudition. "Peter Vallone is the working man's Pat Moynihan, and Pat Moynihan knows that," he said.
Another Democratic contender, James Larocca, a former State Commissioner of Transportation and Energy, played down the importance of the endorsement today. "I understand that there is a long-term relationship there that goes back to when Pat first entered politics," he said. "I think Peter should be pleased by the endorsement, but I don't know that endorsements play that large a role."
Whoever the Democrats nominate will have an uphill fight against Mr. Pataki, who fares very strongly in public opinion polls, and has raised money at a far faster pace -- more than $12 million so far -- than any other candidate in the state's history.
Polls show Ms. McCaughey Ross leading the Democratic field, based largely on having the highest name recognition by far. She also has the largest campaign fund, more than $2 million supplied by her husband, Wilbur L. Ross Jr., a prominent investment banker.
Mr. Vallone runs second in the polls, with most of his support in New York City, and he is the only other Democrat who has raised nearly as much as the Lieutenant Governor. Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, is running third, but he has raised little money.
Mr. Larocca, who won the upstate straw poll Saturday, has widespread support among party officials, but has little money and is a distant fourth. Richard A. Kahan, former chairman of the state's Urban Development Corporation, barely registers in the polls.

HEADLINE: After Clinton's Trek: Fear of a Crushing Embrace?

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, March 29

 BODY:
One of the central themes of President Clinton's trip to Africa is partnership, which is widely welcomed here as a break with the paternalism of the past.
But as the President departed from South Africa today for Botswana, he left behind a major question: What kind of partnership? The United States is so enormous, so rich and so powerful that it can all but crush the comparatively tiny nations and economies of this continent in its embrace. 
 A determination to avoid this lay behind President Nelson Mandela's unequivocal statements last week that South Africa would choose its friends as it saw fit, whatever Washington may think about Cuba, Iran or Libya, and that his Government found unacceptable the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a trade bill that has passed the House and is awaiting Senate approval.
Mr. Clinton did not bridle at Mr. Mandela's blunt if affectionate language. Indeed he spoke in poetic terms of the South African's nobility of character in his toast at a state banquet. Recalling Mr. Mandela's 27 years as a political prisoner, Mr. Clinton said, "Though you were locked in prison for a long time, you opened others' minds and hearts."
On an emotional level, most South Africans welcomed Mr. Clinton equally warmly. He was likened by many older people here to his political hero, John F. Kennedy -- the last American President to take a broad interest in Africa, stimulated by his brother Robert and his energetic Africa specialist at the State Department, G. Mennen Williams.
Yet for all the expressions of mutual respect, the disagreements are real, and the South Africans, proud of their new freedom, are unwilling to be treated as a mere surrogate.
Mr. Mandela made it clear, said an approving editorial in today's Sunday Independent newspaper, that South Africa wanted "a relationship with the United States on its own terms, rather than terms dictated solely by America's self-interest."
The trade bill backed by the President, its critics in the Government here believe, would compromise the sovereignty of African governments by opening American markets completely only to those countries the United States judged to have embraced political and economic reform fully enough. That might penalize countries that choose to follow a path not approved by the International Monetary Fund, for example. To Mr. Mandela and others here, that smacks too much of colonialism.
In addition, the singling out of half a dozen or more countries for special treatment would make the achievement of African unity, already problematical, almost impossible.
By choosing six reforming countries to visit on this trip, Mr. Clinton strengthens the hand of a new generation of African leaders and encourages others to emulate them. But at the same time his policies could push countries like Nigeria deeper into isolation.
Finally, the South Africans worry that the trade bill could sharply increase the power of multinational companies at the expense of the fledgling African economies.
In Washington's view it is pointless to try to persuade American companies to invest here unless they are assured that the African renaissance is real and lasting.
Another dimension to the disagreement, only hinted at in public these last few days, is the balance between trade and aid. Mr. Clinton has promised to try to restore aid to its historically highest levels, but that will be hard to do in the present political climate in the United States. It is not easy for the South Africans to understand this, given the staggering dimensions of American prosperity.
Thabo Mbeki, the Deputy President of South Africa and Mr. Mandela's anointed successor, pushed hard during a meeting with Mr. Clinton for more aid, arguing that trade alone is likely to prolong African economies' reliance on the export of raw materials rather than more profitable finished products.
What South Africa thinks matters, and not only because of Mr. Mandela's stature as a world leader.
President Clinton avoided Gabon, Nigeria and Angola on this trip; they have governments that fall well short of Washington's criteria for acceptability. But with South Africa, they account for 84 percent of United States trade with sub-Saharan Africa. A trade bill that excluded all four, for one reason or another, would not amount to much.
That gives Mr. Clinton and Congress reason to see what they can do to meet Mr. Mandela's objections.
As Mr. Clinton said, "winds of change and good fortune" are blowing here, 38 years after the British Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, told an all-white Government, to no avail, that it must heed the "wind of change" blowing in Africa.
Mr. Clinton appeared to have convinced South African leaders of several things, whatever the disagreements: That he cares about Africa, that he wants the United States to play a leading role in the continent's development and that he considers this country one of Africa's leaders.
Best of all, said Greg Mills, director of the South African Institute of International Affairs, the President's trip has prompted "the beaming of positive African images to an otherwise largely ignorant United States audience."

HEADLINE: A New Debate on the Fate (And State) of Puerto Rico

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: GUANICA, P.R.

 BODY:
On a stone set on a pedestal in Guanica, a small town in southwestern Puerto Rico, a plaque commemorates "the landing of the American troops under Gen. Nelson A. Miles on Guanica Beach, July 25, 1898."
Today's Guanica bears many other marks of that invasion -- a United States Post Office, cross-cultural storefront signs like "Ayala Funeral Service" and residents like Florencio Suarez-Williams, the grandson of one of the American occupiers. 
 "He was a good man," Mr. Suarez-Williams, 75, said proudly of his grandfather, Capt. Abraham B. Williams, a doctor from Florida. "He could have gone on to seek military glory, but he stayed here to help people."
But a century after Spain ceded Puerto Rico to United States rule after losing the Spanish-American War, Americans and Puerto Ricans are less certain of their feelings for each other than is Mr. Suarez-Williams. Prodded by the centennial of the Spanish-American War this year, international disapproval of any vestiges of colonialism and the failings of the status quo, both the United States and Puerto Rico seem to want change. But in trying to redefine their relationship, both are sizing up each other as if 100 years have not been long enough to commit or part ways, or even get to know each other well.
For the first time, Congress is seriously considering a bill that would allow the island of nearly four million people to vote on whether it wants statehood, independence or the current commonwealth association. The bill has been approved by the House.
However, Congress itself is sharply divided over whether to accept a possible 51st state. And for the first time in Puerto Rico, the major political parties agree that the status quo is no longer acceptable, but they remain almost equally split between statehood and some form of association with the United States.
The issue of self-determination has bogged down in Washington on questions about the economic, political and cultural cost of incorporating a Spanish-speaking land.
In Puerto Rico, a decision about the island's fate is deeply wrapped in a sense of identity. Miguel Hernandez-Agosto, past president of the Popular Democratic Party, which was the architect of the current "free associated state" status created in 1952, argues that the century-old association with the United States has created a hybrid: a territory that regards itself as a nation, Americans who feel Puerto Rican, a Latin American culture used to North American standards and values.
"This is not a barrio of the Bronx," said Mr. Hernandez-Agosto, 70. "This is not a question of who favors Hispanics and who doesn't. This is a country with roots, with an idiosyncrasy, with pride, that transcends its boundaries.
"Puerto Rico treasures and defends its own identity," Mr. Hernandez-Agosto said, "but it also treasures and defends its U.S. citizenship."
Commonwealth supporters like Mr. Hernandez-Agosto want more autonomy and to keep their island from succumbing to what he calls "the cultural genocide" of statehood or the instability of complete disassociation. The commonwealth alternative won 48 percent of the vote in a nonbinding status referendum in 1993. But there are two other aspirations: statehood, supported by 46 percent of the referendum voters, and independence, backed by a passionate minority of 4 percent.
What seems like a perennial debate over political status has gained momentum in Puerto Rico as frustrations grow. It is a status that has given Puerto Ricans American citizenship but denied equal rights and obligations. Puerto Ricans cannot vote in Federal elections and do not pay Federal taxes or receive Federal benefits comparable to those in the states unless they move to the mainland. The status has brought economic benefits that have led to a strong middle class and has allowed about three million Puerto Ricans to migrate to and from the states, but has also created a dependence on Federal aid, like food stamps.
In Guanica, a town of about 20,000 where the main street is named "25 de Julio" for the day the Americans arrived, Mr. Suarez-Williams and his sister, Libertad, both advocate statehood. Ms. Suarez-Williams argued that the United States freed Puerto Rico from the tyranny of the Spanish monarchy and instilled the democratic values that it cherishes today. But she said the current commonwealth status renders Puerto Ricans impotent to make their own decisions or influence those made for them in Washington because they cannot vote for President or Congress.
"The greatest benefit of statehood would be that Puerto Ricans could develop a sense of self-esteem with a government that is not trampling them," said Ms. Suarez-Williams, a former high school teacher. "If you don't have strong self-esteem, you are in a state of conformity and incapacitation."
But two years at a community college in Wichita, Kan., convinced Hilka Mercado, 19, a student who works as a waitress at the Blue Marlin Restaurant and Pub here, that the cultures are too different to be joined closer than they are now.
"They don't know where Puerto Rico is," she said of the people she knew in Kansas. "To them Puerto Rico is part of Mexico. To them I'm black. They say I speak Mexican. You can't be that ethnocentric. How can you want to part of people who don't want you?"
Ms. Mercado supports a commonwealth that would give Puerto Rico more autonomy. But Pedro Juan Vargas, 86, the town's historian and a supporter of independence, said Puerto Rico was entitled to "its own sovereignty and everything the United States wants for itself."
Mr. Vargas said he did not expect radical change because, he argued, the United States finds the status quo in its interest. Puerto Rico, he said, represents a major market for American products, an outpost for American military bases and "a blood tribute" paid by the Puerto Ricans who fight America's wars. "If we were a burden, they would have gotten rid of us long ago," he said.
Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat and a co-sponsor of the plebiscite bill, said that Puerto Rico posed a test of the United States' commitment to self-determination and that his bill should pass as "a statement of recommitment to the principle of the Declaration of Independence -- that people should have a say in their destiny." But he said he had warned his colleagues not to vote for the bill if they were not ready to abide by a binding plebiscite.
The legislation passed the House earlier this month by the slimmest of margins, 209 to 208, after 11 hours of debate in which Democrats, Republicans and representatives of Puerto Rican descent argued on both sides of the issue. (Most Republicans voted against it and most Democrats for it.) Its chances in the Republican Senate appear slimmer. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has not scheduled hearings on the bill but is conducting a "workshop" on Thursday to familiarize members with the issue, said Derek Jumper, a committee spokesman.
The Popular Democratic Party in Puerto Rico, opposes the plebiscite bill in Congress, charging that some of its terms favor statehood. It is studying a proposal by Mr. Hernandez-Agosto for an alternative status that would transfer to Puerto Rico some of the powers now under Federal jurisdiction. The party wants exemptions from some Federal laws that it says hamper Puerto Rico's economic development and flexibility for the island to enter into its own international trade deals to create new jobs.
But opponents call those proposals largely cosmetic. They include Luis A. Ferre, the former governor, a Republican Party chairman in Puerto Rico and founder of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, which is in control. Mr. Ferre said that if Puerto Ricans were to remain American citizens and subject to Federal law they should have full vote and say.
Statehood advocates have made a plebiscite such a priority since Gov. Pedro J. Rossello took over in 1992 that they have pushed for the removal of tax exemptions for American companies, increased English instruction in public schools and played down the island's sense of nationhood, all to help pave the way for acceptance into the union.
"We're not like other Latin Americans," said Mr. Ferre, 94. "We Puerto Ricans, without realizing it, have changed. We're the product of the peaceful fusion of two cultures. We're already incorporated."
But just as determined is the pro-independence camp, which in the past has used violence to send a message. Juan Mari Bras, a lawyer and a pro-independence leader, has legally renounced his American citizenship. He said members of Congress who expressed concern about fomenting another Quebec or worse with statehood have reason to worry.
"The independentistas are not going to accept statehood with their arms crossed," said Mr. Mari Bras, 70. "One nation does not fit into another. It's that simple."
In Guanica, preparations are already under way for the centennial commemoration of the takeover by the United States. While independence advocates plan a march to repudiate the invasion, the ruling statehood advocates are gearing up for a celebration.
Mr. Vargas, the historian, is not planning to attend any events. Nor is he following the goings-on in Congress with the plebiscite bill, he said.
"Ever since General Miles entered through Guanica everything has been promises, promises," he said. "Puerto Ricans realized the sad reality that all that happened in 1898 was that we exchanged monarchical masters for democratic ones."

HEADLINE: REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;
Kicking and Screaming, Baby Boomers Begin to Talk About Aging

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 29

 BODY:
It was a workshop to get baby boomers to talk about what was billed as "the A word" -- aging.
"I'm not going to one of those nursing homes," one woman called out from the back of the room.
"I'm not going unless they have caffe latte," another woman insisted. 
 The annual conference of the American Society on Aging, which ended on Saturday at the Hilton Hotel here, brought together more than 3,000 participants for six days of workshops, discussion groups, and speeches by such experts as C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General; Jeanette C. Takamura, the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Aging, and Richard Browdie, Pennsylvania's secretary of aging and the society's new director.
The speeches were chock full of statistics illustrating the rapid graying of America: by 2011, the number of Americans 65 and older will double. A baby boomer turns 50 every 7.6 seconds. There are 61,000 Americans 100 or older, according to the United States Census.
The conference itself offered daunting numbers: More than 800 workshops covering a range of subjects that included Social Security, long-term care, nursing home reform, gay grandmas, women and estrogen, and "Men: myth, crisis, doubt and mature spirituality."
But baby boomers being baby boomers, those at this workshop made it clear things are going to have to change for them.
"There will be a Starbucks in every nursing home," said one of the handful of men in the room, Stephen Sapp, a professor of religious studies at the University of Miami.
 
Happily Inactive
What about people who want to kick back and relax a little in their final decades? What about 85-year-olds who don't want to run marathons, learn languages, go ballroom dancing, or otherwise participate in the "active retirement life style?"
The question was put to Rabbi Sam R. Seicol, director of religious services at the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for Aged in Boston, in his session on "religion, spirituality, and aging." Rabbi Seicol said, "We've got a resident, we can't get him out to programs."
"He's not depressed," Rabbi Seicol said. "He comes out when he wants. He's got his computer, his VCR, his stereo boom box. He's got his CD's. He's happy."
 
Care Program Is Big Draw
For the members of the American Society on Aging, who had gathered from across the country, the top attraction was a nationally recognized comprehensive care program for low-income, frail, elderly people run from a building at 1333 Bush Street.
"It's like going to mecca for everybody in the field of aging," said Bob Eckardt, an official of the Cleveland Foundation, a philanthropic organization, who made the pilgrimage to the building on Saturday.
The program, which has been praised as a model for long-term care by President Clinton and is being duplicated across the country, is called On Lok, which is Cantonese for "peaceful, happy abode."
Jennie Chin Hansen, the executive director of On Lok, led Mr. Eckardt through the building of spacious, light-filled rooms, the medical clinic with its wide, comfortable beds, the Asian garden where Alzheimer's patients can safely enjoy the outdoors and the kitchen where Jimmy Luu, a chef prepared Western- and Eastern-style meals.
Most of the program's 700 people only go to On Lok for the day, because they prefer returning to their homes at night.
 
'What Do I Do Next?'
"I'm 77," Betty Friedan announced to a ballroom filled with gerontologists, social workers, academics, physicians, nurses, ministers, rabbis, entrepreneurs and writers.
The author of "The Feminine Mystique" and "The Fountain of Age" paused for a long moment. "I am?"
"I'm still thinking, 'What do I do next?' " Ms. Friedan said in her speech. "I have fantasies. Partly, I plan my own funeral. Then I think, 'That's sick.' The other part of me is writing an indignant op-ed about these sex scandals. What's the big deal?"
Ms. Friedan shared the lectern with Robert Butler, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and president of the International Longevity Center, who, in his speech, quoted everyone from Leo Tolstoy ("Old age is the most unexpected of all things that happens to a man.") to Maggie Kuhn ("I try to do something outrageous every day."). Dr. Butler and Ms. Friedan talked about the philosophy of the new long life and "new paradigms of aging."
The shift on aging was one of the slogans of the conference, which took as its theme "charting a course for the age boom."
Aging was once about "all those poor old people who are going to be around" sick, degenerating, needing care, and draining the economy, Ms. Friedan said, "as if age is only a matter of care and pathology."
Aging now involves "a new third of life," she said, and a new frontier.
"It's not going to be old, senile people," she said, "but vital people."
People like Senator John Glenn, 76, who is preparing to go into space again.
"I don't think anyone will look at their grandfather in the same way after John Glenn gets back," Dr. Butler said.

HEADLINE: Fortunes Improve for Upstate Cities That Symbolized Decline

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

DATELINE: TROY, N.Y., March 25

 BODY:
For years, there was no greater cliche of urban decline than this old industrial city on the Hudson River. Often described as the most financially distressed city in the country, it earned municipal notoriety five years ago when its officials used a maneuver that amounted to a mortgage on City Hall to try to close a deficit.
But after endless grim reports, the news here in the last few weeks has been surprisingly upbeat. After two years of balanced budgets, debt restructuring, contract renegotiations -- and generally reduced expectations -- Troy's Mayor, Mark P. Pattison, publicly declared an end to the fiscal crisis early this month. And a Wall Street rating company, Moody's Investors Service, upgraded Troy's municipal bond rating one step, to B1 from B. 
 Here, and in a handful of other upstate cities with suffocating financial woes, the crisis atmosphere of the last few years is beginning to lift. Some experts on municipal finance are saying that the combination of the strong national economy, increased state aid and more disciplined fiscal management has meant that Troy and cities like Buffalo, Newburgh and Niagara Falls, while still financially weak, have turned a corner.
"A couple of years ago, there was a terrible downward spiral," H. Carl McCall, the New York State Comptroller, said in an interview. "We've stopped that."
No one is saying the upstate cities have anything like a secure future, and it is far too soon for residents to notice much in the way of cleaner streets or new basketball hoops in public parks. Virtually all the cities still face the long-term problems that made them symbols of urban decline in the first place, including shrinking populations, weakened tax bases, insufficient jobs and expensive municipal services.
It is also unclear whether the new fiscal stability would last if the national economy soured. That would pinch the state's financial health, cutting its income, and would almost certainly dampen the state's appetite for providing the cities with financial assistance.
But some officials say an end to the emergency mentality means they can now try to confront the fundamental issues that are affecting most urban areas. "Having stabilized, it is now possible to move forward and address those other issues" said Mr. McCall, whose office works closely with most of the state's troubled cities. "You couldn't even address those other issues while they were hemorrhaging."
The city manager of Newburgh, Harold J. Porr 3d, said, "What it means for the people of Newburgh is that before there was no hope, and now there is a belief that things will get better."
The Moody's report, which has drawn wide attention across the state, declared early this month that the financial outlook was "stable" in six New York State cities that have been synonymous with financial crisis: Troy, Buffalo, Newburgh, Niagara Falls, Utica and Yonkers.
Some of the improvement, Moody's found, has been a result of an improving economy, although the upstate economy is still trailing the national boom. In each of the six cities it studied, Moody's found that unemployment rates have fallen from highs of five years ago.
In Troy, for example, the unemployment rate fell to 7 percent in 1996, the last year for which data were available, from 8.9 percent in 1992, while the state unemployment rate in 1996 was 6.2 percent. Of the six cities studied, the 1996 unemployment rates exceeded the state unemployment rate in all except one, Yonkers, where unemployment fell to 5.5 percent from 8.3 percent in 1992.
Moody's was least enthusiastic about financial progress in Utica, and it did not analyze the finances of cities that have been among the stronger performers in the group, like Syracuse and Rochester.
In addition to Troy, Moody's also upgraded the bond ratings of Newburgh and Niagara Falls, which have been among the most financially troubled of the state's cities. On a scale from Aaa to C, Moody's upgraded Newburgh and Niagara Falls' rating to Ba1 from Ba.
The bond ratings of all three of those cities remain below the investment grade rating of Baa. But Marcy S. Block, Moody's manager of municipal bond ratings for the Atlantic Coast, said that, for the financial markets, the notion that the finances of New York State's cities might be improving was a novelty after years of crisis. "You were kind of wondering when it was going to stop," she said.
In some of the cities with improving financial health, the impact on the lives of the residents has been minimal. But there are some signs. In Niagara Falls, officials say hopes for redevelopment seem more realistic than they have in years. In Newburgh, Mr. Porr said, the value of the assessed property in the city grew last year for the first time in eight years.
In most of the cities, pressing financial problems continue. In Buffalo, which has had a slight budget surplus for the last few years, a long-running legal fight with the teachers' union has left unresolved whether the city might ultimately have to pay millions of dollars it has not budgeted. Yonkers, which had a budget surplus last year, could face substantial additional costs because of a long court battle over desegregation, according to the State Comptroller's office.
In old cities like Troy, a few years ago, there was little relief from urban doomsayers. In this city of 55,000 people, at least, that is changing, said Dr. Jeanne H. Neff, president of the Sage Colleges, which includes Russell Sage College for Women in Troy. "All you would hear were stories about Troy's decline and fall," she said. "Now, there is a tremendous sense that this is a moment in time when Troy can claim a much brighter future."
The optimism is often expressed subtly. In an act rich with local symbolism, private and state money is being used to restore a granite staircase that leads from the hilltop campus of the nationally known Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to Troy's downtown. For decades, as Troy deteriorated, so did the staircase until it finally fell into disuse years ago.
But there are few notable city-financed economic development projects here. Instead, Mayor Pattison said, the city is trying to encourage private investment by emphasizing the government's return to fiscal stability. He said a group of new shops, including a large downtown furniture store and a new cultural center that is under construction in a row of buildings that have long been empty, were signs that his strategy is working.
That strategy, he said, was to "sweat the details" and pay attention to what he acknowledged were boring components of municipal life, like the adequacy of a water main. "If you want to have investors in the city of Troy, they're going to have to have confidence that the underpinnings are as stable as possible."
Partly, Mayor Pattison said, he emphasized the mundane business of government because returning to financial health was so costly that there was no money for dramatic ventures. And partly, he said, his approach was a sign that, though there is fiscal stability, the underlying challenges to urban life remain.
"The crisis is behind Troy," he said. "The financial challenges are still in front of us. It doesn't get easier from here."
In his first year in office, 1996, he was facing an $8 million shortfall in a $34 million budget. His solution included an immediate property tax increase of 21 percent and a 38 percent hike in water rates. Years of troubles had reduced sanitation and parks workers and other city service crews to skeleton levels. But he asked for and got concessions from all the municipal unions except the police. He is in a bitter contract dispute with the police union.
The public anger about tax increases and declining services leaves little room for added revenue for new projects and little ability to make new cuts. The Democratic Mayor's critics, including a Republican Councilwoman, Carmella R. Mantello, say his obsession with the details of getting the city's finances in order has meant that too little attention has been paid to long-range planning.
Mr. Pattison dismissed his critics, saying that he, too, hoped Troy might have a brighter future than he can now promise.
He said places like Troy have been taught over the last few years that they must be realistic. Getting back to financial stability, he said, only showed how little control most cities can have over their futures because they are too strapped to do much more than survive as they are buffeted by powerful trends like the decades-long flight to the suburbs.
"What will happen to small cities -- cities in general -- is, I think, a very open question," he said. "We as a society are going to have to make certain decisions about what we want to do about cities."

HEADLINE: Lake's Fleeting Greatness Graces a Faded City;
Wave of Welcome Publicity for Plattsgurgh

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

DATELINE: PLATTSBURGH, N.Y., March 27

 BODY:
As the ferry made its way from Vermont to New York, across the choppy waters of Lake Champlain, Kirk Polhemus, a deckhand, issued a judgment heard over and over these days in the North Country. "It may not be a great lake," he said, "but it's the best lake."
These very words are heard so often here that it seems the Chamber of Commerce has written the script for discussing the dispute over a Federal law that briefly made Champlain an official Great Lake, the equal of Superior, Huron, Erie, Ontario and Michigan. That legislation, overturned in Congress last week, was the brainchild of Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat. He was seeking Federal funds from the Sea Grant program, which finances aquatic research at universities that border the Great Lakes or the ocean. 
 Senator Leahy slipped seven words into the bill last month -- "The term Great Lakes includes Lake Champlain" -- and thus unleashed a storm of protest in the Middle West, where politicians from the shores of the five larger lakes rebelled at sharing their "greatness." Now the law has been rewritten, stripping Lake Champlain of that superlative but giving Vermont access to the Sea Grant money nonetheless.
"If you get the money, you don't need the status," said Chris Walfield, a desk clerk at a motel here, who, like most residents on the New York side of the lake, found the whole episode kind of silly.
But the brouhaha, despite sneering editorials across the country, was a bonanza for the Chambers of Commerce on both sides of the lake, a perfect example of the public relations credo: Say what you want about me as long as you spell my name right.
The coast-to-coast publicity was welcome in Plattsburgh, a faded city reeling from the loss of its Air Force base and the Canadian shoppers who are staying home because of the unfavorable exchange rate. In recent weeks, tourism and civic officials have had ample opportunity to proclaim their lake a scenic, unspoiled gem, more like Lake Tahoe or Geneva than industrial waters like Lake Superior, Michigan or Erie, which was once so filthy that it caught fire in places.
And even in Burlington, Vt., a more prosperous and cultivated city than Plattsburgh and well known for its natural beauty and recreation, travel writers from Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Maryland have come calling. They will no doubt tell their readers about the silos and snow geese, the moose and maple sugar, the piney woods and picturesque marinas, to say nothing of the fall foliage season when both Vermont's Green Mountains and New York's Adirondacks blaze with beauty.
Arguably, the publicity that came from Senator Leahy's attempt to rewrite the geography books did more for the New York side of the lake than the Vermont side. Vermont is a small state, with Burlington its economic, educational and cultural hub and Lake Champlain one of its defining features. New York, by contrast, includes the Statue of Liberty, Niagara Falls and everything in between, and thus the lake and the city on its western shore get far less attention, both from the public and the national and statewide politicians.
The mayors on both sides of the 490-square-mile lake, Peter Clavelle in Burlington and Clyde Rabideau in Plattsburgh, agree that Vermont is way ahead of New York in developing and promoting its lakefront. "New York is a huge state so it's hard to get recognition," Mayor Rabideau said.
Mayor Clavelle agreed. "The lake is much more important to Vermonters than New Yorkers," he said. "But that's mainly a matter of scale."
One civic leader who spans the divide is Stewart Ledbetter, the news director of WPTZ-TV, an NBC affiliate that serves both cities and is always hearing complaints from New Yorkers that the station favors Vermont and vice versa. Mr. Ledbetter said that "New York is playing catch-up in realizing the value of waterfront activity to the overall tourist economy," but has a unique opportunity since the former Air Force base, occupying two miles of lakeshore, is now available for private development.
The two cities are as different in character as white bread and wheat bread or cornflakes and granola. Burlington is a hip place, with fine restaurants and cultural activities that draw residents of Plattsburgh across the lake on ferries that run to the Vermont side year round. Burlington won the battle with its New York neighbor in the 1950's for a huge I.B.M. plant and is thus an employment mecca.
Plattsburgh has the look of an industrial city fallen on hard times, boasting too heartily about a new wine bar and a renovated train station. Yet people who live here rave about affordable real estate, natural beauty and down-to-earth neighbors -- not the snooty urban refugees who are more likely to settle in Vermont.
"It's a completely different culture over there," said Mark Barie, head of the organization that is redeveloping the Air Force base. "They see themselves as a playground for skiers, hikers, nature buffs. They're less practical and more esthetic. Here it's dollars and cents and common sense. They wear L. L. Bean clothes so they look like we always looked, but without the label."
The lake, which Mr. Ledbetter crosses several times a day going from his Burlington newsroom to the one in Plattsburgh, "is one of the few commonalities, except the weather, that strikes a chord on both sides," he said.
It is a long, narrow and deep body of water -- 107 miles from Whitehall, N.Y., to the Quebec border, anywhere from half a mile to 14 miles wide and up to 400 feet deep. The scene of significant battles in the American Revolution and the War of 1812, Lake Champlain is considered by divers to be one of the great troves of unexplored shipwrecks.
While far smaller than Ontario, the smallest of the Great Lakes, it is No. 6 in the United States in size and shares many geological and environmental characteristics with its larger cousins, enough to prompt the United States Geological Survey to endorse Senator Leahy's bid. All six lakes were carved by the same glacier, during the Pleistocene ice age, more than 10,000 years ago. All six share the same drainage basin, emptying into the St. Lawrence River.
The six lakes also have identical rock formations, flora and fauna and similar environmental plagues, among them zebra mussels, sea lamprey, phosphorous runoff and mercury pollution. The Sea Grant money, which must be bid for in a yearly competition, will be spent finding ways to clean up the lakes and arrest future problems.
But Middle Western politicians balked at sharing the Great Lake designation. Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, insisted that the hullabaloo was not "a tempest in a teapot" but rather "a matter of our identity." Senator John Glenn, an Ohio Democrat, mimicking a slight that was hurled at Dan Quayle during a Vice-Presidential debate, said: "I know the Great Lakes. I've traveled the Great Lakes. And Lake Champlain is not one of the Great Lakes."
Senator Leahy and others guessed that the Middle Westerners took more offense than New York's senators, whose state sits at the edge of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, because they have less to brag about. "New York has a lot of other things going for it," the Vermont Senator said. "For the Midwestern states, the Great Lakes is all they have."
In a rare burst of candor, Senator Leahy described the compromise struck last week as a win-win situation for him, not only because Vermont got the Sea Grant eligibility, but because, after the vote to rescind Champlain's "great" status, he is now owed favors by his colleagues in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. "He didn't get to be a senator all these years by being stupid," said Chris Lamitie, a ferry employee, taking a break at the Galley restaurant on the dock here.
Donna Holt manages the six-seat clapboard restaurant, serving sandwiches on her daughter's home-baked bread. Mrs. Holt, who has lived most of her life here, had the unlikely experience of being in Wisconsin, where her husband was waiting for a heart transplant at a veterans' hospital, when the Great Lakes dispute flared earlier this month.
At first Mrs. Holt and her husband were flabbergasted by the fury of Wisconsin's citizens. "Then we realized that beside the Green Bay Packers, the lake is their big item," she said.
Then Mrs. Holt offered her own version of the unofficial "I Love Champlain" campaign. "I can't think of anyplace I'd rather be, except maybe in January and February," she said. "To me it's a great lake -- always was, always will be."

U.S. Arms Makers Lobby For NATO Expansion
American arms manufacturers, who stand to gain billions of dollars in sales of weapons, communication systems and other military equipment if the Senate approves NATO expansion, have made enormous investments in lobbyists and campaign contributions to promote their cause in Washington. A1
 
Infighting Rocks Khmer Rouge
The remnants of Cambodia's Communist Khmer Rouge movement have turned their guns on one another, and the jungle stronghold that has withstood repeated Government offensives is now torn by factional fighting. The turmoil comes at a moment of political tension in the capital, where Prince Norodom Ranariddh is scheduled to return after fleeing a coup last July. A3 

U.S.: No Ultimatum for Israel
As a White House envoy announced that he would return from the Middle East to brief President Clinton on the reaction to new peace proposals, American Jewish leaders said they had been assured by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright that the United States would not present Israel with an ultimatum for a West Bank withdrawal. A3
 
Oil Erodes Armenia's Power
Armenians won a 1994 gamble to gain control in Nagorno Karabakh, part of neighboring Azerbaijan, but the regional political structure in the Caspian Sea basin is threatening Armenia's hold. The rush for the untapped oil reserves of countries in the area and billions of dollars in planned investment have loosened Russia's grip on the region and turned oil-rich Azerbaijan into a new hub of regional influence. A6
 
Plot Thickens in South Africa
The mystery around the arrest of a former anti-apartheid guerrilla who is a Government official deepened with President Nelson Mandela's announcement that he had received a report linking the former guerrilla, several army generals and his former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, to a plot to overthrow the Government. But Mr. Mandela said the report was probably a hoax. A7
 
28 Die in Peru Plane Crash
A Peruvian air force plane carrying villagers stranded by flooding crashed into a shantytown in the northern city of Piura, killing 28 people, President Alberto Fujimori said. Fifteen people survived and seven were unaccounted for. The pilot told the control tower that one engine had shut down and that he would try to land. (AP)
 
Iran Condemns Norway Leader
Iran criticized Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik of Norway for having met with the writer Salman Rushdie, who has been condemned to death by Iran for blasphemy. The official Iranian news agency IRNA quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that the meeting "constituted support for Rushdie's desecration" of Islamic sensibilities. (Agence France-Presse)

Health Insurance at Core Of G.O.P. Tax Package
House Republicans, led by Representative Bill Archer of Texas, are drafting an election-year tax bill that would create new tax breaks to help people who receive no health benefits from their employers in buying health insurance. Republicans plan to pay for the tax breaks with revenue raised from higher cigarette taxes. A1
 
Spring Has Sprung on El Nino
Scientists say that the peak of El Nino's influence has passed and that its effects on North America are being progressively weakened by an even more powerful climatic force, the seasonal change known as spring. A1
 
Sparring in Jones Case
Republican and Democratic lawmakers sparred over accusations that President Clinton failed to provide lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones with correspondence from Kathleen E. Willey. Republicans agreed with Ms. Jones's lawyers that Mr. Clinton might have broken the law if he withheld the letters. But Democrats echoed statements by Mr. Clinton's top aides and lawyers -- that Ms. Jones's legal team is trying to deflect the responsibility for its own failings. A13
 
Navigation Upgrade Planned
The Government plans to upgrade the Global Positioning System in the next few years to make hand-held navigation instruments up to 10 times more accurate, a White House official said. A12
 
Tobacco Deal Moves Forward
Senate negotiators agreed to most of the terms of tobacco settlement legislation that would raise cigarettes prices by $1.10 a pack over five years. But a summary of the bill showed the negotiators left open the significant issue of legal protections for the tobacco industry. A15
 
Stay of Execution Denied
The Florida Supreme Court rejected appeals by Judy Buenoano for a stay of her execution. Ms. Buenoano, 54, was convicted of killing her handicapped son, poisoning her husband and trying to blow up a boyfriend. She is to be executed at 7:01 A.M. today. (Reuters)

Speaker to Receive Moynihan Endorsement
Peter Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker, is to receive an endorsement for governor today from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the elder statesman of New York Democrats. The endorsement, an extremely rare gesture for Mr. Moynihan, gives Mr. Vallone the imprimatur of someone who is popular in all regions of the state and with voters of all parties. B3
 
Stepfather Charged in Death
An 8-year-old boy was beaten and strangled in his Bronx apartment on Saturday night, and the police said his stepfather had killed him after he refused to empty a cat's litter box. The stepfather, Robert Rosa, battered Eduwardo Rosa Jr. and strangled him with shoelaces and plastic wrap, and then hid the body in a bedroom closet, the police said. Mr. Rosa, 30, who is also the boy's uncle, was charged with second-degree murder. B1
 
An Economic Turnaround
Troy, N.Y., had often been described as the most financially distressed city in the country. But this month, after two years of effort, its Mayor publicly declared an end to the crisis. Troy and a handful of other upstate cities with deep financial problems are still weak, experts say, but helped by the national economy and greater discipline, they have turned a corner. B5

Port Authority Reports Rise in Volume of Cargo

 BODY:
The volume of goods shipped by sea through ports controlled by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey rose 4.5 percent in 1997, the agency has reported.
The increase in general cargo, which includes goods like bananas and automobiles but not bulk commodities like oil and salt, was the result of the continued strength of the economy, Lillian C. Borrone, the agency's director of port commerce, said on Friday. She also attributed the increase to a labor agreement that reduced fees paid by shippers into a longshoremen's pension fund and a new rail link at the agency's container port in Elizabeth, N.J. 
 Ninety percent of the cargo is shipped through Jersey City, Newark and Elizabeth, Ms. Borrone said.

World War I Museum's New Drive on the Home Front

BYLINE: By Shirley Christian 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., March 30

 BODY:
Two weeks after World War I ended on Nov. 11, 1918, a group of Kansas City civic leaders decided to create a memorial to those who had served. A fund drive was held, and in less than two weeks it raised $2 million, then a substantial sum.
Schoolchildren collected pennies. A lumber magnate, R. A. Long, led the drive and made the largest single donation, $70,000. A local politician named Harry S. Truman who had returned from the war as an Army captain was a contributor. Gen. John J. Pershing and four other Allied military leaders took part in the site dedication in 1921 before 200,000 people. President Calvin Coolidge spoke at the dedication of the monument in 1926, but the crowd favorite was Queen Marie of Romania, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria and a heroine of the war. 
 "Complete, unbridled patriotism created this," said Doran Cart, curator of the Liberty Memorial Museum of World War I, an architectural wonder several times the size of the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials and home to an unmatched collection of artifacts from the war.
With a tower soaring 217 feet from the center, the Liberty Memorial became Kansas City's commanding landmark from a hillside overlooking Union Station. Although other monuments to World War I were built around the country, none are believed to approach this one in size and grandeur, and no other has a museum attached. A Chicago architect, H. Van Buren Magonigle, won a national competition to design the Liberty Memorial, which Edward Durell Stone likened to the Acropolis and the monuments of Paris.
Since 1994, however, the memorial has been closed to the public because of deterioration of its underlying supports, attributed to a poor drainage system and 1920's construction techniques. Embarrassed that it neglected the memorial for so long, the city is trying to raise $60 million from public and private sources to reconstruct the underground supports, restore and update the structures and add a major new space to display a collection that ranges from 1,200 propaganda posters to rare German artillery pieces. The plan is to create a museum for the 21st century that will combine the relics of the war with modern interactive technology, keeping alive the event that laid the framework for much of 20th-century history.
Sixty million dollars does not sound like an unmanageable sum in a growing metropolitan area with a thriving economy, where numerous public and private projects costing several times that amount are under way or ready to start. But Ollie Gates, a businessman who is president of the Parks and Recreation Commission, said that aside from a $2 million donation from R. Crosby Kemper, a banker, and "a hundred thousand here and there from the city budget," no other money was definitely in the pipeline.
He asked the city to appropriate $5 million over the next two budget years and requested $10 million from a state fund for veterans' matters. He said that the city had explored the possibility of Federal aid but that members of the state's Congressional delegation said the city already had an overly long Federal wish list. Some civic leaders think a sales tax may have to be submitted to voters on behalf of the memorial. Meanwhile, an advertising agency is planning a private fund-raising effort.
Still, some of those involved are motivated by personal memories that remind them of the importance the memorial played 70-some years ago, including Charles Waldron, who as a 12-year-old was the Boy Scout aide to Missouri-born General Pershing at the site dedication in 1921. Now 89 and still active as an insurance agent, Mr. Waldron recalls riding beside the general in a black touring car with the top down.
"He was very friendly; he talked very crisply," Mr. Waldron said. "He was one of my inspirations later, when I went into World War II, and came home a full colonel. He was a hell of a guy, a real man's man. The car was very likely a Cadillac. I think that's why I still drive Cadillacs today."
The Liberty Memorial became a museum almost by accident. In 1920, even before the first shovel of dirt had been turned at the site, people began to send objects related to the war. They still do, often because they want the objects to be preserved and know of nowhere else to send them. The United States Army Center of Military History in Washington has called the Liberty Memorial the only museum "whose sole purpose is to provide a history of the World War I period."
"We have an artillery collection that is probably without peer," Mr. Cart said. "We have two guns that are the only known examples of their type: a Bavarian 15-cm. howitzer and an Austrian 8-cm. bronze tube gun. We can cover any aspect of the war, from the home front to the battlefield. We don't have an airplane; I'd like to have one. The Imperial War Museum in London and the Smithsonian have airplanes."
Mr. Cart said the posters were especially important because in that era they were "the" medium of communication for governments trying to gather citizen support for the war effort. Uniforms came from all the belligerent countries. People also sent German helmets, maps, official orders and memorandums. There are about 20 German field guns.
There is a horse-drawn ambulance, a British naval deck gun, a signed autobiography of Eddie Rickenbacker and a full field kitchen. There is a handwritten note from King George V welcoming American troops to England, and one of the brass boxes containing candy and cigarettes that Princess Mary gave British troops in 1914.
In 1993, someone in Tennessee donated a dismantled troop boxcar. "It's called a 40-and-8," Mr. Cart said, "because it was supposed to hold 40 men or 8 horses. The Americans always complained that they had to get aboard right after eight horses had been carried."
Very recently, a Kansas City man donated a naval officer's dress sword from the war, along with a photo of his father wearing it.
The document archives include more than 12,000 photographs of almost every activity and country associated with the war, and 2,000 postcards; a wide variety of newspapers; more than 600 maps, including those of specific battle areas, and a category called "ephemera," which includes the hotel bills for Queen Marie's visit to Kansas City.
Never dreaming that the collection and archives would reach their current size, the creators of the memorial included two buildings of just 2,500 square feet each, one on each side of the tower, with a courtyard connecting them. Murals were painted in one, and the historical collection went into the other. But it was quickly overwhelmed by the size of the collection, and can currently hold only about 10 percent of its items.
Most of the others are in warehouses and the limestone caves that lie beneath Kansas City. When the memorial was closed in 1994, two shopping malls lent free space where a small part of the collection is on public display.
Stephen Abend, the architect whose firm has been retained to oversee the restoration and expansion, said that the crumbling supports are under the 274-foot-wide courtyard between the museum building and the Memory Hall with its murals, but that the tower itself is not threatened because it is sunk 80 feet into bedrock.
If the rehabilitation succeeds, it will provide 140,000 square feet of space. Of that, he said, 40,000 square feet will be gallery and exhibition space, more than 15 times what is now available.
Ralph Appelbaum Associates of New York, which designed the permanent exhibitions of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, has been retained to design the interior exhibition space.

Fears of Increasing Inflation Send Market Gauges Lower

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Fears of rising inflation and Asian economic woes pushed major stock market gauges lower yesterday for the fourth straight day.
A decline in Treasury bond prices and the subsequent rise in long-term interest rates also affected stocks. Bond prices fell after news of a record 4.8 percent jump in home sales in February stirred inflation fears ahead of today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee. 
 Although the Fed is not expected to raise its target for short-term interest rates today, the housing data -- as the latest sign of continued economic growth -- increase the likelihood that the next move in interest rates could be higher, analysts said.
In addition, the dollar rose against the Japanese yen as investors showed their disappointment with Japan's latest economic plan.
In the market yesterday, interest- rate-sensitive issues like banks and financial services companies declined. J. P. Morgan, American Express and the Travelers Group led the Dow lower. Consumer noncyclicals like Coca-Cola, General Electric and Procter & Gamble rose, as did some drug company stocks like Pfizer, American Home Products and Rexall Sundown, a vitamin and consumer health products manufacturer.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 13.96 points, to 8,782.12. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.89 points, to 1,093.55. The Nasdaq composite index declined 4.92 points, to 1,818.70; and the Russell 2000 small-company index lost 0.91 point, to 476.24.
Several market analysts, however, said that investors should not be disheartened by the market's modest declines.
"The market went up for eight consecutive weeks," said Tom Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "I think it's time to pause. Sometimes it's important to consolidate before the next big run."
Mr. Galvin still expects stocks to move higher. He recently increased his forecast for the Dow to 10,105 this year from 9,200. He expects the S.& P. 500 to hit 1,350, up from his earlier prediction of 1,095, in the next 12 to 18 months. He changed his suggested asset allocation, lifting stocks 15 points, to 65 percent of a portfolio, decreasing bond investments by 10 points, to 30 percent, and reducing cash by 5 percent.
Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Company, said of the recent declines, "This is extremely minor in the context of where we're coming from."
In the last four days, the Dow has lost 122.32 points, or 1.4 percent, and the S.& P. 500 has lost 12.1 points, or 1.1 percent. But the gauges have risen 22.6 percent and 24.7 percent, respectively, since their recent lows on Oct. 27. And the Dow is up 2.8 percent so far this month, while the S.& P. gained 4.2 percent in March.
"It's a tiny decline," Mr. Pradilla said, adding, "This is nothing that should worry investors."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Dip in Defensive Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities were lower yesterday, amid defensive trading ahead of today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's committee on monetary policy, at which the course of interest rates in the months ahead may be determined.
While few analysts expect a change in monetary policy, some concern about an increase in interest rates remains in the market, causing buyers to demand a "risk premium" in the form of higher yields. 
 Adding to the cautious tone was nervousness about economic data to be released this week. The National Association of Purchasing Management releases its monthly index of manufacturing activity tomorrow, and the Government reports on employment on Friday, giving the market its first look at the economy's performance in March.
The 30-year bond fell 9/32, to a price of 102 2/32, with the yield, which moves in the opposite direction to the price, up to 5.98 percent, up from 5.96 percent on Friday and the highest level in three weeks.
Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, says his firm's economics group still foresees an unchanged Federal Reserve monetary policy this year as economic growth slows to around 2.5 percent and consumer prices rise by a very modest 1.75 percent.
 Rates at yesterday's regular weekly bill auction were higher than at the previous sale, with the new three-month bill awarded at the average rate of 5.050 percent, compared with 5.030 percent a week earlier. The six-month bills were awarded at an average rate of 5.075 percent, up from 4.990 percent. Analysts called the auction a little weaker than expected.
The following are the results of the auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Bills		 	 	Average Price	98.723	97.434	Discounted Rate	5.05%	5.07%	Coupon Yield	5.18%	5.28%	High Price	98.726	97.442	Discounted Rate	5.04%	5.06%	Coupon Yield	5.17%	5.26%	Low Price	98.722	97.432	Discounted Rate	5.05%	5.08%	Coupon Yield	5.19%	5.28%	Accepted at low price	35%	31%	Total applied for	$35,974,129	$31,679,456	Accepted	$9,870,624	$10,888,456	Noncompetitive	$1,249,240	$1,104,981

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Considers if Disabilities Act Covers H.I.V. Case

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
The Supreme Court took up its first case under the Americans With Disabilities Act today, and the argument over whether the law covers people who have H.I.V. but who show no symptoms of disease served mainly to underscore the statute's complexities.
The 1990 law forbids discrimination against anyone with a disability, which is defined in part as "a physical or mental impairment" that substantially limits a person in "some major life activity." It also provides that someone who "poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others" need not be served in a medical office or other public accommodation. 
 In this case, a dentist who refused to treat an H.I.V.-infected patient in his office is arguing both that the woman was not disabled within the meaning of the law, and that in any event, his refusal to treat her anywhere but in a hospital was justified by his reasonable fear of infection. Two lower Federal courts rejected both arguments, ruling in favor of the patient, Sidney Abbott, in her discrimination suit.
During the arguments today, Justices expressed puzzlement or concern over almost every aspect of the case, from the lower courts' analysis of Ms. Abbott's condition to the statistical basis for assessing a dentist's fear of contracting H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, from a patient. .
The lower courts had accepted Ms. Abbott's argument that the "major life activity" in which she was "substantially limited" was reproduction; she testified that her decision not to have children was based both on her fear of passing the virus to a baby and of not living long enough to rear a child.
Justice David H. Souter was outspoken in his doubt about this analysis. He told Ms. Abbott's lawyer, Bennett H. Klein, that while her decision was based on "a very responsible moral judgment," it was a nonetheless a "self-imposed limitation" rather than a physical limitation of her condition.
"I don't find it that easy to transfer the moral limitation she's placed on herself to the limitation the statute talks about," Justice Souter said.
Mr. Klein replied that the law did not require the complete inability to perform a "major life activity." For example, he said, "breathing" was accepted as a major life activity under the statute, even though people with impaired respiration are obviously still breathing.
"The statute doesn't require the preclusion of the activity," he said. "The fact that there's a volitional aspect doesn't preclude it from being a substantial limitation."
Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked, "Are you disabled under the act if you know that the minute you leave the house, you will infect the whole city with bubonic plague?"
"I think so," the somewhat startled Mr. Klein replied.
"I would think so, too," Justice Breyer said.
Justice Antonin Scalia objected, "That's not obvious to me."
In this appeal, Bragdon v. Abbott, No. 97-156, the Court was confronting not only its first case under the Americans With Disabilities Act, but also its first case related to AIDS or H.I.V. The wariness and unease the Justices displayed might be explained by their knowledge -- reinforced by the many friends-of-the-court briefs -- that almost any ruling would set an important precedent not only for the legal status of AIDS and H.I.V., but for how the law applied to a wide range of conditions. At issue is not only the definition of disability, but also the meaning of the exception offered to medical workers and others who fear a "direct threat" from a person with an infectious disease.
John W. McCarthy, the lawyer for Randon Bragdon, the dentist who in 1994 refused to treat Ms. Abbott in his Bangor, Me., office, argued strenuously that the lower courts' interpretation required dentists to take unacceptable risks.
"Some risks are acceptable" in society, Mr. McCarthy said, arguing, as an example, that deaths among workers building bridges are inevitable. But he said dentists should not be forced to risk their lives by treating patients with H.I.V. infection.
Both the American Medical Association and the American Dental Association filed briefs asserting that patients with H.I.V. can be treated safely in medical and dental offices using standard precautions against infection. There was much debate during the argument about the nature of the risk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that there is no documented case of a dentist or hygienist being infected with H.I.V. from a patient. Mr. McCarthy said that there were seven such cases, and that the risk was understated and underreported.
One question for the Court is whether risk should be assessed by public health professionals or whether practitioners should be able to act individually.
Urging the Justices to find that asymptomatic people with H.I.V. infection are not disabled, Mr. McCarthy said the law should be interpreted in light of its "context and purposes." He said Congress was concerned about disability that impairs "day-to-day independent living and economic self-sufficiency." From that perspective, he said, limitations on learning, hearing, working and breathing were covered, while reproduction was not.
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy asked how the law should apply to a disease that will inevitably produce limitations in the future. Mr. McCarthy replied that the law did not take account of future disabilities.
When Mr. McCarthy said an eating disorder would probably be covered under the law, Justice Breyer said: "Then why not reproductive activity, which includes a person having a sex life." Sexual activity, he said, was "regarded in this society as a major life activity."
The Clinton Administration entered the case on behalf of Ms. Abbott. Lawrence G. Wallace, a deputy solicitor general, called the lower court's approach to the case exemplary.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Britain Moves to Combat 'Millennium Bug'

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, March 30

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair announced today an accelerated program to forestall the catastrophic essential service lapses, business losses and communications blackouts that he said could be caused by the year 2000 computer date change crisis known as the Millennium Bug.
Saying he was concerned that small and medium-size businesses were lagging in their awareness of the gravity of the "technical time bomb," Mr. Blair told a London conference on the subject that the Government would spend $160 million for new centers for information technology assistance, for increased financing for the Government's Action 2000 campaign and for the training of 20,000 "bug busters" to help companies correct the problem. 
 The Government will offer grants to train young people, the older unemployed or retired people to help companies and in the process help them start their own careers in information technology, he said.
In keeping with his projection of the country as modern and competitive in an age of high-speed worldwide technology, he said Britain would assist a move to educate countries abroad that have not taken into account the seriousness of the consequences of inaction.
"We need to act internationally," Mr. Blair said, "because in a global economy other countries' problems are our own."
He said Britain was contributing $16.5 million to a proposed World Bank fund aimed at generating action in developing countries, and he said that as the current president of the European Union, Britain would press the case at future meetings of the community.
The Millennium Bug potentially affects millions of computers and other electronic devices that will not read 2000 as a valid date because their internal software is programmed to read only the last two digits of any given year. That means they would interpret 2000 as 1900, which could cause the computers to corrupt data, crash programs or fail to operate at all.
Huge amounts of records and statistics, including those of stock and pension accounts, could be compromised as computers came to a halt. Any industry with time-sensitive data, from nuclear reactors and hospitals to financial institutions and retail businesses, could be harmed.
"Without careful preparation, there could be major disruption to essential services such as benefit payments, or even to emergency services such as hospitals, the fire and the police," Mr. Blair said.
Mr. Blair said that Britain was "leading the way in tackling the Bug."
Britain, of course, is not the only place trying to avert a Millennium Bug problem. Many other Governments and companies around the world are also spending money on computer upgrades. In the United States, officials responsible for year 2000 conversion efforts have estimated it will cost $2.3 billion just to fix the Federal Government's computer systems. The General Motors Corporation expects to spend up to $500 million and Chase Manhattan Bank expects to spend $300 million.
Several critics greeted Mr. Blair's announcement today with warnings that his action was already too late. Richard Coppel, chief executive of Prove It 2000, a major consulting group, said loosing "dedicated amateurs" on the problem risked complicating it further. He said the Government was "well intentioned but lacks any understanding of how the program might be practically applied."
Cheryl Gillan, the Conservatives' spokesman on Trade and Industry, also faulted Mr. Blair for waiting too long, saying: "It is now a question of damage limitation. The Government cannot afford to waste any more precious time."
Brian Cotter, the spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said, "The Government's posturing belies their own inaction over the Bug."
Mr. Blair said the overall cost of adjustment to the public sector would reach $5 billion. A Forum of Private Business survey showed that only 53 percent of its 23,700 member companies had checked their hardware and operating systems to see if they were prepared for the Millennium rollover date and only 27 percent had begun to make the changes.
While the Millennium Bug has prompted a lot of general doomsday scenario predictions, a case at the giant retail concern of Marks & Spencer is the one that has so far most attracted consumers' attention. The chain's stock inventory system scrapped an entire consignment of corned beef because its sell-by date was "02," and the computer system assumed it was 96 years old.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Soar to Record High

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
Sales of new homes soared to a record high in February, the Government said today, as the robust economy, low mortgage rates and warm weather enticed buyers.
Single-family home sales rose 4.8 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 893,000 units last month after a revised 5.2 percent gain in January, the Commerce Department said. February's annual rate was the highest on record, surpassing the 880,000 set in March 1986. 
 Economists said the report underscored tremendous momentum in the economy despite weakness in exports by American business to Asia.
The home sales pace topped the rate of 817,000 in February 1997 by 9.3 percent. The news follows a report last week that sales of existing homes also jumped to a record last month.
In its report, the Commerce Department said the supply of available homes dwindled to a record low 3.8-month supply from 4.1 months in January.
The regional breakdown of sales showed the clear influence of the weather as the Northeast and Midwest, which enjoyed springlike weather in February, saw the biggest gains.
Sales jumped 25.5 percent in the Midwest, 19.2 percent in the Northeast and 15.7 percent in the West. But sales fell 12.3 percent in the South, which was hit by severe storms caused by the El Nino weather pattern.
The median price of a new home rose 5.8 percent, to $153,400, from $145,000 in January and 7.3 percent from $143,000 in February 1997.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES;
Norway Pledges to Take Part In Worldwide Oil Supply Cuts

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
An emerging coalition of oil-exporting countries seeking to reduce production and raise prices was significantly strengthened yesterday when Norway, a major exporter, said it would cut its output as much as 100,000 barrels a day.
And members of the main-line Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting at a special session in Vienna yesterday, approved cuts totaling about 1.25 million barrels a day, or 4.3 percent of the group's output of 28.8 million barrels a day. Current world demand totals about 74 million barrels. 
 Norway's agreement means that two major exporting countries outside OPEC -- Mexico and now Norway -- support efforts to lift the price of oil, which had fallen below $13 a barrel at one point before rebounding somewhat.
Nonetheless, crude oil prices fell yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, dropping 55 cents, to $16.21 a barrel, as traders were apparently uncertain that the producing countries would actually follow through on their pledges and that the cuts would be large enough.
After news of the agreement among OPEC members, which came last night in Vienna, oil prices fell slightly in trading on exchanges that were open at night.
"Most people don't think it's enough," Doug Stetzer, a broker at ED&F Man International in New York, said of the proposed cuts.
All OPEC members have pledged their support of the effort, which began a week ago with an agreement by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico.
Marit Arnstad, Norway's Oil and Energy Minister, said that his country's cuts would not be made until mid-April and depended on other producing nations' living up to their promises to reduce output. The OPEC members said they would begin the cuts tomorrow.
Norway has supported OPEC-initiated export cuts in the past in an effort to increase prices. What is unusual in this round of cuts, however, is that the initiative was taken by Mexico, which helped bring about the agreement of the Venezuelans and Saudis, each of whom had been waiting for the other to make the first move.
Vahan Zanoyan, president of the Petroleum Finance Company, an energy consulting group based in Washington, said yesterday it was still unclear whether greater cooperation was emerging between OPEC and major non-OPEC producers.
"I really believe that it is premature to even suspect that," he said, recalling previous efforts to achieve cooperation.
He added that Norway was less dependent on oil revenue for its economic well-being than some other major producing countries -- particularly Mexico, but also many OPEC members. The Norwegians might therefore not have as pressing an incentive to stick by an effort to increase prices.
All the producers are struggling to reduce a world surplus of oil caused by an unusually mild winter; the economic crisis in Asia, which reduced expected growth in demand, and rising exports by many producing countries.
Though the price of crude oil fell in recent weeks to the lowest level in nine years, it has rebounded a bit on expectations of a supply cut. And that effect may have begun to be felt at the pump. The United States Energy Department said yesterday that the average price for regular gasoline increased to $1.03 a gallon this week, up 3 cents from last week.
Normally it takes about one month for the price of crude oil to be passed through to the retail level, so the jump was called unusual.
The average retail price, however, was still 17 cents lower than in the same period last year.

HEADLINE: Fund Investors Are Returning To Riskier Bets

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
After several months of more cautious and conservative investing, mutual fund shareholders and managers are growing bold again.
According to industry groups that track fund cash flows, the amount of new money invested in several types of aggressive stock funds in the United States and abroad rose steadily in February and March, as a surge in technology stocks led American share prices to record highs. 
 Mutual fund portfolio managers have also been taking a less cautious stance. The amount of uninvested cash in stock portfolios fell to 5 percent of assets in February, down from 5.5 percent a month earlier and 5.7 percent in February 1997. By keeping less in cash, fund managers demonstrate that they are less concerned about investor withdrawals.
The return to more aggressive fund choices marks an end, at least for now, to the nervousness among fund investors since October, when weakness in Asian economies pushed the United States stock market into a quick decline. The resulting turmoil caused new investments in small-capitalization and aggressive growth stock funds to fall as investors channeled more money into less risky ones.
"I really believe individual investors thought Asia was going to slow the U.S. market significantly, and so they became more conservative with their fund investments," said Charles Biderman, president of Trim Tabs Financial Services, a Santa Rosa, Calif., company that tracks cash flows. "It was only in the middle of March that they gave up that fear completely."
According to data released yesterday by the Investment Company Institute, a fund trade group, equity mutual funds took in a total of $24.2 billion in February, nearly two-thirds more than in January and well above the group's previous estimate of $19.5 billion for February.
Some of those gains came from aggressive growth stock funds, which in January had net withdrawals by investors but received $1.6 billion in net new deposits last month, the institute reported. Global stock funds added $3.7 billion in February after cash outflows of about $1 billion in January.
Cash flows into hybrid funds, a more conservative group that invests in both stocks and bonds, fell by one-third in February, to $1.9 billion.
Those trends continued this month, according to Trim Tabs and AMG Data Services, another independent company that tracks short-term cash flows. In recent weeks, both companies have reported that aggressive stock funds have added new cash, while the amounts flowing into moderate and conservative stock funds are flat, at best.
As investors shied away from aggressive stock funds last fall, they increased purchases of shares in bond funds. So while the amount of money flowing into taxable bond funds is up sharply from its level a year ago, it has fallen over the last two months. Taxable bond funds added $5.6 billion in February, down from $7.2 billion in January, the Investment Company Institute said.
Trim Tabs reported that bond funds of all types added about $3.8 billion in March, down from about $6 billion in February.
The Investment Company Institute also reported that municipal bond funds added $656 million in net new investments in February, about one-third of the January amount. By comparison, in the first two months of 1997, about $575 million flowed out of municipal funds.
This month, the Investment Company Institute revamped its categories for measuring cash flows. In addition, it eliminated from its calculations the assets put into funds of funds -- those that invest in a portfolio of other mutual funds. Previously, those assets, which totaled $26.3 billion at the end of February, had been counted twice in measuring assets and cash flows.
The institute moved several classes of funds that invest in both stocks and bonds into a separate, hybrid category. Previously, most of those were included in the bond fund totals.
While the institute had previously reported that bond funds added $11.3 billion in new cash in January, the revamped January totals included only $7.2 billion in taxable bond funds. A further $3.1 billion was invested in the hybrid funds in January, while $1.8 billion flowed into municipal bond funds.

HEADLINE: Wrangling Over the Federal Budget Outlives a Dying Deficit

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
Last year's balanced budget agreement was supposed to make it all so simple. After years of bitter partisan warfare over taxes and spending, President Clinton and the Republican leadership in Congress agreed on a five-year plan that gave both sides most of what they wanted, with enough left over to eliminate the Federal deficit.
The deficit is evaporating even faster than expected, thanks to the strong economy and the tax revenues it is generating. But the ideological and political confrontations over how to apportion the money raised by the Federal Government are as intense as ever, and members of both parties see themselves headed for a high-stakes showdown with considerable implications for this fall's Congressional races. 
 At issue is whether the two parties can find a way to keep their pledges of fiscal discipline and find money for more of what they have always craved -- tax cuts on the part of Republicans, social programs for Democrats and old-fashioned pork-barrel spending for both.
Franklin D. Raines, the White House budget chief, said today that the White House and Republicans appeared to be heading toward a major confrontation in September, when Congress will try to complete its spending bills for next year.
Not only are there a raft of unresolved partisan disputes, Mr. Raines said, but the White House and the Republican leadership do not have any negotiating forum in which to address their differences, as they did last year when teams from the two sides met regularly to hash out the balanced budget deal.
"I'm very concerned that we don't even have a process by which we could get a good result," Mr. Raines said. "It's a hazardous path we're on with very few working days in Congress left to resolve it."
Mr. Raines even suggested that the outcome could be another standoff of the sort that led to the Federal Government's being shut down in 1995. He indicated, though, that it was more likely to turn out like 1996, when the Republicans, eager to finish their work and go home to campaign, cut a flurry of last-minute deals that gave the Administration much of what it wanted.
Richard E. May, former Republican staff director of the House Budget Committee, said Republicans even had a name for what it cost them to come to an agreement in 1996 so they could leave Washington to campaign: an "exit fee."
Mr. May said it would not be surprising if the Administration tried the same negotiating tactic this year. But he said this time the Administration would have a difficult time making the case that its domestic proposals will not shatter the spending limits that both sides have agreed to abide by. And he said the situation still remained very confused because of uncertainty about whether Congress will pass legislation intended to curb smoking, largely by forcing a sharp increase in cigarette prices, a move that would raise billions of dollars that both parties want to dedicate to their priorities.
"This is a bizarre year for the budget," Mr. May said.
It is a measure of how many cross-currents are at play that not all of the disputes are strictly partisan. Already the White House sees money for its proposed new education and child care programs being whittled away by a bipartisan push to spend far more on highways and mass transit than last year's budget deal envisioned. The transportation bill is the only major piece of legislation to pass the Senate so far this year, and it is one of the few bills with bipartisan support in the House.
"Transportation is an important domestic priority, but we must strike a balance so that we do not allow one priority to squeeze out other critical investments such as education or undermine our fiscal discipline," Mr. Clinton said in a letter sent to Speaker Newt Gingrich on Saturday.
Fiscal conservatives within the Republican Party are just as worried about the strong momentum behind the transportation bill, saying it goes back on their commitment to reduce the size and power of the Federal Government.
"This bill is really a hog," said Representative John R. Kasich, Republican of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee. "We believe this bill is, in fact, an abomination." His objections were brushed aside by Mr. Gingrich and the rest of the Republican leadership.
Some of the battles are more traditionally partisan. The White House's expansion of education and child care programs would rely on the revenues that would flow from the tobacco legislation.
But Republicans are divided about how any tobacco money should be used, with Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico leading a push to use the money to shore up Medicare, and many other Republicans determined to use the money for tax cuts.

HEADLINE: SENATE IS OFFERED SWEEPING MEASURE TO FIGHT SMOKING

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
With bipartisan support, Senator John McCain today offered a comprehensive tobacco bill that could form the basis of ground-breaking legislation meant to sharply reduce the number of Americans who smoke.
The measure, containing no restrictions on private lawsuits, faced withering attacks from the cigarette manufacturers on one side and public health authorities on the other. 
 But Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, who heads the Commerce Committee, said he hoped to have found a middle ground that could win broad support. "It's tough medicine for a tough problem," he declared at a news conference.
The measure would impose a fee on tobacco companies to force up the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.10 over the next five years, penalize the tobacco companies if the number of teen-age smokers did not fall to specified levels, impose strict limits on cigarette advertising and give the Food and Drug Administration broad authority to regulate tobacco.
The main concession to the industry was an annual ceiling of $6.5 billion on the amount the cigarette manufacturers could be required to pay in civil damages. Claims exceeding the ceiling would be owed in subsequent years.
The legislation is much tougher on the tobacco industry than the settlement the manufacturers reached with state attorneys general last June. The bill would raise the price of a pack of cigarettes by almost twice the amount in the June agreement and would not contain that settlement's prohibition against class-action lawsuits seeking damages for smoking-related illnesses.
With the bill's introduction today, it replaced the June settlement as the package around which further deliberations will revolve.
Mr. McCain said that the Commerce Committee would vote on the legislation on Wednesday and that he had received assurances from the Republican majority leader, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, that the bill would be brought to the Senate floor.
The House of Representatives has seemed to be marking time on tobacco legislation until the Senate acts.
The McCain measure was the product of weeks of horse-trading. As late as Sunday night, the negotiators had not resolved the question of whether to give the cigarette manufacturers protection from lawsuits in exchange for their agreement to restrict advertising voluntarily.
The industry urgently wants such protection, but Mr. McCain decided against it: "The consensus was that this was the most viable option."
J. Phil Carlton, a top lawyer for the tobacco industry, said the measure would lead to "a massive contraband market" and "almost certainly drive companies into bankruptcy."
"It cannot serve as the basis for a realistic and comprehensive national tobacco policy," Mr. Carlton said at a news conference.
On the other side, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, one of the country's most prominent public health authorities, said: "I cannot support this bill as it stands. Its programs to reduce the number of children who smoke are too weak and its protections of the tobacco industry are too strong."
Several Democratic lawmakers, including Senators Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said that the bill was unsatisfactory and that they would try to amend it.
Mr. Conrad, who represents the Senate Democratic leadership on tobacco issues, said in an interview tonight that he was pleased that Mr. McCain had dropped provisions that would have given the cigarette manufacturers immunity from class-action lawsuits based on smoking-related illnesses and other private suits seeking punitive damages from the companies for past practices.
But Mr. Conrad said that the cigarette price increase was too small and that the penalties were too low on companies that did not meet annual goals for reducing youth smoking. Mr. Conrad favors raising the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.50 over two years.
Promising frequent efforts to amend the legislation, Mr. Conrad said, "We're going to give our colleagues a chance to vote and vote and vote."
The White House took a measured approach. In a luncheon speech, Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff, said that the Clinton Administration was pleased with many aspects of the legislation. But he said that the Administration hoped to increase the penalties on the companies if smoking goals were not met. The bill would limit the penalties to $3.5 billion a year.
Rahm Emanuel, a senior adviser to President Clinton, called the bill "promising but not perfect."
Despite the opposition, Mr. McCain has won substantial backing on his committee.
He has solid support from the Republicans. And at his news conference today, he was joined by two important Democrats on the committee -- Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, one of the few lawmakers who have expressed a degree of sympathy for the tobacco industry, and Ron Wyden of Oregon, perhaps the committee's most ardent opponent of the industry.
Also present were two state attorneys general who have been active in taking on the tobacco companies, Michael C. Moore of Mississippi and Christine Gregoire of Washington.
Mr. McCain said that he had checked with all the members of the committee and that he had "an overwhelming majority on both sides of the aisle" on his side.
Asked about the industry's complaints, Mr. McCain replied, "I could not craft a proposal that would be vetoed or modified by their concerns."
Whether the strong support on his committee can be turned into a majority on the Senate floor is another matter. Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, could be a serious obstacle. He is not enthusiastic about tobacco legislation, and he has a history of tying up legislation that he opposes.
The bill would require the tobacco companies to pay more than $500 billion into a Government fund over the next 25 years, compared with $368.5 billion in last June's settlement. The cost would be passed on to smokers, and as a result the price of a pack of cigarettes would be raised in annual increments that would reach $1.10 a pack in five years.
When inflation and scheduled excise-tax increases are factored in, according to Treasury Department calculations, the average price of a pack of cigarettes nationwide would reach $3.58 in 2003.
The goal is to reduce teen-age smoking by 25 percent in five years and 45 percent in 10 years.
The McCain bill does not address how the money would be spent. Some Republicans want it all to go into Medicare. Others favor tax breaks to encourage small businesses and individuals to purchase health insurance.
President Clinton wants some of the money to go for education and child care. Public health advocates want most of it to be spent on antismoking advertisements and smoking cessation programs.

HEADLINE: Republican Budget Feuds

 BODY:
Republicans in Congress have developed a habit of fighting with each other more than with the White House. Now their feuding threatens passage of emergency spending for disaster relief and for American forces in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf.
In the House, restive conservatives have draped the emergency bill with budget cuts in Administration programs like housing and AmeriCorps. They know such cuts will force President Clinton to veto the bill, but do not seem to care. They have forgotten that the same tactics of holding a vital disaster-relief measure hostage to their agenda backfired last year, tarring Republicans as obstructionists. 
 In the Senate, the issue of spending has sent Republicans in a different direction altogether. When the emergency appropriations bill was approved by the Senate last week, it contained no separate call for budget cuts. In fact, the bill grew in size as Republican senators added spending for boll-weevil eradication, military aircraft acquisition and other items. Most significant, the Senate attached $17.9 billion for the International Monetary Fund as leading conservatives like Ted Stevens of Alaska warned that the money was needed to stabilize financial markets in Asia.
The Senate bill, with its I.M.F. rider, passed 84 to 16 last week. But the lopsided vote is unlikely to impress House Republicans. Again, they seem incapable of passing something on its own merits. They insist that they will not approve money for either the I.M.F. or the United Nations unless approval contains yet another separate provision barring American aid to family-planning groups overseas that advocate abortion. No matter that a long list of internationally minded Republicans have joined with Alan Greenspan to plead for the I.M.F. funding as necessary for a healthy global economy.
Watching House members engage in the self-destructive act of tying up much-needed legislation, Speaker Newt Gingrich seems incapable of acting. He announced over the weekend that he would seek re-election to the House and to the post of Speaker, but most politicians expect him to run for President. Whether he leaves the House or stays, Mr. Gingrich clearly feels he cannot stand up to the obstreperous ultra-conservatives in his conference who bemoan every compromise with the Administration as an unconscionable sellout.
But if Mr. Gingrich aspires to the Presidency, or if Congressional leaders aspire to full partnership on the budget, they first have to show they can govern. Holding up essential legislation to settle scores is not the way to do it.

HEADLINE: CBS Considers Manhattan and Jersey City for New Studios

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In what may shape up as the next trans-Hudson battle for big business, the CBS television network is considering several sites in Manhattan -- and one in Jersey City -- for a new broadcasting center to replace its 35-year-old studios on West 57th Street, near 11th Avenue, according to several people involved in the negotiations.
Leading the list of options for the network, several of those people said, are Donald J. Trump's Riverside South project on the West Side of Manhattan, from 59th Street to 72nd Street, and the Newport complex of apartments and offices on 600 acres on the Jersey City riverfront. The network's plans were first reported yesterday in The New York Post. 
 "We consider staying in Manhattan to be the preferred option, but we need to look at the financial implications of each scenario," said Jack Bergen, the network's vice president for communications. While acknowledging that Newport and Mr. Trump's project are under consideration, he said other Manhattan sites were also among the network's options. Neither he nor any of the other officials involved in the negotiations would specify the other sites.
The network will be required later this year by the Federal Communications Commission to begin producing digital television programs, and must invest heavily in equipment for the new technology. Although it accepted a $49.5 million package of tax breaks and other incentives from New York City in 1993 to upgrade its 57th Street studios for the new technology, it has not done so, and Mr. Bergen said network executives have concluded that a new building would be better suited for the technology.
CBS would be required to reimburse the city for all of the financial incentives it has received if it moves to New Jersey, city officials said. Although it was not clear yesterday whether the incentive package could be transferred to another site in Manhattan, several officials said some form of city incentives were all but assured.
"We don't expect them to move out, and we regard this as a great opportunity for the city," said Randy Levine, the Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, who said he met with CBS executives two weeks ago to discuss their options. He said the city hoped not only to persuade the network to stay, but also to "piggyback" its new studios with those of other entertainment companies, creating an even larger complex. But he said questions about whether financial incentives would be offered, or what form they would take, had not been resolved.
Officials at Cushman and Wakefield, the brokerage firm representing CBS in its search, said the network has taken an interest in Newport Centre Three, an office building in the Jersey City complex on which construction is to begin next month.
But in Jersey City, it appeared unlikely that negotiations had reached the point where CBS was seeking any government incentives, because the company had not yet spoken directly to Newport's developer, Samuel J. LeFrak. He began building the vast riverfront complex 14 years ago.
"I have not spoken to them personally," Mr. LeFrak said. "CBS's fingerprints may be there, but it doesn't mean their signature is there." New Jersey officials could not be reached by telephone for comment last night.
Mr. Trump, by contrast, said he had met with CBS executives and was convinced that they would sign on for at least 1.5 million square feet of studio space in his project. "I have a great feeling about CBS," he said yesterday.
If the network's search narrows -- as some officials said they believed it would -- to a choice between Jersey City or Mr. Trump's project, it could prompt a replay of the battle that was waged in the 1980's to persuade NBC not to move to New Jersey.
Although NBC ultimately accepted a package of city incentives to remain in its studios in Rockefeller Center, it had threatened to move to New Jersey or to be the first large tenant of Mr. Trump's West Side project, which was then to be called Television City and provide space for several broadcasting companies.
Since then, the project, with its name changed to Riverside South, has emerged from a series of political battles and revisions as a plan for 18 riverfront towers, most of them residential. Only the southern end of the area, from 59th Street to 62d Street and from West End Avenue to the West Side Highway, is now designated for broadcasting studios.
Mr. Trump said yesterday that he had decided to change the name of the project again, this time to Trump Place, a designation that he said would capitalize on the prestige of his name.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan, to Revitalize Economy, Prepares to Reshape Its Markets

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 30

 BODY:
In one of its most ambitious undertakings, the Japanese Government plans this week to set in motion a far-reaching program that it hopes will infuse the country's financial landscape with the prowess of its manufacturing industries.
The rules of the game start changing Wednesday in a phased, three-year process called the Big Bang. For the Government of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, April 1 is the opening shot in an effort to transform Tokyo into a financial center as vibrant as New York or London. 
 The change is also aimed at shattering the rigidities of the Japanese economy, which has been strained by weaknesses in the banking system, most notably hundreds of billions of dollars in soured property loans amassed over the years.
Scores of measures, embraced in a 10-pound, 2,132-page tome now working its way through Parliament, are intended to bring mutual funds to the man and woman in the street, break down barriers between banks and brokerage firms, encourage insolvent financial institutions to close down and allow brokers to compete with the Tokyo Stock Exchange by starting their own mini-exchanges to trade stocks. It amounts to a grand bid to create more efficient markets, and, if successful, could end up changing Japanese investing habits the way those of Americans have been transformed over the last quarter-century.
The Government hopes that by the year 2001 it will have begun to coax many of the nation's savers into investing a chunk of their savings in new ways. Those savers have sequestered in near-zero-interest savings accounts a total of about $9 trillion -- a sum greater than the annual output of the American economy. Even a fraction of that could send global stock markets soaring.
Much of the program is not yet fully formed, and its completion is by no means certain.
Until recently, Japan's financial industry has been a strait-jacketed society, governed less by shareholders than by Government officials, who stifled competition with stiff regulations and by sharing new ideas among the banks. Major banks consulted one another so much that they ended up expanding overseas in a herd, making property loans at the same time and then watching in horror as those loans soured simultaneously. Even now, they announce profits and losses all together in a group meeting.
The Government aims to transform that into a freer, more open system. By the year 2001, it hopes far more variety will be offered to ordinary citizens.
Still, the Japanese remain largely risk-averse investors, particularly after the collapse of their stock market from its dizzying heights of the early 1990's. It is entirely possible that the Big Bang at the outset will produce a flood of new financial instruments that no one will feel comfortable buying.
But some younger people are eager to embrace greater risk in exchange for a return higher than the less than three-tenths of a percent interest paid by banks. Yuki Aoyama, an office manager at a small company, recently visited the Tokyo Stock Exchange to learn more about the Big Bang.
"I'm tired of the scandals at the Japanese banks and securities companies," Ms. Aoyama said. "After April, we can open an account overseas. Having money in Japan will do you no good. Banks are places where you keep your money just to prevent it from being stolen." "Of course, there will be foreign exchange risk," she added. "But we need to make our own decisions on whether to bet on high-risk, high-return products. That is real capitalism."
American and European financial companies, from Merrill Lynch & Company to Fidelity Investments, are rushing into the market in the hope of wresting funds from Japanese banks. They are betting that the Japanese savers are fed up with a dearth of choice and are planning to offer a range of American-style mutual funds and sophisticated asset management, wrapped up in bolder marketing.
The master plan was inspired by earlier efforts to liberalize markets in the United States and Britain. In the United States, the move was called May Day, after the date in 1975 when brokerage commissions were deregulated. In Britain, markets were freed in the Big Bang of 1986 that helped fortify London's status as a pillar of international finance.
Japan hopes to modernize its markets as well, but it will not be easy.
"We have all been living in a protected environment, like a society of young children," said Nobuyuki Koga, a director at Nomura Securities Ltd., Japan's largest brokerage house. "But from now on, only those who think for themselves and act by themselves will survive. And it is a big question whether everyone who belonged to that society can grow up and become an adult."
Indeed, the Big Bang might fizzle into a Little Rattle. There are potential minefields ahead for the authorities, who have already shown some ambivalence about giving up so much control to the markets. Partly as a result, deregulation will be spread over three years, officially beginning by freeing up some brokerage commissions and making it easier for individuals to open accounts overseas.
It will end in 2001, if all goes as planned, with a better stock settlement system, broader financial empires, greater disclosure, an expanded watchdog agency over the financial industry -- and probably a lot fewer banks and brokerages.
But of the 200 brokerage firms in Japan, analysts ask, will the Government let half of them disappear?
"Why not?" responded Eisuke Sakakibara, Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs. Insolvent and weak institutions will simply have to merge, be purchased or disappear in an orderly fashion, he said in an interview. "Right now we have 19 internationally active Japanese financial institutions," he said. "But I would not be surprised to see that number reduced to below 10 over the next two to three years."
"There's no choice now -- we have crossed the river, we have burned all the bridges," Mr. Sakakibara added. "The global standard has to be established here. There's no other way. I don't see any other way but to continue to deregulate this Tokyo market. And we can do that."
Can they?
Japan has been bringing out deregulation packages for years, yet bureaucratic controls are so strong and social attitudes are so averse to layoffs and bankruptcies that past drives have often fallen flat. Critics point out that the Big Bang has hit snags even before it has begun.
Indeed, as a last act under the old system before Big Bang rings in the new fiscal year on April 1, the Government has hinted it will spend nearly $8 billion to buy stocks and help prop up the stock market. Banks and brokerage firms fold substantial amounts of stock into their capital bases, so the Government is trying to help minimize losses when banks record their stock prices on March 31.
The Government protests that its first priority is to bolster the tottering financial system, which was thrown into turmoil last fall with the failure of four financial institutions.
Likewise, to avoid too much carnage in the new rough-and-tumble marketplace, the Government is delaying full competition in brokerage commissions, liberalizing them first only on transactions over $390,000 before completing the process in 1999. But while some brokers are at a loss over how to cope, the prospect of a fight-to-the-death has caught the attention of others.
"It breaks our hearts, but we're pushing ahead with restructuring, said Osamu Horibe, director of Takagi Securities, a midsize brokerage firm that has shut down branches and let go more than half its workers over eight years. "There may be victims, but I hope the company I love will not be one of them."
This restructuring may in turn ripple through the financial system and, ultimately, change the entire Japanese economy. For instance, if banks told corporate clients that they would not lend money unless the companies increased their return on capital, then companies might work harder to lift profitability.
"The number of banks we end up with is less important than the rules by which they lend money," said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist in Japan for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and his guess is that banks will set stricter guidelines that will raise efficiency in all sectors.
Certainly fiercer competition, particularly from foreign firms, is likely to heighten efficiency in Japan. Even the Tokyo Stock Exchange is vulnerable. Under current plans, brokers will be able to challenge it by setting up their own mini-exchanges to trade individual stocks, even in their own offices, to save costs.
Moreover, banks will be able to enter the insurance business, and insurance conglomerates will be allowed to try their hand at extending loans. Banks will be able to sell mutual funds, which were traditionally sold by brokerage firms, and Government approvals will no longer be required on each new type of fund.
Traditionally, money was something one did not talk about in public, and many people are profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of buying riskier stocks, mutual funds or bonds. Japanese invest only about 2.6 percent of their household assets in mutual funds.
But now consumers will be hit with a new marketing barrage. Even some 24-hour convenience stores are preparing to go into the foreign exchange business. Brokerage firms are already wooing investors with the prospect of lucrative opportunities in the booming markets in the United States and Europe. So some Government officials fear an outflow of money, as individuals begin investing in Treasury bonds, which are offering three times the yield of Japanese Government instruments.

HEADLINE: 2 Developers Bid Top Dollar For What's Left in Times Sq.

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Outbidding a dozen other developers, Mortimer B. Zuckerman and George Klein have won the rights to buy the last two development sites in Times Square, but at a price that vastly exceeds that of similar buildings in the booming, neon-encrusted neighborhood, said real estate executives and a top state official.
The deal, if completed, would mark the culmination of a much-ballyhooed but long-delayed redevelopment effort that began 16 years ago, when city and state officials sought to clean up Times Square with plans to build four giant office towers, to be filled, they thought, with financial corporations. 
 That plan died after the real estate market collapsed a decade ago, and for years many people wondered whether the office towers would ever be built.
But now, with Times Square awash with tourists, new theaters and entertainment companies, the four towers appear headed for completion. Instead of bankers, the people roaming the halls are likely to be media and entertainment executives and lawyers who handle their business.
One tower is under construction, to be occupied by Conde Nast Publications and the law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom; a second, whose main tenant will be the Reuters news and information services organization, is due to start soon.
Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Klein are poised to develop the final two buildings, on sites on the south side of 42d Street, just east and just west of Seventh Avenue. The developers reached an agreement in principle with the sites' owner, the Prudential Insurance Company of America, to buy control of them for about $330 million. The two developers, who joined forces shortly before the March 11 deadline for bids on the two sites, plan to demolish the existing buildings and construct two towers of nearly one million square feet each. Among the potential tenants are Disney and Home Box Office, both of which are looking for new office space in Times Square.
Prudential is expected to hammer out the terms of the deal during the next week with a joint venture formed by Mr. Zuckerman, Mr. Klein and the Blackstone Group, an investment bank. Mr. Zuckerman, the chairman of Boston Properties and the publisher of The Daily News, is expected to be the majority owner of the project. Prudential and the Zuckerman-Klein group declined comment.
Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Klein submitted an offer for both parcels that was large enough to pre-empt all the other prospective buyers, including the developer Jerry Speyer and the investor Steven C. Witkoff, who had recently intensified their efforts to win control of the sites.
Real estate executives say both developers are desperate to regain center stage in the city's real estate theater, after gambling when real estate was booming in the 1980's only to falter after the stock market crashed in 1987. To do it, Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Klein are paying about $180 a buildable square foot. That is twice the amount paid by Reuters for a similar site on the northwest corner of Seventh Avenue and 42d Street less than six months ago, and nearly four times what the Durst Organization paid for the site of the first tower, at 43d and Broadway.
"This deal provides them with an opportunity to get back into the public spotlight in an area which is highly sought after by both local and national tenants," said Charles R. Foy, a lawyer specializing in land use with Whitman Breed Abbott & Morgan. "They're paying a very high price for a highly visible project in order to capture what may be the last opportunity in this market."
The price raises the question of whether the developers would have to charge high rents, or ask the city for more tax incentives to attract tenants, real estate executives say.
Mr. Zuckerman's attempts to build an oversized tower at Columbus Circle died in 1994 after a recession and a decade of battles with celebrities and civic groups. From 1982 to 1996, Mr. Klein shared the development rights to all four towers with Prudential, but lost a chance to develop any one of them when Prudential decided to abandon real estate.
"I'm glad they both won," said former Mayor Edward I. Koch. "Ultimately, justice prevails."
Prudential, which had once given up hope of ever recouping the $433 million it put into Times Square redevelopment during the past decade, now stands to break even or make a little money, if the latest deal goes through. In the last two years, the insurance company sold two of the four development sites it controlled for a total of $150 million. The latest deal would bring Prudential's take to $480 million.
The latest two parcels inspired intense competition among developers and investors, not only because development sites are so rare in Manhattan, but also because the parcels are laced with tax breaks under the state's 42d Street redevelopment project that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. With so few large blocks of office space available in midtown, rents are rising.
"Times Square has replaced Fifth Avenue as the place where people want to be," said Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University.
The most valuable of the two sites that Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Klein plan to develop is the southwest corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue, where a 40-story office tower is planned on a parcel now occupied by the Disney Store and next door to Disney's New Amsterdam Theater. Disney is expected to retain its retail store in the new building.
The second site, an irregularly shaped island bounded by Seventh Avenue and Broadway, 41st and 42d Streets, presents more of a challenge because it sits above a complex of subway tunnels, which will make excavation complicated. It is now the site of Hansen's Times Square Brewery. A 49-story tower is planned.
The fortunes of Times Square have taken a roller coaster ride during the last two decades. In the early 1980's, the city and the state had hoped that the development of four large, heavily subsidized office towers would rejuvenate the area and wipe out the peep shows, T-shirt shops and pornography theaters that dominated 42d Street. But Prudential and Mr. Klein's plans ran into neighborhood opposition and a string of 47 lawsuits in the 1980's.
By the time the recession hit in the early 1990's, Prudential had poured $433 million in land acquisition, theater renovation and retail space, and lost its desire to build. The revival of Times Square was led, instead, by Bertelsmann, the giant German company; Disney, and other entertainment companies.
Much to Mr. Klein's dismay, Prudential decided to sell the four development sites rather than build. In 1996, Douglas Durst paid the insurance company $70 million, about $50 a buildable square foot, for a parcel on the east side of Broadway, between 42d and 43d Streets, where he is now building a 50-story tower.
Last year, Prudential sold a second site, on the west side of Seventh Avenue, between 42d and 43d Streets, to Reuters and the Rudin real estate family for another office tower.

HEADLINE: METRO NEWS BRIEFS: NEW JERSEY;
Whitman to Streamline Operation of Programs

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman announced yesterday that the state government would be reorganized to streamline the administration of some programs.
One change would shift the New Jersey Redevelopment Authority, which finances urban projects, from the Department of Commerce to the Department of Community Affairs, which oversees the State Urban Coordinating Council, said Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman for the Governor. Community Affairs, which is the state's primary link to municipalities, would also take over the Office of State Planning, now a part of the state Treasury Department, to help local governments achieve statewide land use goals, Ms. O'Connor said. 
 In addition, school bus safety and inspection programs are to move from the Department of Education to the Department of Transportation, and all state arts and cultural institutions would be gathered under the Department of State.
The Governor has already merged the Departments of Banking and Insurance, and has eliminated the Departments of Higher Education and the Public Advocate. The new changes, which the Governor's office said would not necessitate layoffs, will go into effect in 60 days unless they are opposed by lawmakers.
