HEADLINE: Turkey Hints at a Breakup With Europe

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Turkey's prime minister denounced the European Union's alleged stalling on his country's longstanding membership bid. But is he bluffing when he says Turkey will look east? 

 BODY:
LONDON - A half century after taking the first steps toward becoming an integral part of Europe, Turkey may be ready to give up.
After heavy hints that Ankara is looking eastwards to a closer alliance with Asia, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the prime minister, said this week that membership in the European Union was not a must for Turkey.
"It is not the Apocalypse if they do not let us in the E.U.," Mr. Erdogan told reporters during a visit to Budapest on Wednesday, as he launched his latest broadside against the Union's alleged delaying tactics to keep his country out. 
His remarks followed a news conference earlier this week in Prague, where Mr. Erdogan described the delay in granting membership to Turkey as "unforgivable."
These and similar expressions of frustration have come as Turkey approaches the 50th anniversary of an agreement with what was then the European Economic Community, which was to have led to eventual full membership in the bloc.
Mr. Erdogan set the tone in a television interview last month in which he accused the E.U. of dragging its feet because Turkey was an Islamic nation. 
As my colleague Andrew Finkel wrote from Istanbul, the prime minister also "threw the diplomatic equivalent of a cream pie" into the debate by suggesting Turkey join the Shanghai Cooperation Organization instead.
Membership of the S.C.O., which groups Russia, China and central Asian states, is not widely viewed as a viable alternative to joining Europe. Andrew wrote that Mr. Erdogan's proposal prompted Turkish columnists to ask whether he might be bluffing in an attempt to put pressure on the Europeans.
The same question was posed this week by Pravda.ru, a Russian news Web site: "The first thought about the purpose of such statements is the fact that Turkey is trying to express its disappointment with the stalled negotiations on accession to the E.U."
But it did not rule out the possibility that Mr. Erdogan might be seeking power "wherever his country's economic strength is consistent with its geopolitical needs as a global player," in contrast to a weak Europe that was preoccupied with its internal problems.
Washington has suggested that Turkish membership in the S.C.O., a security organization viewed as an anti-American bulwark in Central Asia, might be problematic in view of the Turkish role in N.A.T.O.
"Obviously it would be interesting, given the fact that Turkey is also a N.A.T.O. member," Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, said last week.
Hugh Pope, the International Crisis Group's project director in Turkey, suggested that Mr. Erdogan was courting popularity by bashing the Union. 
Turks are frustrated not only by delays in the membership process, he told Rendezvous, but also by the draconian visa regulations they face when traveling to Europe. Potshots aimed at Turkey by European critics were also deeply offensive to Turks, he said.
"But joining the E.U. is not rocket science," he added, emphasizing that Turkey had to meet the requirements of the club if it wanted to join. This would include making domestic reforms and changing its policy on Cyprus, an E.U. state that it refuses to recognize.
Mr. Erdogan's recent remarks on Europe might not indicate that Turkey is quite ready to break off the world's longest engagement. 
Murat Yetkin, of the Turkish daily newspaper Hurriyet, commented on Wednesday: "It is clear that Turkey-E.U. relations cannot go on like this any longer; another chapter this year, a pointless agreement the next."
However, he wrote, "it seems that neither Turkey nor the E.U. wants to be the first to declare divorce. Perhaps because both sides know that it would be a strategically wrong move."

HEADLINE: Geithner to Join Council on Foreign Relations

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: Timothy F. Geithner, who stepped down as Treasury secretary last month, is joining the Council on Foreign Relations as a distinguished fellow, the research organization, based in New York, said on Wednesday. 

 BODY:
 12:41 a.m. | Updated Timothy F. Geithner, who stepped down as Treasury secretary last month, is joining the Council on Foreign Relations as a distinguished fellow, the research organization, based in New York, said on Wednesday. 
The position continues Mr. Geithner's long career in international economic policy. He served as a senior fellow at the council in 2001, and the group said he would be based at its headquarters in New York. 
"We are thrilled to welcome Tim back," Richard N. Haass, the council's president, said in a statement. "Both at Treasury and at the New York Federal Reserve, Tim was a tireless, creative, and responsible custodian of the public trust. His coming to C.F.R. only strengthens our capacity to produce thoughtful analysis of issues at the intersection of economic, political, and strategic developments."
Additionally, Mr. Geithner is planning to write a book, and will begin meeting with publishers shortly. In his post-government work, he is being represented by the powerful Washington lawyer Robert B. Barnett. 
A person familiar with Mr. Geithner's book project said that it is tentatively about the American response to the global financial crisis, describing the decisions Mr. Geithner helped to make from the helm of the New York Fed and then Treasury. It might also touch on the craft of financial firefighting, the person said, given Mr. Geithner's experience fighting foreign crises while at the International Monetary Fund and during the Clinton administration. 
President Obama has named Jacob J. Lew, his former budget director and chief of staff, to head the Treasury Department. Mr. Lew awaits Senate confirmation. 
Mr. Geithner served as Treasury secretary for four tumultuous years, which included the financial crisis and recession. He shepherded the bank bailouts, auto bailouts and stimulus package that helped to return the country to growth, if sluggish growth. Prior to becoming treasury secretary, Mr. Geithner headed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and served as a Treasury and International Monetary Fund official.

HEADLINE: Better Place, Proponent of E.V. Battery Swapping, Pulls Out of U.S. and Australia

BYLINE: BRADLEY BERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Better Place, a company that provides charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, said it would concentrate on Denmark and Israel. 

 BODY:
Better Place, a company that provides charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, said on Wednesday that it would wind down its operations in North America and Australia and concentrate solely on Denmark and Israel.
The company was founded five years ago by Shai Agassi, a charismatic Israeli entrepreneur who had previously been a top executive at SAP, the software company. Mr. Agassi raised more than $800 million in private capital on his vision of breaking the world's oil addiction by offering convenient battery-swapping stations for electric cars. 
But the company failed to demonstrate the feasibility of its battery-swapping concept, even though it managed to create a small network of stations in Israel and Denmark. It has posted $477 million in cumulative losses since 2010, and four months ago replaced Mr. Agassi with a new chief executive, Evan Thornley, who had been the top Better Place executive in Australia. Mr. Thornley unexpectedly resigned in January after just three months in the job, and has been replaced by Dan Cohen. 
Mr. Cohen, who became the company's third chief executive after leaving the company for a brief period, had served as vice president for strategic initiatives for four years. 
On Jan. 22, around the time Mr. Thornley left the company, the Israeli business publication Globes reported that he had left over differences of opinion with the largest shareholder, the Israel Corporation, about Better Place's strategic direction. The company, which was founded in Palo Alto, Calif., is based in Tel Aviv.
On Nov. 28, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the Israel Corporation had warned that it would stop injecting cash into Better Place unless it received a viable business plan by the end of 2012. 
In December, Julie Mullins, a company spokeswoman who has since left Better Place, said that under Mr. Thornley's direction Better Place was "not moving away from battery switching, but is also looking to be the network service provider of choice for any E.V." This suggested a strategic shift to electric-vehicle charging and related software. 
Previously, Better Place's business model had relied on securing automakers' commitments to make vehicles that would be compatible with its robotic battery-swap stations, which resemble drive-through car washes. Mr. Agassi had envisioned a network of stations where motorists could pull in, have their depleted batteries replaced with fully charged units, and return to the road in roughly the amount of time it would take to fill a conventional car with gasoline.
To date, only Renault has agreed to participate, converting a limited number of its electric Fluence sedans, sold in Europe, for battery swapping.
Better Place Hawaii, which operates E.V. charging locations but not swapping stations, informed its customers Tuesday about the North American shutdown. In an e-mail to customers, Brian Goldstein, director of Better Place Hawaii, said the company "will work to ensure continued public charging services for all our Hawaii members." The company's Web site states that Better Place offers more than 150 charging points in Hawaii.
In 2011, the State Energy Office of the Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism provided $581,943 in federal stimulus money to Better Place.
With the announcement that United States operations would cease, Better Place is withdrawing from its plans to build battery-swapping stations for a fleet of electric taxis in San Francisco and in San Jose, Calif. In October, the California Energy Commission approved $3 million for the eTaxi project, according to Forbes.
In a statement onBetter Place's Web site, Mr. Cohen, the new chief executive, said the company would focus in the short term on its operations in Israel and Denmark. "At the same time," he said, "we had to make some difficult decisions on actions to be taken elsewhere in the world."

HEADLINE: Earned-Income Ironies

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The disconnect between how the earned income tax credit and unemployment benefits are calculated often means that people who didn't work receive a larger credit than those who did, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
The "earned income tax credit" is, ironically, more likely to be received by unemployed people than by workers who do not spend any time unemployed.
The credit was created years ago to reduce tax burdens on the poor and to "provide a genuine incentive for working;" a household must have some wage and salary income in order to receive the credit. 
However, because the credit is administered on a calendar-year basis and is phased out with calendar-year wages and salaries, it is disproportionately received by people unemployed after a layoff.
As I illustrated in an earlier post, the credit follows a mountain-plateau pattern: an increasing portion for the lowest calendar incomes, a flat portion, a decreasing portion and then a flat portion of zero.
You might think that unemployed people do not receive the credit because they do not have any wage or salary income, but typically people unemployed from layoff do have wages or salary income during the calendar year of their unemployment from their previous job. Their layoff might have occurred after the beginning of the calendar year. Even a layoff occurring in December of the previous year might generate wage and salary income in the current year because of a severance payment or accumulated sick and vacation pay.
Moreover, an unemployed person might have a spouse with wage and salary income, and the spouse's income counts toward the credit.
Because unemployment compensation is supposed to be reported on the recipient's federal individual income tax return, I was able to further investigate this issue by examining a large sample of individual income tax returns for the years 2000-7 provided by the Internal Revenue Service to the National Bureau of Economic Research and other institutions for research purposes.
In 2007, 97 percent of the 7.6 million returns showing unemployment-compensation income (that is, the taxpayer or spouse was unemployed and receiving benefits some time during the calendar year) also had wage and salary income during the year. That percentage was essentially the same in each of the years 2000-6.
Of the same 7.6 million returns with unemployment income in 2007, one quarter received the earned income tax credit. By comparison, the credit was received by only one-sixth of the returns with wage and salary income but no unemployment income.
Among returns with unemployment income, the average earned income tax credit was $486, compared with $347 among the returns with wages but not unemployment income.
For most of the returns with both unemployment income and the earned income tax credit, the credit would have been even greater if the taxpayer had been employed fewer weeks than he or she actually was. Still more returns with unemployment income but no earned income tax credit would have received the credit if the unemployment had lasted longer.
This situation occurs so often because unemployment benefits are based on a person's weekly work situation while the earned income credit is based on a household's annual wages and salaries, and because weekly unemployment benefits by themselves are usually less than weekly wages and salaries.
The earned income tax credit is thus a good example of how a so-called tax credit can act like a tax from a working person's point of view.

HEADLINE: R.B.S. Fine a Burden for the Bank's Majority Owner, British Taxpayers

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The Royal Bank of Scotland's $612 million settlement with authorities over rate manipulation leaves British taxpayers liable for part of the fine. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The British government is taking aim at an unlikely target in the latest rate-rigging case: the British government.
The $612 million settlement that the Royal Bank of Scotland reached with authorities on Wednesday over rate manipulation will leave British taxpayers liable for part of the fine.
The government still owns a 82 percent stake in the bank, which was bailed out in 2008 during the height of the financial crisis. 
The British government finds itself on the other side of its case as well because the Financial Services Authority, the country's main financial regulator, has been part of the global investigation into the manipulation of benchmark rates like the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.
 The case against the Royal Bank of Scotland has been politically charged after British politicians demanded that bankers' bonuses should be used to pay for the settlement.
"There is a legitimate concern that British taxpayers, who already have bailed out the bank, will be asked to pay for past mistakes at R.B.S.," said Pat McFadden, a British politician who is a member of the opposition party and part of the Parliament's Treasury select committee that oversees the country's finance industry. On Monday, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, also called on the bank to use bonuses to pay the Libor fine.
To help pay for the global settlement, the British bank said it would claw back past and present bonuses totaling $471 million from both the traders implicated in the rate-rigging scandal as well as from employees in the bank's operations, particularly its investment banking unit, which have not been part of the wrongdoing.
Bank officials said the clawbacks were related to the reputational damage caused to the bank, and would also cover potential future legal liabilities. But that money will be used primarily to pay the fines levied against the bank by the United States authorities.
The Financial Services Authority's share of the fine is expected not to come from the bonuses. The money will, in a sense, be recycled since it will go to the British government's coffers.
One of the casualties of the Libor scandal was John Hourican, head of the firm's investment banking division, who resigned on Wednesday. He will forgo past and present compensation worth a combined $14.1 million. Mr. Hourican, who took over the investment banking unit in 2008 and has not been implicated in the wrongdoing, will receive a one-time payout from the bank of around $1 million.
"This has been a soap opera for the last four years because of the ups and downs of this job," the bank's chairman, Philip Hampton, told reporters on Wednesday. "The bank was in a hell of a mess."
The taxpayer stake in the bank sets the latest deal apart from the other two big Libor settlements. Last summer, the British bank Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to settle accusations that it reported false rates. In December, the Swiss giant UBS struck a sweeping $1.5 billion deal with authorities in which its Japanese subsidiary pleaded guilty to felony wire fraud.
But despite the vested interest of taxpayers, the Financial Services Authority did not take the government's ownership stake into consideration when reaching the settlement, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The renewed scrutiny on the bank, however, could hinder the government's ability to sell its stake for a profit, as private investors remain wary of the bank's future liabilities. Since the bailout in 2008, the bank's shares have plummeted, and are currently trading around 32 percent below the initial purchase price.
As part of plans to sell the government's stake in the bank, Vince Cable, the British business secretary, said Royal Bank of Scotland should have been fully nationalized when it was bailed out in 2008. In a speech on Wednesday, he added that one option could be to return shares in the bank to British taxpayers.
"The early hope of reprivatization now looks a very long way off, unless at an unacceptable loss," Mr. Cable said.
Government officials have held preliminary discussions with a number of investors about selling stakes in the Royal Bank of Scotland, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The potential losses facing British taxpayers contrast with the $182 billion bailout of the American International Group in 2008. Over the last two years, A.I.G. issued a series of stock offerings to reduce the United States government's ownership, generating profit of around $22 billion for American taxpayers.

HEADLINE: Time to Revive the Financial Transaction Tax

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: A financial transactions tax would take a 3-cent nip out of every $100 traded, and raise billions. The burden of proof is on opponents to explain how so slender a tax could harm the capital markets. 

 BODY:
The unwritten rule of Washington debates about taxing and spending is to never consider anything new. But wouldn't it be wonderful if the pressure of the next few months' debate changed that?
Last month, 11 European countries, including France and Germany, moved forward on introducing a minuscule taxon trades in stocks, bonds and derivatives. The tax goes by many names. It's often called a Tobin tax, after the economist James Tobin. In Europe it goes by the more pedestrian financial transaction tax. In Britain, it goes by the wonderful Robin Hood tax, and is supported in an often clever campaign.
On this side of the Atlantic, there is a ghostly silence on a transaction tax in respectable political quarters. But that might change. This month, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, and Representative Peter DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon, plan to reintroduce their bill calling for just such a tax. 
A transaction tax could raise a huge amount of money and cause less pain than many alternatives. It could offset the need for cuts to the social safety net or tax increases that damage consumer demand. How huge a sum? Mr. Harkin and Mr. DeFazio got an estimate from the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which scores tax plans. It's a hearty one: $352 billion over 10 years.
The money would come from a tiny levy. The bill calls for a three-basis-point charge on most trades. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. So it amounts to 3 cents on every $100 traded.
And the bill contains some exemptions intended to make the tax more politically palatable. The first sales of stocks (initial public offerings) and bonds are exempted, so that the markets' capital-raising function isn't harmed. Initial investments and withdrawals from tax-protected accounts, like retirement or education funds, also have a measure of protection.
Critics of such a tax cavil that it will harm our capital markets and won't raise that much money. They argue that such a tax cannot be enforced; that it will depress trading, leading to lower asset prices; and that it will ultimately be passed on to retail investors.
These are anemic arguments, and are completely destroyed in anexcellent piece of myth-busting by a group in Britain called Stamp Out Poverty.
Lots of taxes are hard to collect, but this doesn't seem like one of them. Sales taxes have decent compliance, and they are often collected by small businesses conducting commerce in cash. Trading, on the other hand, is conducted by large businesses on computers. This tax would be collected by the exchanges. If there's no exchange involved, the buyer owes it. It would be paid on any trade carried out in the United States or by any American entity or individual (a corporation's offshore subsidiaries can't get around it).
If there is truly a concern, then the tax could be modified so that if it hadn't been paid, neither the transaction nor any legal action arising from it would be enforceable in the United States judicial system. Voilà! Plenty of compliance.
But those who argue against the tax are blind to a sea change in the way society sees the financial sector. They should be asked to make an affirmative case for more frenzied capital markets activity, rather than just assume that tamping it down is malign.
Yes, trading costs have come down and trading has skyrocketed in the last decade and a half. What have we gotten for it? Bubbles, crashes, volatile asset prices and an outsize financial sector that extracts rents from the rest of the economy. Rising volumes and tighter spreads haven't delivered good economic growth, broad-based wage growth or good jobs.
Nor have they even helped the stock market. Where is the boom in newly public companies? The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is only just now getting back to its peak before the financial crisis. The Nasdaq isn't close to the peak achieved in the year 2000. Stock market valuations are depressed.
So let trading costs rise again, if the Tobin tax would really lead to that. (Other factors, like brutal competition, might still keep them just as low.) Much of the trading that occurs in the market is socially useless. It might narrow slightly the spread between the prices at which securities and derivatives are bought and sold, but the minute there's a crisis, the traders flee. They provide the kind of liquidity that is available only when it is not needed.
The average American, who has limited exposure to the stock market, has little to fear from the tax and much to gain. And if some of the high-frequency trading flees offshore? Good riddance.
Alternatively, let's suppose that a transaction tax succeeds beyond expectations in bringing down excessive trading and doesn't raise as much as projected. Fine. The American capital markets will become less volatile and more connected to fundamentals. Pension fund and mutual fund managers will have an incentive to hold stocks longer and adjust their investing expectations. There is a scourge of short-term thinking in American business; a transaction tax leans against this malign influence.
But what if the tide of technology and investor attention-deficit disorder continues apace, and trading does not decline as much as the securities industry and its paid academic shills claim? That's fine, too. We'll take the revenue.
The politics of a transaction tax are fascinating. Mr. Harkin doesn't have the juice to get it done on his own, several Senate staff members and Washington observers explained to me. The transaction tax would need to be embraced by some senators on the relevant committees, like finance or banking. The Senate Finance Committee is a problem because Charles Schumer of New York, the heavyweight Democrat who serves on it, often acts as if his main constituency is Wall Street.
There have been hints of a possible anti-Wall Street/Big Bank coalition between Midwestern and Western Democrats and Republicans. The Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown and the Louisiana Republican David Vitter don't agree on much, but they co-sponsored a bill calling for more bank capital. Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican famous for skewering vested interests, serves on the Senate Finance Committee. Of course, Republicans have taken blood oaths never to support higher revenue.
If some kind of increase in taxes is inevitable, one that takes aim at high-frequency traders probably hits few Iowans and average Americans in general, while doing much good.

HEADLINE: A Capitalist Case for Emancipation

BYLINE: SUSAN SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: For one businessman, slavery had to end not because it was immoral - but because it was inefficient. 

 BODY:
Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation was met with both roars of approval and curses of outrage. Many of the most vocal supporters spoke in moral and political terms, arguing that slavery was either a sin or an abuse of intrinsic human freedom. But a third case was made too, one often overlooked today: slavery had to end because it violated the laws of the free market.
The leading voice of this economic case for emancipation was Edward Atkinson, an agent and treasurer for several Northeastern cotton mills who knew more than anyone else about the financial and manufacturing aspects of the industry. He was an early member of the Free Soil Party, and soon after joined the newborn Republican Party in its quest to halt the expansion of slavery into the West. In 1859 he raised money to support John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, and just after the war began he joined the Boston Emancipation League. When it appeared that Britain and France might recognize the Confederacy, he was among the first to urgently advocate the destruction of slavery as the most direct way to end the rebellion before they did. 
But Atkinson's hatred of slavery was animated less by moral certainty or political conviction than by his ardent faith in free trade. In this respect he was at odds with many of his New England colleagues, most of whom believed that cotton profits depended upon slavery. Atkinson believed that cotton could be cultivated by whites and free blacks "with perfect ease and safety." The fact that he had to make the case so forcefully should remind us that for many Americans, a South without slavery was simply unthinkable. 
Horace Greeley, the pro-Republican editor of The New York Tribune, liberally quoted Atkinson's works to refute Southern claims that cotton profits demanded the continued protection of slavery. But rather than make a moral case - like so many abolitionists had for decades - Atkinson pointed to the question of efficiency. Thus when Lincoln announced the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation in the fall of 1862, Atkinson leapt at the opportunity to persuade his colleagues to embrace Lincoln's plan as the first step toward a radically different future for the American South. Such arguments were not new, of course. But part of what made Atkinson's case against slavery unique was his innovative use of cartography to showcase the inefficiency of slave labor.

Cotton Kingdom (PDF)

Cotton Kingdom (Text)
Such layered "thematic" maps were still somewhat rare in 1860, though they spread rapidly in subsequent decades. Two years earlier, Frederick Law Olmsted had designed a pathbreaking map of cotton cultivation, but Atkinson's was an even more ambitious attempt to integrate several classes of information in a single image. The dark lines on the map encompass the principal cotton-growing regions of 1860, while the dotted line to the north marked the outer limits of cotton cultivation. Atkinson then added a line to mark the mean summer temperature, his method of showing that-according to the laws of nature-a far greater area could potentially be devoted to cotton. (He did not, however, acknowledge the very real limitations of soil composition.) 
Oddly enough, Atkinson's attempt to show that cotton could expand evoked the great fear sparked by the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. As Lincoln put it in his speech at Peoria, Ill., "a glance at the map" showed climate was no barrier to plantation agriculture. For Atkinson, the westward growth of cotton - cultivated without slavery - was a welcome sign of prosperity.
Perhaps most powerful was Atkinson's attempt to measure the inefficiency of slavery through the 1860 Census. The shaded squares on the map represent annual production of cotton in each state relative to its size. By Atkinson's measure, less than 13 percent of the land in the six principal cotton states had even been cultivated, a shocking statistic for a nation taught to fear the economic and political power of slaveholders. Rather than being the country's agricultural powerhouse, "king" cotton actually constituted just 2 percent of the total acreage of those states. These figures paled in comparison to the amount of land devoted to agricultural production in the Northeast and the Midwest. 
This was an utter violation of capitalism, Atkinson argued. Not only had slave labor hampered Southern agriculture, but it had driven away countless potential immigrants. Northern cotton manufacturers had not just the right, but the obligation to demand the introduction of free labor. He proudly noted that free white labor in Tennessee and Texas already produced nearly one-ninth of the region's cotton output. He even attempted to implement his ideas in late 1863 by supporting the cultivation of cotton with free black labor behind Union lines.
Atkinson's description of the "disturbing" concentration of the black population in the cotton states - and his assumption that whites were more industrious - indicates a racial prejudice that was entirely typical of the era. But by framing his arguments in economic terms, he hoped to appeal to those Northerners who remained unmoved by the moral and political arguments for abolition. This broadened support for emancipation might in turn pressure Lincoln to extend the proclamation beyond its wartime limits. 
Atkinson's use of this data was surely controversial and selective, but his ideas circulated widely and drew strong approval. When the map was reprinted in Benson Lossing's popular late 19th-century history of the war, many young Americans learned to skewer the antebellum logic of the "cotton kingdom." And his map reminds us that the concept of free labor - so assumed today - demanded a wholesale reimagination of the American South.

HEADLINE: Justice(s) at Work

BYLINE: LINDA GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: A little-noticed Supreme Court decision last summer raises concerns about the future of labor law in the hands of an anti-union conservative majority. 

 BODY:
 This column is prompted by the eye-catching headline that appeared two weeks ago: "Share of the Work Force in a Union Falls to a 97-Year Low, 11.3%." As the article explained, many factors - global, domestic, economic, political - have contributed to the steep decline in the unionized work force, in both the private and public sectors. The trend, while accelerating, isn't new. And on the surface, certainly, it has little to do with the Supreme Court. 
But the story led me to think back to a decision the court issued last June 21. In the breathless run-up to the health-care decision, which came a week later, Knox v. Service Employees International Union didn't get a great deal of attention. It should have, not so much for what the court actually decided but for what the decision portends for the future of labor law in the hands of an anti-union conservative majority, as well as for the majority's plan of attack on precedents it finds inconvenient or disagreeable.

The issue in the Knox case seemed narrow, even arcane: whether a public employee union in California had properly handled a temporary dues increase intended to build a war chest to fight anti-union propositions on the state's 2005 ballot. The specific question was whether employees who were not union members, but who under typical "agency shop" rules paid a fee to support the collective-bargaining work that the union undertook on behalf of all employees, had received an adequate opportunity to object to paying the special dues assessment.
Seven justices - all except Stephen G. Breyer and Elena Kagan - agreed that the union's procedure was inadequate, an outcome of relatively little moment because the union had already returned the money to the objectors and had, in fact, argued that the case was thus moot. But Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for a five-member majority that included Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas, went beyond the confines of the case to suggest strongly that the decades-old accommodation between union members and non-members in public workplaces violates the First Amendment rights of the non-members.
To avoid the problem of "free riders," agency-shop provisions require that those who object to joining the union nonetheless pay a fee that represents the portion of union dues that goes to the collective bargaining activities from which all employees benefit. The non-members, at their request, are entitled to be excused from contributing to the union's political activities. Since the non-members must affirmatively exercise this "opt-out" option, this system tends to favor the union; as students of default rules well understand, inertia inevitably keeps some people from bothering to assert their rights.
The opt-out system "represents a remarkable boon for unions," Justice Alito wrote in his majority opinion characterizing the arrangement as one the court had endorsed haphazardly and without adequate thought. He went on to challenge the basic agency-shop structure, calling it "an anomaly." Compelling nonmembers to pay any portion of their dues to a union with which they don't care to be associated is a substantial impingement on the First Amendment right to be free from compelled speech and association, Justice Alito said, adding: "Our cases to date have tolerated this impingement and we do not revisit today whether the court's former cases have given adequate recognition to the critical First Amendment rights at stake."
In case he hadn't made it sufficiently clear that 60 years of Supreme Court precedents are now hanging by a thread, Justice Alito continued: "Our prior decisions approach, if they do not cross, the limit of what the First Amendment can tolerate." As for the special dues assessment at issue in the case, he concluded, the opt-out system was constitutionally insufficient, and the objecting employees were free of any obligation unless they chose to opt in.
I'm not arguing that the Knox opinion alone is a game-changer for public sector employment. It is irrelevant in nearly half of the states, where "right to work" laws mean that no one can be required to support union activity. And the decision is only the latest in years of Supreme Court losses for organized labor on central questions of collective bargaining, decisions that have "seriously circumscribed the capacity of a post-industrial work force to engage in effective group action," as Professor James J. Brudney, a labor law expert at Fordham Law School, put it in a recent conversation.
Nonetheless, this largely overlooked case is notable for a few reasons. I've written several times recently about the current majority's aggressive use of the First Amendment in the service of a conservative agenda. While solicitude for the rights of nonunion public employees certainly predates the Roberts court, the Knox majority's attack on the long-settled default rule for union objectors underscores how profoundly the free-speech polarity is shifting rightward.
(In December, the federal appeals court in Manhattan invoked the First Amendment to rule that the government couldn't prosecute a pharmaceutical sales representative for promoting to doctors the "off-label" unapproved use of a prescription drug; such marketing activity, long prohibited by the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, is a matter of free speech, the court ruled in United States v. Caronia. Faced with the prospect that the Supreme Court would affirm the ruling, the Obama administration decided last month not to appeal it.)
Further, the Knox decision highlights a disparity between unions and corporations that is highly relevant to the post-Citizens United world of corporate money in politics. The Citizens United decision appears to treat unions and corporations equally, giving both the First Amendment right to spend unlimited amounts of money. But as Professor Benjamin Sachs of Harvard Law School has pointed out, nonunion employees can withhold any money that would go to political activity, thus greatly shrinking the pool of money available, while a corporation's shareholders who object to the company's political spending have no equivalent way of dissenting.
Finally, there's the matter of the Knox majority's flagrant activism. In his opinion, Justice Alito denied going beyond the confines of the question the parties brought to the court, but Justice Sonia Sotomayor shredded his defensive assertion in a separate opinion. Joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor said the case, as presented, provided no occasion for the majority's attack on the opt-out rule, let alone its expressions of skepticism about the constitutionality of the agency shop. Noting that the words "opt in" didn't even appear in the objecting employees' brief, Justice Sotomayor said: "To cast serious doubt on longstanding precedent is a step we historically take only with the greatest caution and reticence. To do so, as the majority does, on our own invitation and without adversarial presentation is both unfair and unwise."
Justice Breyer, joined in his dissenting opinion by Justice Kagan, noted that "the debate about public unions' collective-bargaining rights is currently intense." He added, "There is no good reason for the court suddenly to enter the debate, much less now to decide that the Constitution resolves it."

HEADLINE: E-Mails Imply JPMorgan Knew Some Mortgage Deals Were Bad

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: E-mails and employee interviews filed as part of a lawsuit show that JPMorgan Chase flouted quality controls as it bundled mortgages into complex financial instruments. 

 BODY:
When an outside analysis uncovered serious flaws with thousands of home loans, JPMorgan Chase executives found an easy fix.
Rather than disclosing the full extent of problems like fraudulent home appraisals and overextended borrowers, the bank adjusted the critical reviews, according to documents filed early Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan. As a result, the mortgages, which JPMorgan bundled into complex securities, appeared healthier, making the deals more appealing to investors.
The trove of internal e-mails and employee interviews, filed as part of a lawsuit by one of the investors in the securities, offers a fresh glimpse into Wall Street's mortgage machine, which churned out billions of dollars of securities that later imploded. The documents reveal that JPMorgan, as well as two firms the bank acquired during the credit crisis, Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns, flouted quality controls and ignored problems, sometimes hiding them entirely, in a quest for profit. 
The lawsuit, which was filed by Dexia, a Belgian-French bank, is being closely watched on Wall Street. After suffering significant losses, Dexia sued JPMorgan and its affiliates in 2012, claiming it had been duped into buying $1.6 billion of troubled mortgage-backed securities. The latest documents could provide a window into a $200 billion case that looms over the entire industry. In that lawsuit, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has accused 17 banks of selling dubious mortgage securities to the two housing giants. At least 20 of the securities are also highlighted in the Dexia case, according to an analysis of court records.
In court filings, JPMorgan has strongly denied wrongdoing and is contesting both cases in federal court. The bank declined to comment.
Dexia's lawsuit is part of a broad assault on Wall Street for its role in the 2008 financial crisis, as prosecutors, regulators and private investors take aim at mortgage-related securities. New York's attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, sued JPMorgan last year over investments created by Bear Stearns between 2005 and 2007.
Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, has criticized prosecutors for attacking JPMorgan because of what Bear Stearns did. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in October, Mr. Dimon said the bank did the federal government "a favor" by rescuing the flailing firm in 2008.
The legal onslaught has been costly. In November, JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, agreed to pay $296.9 million to settle claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission that Bear Stearns had misled mortgage investors by hiding some delinquent loans. JPMorgan did not admit or deny wrongdoing.
"The true price tag for the ongoing costs of the litigation is terrifying," said Christopher Whalen, managing director at Carrington Investment Services. 
The Dexia lawsuit centers on complex securities created by JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual during the housing boom. As profits soared, the Wall Street firms scrambled to pump out more investments, even as questions emerged about their quality.
With a seemingly insatiable appetite, JPMorgan scooped up mortgages from lenders with troubled records, according to the court documents. In an internal "due diligence scorecard," JPMorgan ranked large mortgage originators, assigning Washington Mutual and American Home Mortgage the lowest grade of "poor" for their documentation, the court filings show.
The loans were quickly sold to investors. Describing the investment assembly line, an executive at Bear Stearns told employees "we are a moving company not a storage company," according to the court documents.
As they raced to produce mortgage-backed securities, Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns also scaled back their quality controls, the documents indicate.
In an initiative called Project Scarlett, Washington Mutual slashed its due diligence staff by 25 percent as part of an effort to bolster profit. Such steps "tore the heart out" of quality controls, according to a November 2007 e-mail from a Washington Mutual executive. Executives who pushed back endured "harassment" when they tried to "keep our discipline and controls in place," the e-mail said.
Even when flaws were flagged, JPMorgan and the other firms sometimes overlooked the warnings.
JPMorgan routinely hired Clayton Holdings and other third-party firms to examine home loans before they were packed into investments. Combing through the mortgages, the firms searched for problems like borrowers who had vastly overstated their incomes or appraisals that inflated property values.
According to the court documents, an analysis for JPMorgan in September 2006 found that "nearly half of the sample pool" - or 214 loans - were "defective," meaning they did not meet the underwriting standards. The borrowers' incomes, the firms found, were dangerously low relative to the size of their mortgages. Another troubling report in 2006 discovered that thousands of borrowers had already fallen behind on their payments.
But JPMorgan at times dismissed the critical assessments or altered them, the documents show. Certain JPMorgan employees, including the bankers who assembled the mortgages and the due diligence managers, had the power to ignore or veto bad reviews.
In some instances, JPMorgan executives reduced the number of loans considered delinquent, the documents show. In others, the executives altered the assessments so that a smaller number of loans were considered "defective."
In a 2007 e-mail, titled "Banking overrides," a JPMorgan due diligence manager asks a banker: "How do you want to handle these loans?" At times, they whitewashed the findings, the documents indicate. In 2006, for example, a review of mortgages found that at least 1,154 loans were more than 30 days delinquent. The offering documents sent to investors showed only 25 loans as delinquent.
A person familiar with the bank's portfolios said JPMorgan had reviewed the loans separately and determined that the number of delinquent loans was far less than the outside analysis had found.
At Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, employees also had the power to sanitize bad assessments. Employees at Bear Stearns were told that they were responsible for "purging all of the older reports" that showed flaws, "leaving only the final reports," according to the court documents.
Such actions were designed to bolster profit. In a deposition, a Washington Mutual employee said revealing loan defects would undermine the lucrative business, and that the bank would suffer "a couple-point hit in price."
Ratings agencies also did not necessarily get a complete picture of the investments, according to the court filings. An assessment of the loans in one security revealed that 24 percent of the sample was "materially defective," the filings show. After exercising override power, a JPMorgan employee sent a report in May 2006 to a ratings agency that showed only 5.3 percent of the mortgages were defective.
Such investments eventually collapsed, spreading losses across the financial system.
Dexia, which has been bailed out twice since the financial crisis, lost $774 million on mortgage-backed securities, according to court records.
Mr. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said that overall losses from flawed mortgage-backed securities from 2005 and 2007 were $22.5 billion.
In a statement shortly after he sued JPMorgan Chase, Mr. Schneiderman said the lawsuit was a template "for future actions against issuers of residential mortgage-backed securities that defrauded investors and cost millions of Americans their homes." 
An earlier version of this article included outdated information on the business affiliation of Christopher Whalen. He is managing director at Carrington Investment Services; he is no longer with Tangent Capital Partners.

HEADLINE: Documents in S.& P. Case Show Alarm

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Documents in a lawsuit against Standard &#038; Poor's provide a glimpse at the company's inner working in the run-up to the financial crisis. | Royal Bank of Scotland poised to settle accusations that it manipulated Libor. | Debevoise &#038; Plimpton is eliminating its trusts and estates practice. | The fate of Hostess Brands shows how corporate machinations can both doom and save a company. 

 BODY:
Documents included in the Justice Department's lawsuit against Standard & Poor's provide a glimpse at the company's inner working in the run-up to the financial crisis. "Tensions appeared to be escalating inside the firm's headquarters in Lower Manhattan as it publicly professed that its ratings were valid, even as the home loans bundled into mortgage-backed securities, or M.B.S., were failing at accelerating rates," Mary Williams Walsh and Ron Nixon write in DealBook. "Together, the documents show a portrait of some executives pushing to water down the firm's rating models in the hope of preserving market share and profits, while others expressed deep concerns about the poor performance of the securities and what they saw as a lowering of standards."
Some of the documents also showed some of the snarkiness among the rank-and-file over the impending crisis. One analyst in March 2007 borrowed from the Talking Heads, creating new lyrics to "Burning Down the House," according to the complaint: "Subprime is boi-ling o-ver. Bringing down the house." In a confidential memo reproduced in the complaint, one executive said: "This market is a wildly spinning top which is going to end badly." 
 At the heart of the civil case are the computer models S.& P. used to rate complex mortgage securities. The Justice Department claims that the faulty projections were not simply naïveté, but rather a deliberate effort to produce inflated, fraudulent ratings. "The complaint asserts that S.& P. staff chose not to update computer programs because the changes would have led to harsher ratings, and a potential loss of business," Peter Eavis writes. But S.& P., which says the lawsuit is without merit, disagrees with the government's characterization of the models. Catherine J. Mathis, an S.& P. spokeswoman, said the Justice Department had not "shown actual adjustment to the models or other changes that were not analytically justified."
Indeed, the government faces an uphill battle in making its case that S.& P. intentionally inflated ratings. "The government will have to prove that ratings were in fact faulty, and published intentionally so as to deceive investors in the securities. In response, S.& P. could simply argue that the company was just as blinded by the financial crisis as anyone else, and that questionable e-mails are simply the work of lower-level employees who were not involved in the decision-making," Peter J. Henning and Steven M. Davidoff write. "Even if the Justice Department can prove the agency acted to deceive investors, it still has to deal with something lawyers call reliance. In other words, did investors rely on these ratings to make their decisions?"
R.B.S. APPROACHES SETTLEMENT OVER RATE-RIGGING | The Royal Bank of Scotland said on Wednesday that it was in advanced discussions with authorities on both side of the Atlantic over settling accusations that it manipulated Libor. "Although the settlements remain to be agreed, R.B.S. expects they will include the payment of significant penalties as well as certain other sanctions," the bank said.
A settlement, which could be announced as soon as Wednesday, is expected to include a penalty of about £400 million ($626 million), according to several news reports. "As part of the anticipated deal, R.B.S.'s Japanese unit is expected to plead guilty to a crime in the U.S., although the Justice Department isn't expected to charge any individuals, according to one of the people briefed on the talks," The Wall Street Journal writes. John Hourican, the head of R.B.S.'s investment bank, is also expected to resign, the reports said. 
DEBEVOISE DROPS TRUSTS AND ESTATES PRACTICE | Debevoise & Plimpton, the prominent white-shoe law firm, is eliminating its trusts and estates practice, DealBook's Peter Lattman reports. Michael W. Blair, Debevoise's presiding partner, said in a statement that the firm was helping the group's eight lawyers - including Jonathan J. Rikoon, the partner in charge of the practice - find new posts.
Lawyers exchanged whispers about the news at a conference in Florida last month, Mr. Lattman writes. "Debevoise's decision surprised members of the trusts and estates bar. If an institution as prestigious and financially sound as Debevoise was abandoning its practice, were they vulnerable too?" Mr. Lattman continues: "Corporate law firms once viewed trusts and estates as a small yet important practice that discreetly advised wealthy families. But drafting wills and trusts, and the legal matters that flow from that, is less lucrative than the primary revenue drivers at big law firms: multibillion-dollar corporate transactions and high-stakes litigation."

RESCUING THE TWINKIE | The demise of Hostess Brands, the maker of Twinkies and other treats, "came at the hands of corporate America's machinations," Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. "Its survival, however, depends on some of those same machinations. In the end, it was the extreme outcome of a liquidation in bankruptcy that made the 83-year-old brand salvageable."
"All told, it appears that the sale of Hostess may reap over a billion dollars, almost twice what the creditors initially expected if it had not been liquidated. In other words, the liquidation of Hostess has made the company worth more."
ZYNGA AT A CROSSROADS | Zynga released fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday that were better than expected but still showed the significant challenges the company faces, after losing much of its market value since its I.P.O. "In the next few months, Zynga faces a critical test," David Streitfeld writes in The New York Times. "Can it successfully put its most popular Web games, starting with Farmville, on mobile devices?" To Mark Pincus, Zynga's founder and chief executive, 2013 is "a year of investment and transition." Mr. Streitfeld says: "The pain accompanying Zynga's transition to mobile was evident in the earnings report. Revenue was $311 million, flat with the year before. Daily users of the games were down 6 percent from the third quarter, a clear measure of flagging interest. More casual users dropped as well."

HEADLINE: The Phantom Province in China's Economy

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: China's economy wows the world, but at home, over-reporting of local G.D.P. figures has produced an entire "phantom province," Chinese media say. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - China has a "phantom province" pumping out nearly 5.8 trillion renminbi (about $930 billion) in gross domestic product last year, about equivalent to the output of its richest province, Guangdong, Chinese media reported this week.
How so? 
Deliberately inflated figures from local officials are largely to blame, domestic media reported, as officials seek promotion for delivering the high growth demanded by the state. And the problem of systemic exaggeration in the economy is growing, not shrinking, as the country becomes richer and is increasingly integrated into the global economy.
The world is accustomed to remarkable growth from China, which is now the world's second-largest economy after zooming up the list to overtake Germany and Japan, and is projected by some to challenge the economic dominance of the United States. And other nations have grown accustomed to looking to China to drive global growth with those high numbers. As Yi Gang, the deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, "I think China's growth rate will be about 8 percent this year."
Yet back home, officials are faced with figures that can be off the mark by millions, billions or trillions of renminbi, meaning no one is entirely sure what's going on. (The government in Beijing has its own way of dealing with the problem: The incoming prime minister, Li Keqiang, once reportedly said financial data in China was "man-made" and he relied instead on three indicators: electricity consumption, rail cargo and bank loans.)
This week, Chinese media reported widely on China's "phantom province," the G.D.P. excess that resulted when the economic growth figures from 31 provinces, municipalities and regions were added up and compared to the different, national G.D.P. figure that the government uses. In 2012, the discrepancy reached a remarkable 5.76 trillion renminbi, its biggest ever and the equivalent of the output of Guangdong province, itself an economic powerhouse, the media said.
For 2012, the national G.D.P. figure is estimated to be nearly 52 trillion renminbi (about $8.3 trillion,) while the provincial total was nearly 58 trillion (about $9.3 trillion.)
"Media exposes total G.D.P. of all provinces exceeds national G.D.P. by over 5 trillion renminbi," (the exact figure was 5.76 trillion,) a headline announced in the 21CN News.
The gap is getting bigger, fast: in 2009, total provincial G.D.P. was nearly 2.7 trillion more than national G.D.P.; in 2010 it was more than 3 trillion; in 2011 it was 4.6 trillion, the Beijing News reported.
In a chain of exaggeration that begins at the village or county level, the figures pile up until they overreach any possible national total, the articles indicate.
The cause of the problem? "G.D.P. 'achievement,'" said an article in the China Youth Daily, which is run by the Communist Party's Youth League, referring to the system whereby officials are promoted for achieving high growth rates so they deliberately exaggerate.
The government has tried to stop the mendacity by launching investigations and threatening to punish offenders, but the problem is stubborn, the article said.
The solution?
"Only painful and determined reforms can change the achievement-based evaluation system," the article said, including: sustained checking of officials' reporting, increasing the rights of ordinary people to evaluate officials, taking away local officials' sole responsibility for G.D.P. growth, the environment, public services, people's prosperity and sustainable development.

HEADLINE: Political Intelligence

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins on a few suspicious signs that we might actually be headed in the right direction. 

 BODY:
 David Brooks: Gail, let me start out with a troubling issue before I get to a bunch of encouraging ones. How would you vote on the Chuck Hagel nomination for secretary of defense? I would probably still vote yes, but only because I think a president should be given enormous deference to fill out his team.
 Gail Collins: If I was a Republican senator, I would vote no just because voting no always works. You can never get into trouble for voting no.
 David: I have doubts, after that hearing, about whether Hagel can now be an effective secretary of defense. I don't think the White House is going to want to send him out on the Sunday shows or to various global forums to represent U.S. policy. I'm not sure Senators of either party will defer to him or fear him when it comes to making choices about where to spend or where not to spend. I'm not sure the military will treat him with genuine fear and respect, beyond what is required by their code. 
 Gail: David, if our bottom line is that in this age, a secretary of defense has to be good at spin, then you're right that the Hagelian future does not look bright. He's lucky that some of the Republican senators were so unnecessarily nasty in that committee hearing. If they had managed to look wise and concerned instead of partisan and hectoring, he'd probably have been cooked.
 David: I say that glumly, genuinely liking Hagel. But leadership involves a certain performance element and it involves a certain demonstrated ability to master a brief. Hagel didn't pass those tests. If I were him I'd call up the president and ask if he was still confident he'd made the right nomination. If Hagel doesn't have Obama's full confidence, then he won't be successful, and then what's the point of taking the job?
 Gail: Cannot argue with that last point. But you know that when presidents really want somebody to go away, they have ways of making that happen.
Obama picked Hagel because he wanted a secretary of defense who thinks the way he does about what military preparedness will mean in the future: drone-prone with a real aversion to putting boots on the ground. Hagel seems to have been successful in his one-on-one encounters with the senators. If he can work successfully on the inside, there are plenty of glib people around who can do the rounds of the talk shows. We'll just call him the quiet secretary.
 David: That issue aside, a lot of positive things are happening in Washington. I'm moderately encouraged about the prospects of us getting an immigration bill this year. The Republican leaders seem to be drifting toward a sensible position, at least judging by Eric Cantor's speech this week. The president is doing a good job raising the profile of the issue without trying to dictate terms. Various effective legislators, like Schumer, Rubio and McCain, are involved. It's all coming together.
 Gail: Yeah. So far.
 David: There are two main dangers, it seems to me. The first is the supposedly moderate position that Republicans are now striking. This involves giving current illegal immigrants a legal status in this country without giving them a path to full citizenship. This idea sounds like something Peter Skerry proposed in National Affairs. Personally, I would be very wary about creating a class of lifelong American citizens who are not citizens and have no way to become citizens. We do not want to regularize a class of legal helots.
 Gail: I'll bet most of the Republicans would agree with you in a heartbeat, if they could just find some way out of that anti-amnesty wall they've built. They're trapped because the approach they've railed against for their last several campaigns is actually the right approach. They just can't admit it.
The Democrats will never agree to limit reform to a path to legal non-citizenship. And if the Republicans kill the bill over it, they'll be stuck with the consequences in future elections.
 David: The other main danger is that the whole debate will be sidetracked by some second-order issue. The main reason to do immigration is to improve the country's ability to lure the best global talent - both high- and low-skill. A lot of people in Washington don't see it that way. They are worrying about how many links should be in the Mexican fence, what border security measure will trigger what, how various gay partnership issues will be resolved.
This is a complete inability to distinguish side issues from the main one.
 Gail: Border security is a red herring. If Obama was a Republican, the party would be cheering over the way he'd expanded the patrols, and drones, as well as the ratcheted-up deportation of lawbreakers over the last four years.
As to side issues like gay partnership, I guess it depends on who you are. The Violence Against Women Act is hung up on the question of who should prosecute men accused of domestic violence on Indian reservations. It might sound like a minor matter - unless you happen to be an American Indian woman living on a reservation.
 David: I'm also moderately encouraged about the Republican Party. Republican donors are rallying to prevent future Todd Akins. Every day another party leader gives a speech trying to sound sensible. The Tea Party isn't dead the way Occupy is, but it's not self-confident either. I wrote one of my usual pieces on the need for a more moderate party that can win on the coasts and of course there was criticism, but there was also a much more respectful hearing on conservative talk radio than I'm used to getting.
Change is slow, and it will not be led by our elected leaders in Washington. But there are good signs.
 Gail: I could be negative and point to the new emerging craziness that is Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Or the Iowa boomlet for the ultra-loopy Representative Steve King for Senate. But I'd rather follow your positive wave and praise you for being one of the most helpful and influential voices for moderation.
 David: Finally, President Obama is visiting the Middle East. This will be his chance to see firsthand the current state of Israeli politics, which is hopeless prosperity. Every Israeli knows that all the political trends are pointing in a bad direction and there is no visible way to escape them. Peace is further away, the demographics stink. Public opinion is polarizing. And yet the economy booms and life gets sweeter. How long can a society live in hopeless prosperity? I'm guessing a century or so.
 Gail: I was very, very modestly encouraged by the good showing of the new centrist Yesh Atid party in the recent elections. Their success suggests that there might be a future majority of Israelis who don't feel they're getting their share of that sweet life and who are tired of wasting tax money subsidizing the religious right and the West Bank settlement expansion.
I know that's a stretch, but it's at least a thought. And we've gotten through a whole conversation without hitting a single stone wall of implacable political stupidity. Do you think it'll last? It'd be great for the country, but then we'll have nothing to write about.

HEADLINE: Interview With Gen. John R. Allen on Leaving Afghanistan

BYLINE: MATTHEW ROSENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: The New York Times interviewed Gen. John. R. Allen on Sunday, a week before his scheduled departure from Afghanistan after 19 months as the commander of the American and allied forces. 

 BODY:
The New York Times interviewed Gen. John. R. Allen on Sunday, a week before his scheduled departure from Afghanistan after 19 months as the commander of the American and allied forces. 
 Following are some of General Allen's comments. Brief explanations have been provided in brackets.
 On his relationship with President Hamid Karzai: 
"I wanted him to understand that he was always going to have my loyalty and I was always going to work with him. In fact, I said a number of times, 'I'm proud to have served you at the same time I served my own leadership, whether it's a NATO leadership or U.S. leadership.' Now, I wanted him to believe it because it happened to be true. I think our personalities matched in that regard."
"Now, we've had some tough times. This has been a time of really dramatic change for the campaign. When I got here, I measured success in how well we and how often we were fighting. Today, it's a very different environment. The Afghans are virtually entirely in the lead across Afghanistan." 
"This is what I've learned about the president. If you listen to him, he's got some pretty good ideas, and often the controversy that has arisen in the relationships hasn't been because necessarily you disagree with the ideas. It's because you haven't listened to them early enough."
"And sometimes it's been strained. I don't think he ever believes that actions that I have taken were ever intended to disadvantage him as the president, or not do everything I possibly could for the Afghan people. I told him, I'm prepared to die in this country on behalf of his people. I take that very seriously."
 On civilian casualties: 
"I've met with the families of the casualties that we've inflicted. I've flown to the villages to personally apologize for the casualties, and do what I can to do the right thing for those families. I've taken measures with respect to the employment of certain kinds of fires." ["Fires" is common military shorthand for a variety of munitions, from bullets to missiles to mortar shells.]
"We had a couple of pretty rough incidents where Afghans were killed by the delivery of aviation fires. I eventually said to President Karzai that civilian structures, tents, potential areas where civilians might be either taking refuge or hiding or living, I'm not going to deliver any more fires on those structures unless my troops are pinned down, can't move, and the only option they have is to deliver fires on these structures, or I decide, the senior leader out here, I decide to deliver fires on these structures."
"The civilian causalities as a result of air fires plummeted immediately. It was probably the decision I could have made long before that and none of our forces were put at risk, or a greater risk because of this."
 On the aftermath of the burning of Korans at Bagram Air Base: 
"I have to tell you, I thought this could be it for the relationship.
"I immediately got on the phone to a number of Afghan media outlets, immediately cut a video apologizing for this as sincerely as I could possibly appear and sound because this was going to be bad, it could be really bad. I called the president, I went to see him, apologized to him for this. It was completely inadvertent but this culture deserved that apology. We were in their home, so to speak. We are guests in their home and even though it was an accident, even though it was not intentional, we had made a bad mistake, a real error and the people deserved my apology, the president deserved my apology.
"He accepted it and I think in many respects, the personal nature of our relationship was what tempered the language coming out of the palace, the relief, his own engagement with the media and so on. Because of both of our actions, both of them supporting each other, we were able to keep this from being the result of a bad mistake from being something that could have really fractured the relationship."
 On the fallout in March after an American soldier killed 16 villagers in the southern Afghan district of Panjwai, which he first heard about when he was in the United States to testify before Congress: 
"The first phone call was something of the effect of -- we've got mixed reporting from Panjwai. We think an American soldier maybe shot some people and my response was, 'All right. Let's develop the situation quickly. Tell me what we got in front of us because we've got to make the Afghans were included on this.' "
"Then the phone calls started coming in and the numbers started going up and pretty quick and this is as bad a circumstance as you might have imagined."
"I called President Karzai from home and we had a long conversation about it. I promised him once again that we would take all steps, measures, take all actions necessary to get to the bottom of this and we would do a full and complete investigation and those people necessary would be held accountable."
"This was still unfolding. It was one shooter. It was multiple shooters. There were wild rumors associated with things that he had done in addition to shooting. So the information environment was wide open at this point. And both for the purposes of internal stability in Afghanistan for the purposes of preserving our relationship we were working very, very hard to confirm what we knew to be the facts and try very hard to get after the rumors that were just flying."
"Once again, when he could have been angry, when it could have been a very negative conversation, I mean, he was tutorial. He explained to me why this is bad for the relationship, why this is bad for the campaign, and why this will shake the confidence of the Afghan people, his personal gesture of measured conversation with me. He wasn't angry."
 On why the United States should stay engaged in Afghanistan: 
"I put it in the context of this has been worth it. This is bigger than anyone of us. It's bigger than the president. It's bigger than the president of Afghanistan, because this isn't about today. This is about tomorrow. This is about doing all we can to facilitate President Karzai with his desire to be successful. But it'll be about doing all we can do to set up his successor for success."

On overcoming the skepticism of officials in Washington, who often express frustration with Mr. Karzai: 
"For this president, at this moment of its history, the Afghanistan history, to be able to hold together these tribes and these ethnic groups with these kinds of challenges has got to be one of the hardest jobs going. And so I try to paint the context of the challenges that he faces, the history from which he originates and help conceivably, he will interpret our actions. He may not understand what we are trying to do, or may misinterpret what we're trying to do or say. And frankly, one of the great things about our democracy is also one of the hardest things about our democracy: That is, we don't always speak with the same voice.
"So he'll hear a voice from one part of the government, it will be different for another part of the government and he'll see to square the differences. It's not a criticism, it just is who we are. The farther you are away from Kabul, the farther you are away from the palace, the farther you are away from the history of this country in the complexities of society, the easier it is to generalize, frankly."
 On the need for the Afghan government to better serve its people and stamp out corruption within its ranks: 
"We've worked very hard, obviously, to build a capacity in those. But when your ability to survive the night, or put food on the table was -- well, for many years are functionally, what tribe you were part of, or what group you were part of. And those patronage networks undertook economic opportunities which made them some respect, criminal patronage networks.
"They can only survive because institutions of governance are weak. And so now, we find ourselves in this -- at this very moment when the future of the country relies on the strength of institutions. The criminal patronage networks recognized that their future, their survival can only be sustained by keeping these institutions weak. That's the moment we find ourselves in, and the presidential directive on any corruption and government reform and the Mutual Accountability Framework came out of Tokyo.
"These created very helpful, very useful, both domestic and international expectations for reform. So we need to see how smoothing past the written word and the spoken word and start moving towards action. I think the president, if he were sitting here would tell you that they have achieved some good action, good results in his presidential decree. The Mutual Accountability Framework is constantly being audited to see that there's progress on reform. But again, we're still pretty fresh in the process and we've got to let this play out some more."
 On the future of the war and Afghanistan: 
"Let me make sure I'm clear on this. Nothing is sure in a post-conflict society. But I think the indicators, as far as I'm concerned, are that we're on the right trajectory. What you have to understand, what people have to understand is some of these reforms take a very long time. In an environment where human rights were crashed under multiple different invasions or civil wars or the Taliban, creating once again the kind of bias for human rights that we would all expect in the Western society, just doesn't come easily to this country.
"Nothing will happen in this country without security. And that security is being purchased every single day by the Afghan National Security Forces. And then, on the platform of that security, this president has announced a program or platform that he intends to follow. Now, he's moving forward in some areas, he's having resistance in others, but we just have to expect this is going to take time. That's where huge patience has to come in. That's where the decade of transformation comes in."
 On the surge of "insider attacks" against Westerners that took place in 2012: 
"The losses became to this particular means of attack became very troubling, very significant, and tragic. And while on the tactical level and on the operational level, we were able to deal with the problem. This was becoming a strategic crisis -- a strategic crisis in capitals, a strategic crisis for the alliance -- and the Taliban saw this. They knew this. They saw that. They saw that the future of the A.N.S.F. relied on our being close, partner or adviser inside the Afghan formations.
"We were very careful in our reaction to insider attacks. Not to wall ourselves off from the Afghans and create distance. I used to tell them, you may not be able to do anything about the linear distance that you have to deal with but there's a lot you can do about your proximity and the closer you all feel to each other, the more secure you will be. And that's in an environment where we're transitioning to being advisers almost entirely across Afghanistan. That has to be one of the operative principles for philosophically how we're going to live with the Afghans. You treat them like brothers. You live with them like they're family. That reduces the unknowns, it reduces the potential for cultural affront, and it makes you more secure."
"That doesn't mean we're not going to keep a close eye on the environment. We still have these people called Guardian Angels because there are enemies in the ranks and they're waiting to take that shot."
"We took a lot of measures and the numbers are down. But I don't in any way want anybody to become complacent about the number being down. I don't want anyone to lift up on the security measures that they're taking or reduce the attentiveness that they have to the environment around. So, I want everybody to be attentive and we're going to periodically refresh our training both at the very lowest levels and for the units coming in. So, we're not going to give up on this."

HEADLINE: Leaving Behind Malibu in Search of a New Dream Home

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
ONE of the best-known residents of Malibu, Calif., alongside billionaires like David Geffen and Larry Ellison, is embarking on a national promotional effort to help sell her home there for the eye-popping price of $25 million.
Potential buyers may want to try bargaining down the price when they realize the house has only one bedroom and one bathroom -- and three walls. 
Those clues ought to point to the owner: Barbie, the doll who has, in the imagination of millions of girls, lived on the beach -- in a home formally known as the Barbie Malibu Dreamhouse -- since the introduction of Malibu Barbie in 1971. Mattel, the toy maker that has marketed Barbie since 1959, is to announce on Thursday that Barbie is posting a ''for sale'' sign on her house in preparation for a move.
The announcement will kick off a campaign that is to culminate with a disclosure of Barbie's new home, which will be brought to life in a playset that will come out in the fall, in time for the 2013 Christmas shopping season.
The campaign is meant to mix actual and imaginary elements. For example, a section of Trulia, the real estate Web site, will carry the for-sale listing for what is being called ''the dreamiest of dreamhouses.'' Josh Altman, a cast member of ''Million Dollar Listing: Los Angeles,'' a reality series on the Bravo cable channel, is being ''hired'' by Barbie to list the house.
And four designers are forming a dream team, in Mattel's parlance, to advise Barbie in her hunt for a new home. They are Jonathan Adler, who brought the Malibu playset to life in 2009 as part of a commemoration of Barbie's 50th anniversary; Lulu de Kwiatkowski; Celerie Kemble; and Trina Turk.
Although the campaign will include some traditional advertising like an ad in Us Weekly magazine, the bulk of it will involve digital media, on platforms like trulia.com and the Barbie Web site, barbie.com; social media like Facebook and Twitter; and public relations.
The campaign will also include so-called experiential marketing in the form of ''Barbie the Dreamhouse Experience'' -- a touring exhibition, in a partnership between Mattel and EMS Entertainment -- that is to begin this year in two markets, Berlin and Sunrise, Fla.
When Mattel reported its fourth-quarter results on Friday, executives said that Barbie sales fell about 4 percent, representing the third quarterly decline during 2012. That trend has set off efforts by Mattel to generate interest in Barbie and address challenges like the sluggish economy and the growing interest among children in electronic toys.
Recent examples of Mattel initiatives include a campaign, predominantly in social media, to reunite Barbie and her boyfriend, Ken, after a seven-year separation; a Web video series, ''Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,'' that can be watched on barbie.com/dreamhouse and YouTube; and cruises with Barbie themes on Royal Caribbean International ships.
''Over all, we're pleased with the position of Barbie in the marketplace,'' said Stephanie Cota, senior vice president for girls' brands worldwide at the Mattel Brands division of Mattel. ''No. 1 is a good place to be.''
Still, ''it's our job that she remain top of mind,'' she added, and ''we are at our best when we recognize the cultural relevance of Barbie.''
The campaign is being introduced amid signs that the battered American housing market is healing, like an acceleration in groundbreaking for new homes and a spate of prominent ads by national realty companies that included a commercial for Century 21 during Super Bowl XLVII on Sunday. Those may be indications that consumers are ready for a lighthearted campaign about a doll's foray into the real estate market.
Barbie is ''a fun brand, an iconic brand, to partner with,'' said Ken Shuman, head of communications at Trulia in San Francisco. The location of and high asking price for Barbie's home fit with the focus of a Trulia blog ''on luxury celebrity properties,'' he added.
Besides, ''we're a Silicon Valley company, technology-focused,'' Mr. Shuman said, ''and Silicon Valley has embraced Barbie, voting that computer engineer be her next career'' in 2010.
Mr. Altman, who works frequently with Trulia, is also getting into the spirit of the campaign. He said he would be glad to show Barbie new homes ''anywhere on the planet'' because ''she speaks God knows how many languages.''
''And Ken is fine with whatever she wants to do,'' he added, laughing.
After suggesting that he might advise Barbie to buy ''a skyscraper in Manhattan,'' Mr. Altman ended the conversation by declaring: ''This is Barbie on the other line; I've got to go.''
All the nontraditional elements of the campaign make it difficult to determine spending. Ms. Cota said it would be comparable to Mattel's spending on Barbie in recent years.
According to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, Mattel spent $11.6 million to advertise all Barbie products in major media in the first nine months of last year, compared with $8.4 million in the same period of 2011. Full-year spending was $18.4 million in 2011, $17.2 million in 2010, $23.7 million in 2009 and $31.7 million in 2008, Kantar Media reported.
The campaign is being led by an internal agency at Mattel, which is working with Attention, a digital and social media agency, and, for public relations, the HL Group, part of MDC Partners.

HEADLINE: A Plan Aims to Reconnect Residents With the East River Waterfront

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
As New Yorkers have watched the waterfront around Manhattan open up in recent years, one stretch has lagged: the East River waterfront, especially from the Brooklyn Bridge north to 38th Street, where the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive impedes access, bike lanes are squeezed by development and, now in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, storm surges threaten parkland.
A new blueprint for that section, called the East River Blueway Plan, will be announced on Thursday by the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, in his annual state of the borough speech. The plan, which involved public meetings with dozens of community groups and consultations with seven city and state agencies, lays out various ways to reconnect residents with the riverfront. 
The plan will not be officially released for a few weeks, but a copy was obtained by The New York Times in advance of the speech. Among the major recommendations are the development of a new public beach and kayak launch directly beneath the Brooklyn Bridge, where a naturally occurring sand beach forms a rock-strewn crescent that is now fenced off; the creation of two boat launches at Stuyvesant Cove at the ends of 20th and 23rd Streets; the installation of marshlands and sea walls in especially vulnerable flood zones, and the planting of trees and greenery all along the F.D.R. Drive to provide shade and absorb storm water runoff.
''We want very much to open the waterfront from a recreation perspective, but we also want to protect our fragile waterfront from Mother Nature by recognizing the reality of storm surges,'' Mr. Stringer said in a phone interview. ''What's novel here is that we actually remedy some of the issues with storm surges through amenity enhancements for the public.''
One proposal -- the most costly to execute -- would elevate the bike and pedestrian path over the F.D.R. Drive at 14th Street, where the path currently narrows to four feet near the Consolidated Edison substation. The plan calls for a new pedestrian bridge that would rise gradually from blocks away, allowing users to avoid that difficult bottleneck. The bridge would also serve as an inland sea wall that could help prevent flooding and an explosion like the one that rocked a substation during Hurricane Sandy, which contributed to the blackout across Lower Manhattan.
While there is no pot of money set aside to pay for all of the proposals, Mr. Stringer has pledged $3.5 million in capital funding toward new marshlands detailed in the plan. Both Mr. Stringer, who is running for the city comptroller's office, and Brian Kavanagh, the New York state assemblyman who collaborated on the report, expect that other elements could be financed gradually while the storm protections could receive a boost from the billions in federal money that was recently allocated in response to Hurricane Sandy.
''There are lots of smaller-ticket items that can be financed over time in the normal course of budgeting from city agencies,'' Mr. Kavanagh said. ''Having lighting and adequate bathrooms and places where you can get refreshments and other supplies are not extraordinarily expensive.''
The plan builds on a decade of activity along the East River, from newly opened piers to park renovations, as well as on earlier city studies, notably the City Planning Department's ''Vision 2020: New York City Comprehensive Waterfront Plan'' and the Economic Development Corporation's ''Transforming the East River Waterfront.''
While the 14-month planning process had already addressed climate change, Hurricane Sandy led to deeper discussions with experts on approaches to flooding in places like Venice and the Netherlands. ''We now know that this area was the Achilles' heel of the storm surge,'' Mr. Stringer said. ''We have got to make the case to the federal government and state government that if we are going to continue to build our waterfront, we can't build the way we used to.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Seek to Stave Off $1 Trillion in Cuts

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN and ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With at least one million jobs on the line, Senate Democrats on Wednesday said they were closing in on legislation to temporarily head off nearly $1 trillion in cuts that were already affecting Pentagon decision-making and could force significant reductions in staffing and services across the government.
Despite strong resistance from Republican leaders to new tax revenues, Democrats said that they expected the onset of federal furloughs and layoffs on March 1 to make Republicans more receptive to an emerging solution that would combine spending cuts with revenue from closing tax loopholes. Lawmakers were being spurred by increasingly dire warnings from top Pentagon officials about the implications of the automatic reductions. 
''This is not a game; this is reality,'' Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said emphatically in a speech at Georgetown University on Wednesday, as he warned that the cuts would curtail American naval operations in the western Pacific by as much as a third and force one-month furloughs for as many as 800,000 Defense Department civilian employees starting this spring.
''These steps would seriously damage the fragile American economy, and they would degrade our ability to respond to crisis precisely at a time of rising instability across the globe,'' he said.
Within hours of the speech, the Pentagon announced that the pending budget cuts had forced it to delay the deployment of a second aircraft carrier to the crucial Persian Gulf, leaving only one near the Strait of Hormuz and the coastline of Iran after March. Because of the tensions in the region, the Pentagon has kept two carriers in the area for most of the last two years.
At a closed-door retreat in Annapolis, Md., this week, Senate Democratic leaders struck a populist tone. They suggested they could rally public support for a measure that would temporarily suspend the cuts by limiting tax breaks for oil and gas exploration, reducing the tax advantages for wealthy private-equity employees who pay a lower 20 percent capital gains rate on much of their income, and ending tax deductions for the cost of moving business functions overseas.
A presentation by Senator Patty Murray of Washington, who spoke along with Senators Max Baucus of Montana and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, described the income gains of the richest 1 percent of Americans amid rising poverty and stagnating middle-class incomes.
''Republicans ultimately have to choose whether they are more interested in protecting tax breaks for Big Oil and other special interests, or protecting defense spending and the economy,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
Republican leaders are no less firm that the cuts will come into force in three weeks unless Democrats agree to equivalent spending cuts elsewhere in the budget, without tax increases.
''At some point, Washington has to deal with its spending problem,'' Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said Wednesday. ''I've watched them kick this can down the road for 22 years since I've been here. I've had enough of it. It's time to act.''
While federal officials have historically warned of government disruptions to avoid cutbacks, the potential impact of the cuts is being cited by both parties. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said the military side alone would eliminate 350,000 jobs directly, and 650,000 more that depend on the government programs.
Domestic programs, from the National Institutes of Health to the Department of Education, would be hit nearly as hard. The Army would cut intelligence and surveillance aircraft and pull back on efforts to counter roadside bombs. Defense Department furloughs would potentially begin as early as April and would cut one work day a week from the Pentagon's vast civilian work force for the next six months. The employees would face a corresponding 20 percent cut in pay.
At a House Democratic retreat in Virginia on Thursday, Representative Nita Lowey of New York is expected to lay out the domestic side. About 10 percent of the Federal Aviation Administration's 40,000 workers would be furloughed. Because meat and poultry inspectors would be kept home, food plants that cannot operate without them would have to be shuttered. Coast Guard air and surface operations would be down nearly 25 percent.
Wait times at the nation's busiest airports could rise as much as three hours with the furloughing of customs agents. Some 70,000 children would be dropped from Head Start. And as Republicans continue to delve into the deaths of four Americans at the American Mission in Benghazi, Libya, the State Department would have to absorb a $168 million cut to embassy security.
Both parties are showing cracks in their resolve. Some Republicans with large military installations in their districts said they could support a postponement in the military cuts while negotiations continued on a broader deficit reduction plan. Fearing for Hill Air Force Base, Representative Rob Bishop, Republican of Utah, did not rule out supporting a Senate bill that closed tax loopholes and cut spending to stave off the cuts.
''It would depend on what the details are,'' he said.
Republican leaders of the Senate and the House Armed Services Committees proposed Wednesday to cancel the Pentagon cuts for 2013 by applying savings from a 10 percent cut in the federal work force over the next decade.
Most of the Armed Services Republican leaders were steadfast in their opposition to any more tax increases to resolve the impasse. After describing the situation as ''desperate,'' Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Senate committee, added, ''It's not desperate enough to raise taxes.''
The cuts were required in 2011 when a special House-Senate committee was unable to come up with a compromise plan to reduce the deficit.
But Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said both parties bear responsibility for agreeing to the cuts to force a bipartisan deficit deal that remains out of reach.
''We got into this mess together,'' he said. ''We're going to have to get out of it together.''
House Democrats produced legislation that would stave off the cuts through Sept. 30 by ending direct subsidy payments to agribusinesses, eliminating tax breaks for oil and gas companies, and establishing a minimum 30-percent effective tax rate on annual incomes over $1 million.

HEADLINE: The 0.03% Solution to Washington's Budget Problems

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER. 
Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest. E-mail: jesse@propublica.org Twitter: @eisingerj

 BODY:
The unwritten rule of Washington debates about taxing and spending is to never consider anything new. But wouldn't it be wonderful if the pressure of the next few months' debate changed that?
Last month, 11 European countries, including France and Germany, moved forward on introducing a minuscule taxon trades in stocks, bonds and derivatives. The tax goes by many names. It's often called a Tobin tax, after the economist James Tobin. In Europe it goes by the more pedestrian financial transaction tax. In Britain, it goes by the wonderful Robin Hood tax, and is supported in an often clever campaign.
On this side of the Atlantic, there is a ghostly silence on a transaction tax in respectable political quarters. But that might change. This month, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, and Representative Peter DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon, plan to reintroduce their bill calling for just such a tax. 
A transaction tax could raise a huge amount of money and cause less pain than many alternatives. It could offset the need for cuts to the social safety net or tax increases that damage consumer demand. How huge a sum? Mr. Harkin and Mr. DeFazio got an estimate from the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which scores tax plans. It's a hearty one: $352 billion over 10 years.
The money would come from a tiny levy. The bill calls for a three-basis-point charge on most trades. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. So it amounts to 3 cents on every $100 traded.
And the bill contains some exemptions intended to make the tax more politically palatable. The first sales of stocks (initial public offerings) and bonds are exempted, so that the markets' capital-raising function isn't harmed. Initial investments and withdrawals from tax-protected accounts, like retirement or education funds, also have a measure of protection.
Critics of such a tax cavil that it will harm our capital markets and won't raise that much money. They argue that such a tax cannot be enforced; that it will depress trading, leading to lower asset prices; and that it will ultimately be passed on to retail investors.
These are anemic arguments, and are completely destroyed in anexcellent piece of myth-busting by a group in Britain called Stamp Out Poverty.
Lots of taxes are hard to collect, but this doesn't seem like one of them. Sales taxes have decent compliance, and they are often collected by small businesses conducting commerce in cash. Trading, on the other hand, is conducted by large businesses on computers. This tax would be collected by the exchanges. If there's no exchange involved, the buyer owes it. It would be paid on any trade carried out in the United States or by any American entity or individual (a corporation's offshore subsidiaries can't get around it).
If there is truly a concern, then the tax could be modified so that if it hadn't been paid, neither the transaction nor any legal action arising from it would be enforceable in the United States judicial system. Voilà! Plenty of compliance.
But those who argue against the tax are blind to a sea change in the way society sees the financial sector. They should be asked to make an affirmative case for more frenzied capital markets activity, rather than just assume that tamping it down is malign.
Yes, trading costs have come down and trading has skyrocketed in the last decade and a half. What have we gotten for it? Bubbles, crashes, volatile asset prices and an outsize financial sector that extracts rents from the rest of the economy. Rising volumes and tighter spreads haven't delivered good economic growth, broad-based wage growth or good jobs.
Nor have they even helped the stock market. Where is the boom in newly public companies? The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is only just now getting back to its peak before the financial crisis. The Nasdaq isn't close to the peak achieved in the year 2000. Stock market valuations are depressed.
So let trading costs rise again, if the Tobin tax would really lead to that. (Other factors, like brutal competition, might still keep them just as low.) Much of the trading that occurs in the market is socially useless. It might narrow slightly the spread between the prices at which securities and derivatives are bought and sold, but the minute there's a crisis, the traders flee. They provide the kind of liquidity that is available only when it is not needed.
The average American, who has limited exposure to the stock market, has little to fear from the tax and much to gain. And if some of the high-frequency trading flees offshore? Good riddance.
Alternatively, let's suppose that a transaction tax succeeds beyond expectations in bringing down excessive trading and doesn't raise as much as projected. Fine. The American capital markets will become less volatile and more connected to fundamentals. Pension fund and mutual fund managers will have an incentive to hold stocks longer and adjust their investing expectations. There is a scourge of short-term thinking in American business; a transaction tax leans against this malign influence.
But what if the tide of technology and investor attention-deficit disorder continues apace, and trading does not decline as much as the securities industry and its paid academic shills claim? That's fine, too. We'll take the revenue.
The politics of a transaction tax are fascinating. Mr. Harkin doesn't have the juice to get it done on his own, several Senate staff members and Washington observers explained to me. The transaction tax would need to be embraced by some senators on the relevant committees, like finance or banking. The Senate Finance Committee is a problem because Charles Schumer of New York, the heavyweight Democrat who serves on it, often acts as if his main constituency is Wall Street.
There have been hints of a possible anti-Wall Street/Big Bank coalition between Midwestern and Western Democrats and Republicans. The Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown and the Louisiana Republican David Vitter don't agree on much, but they co-sponsored a bill calling for more bank capital. Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican famous for skewering vested interests, serves on the Senate Finance Committee. Of course, Republicans have taken blood oaths never to support higher revenue.
If some kind of increase in taxes is inevitable, one that takes aim at high-frequency traders probably hits few Iowans and average Americans in general, while doing much good.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Europe's Plan For GPS Limps To Crossroads

BYLINE: By ANDREW HIGGINS; James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.

 BODY:
FUCINO, Italy -- With lofty dreams of European unity increasingly grounded by economic woe and the weight of narrow national interests, an array of computer screens here in central Italy blinks with faint signs that -- far away in space, at least -- Europe's often quarreling nations can still sometimes find common cause.
Ringed by snow-covered mountains on a plateau east of Rome, the Fucino Space Center stands guard over the European Union's flagship joint project: a satellite navigation system that is years behind schedule, many times over its original budget and unlikely to start operating for at least another year.
Europe's future commitment to the project, known as Galileo and designed to create a new, improved and European-controlled version of America's Global Positioning System, is to be decided in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, when European leaders will try for a second time, after talks failed in November, to hash out a long-term budget for the 27-nation bloc. 
With recession and austerity clouding much of the Continent, they will argue over where the ax should fall on a European Union budget for 2014 to 2020, which would total nearly $1.35 trillion as drafted. An over-budget satellite navigation system that is years from full completion, largely a duplicate of an American system already widely used in Europe and unlikely ever to generate much revenue would seem to be in the budget cutters' cross hairs.
But Galileo's backers are confident, so much so that they are asking for $8 billion beyond the more than $4 billion already spent. For Galileo promises perhaps the one thing that still seems able to overcome European leaders' devotion to austerity: economic and technological independence from the United States.
''It is like a car going on a highway -- it is very difficult to stop,'' said Lucio Magliozzi, chief operating officer of Telespazio. The Italian-French company manages the Fucino control center, which is tracking the handful of Galileo navigation satellites launched by Europe so far.
Galileo, also known as the European Global Navigation Satellite System, has already burned through more than three times the original budget target and has only 4 of the 30 planned satellites in orbit. Even so, the troubled program highlights how, through sheer force of will and a judicious sharing of economic spoils, the European Union can at times push ahead with objectives it defines as ''strategic.''
Space ''has a strategic importance for the independence of Europe, for employment and for competitiveness,'' Antonio Tajani, vice president of the European Commission, the union's policy-making arm, said in a recent speech. Mr. Tajani, who is also the commission's senior official responsible for space projects, added, ''This is why we need a European space policy that is even more ambitious.''
The budget talks are expected to be dominated by the competing demands of countries, like France, that want to maintain heavy spending on farm subsidies and those in poorer regions that want to avoid cuts to so-called cohesion funds designed to narrow economic gaps on the Continent.
This leaves items like research vulnerable to deep cuts. Research is heavily favored by Britain and some other countries as a lever for Europe to be competitive in the future but is less immediately tied to the economic fortunes of individual states.
One project that could get hit is a satellite observation system known as Copernicus, or Global Monitoring for Environment and Security. Europe's efforts to monitor earth from space suffered a big blow last year when its biggest satellite, an eight-ton device called Envisat, suddenly stopped working. The Copernicus program has its own satellites and is now mostly operational but has struggled to get a clear funding commitment in the next long-term union budget.
Europe ''is like someone who buys a car but has no money for petrol,'' Diego Canga Fano, a senior European Commission official in the department responsible for industry, said at a space conference in Brussels last week, referring to uncertainty over money for the Copernicus project. ''The car is useless. We are a bit in this situation.''
Galileo has fared better, gathering a powerful group of backers in Brussels and among industrial and political interests in key member states. They include France, Germany and even Britain, which is usually a leading voice for deep cuts and was once a strong critic of the navigation program.
Galileo -- first proposed in 1994, more than 20 years after America started its own system, and initially promoted as a big potential moneymaker -- ''can't give a direct return on investment, but politically it is very important for Europe to have its own autonomous system,'' said Mr. Magliozzi of Telespazio.
By building and controlling its own satellite navigation apparatus Europe aims to escape its dependence on America's GPS to guide its cars, missiles, aircraft and ships. Unlike the American system, which was devised by the military and is still ultimately controlled by the Pentagon, Galileo is under civilian control -- although it, too, would have potentially wide military uses. It is also designed to be far more precise than the American version.
After an abortive effort to get private companies to put up much of the development costs, Galileo has been financed almost entirely by the European Union since 2007. It is the first and so far only major infrastructure project managed by the European Commission.
Galileo has had such a troubled history that many doubted it would ever get off the ground. Critics mocked it as ''the Common Agricultural Policy in the sky,'' a reference to Europe's program of subsidies for farmers, which eats up nearly 40 percent of the union's total budget.
A 2011 report to the European Parliament listed a catalog of troubles, noting that Galileo had been particularly blighted in its early years by a familiar problem: political pressure from individual countries to skew the project in favor of their own companies and other immediate interests.
It also ran aground, the report said, on friction between the ''pro-Atlanticist'' stand of strong American allies like Britain and the ''pro-European'' outlook of nations that often have strained relations with Washington, like France. ''Political disagreements among member states marked the Galileo program since its very beginning,'' the report said.
A cable from the United States Embassy in Berlin released by WikiLeaks reported private remarks made in 2009 by the chief executive of a German satellite maker, OHB-System. It quoted the OHB chief, Berry Smutny, describing Galileo as doomed to fail without major changes and ''a waste of E.U. taxpayers' money championed by French interests.'' Mr. Smutny, who disputed the comments attributed to him, was fired by the company.
''This is the most stupid remark I have ever heard, and the decision taken by shareholders of OHB was the right one,'' François Auque, chief executive of Astrium, a rival satellite company owned by the European defense and aeronautics conglomerate EADS, said in a recent lunch with reporters. ''It doesn't cover any reality at all.''
Astrium won an initial Galileo contract for four satellites. But contracts worth $1 billion for 22 more satellites have all gone to OHB, now one of the primary corporate beneficiaries of Galileo. British companies have also done well, a boon that has helped erode Britain's initial hostility to the project.
The United States also initially opposed Galileo, with officials in the administration of President George W. Bush worrying that the European system would interfere with GPS channels used by the military and could be used by America's foes in a war. Washington also asked why, when many European nations were increasingly unable to fulfill their military obligations as members of NATO because of defense cuts, they wanted to splash billions on a project that replicated an existing system paid for by the United States.
After long and sometimes testy negotiations, Europe and Washington called a truce in the dispute, and now each pledges to cooperate to make the two systems work together.
Officials at the European Commission now stress that Galileo is not meant as a rival to the American system but as a European-controlled extension of a shared global navigation network. They acknowledge that Galileo, most of whose services will be free like those of GPS, will not earn much. Airlines, shipping companies and some other commercial users will probably be asked to pay for certain data.
But, said Mr. Tajani, the commission vice president, it will ''open a whole new world'' for business in the development of applications for Galileo's highly precise positioning data. Officials say Galileo could be used to guide blind people, monitor the movement of cows to check when they are ovulating and aid in a host of other practical needs.
But other Galileo supporters still emphasize its role in freeing Europe from dependence on America. ''It lets Europe stay independent,'' said Elmar Brok, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the European Parliament.
''It is a question of independence,'' Mr. Brok said. ''The blind are not independent, and Europe without its own satellites will be blind.''

HEADLINE: ArcelorMittal, Announcing Loss, Indicates No Further Plant Closures in Europe

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED

 BODY:
LONDON -- ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel company, appeared to draw the line on additional European plant closures Wednesday, even as it announced a $4 billion net loss for the fourth quarter of 2012 and a $3.7 billion net loss for the year.
But the company's results also highlighted just how bad operating conditions in Europe have been. A key reason for the losses was $5 billion in write-downs, almost all of it on its European businesses. 
ArcelorMittal continues to be badly hurt by its operations in Europe, where it employs 98,000 people and where demand for steel has dropped by 30 percent since 2007, including a 9 percent decline in 2012. The company reported a $2.9 billion operating loss for the quarter in its European unit which supplies the beleaguered automobile industry.
Lakshmi N. Mittal, the company's chairman and chief executive, said during a conference call with analysts Wednesday that he expected steel shipments to increase this year by 2 percent to 3 percent. That, he said, was because of growing demand for steel in China, Brazil and the United States, where the oil and gas industry, as well as auto and heavy equipment makers, were proving strong markets for ArcelorMittal's products.
Unlike in Europe, he said that U.S. ''businesses are getting loans.'' He added that he expected Europe to remain in recession this year, but that this would be ''far less severe than in 2012.''
Although ArcelorMittal is bidding on a steel plant being sold to the German steel maker ThyssenKrupp in Alabama, the company is mainly focusing on its new investments in mining, which has been more profitable than steel making of late, recording $1.2 billion in operating profit and a 22 percent operating margin last year.
The company announced Wednesday that the board had approved a big expansion and modernization of its iron ore mine in Liberia, part of a $4 billion effort to nearly double global iron ore production. The company's iron ore output is likely to rise by 20 percent in 2013 as enlargement of its Canadian mines is completed, the company said.
Mr. Mittal said 2012 had turned out worse than expected, particularly in Europe and China, taking the industry by surprise.
''Production was not adjusted quickly enough, leading to oversupply and weak pricing,'' he said, adding that steel prices were down 8.2 percent in 2012 from 2011.
Mr. Mittal created his company through a long series of acquisitions that culminated in an epic takeover battle for Arcelor, based in Luxembourg, in 2006. At the time it looked as if he had succeeded in achieving sufficient consolidation of the fragmented industry to make it highly profitable.
But conditions have been brutal since the financial crisis hit in 2008, with steel demand shrinking in Europe and North America, where ArcelorMittal has much of its operations. A large portion of the write-downs last year were noncash good will on European units acquired through the Arcelor merger.
The weak European economy ''led to a downward revision of cash flow expectations'' from these businesses, the company said.
Jeff Largey, an analyst at Macquarie Securities in London, wrote in a recent research note that the company made close to $43 billion in investments, including takeovers, from 2006 through 2011, whereas the company's market value is now only about $28 billion. He said those figures raised questions about whether ArcelorMittal ''will be able to generate shareholder value gains and sufficient returns from its investment projects.''
He also said that they raised ''the question of whether the steel industry is capable of generating shareholder value'' over the long term.
Mr. Largey wrote in an e-mail on Wednesday that he saw ''a modest uplift in earnings for 2013'' for ArcelorMittal, but that the steel industry remained hampered by ''overcapacity and lackluster real demand, particularly in Europe.''
The difficult economic conditions have forced Mr. Mittal to take a knife to his operations, especially in Europe, where the company produces about 45 percent of its steel. ArcelorMittal previously announced the long-term idling of blast furnaces at Florange, France, various facilities in Liège, Belgium, and electric arc mills in Spain and Luxembourg as part of what it called its ''asset optimization'' program, which is designed to achieve $1 billion in annual savings.
The idlings and closures led to tensions with labor unions and a showdown with the government of President François Hollande of France over the closure at Florange, which employs 2,000 workers. The French government threatened to nationalize the facility before ArcelorMittal agreed to invest &#x20ac;180 million, or $234 million, in the site, though it indicated that the two blast furnaces would remain closed.
''We have had to deal with the negative reactions of many stakeholders during implementation, but steps we have taken have been essential, '' Mr. Mittal said Wednesday.
Aditya Mittal, the company's chief financial officer and Mr. Mittal's son, said ArcelorMittal did not ''expect any further restructuring in Europe.'' There will be further financial charges as the reorganization progresses, Aditya Mittal said.
Despite the company's struggles, which have included downgrades of its debt to junk status, ArcelorMittal is still able to raise money in the markets. Last month it raised $4 billion through an offering of shares and convertible notes in an effort to reduce net debt, which it forecast would be $17 billion in June, down from $21.8 billion at the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Europe Adopts Sweeping Changes to Fishing Policy

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- In an outcome hailed by environmentalists, European Union lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to overhaul the region's troubled fisheries policy to end decades of overfishing.
Responding to widespread public dissatisfaction with the current policy, the European Parliament voted 502-to-137 to impose sustainable quotas by 2015 and end the wasteful practice of discarding unwanted fish at sea. The legislation also returns some management responsibility to E.U. member states.
''The fishermen back home were really determined to wrest control away from Brussels, where the micromanagers have been the absolute ruination of the fisheries policy,'' and they will be pleased with the outcome, said Struan Stevenson, a Scottish member of Parliament for the European Conservatives and Reformists and the party's spokesman on the issue. 
Markus Knigge, policy and research director for Pew Environment, said the E.U. legislation was comparable to the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the landmark U.S. law that in 1976 established modern American fisheries practices, widely seen as superior to European practices.
Under current policy, 63 percent of the E.U.'s Atlantic stocks and 82 percent of its Mediterranean stocks are overfished, according to the European Commission.
The vote Wednesday in Strasbourg was the first time the Parliament had shared responsibility for setting fisheries policy, formerly the domain of the European Fisheries Council. The council, dominated by national fisheries ministries with close ties to the industry, has been criticized for flouting scientific recommendations on catch limits and providing subsidies to fleets harvesting even the most vulnerable species.
Guy Vernaeve, secretary general of Europêche, which represents European fishing associations, expressed disappointment with the vote. Setting quotas at maximum sustainable yields by 2015 was ''unrealistic,'' he said, and the discard ban was a ''radical obligation'' that legislators had adopted without understanding that in many cases it would be impossible to implement.
Mr. Vernaeve said the industry would seek to persuade the European Fisheries Council to fight some measures, but added that a final agreement could be reached by June.
The parliamentary vote, spearheaded by Ulrike Rodust, a German Socialist who leads the Fisheries Committee, was supported by an alliance of Greens, Liberals, Socialists and the Conservatives and Reformists. But parliamentary observers said the final tally showed that some lawmakers from parties opposed to the overhaul had crossed the aisles in significant numbers to support it.
Still, the Parliament does not have the final word on the matter. Because the legislation adopted Wednesday goes much further than proposals from the Fisheries Council, the issue will go through a process known as a trilogue -- a reconciliation of the competing proposals, with the European Commission acting as mediator.
In addition, some E.U. states with significant fishing industries have argued that the Parliament does not have the authority to set multiyear fishing plans, raising the possibility of a battle over E.U. governance that could lead all the way to the European Court of Justice.
Nonetheless, the Irish government, which holds the rotating presidency of the Union, has said it hopes to wrap up an agreement by the end of June.
Maria Damanaki, the European fisheries commissioner, said she welcomed the vote, noting in a statement that the Parliament had endorsed ''the approach put forward by the commission'' -- a not-so-subtle reference to the fact that her own proposals had been watered down by national fisheries ministers.
In concrete terms, the measures Wednesday require that by 2015, all European quotas be set at the optimal catch level, known as maximum sustainable yield. The fishing industry had called for introducing that standard on a case-by-case basis starting in 2020.
The legislation also requires the elimination of excess fishing capacity, a perennial problem for European fisheries, by removing boats from the fishing fleets. The measure also would deny subsidy payments to fisheries that did not respect the law, including by failing to provide accurate catch data.
Parliament also voted for a strict ban on discarding, the environmentally and economically costly practice in which fish are thrown back into the sea, often dead or dying, because they could not be legally caught. Fleets will have to modify their methods and equipment so they do not accidentally catch prohibited fish.
Mr. Stevenson said the timetable on some of the issues might turn out to be ''unrealistic,'' particularly a blanket discard ban by Jan. 1, 2014.
''All sorts of work has to be done,'' he said. ''Fishermen have to adapt their methods, adapt their gear. But I believe that by 2018 at the latest, we'll see the discarding of fish as history.''

HEADLINE: Deep-Sea Drilling Muddies Political Waters

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex. -- The oceans deep are a repository of many secrets. Shipwrecks have existed undisturbed for centuries, as have corals and fish of almost unimaginable diversity.
Now, increasingly, the secrets of the seabed are being looked at by companies drilling for oil and minerals. International geopolitics and the environment are getting more muddled as a result.
''Deep-sea drilling is expensive and hard, and the technology wasn't there until very recently,'' said Sheila Smith, a senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States. Now, major powers are vying for drilling rights in places like the East China Sea, where the tussle is between the two largest energy consumers in Asia: China and Japan. Tensions there flared this week when Japan said China had recently aimed military targeting radar at one of its ships near disputed islands. 
The drilling industry continues to move toward deeper waters and new deposits. In the Gulf of Mexico, drilling is now occurring beneath as much as 8,000 to 9,000 feet, or about 2,400 to 2,700 meters, of water, according to Mike Lyons, general counsel of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association. The Deepwater Horizon rig, by contrast, was drilling in about 5,000 feet of water in the gulf when it exploded after a blowout nearly three years ago.
Technology has accelerated the move toward deeper waters. ''A lot of the drilling now in the Gulf of Mexico is done with drill ships, as opposed to conventional drilling platforms that people have used in the past,'' Mr. Lyons said. The ships can inhabit deeper waters and be stabilized over a drill site with the aid of sophisticated computers, he said.
Amy Myers Jaffe, executive director for energy and sustainability at the University of California, Davis, said that the industry's advances into deeper water had been steady but incremental.
With the increased capability comes increased scrutiny, especially after events like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon accident and a 2011 oil leak off of Brazil, as well as a natural gas leak last year at a North Sea drilling platform about 150 miles, or 240 kilometers, off Aberdeen, Scotland.
Ms. Jaffe said that drillers had perhaps viewed deep-water operations as too routine. ''I think that we were a little blasé about how hard it is to do,'' she said. ''And maybe the industry is now grappling with the difference between 2 percent tolerance and 0 percent tolerance'' for mistakes. Zero percent may be the new model, especially in places that have recently experienced public outcries over spills, including Australia, Brazil and the United States, she said.
Shell's difficulty in drilling in Arctic waters off Alaska further illustrates the technological challenges of operating in new, often adverse settings.
The industry is eager to ''get access to these fragile and complicated areas'' like the Arctic, said Frederic Hauge, president of the Bellona Foundation, an environmental group based in Oslo. But the risks are immense, he said, adding that in Norway, he felt that companies lacked adequate emergency response plans for their far-afield rigs.
As technology helps propel the industry further offshore, geopolitical difficulties are intruding. Many countries have overlapping maritime boundaries. Lebanon and Israel have disputed claims in the natural-gas-rich eastern Mediterranean Sea. The United States and Mexico have also had differences over rights in the Gulf of Mexico, though they signed a cooperation agreement a year ago on drilling.
In the East China Sea and the South China Sea, disputes continue as China, with its rising energy appetite, clashes with its neighbors over drilling rights and sovereignty claims.
''If these were uncontested regions, I'm sure people would have gone forward already'' with drilling, said Ms. Smith of the Council on Foreign Relations.
Should the drilling industry venture into even deeper waters, additional political complications await. The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, signed by more than 150 countries -- though not by the United States -- gives the International Seabed Authority, based in Jamaica, oversight of mineral exploration in waters that lie beyond a country's so-called exclusive economic zone, which typically extends 200 nautical miles, or 370 kilometers, from shore.
Adam Cook, a marine biologist with the seabed agency, said that while the group had agreed to 17 exploration contracts with companies, most of those companies were looking for minerals like manganese nodules, which are rock formations. So far, none are after oil or natural gas, and the consensus is that there is ''unlikely to be any drilling for oil and gas beyond national jurisdiction in the near future,'' Mr. Cook said in an e-mail.

HEADLINE: Change of Economic Course Lead to Surge in Nikkei

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's Nikkei average surged 3.8 percent Wednesday, closing at its highest point since October 2008, after the yen fell sharply amid expectations of a more aggressive economic policy. 
The benchmark rose 416.83 points to 11,463.75, its biggest one-day gain since March 2011, as the Japanese currency dropped to 94.08 against the dollar.
On Tuesday, Masaaki Shirakawa, the governor of the Bank of Japan, said he would step down, along with his two deputies, in March, three weeks before the scheduled end of his five-year term.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has put the central bank under relentless pressure to do more to pull the economy out of the doldrums. Mr. Shirakawa's announcement opened the way for him to quickly appoint a governor who would be bolder in loosening monetary policy.
''There was a very aggressive, solid weakening of the yen in response to what seems like relatively trivial news,'' said Stefan Worrall, director of equity sales at Credit Suisse in Tokyo. ''But it's nonetheless news that signals the expectation and recognition that the momentum in Japan is continuing to favor yen weakening,''
Although investors have seen the weak yen as a boon for exporters over the last two and a half months, Mr. Worrall said, there are other benefits to a more competitive exchange rate.
''On a U.S. dollar basis, Japan has yet to break out, particularly if you compare its rally with rallies'' in Germany and Australia, he said.
Indeed, brighter profit forecasts from the likes of Toyota Motor and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries helped sustain the optimistic mood Wednesday. Their gains stemmed from the weaker yen, which inflates the value of earnings from overseas.
Toyota climbed 6.1 percent and was the most-traded stock by turnover on the main board, and Mitsubishi Heavy rose 10.4 percent, with both stocks hitting their highest levels since autumn 2008.
Expectations of a new central bank governor also helped inflation-sensitive shares, as the central bank signed onto a new 2 percent inflation target last month with the government. On Wednesday, the real estate sector advanced 4 percent.
Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley, said the central bank might start ''open-ended'' asset buying in April, well before the 2014 start the central bank committed to at its last policy meeting.
Mr. Fujito said he saw Kazumasa Iwata, a former Bank of Japan deputy governor and a vocal supporter of an asset purchase fund of ¥50 trillion, or $530 billion, as the most likely candidate to succeed Mr. Shirakawa.
Others seen as possible candidates are Haruhiko Kuroda, president of the Asian Development Bank, and Heizo Takenaka, who a decade ago was an economics minister.

HEADLINE: Obama's Choice to Lead Interior Dept. Has Oil Sector and Conservation Credentials

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Stephanie Clifford contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Wednesday nominated Sally Jewell, the chief executive of Recreational Equipment Inc., to lead the Interior Department, with a vow that she will balance the agency's sometimes conflicting mandates to promote resource development and preserve the nation's natural heritage.
If confirmed, Ms. Jewell, a former oil company engineer and longtime advocate for conservation and outdoor recreation, will take over a department that has been embroiled in controversy over the regulation of oil and gas on public lands and in the Gulf of Mexico and Arctic Ocean. She also will be the steward of hundreds of millions of acres of public lands, from the Everglades of Florida to the Cascades of Washington State. 
Ms. Jewell, 56, who also had a 19-year career as a commercial banker, took over as chief executive of REI in 2005. The company, which is based in Kent, Wash., just south of Seattle, has since grown to nearly $2 billion a year in sales.
She is in line to replace Ken Salazar, who has led the department since the beginning of the Obama administration.
The president must also fill vacancies at other major agencies that deal with energy and environmental issues -- at the Energy and Transportation Departments and the Environmental Protection Agency. The White House gave no indication on Wednesday that any of those appointments are imminent.
While introducing Ms. Jewell at the White House, Mr. Obama alluded to the tensions that have divided the Interior Department's mission for decades. He said that she is an expert on energy and climate change issues as well as an avid outdoorswoman and a former oil company worker in Oklahoma and Colorado.
''She knows the link between conservation and good jobs,'' the president said. ''She knows that there's no contradiction between being good stewards of the land and our economic progress, that, in fact, those two things need to go hand in hand.''
Ms. Jewell spoke briefly, saying she was humbled and energized by the appointment and looked forward to meeting the senators who will vote on her confirmation.
She can expect sharp questioning during those hearings about her approach to resource development -- oil, gas and minerals, but also solar and wind power -- on public lands. Republicans in Congress have criticized the Obama administration for holding back public lands from oil and gas leasing and for imposing overly restrictive regulations on hydraulic fracturing and other extraction methods.
Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the senior Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said she was not yet ready to judge Ms. Jewell's credentials. ''I look forward to hearing about the qualifications Ms. Jewell has that make her a suitable candidate to run such an important agency, and how she plans to restore balance to the Interior Department,'' Ms. Murkowski said in a statement.
Ms. Jewell will also face scrutiny from environmental and conservation advocates who will want to know about her approach to the preservation of public lands.
Ms. Jewell, a native of the Seattle area and a graduate of the University of Washington with a degree in mechanical engineering, has been a lifelong outdoors enthusiast. As a child she sailed in the Puget Sound and camped throughout the Pacific Northwest, according to a 2005 profile in The Seattle Times.
In 2011, she introduced President Obama at the White House conference on ''America's Great Outdoor Initiative,'' noting that the $289 billion outdoor-recreation industry is the source of 6.5 million jobs.
Ms. Jewell and her husband, Warren, have made political contributions of nearly $100,000 since the mid-1990s, almost exclusively to Democratic candidates and causes. She contributed to two groups that supported the successful 2012 effort to legalize same-sex marriage in Washington State.
The Interior Department post has traditionally gone to a politician from the Western United States, like Mr. Salazar, a former senator from Colorado. Under President George W. Bush, Gale A. Norton, a former attorney general of Colorado, and Dirk Kempthorne, a former governor and senator from Idaho, served in the position.
Ms. Jewell, if confirmed, would represent a different model, a corporate executive with experience in both resource exploitation and conservation.
Douglas W. Walker, a former chairman of the board at REI and a climbing partner of Ms. Jewell's, said she is an avid climber, kayaker and sailor who has climbed Mount Rainier in Washington State and Mount Vinson in Antarctica.
Mr. Obama referred to her South Pole adventures.
''And when Sally is confirmed, I'm willing to bet that she will be the first secretary of the interior who frequently hikes Mailbox Peak in her native Washington State and who once spent a month climbing mountains in Antarctica,'' he said, ''which is just not something I'd think of doing, because it seems like it'd be cold, and I was born in Hawaii.''

HEADLINE: Restoration Drama

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
WILTON, CONN. -- In the annals of domestic horror stories, Jay Fielden's is as gothic as they come. It begins with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the attendant financial meltdown in the fall of 2008. He and his wife, Yvonne Orteig Fielden, now both 43, and their two young children had just moved into their new home, a sturdy example of Connecticut's storied collection of modernist glass houses, which they had bought for $900,000 in 2007 and spent eight months renovating.
Just as they were settling in, Mr. Fielden lost his job as editor in chief of Men's Vogue, which folded in the wake of the economic downturn. To be sure, he wasn't thrown out on his ear. There was a stint at Vogue.com, but when he finally left, it was clear that the age of the golden parachute was long gone. Then, in October of 2010, when he had been out of work a year and their third child had arrived, an electrical fire tore through the house, destroying most of it.
If this were a short story, it would be gilding the lily to add that Mr. Fielden also contracted Lyme disease during this time and his father passed away as well, but this tale is not fiction. It does have a happy ending, however. 
''It's amazing we're still married,'' said Ms. Fielden, who in the middle of the events detailed above became guardian of her father, who suffers from dementia. ''Man, it was a lot of straws.''
It was a bright, windblown weekday morning, and Mr. Fielden was home from his new job as editor in chief of Town & Country magazine. His house has been rebuilt (again), as has his magazine, a 167-year-old publication that has struggled to stay relevant. (In the age of social media, what role should the original chronicle of America's social life play?) Mr. Fielden, a dapper Texan with a deep Fred Thompson rumble, is a former New Yorker editor with a taste for the American literary canon that peaked around the time his house was built, in 1960. He has reimagined Town & Country, once a slim portfolio of Midwestern debutante parties and East Coast WASP weddings, as a Vanity Fair manqué, a sassy primer to the good life with a bit of meat thrown in.
His redesign is warm and lively (a Vogue/Spy/Vanity Fair mash-up), and particularly vivid in his March issue. The magazine's Web site has also been refreshed. Clean, classy and easy to navigate, it stands out from its pedestrian colleagues in the Hearst stable. Town & Country's meat, however, can feel stale: a feature on the twin sisters at the center of the General Petraeus scandal promises new details, but four months after the affair and the accompanying tabloid frenzy, it's hard to work up an appetite. But while the magazine may still feel like an afterthought purchase (after Vogue and Vanity Fair, that is), its numbers are good: advertising is up more than 7 percent this quarter.
Perhaps the most telling feature of the new magazine is the editor's letter, generally not a must-read column in most magazines. November's began with these words: ''My three kids don't particularly like the fact that I have a job.'' Though he also addresses more man-about-town topics -- partying with America's Cup sailors, reminiscing about editing Robert Hughes -- he regularly shares the details of a complex life that should be familiar to his target readers. (The November letter goes on to chronicle his daughter Eliza's day in Town & Country's offices, with lunch ''at my regular power canteen, the American Girl Cafe.'')
In many ways, Mr. Fielden is emblematic of his generation, a man deep in the weeds of caring for young children and aging parents while trying to stay on top of his profession in a punishing economic climate. His ability to express that connection with his readers bodes well for his new magazine. Town & Country's audience is 70 percent female, and you can't help but imagine they'd warm to a man who takes his children to work. Certainly his candor is unexpected, editors in chief being a notoriously circumspect tribe. But after having lost so much, he said, his life is rich in ways that have nothing to do with possessions. By his own account, he'd always been a guy who delighted in the totems of patrician luxury.
''If you define yourself by your things,'' he said, ''who are you when you lose all those things? I work in a world where the material things are paramount. There's nothing wrong with loving these beautiful things, but they can start to own you. Even though it was a harsh lesson, it was nice to know that we can stand on our own feet. Especially for our kids to have that lesson early in life. To realize the house can burn up but the relationships, the care, can't be torn apart.''And he's lucky enough to have a wife who can gently take him down a peg or two.
''Just replacing Jay's hair products was a job,'' Ms. Fielden said, grinning at her husband's Mick Jagger mane.
Early in their marriage, when Mr. Fielden was hired as arts editor at Vogue, Ms. Fielden, who has a degree in social work, recalled telling a hairdresser about her husband's new job. ''He excitedly said, 'Oh, you're going to be a Vogue wife!' He was so excited that it was going to inspire the hair!''
She went on to describe the weirdness of spending an afternoon at Rikers Island for her work and then attending a Vogue party. Ms. Fielden may have felt ill-suited to being a Vogue wife -- though with her sleek cap of blond hair she certainly looks the part -- but Mr. Fielden had been grooming himself for a glamorous magazine role since he was a child. ''When I was growing up in Texas,'' he said, ''I saw the life of becoming a writer-slash-editor as something that wrapped up a kind of ability to be stylish on the page with an ability to be stylish in life.''
He pokes fun at himself using literary tropes, describing a rental he and Ms. Fielden took in Connecticut when she was pregnant with their first child as ''a Nick Carraway situation.'' Battling the house fire before the firefighters arrived, and forcing himself to think hard about what to save, was like a being in ''a John Cheever story.''
In the days and months that followed the fire, the Fieldens' neighbors in Connecticut, and their colleagues and friends in New York, rallied in startling, heartbreaking ways. It is true that many hair products accrued to Mr. Fielden, as did the contents of the shoe closet at Vogue to his wife. Jenna Lyons, J. Crew's designer, sent clothing, and so did David Lauren. But when Ms. Fielden recalled receiving garbage bags full of clothes in her children's sizes from neighbors she had barely met, she burst into tears.
''In the midst of this terrible loss, and having this life we'd created for ourselves burn up in 20 minutes,'' she said, ''of suddenly not having a pair of underwear to our name, just as suddenly you've got jeans, you've got shoes, you've got shampoo. All these neighbors, most of whom I didn't know, are going to Costco for us and taking our cats to the vet. I kept thinking, 'Would I have been this person?' ''
The Fieldens lived for a month with friends, and then moved into a rental apartment, followed by another rental in a farmhouse. They threw themselves into the quagmire of insurance and cleanup that follows a disaster. When it became clear that the most pragmatic thing to do was rebuild the house -- not an easy or joyful decision, they said, because what you really want to do after a catastrophic fire is walk away -- Robert Dean and Jesse Carrier, the architect and designer who had rehabbed the house in 2007, helped them with this rebuild.
''The object becomes, how do we create a place that reflects who we are but doesn't own us,'' Ms. Fielden said.
Her husband added: ''Or put us in debt.''
This time around, there is a lot more Ikea, Ms. Fielden said, than ''Jesse is probably used to.''
Built by James Evans, a protégé of Louis Kahn, the house had all the optimism of its period, as Mr. Dean put it recently, ''when architects thought they had made a breakthrough to a fresh new time.'' It had all the drawbacks as well: tiny bedrooms, cheap materials, awkward connecting spaces. So the new house, into which the Fieldens moved last summer, is a nearly perfect design -- open and light, yet private and safe -- seasoned as it is by their experience.
Not all their belongings were ruined. Mr. Fielden saved half of his books, along with artwork by Irving Penn and by his own children, and some family furniture. Ms. Fielden's Madam Alexander dolls, which Mr. Fielden's mother painstakingly cleaned up and now live in Eliza's room, have only slightly blackened eyes.
And on the coffee table in the living room, two architecture books -- one on Richard Neutra, one on Louis Kahn -- are stacked on top of each other. If you remove the topmost book, you can see its bright silhouette in the singed, smoky cover of the book below.

HEADLINE: Unremarkable Earnings Reports Keep the Markets Flat

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks were flat on Wall Street on Wednesday as the latest round of earnings reports failed to give investors an impetus to push the market's recent rally forward.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.22 points to close at 13,986.52, after trading slightly lower for most of the day. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.83 points, to 1,512.12. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 3.10 points, to 3,168.48.
Time Warner shares rose $2.05, or 4.1 percent, to $52.01 after the company said its net income rose 51 percent in the last three months of 2012 despite largely unchanged revenue. Marathon Oil fell 32 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $34.40 after its fourth-quarter net income fell 41 percent on higher exploration costs and taxes. 
Stocks are consolidating their gains after surging since the start of the year. The Dow closed above 14,000 on Friday for the first time since December 2007 and had its best January in almost two decades. The index is up 6.7 percent this year, and the broader S.& P. 500 is up 6 percent.
''There's no question that we need to take a pause and let reality catch up,'' said Jim Russell, an investment director at U.S. Bank.
The rally started when lawmakers reached a last-minute deal on New Year's Day to avoid a series of steep tax increases and spending cuts that would have kicked in at the beginning of the year. The gains have continued on optimism that the housing market recovery is gaining momentum and the job market is healing.
While the budget deal reached in January dealt with tax increases, it did not tackle spending cuts.
Automatic cuts to everything from military spending to popular benefit programs were scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, but were postponed until March 1. Mr. Russell said stocks were unlikely to rise strongly while talks heat up in Washington over the spending cuts, which are also referred to as sequestration.
The rally has pushed stocks close to nominal record levels. The Dow is 178 points off its milestone close in October 2007, and the S.& P. is 53 points below the high it achieved in the same month.
''We've had a really nice move up here. Whether we graduate to the next level, I think, is questionable,'' said Ben Schwartz, chief market strategist at Lightspeed Financial. ''We're looking for something to spark it.''
More than half of the companies in the S.& P. 500 have reported earnings for the fourth quarter, and analysts expect earnings for the period to rise 6 percent, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. That would put earnings growth on track to increase for the third consecutive quarter after slowing to 0.81 percent in the second quarter of 2012.
As investors have become more comfortable holding riskier assets like stocks, they have reduced their holdings in defensive investments like United States government bonds, sending yields on those bonds higher.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to its price, has risen more than 20 basis points since the start of the year and is trading close to its highest level since April. On Wednesday, the price of the 10-year note rose 11/32, to 97, while its yield fell to 1.96 percent, from 2.01 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Panetta Warns of Dire Consequences to Military From Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the wake of President Obama's appeal to Congress to stave off across-the-board military and domestic spending cuts, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned Wednesday that reductions from the automatic cuts would curtail American naval operations in the western Pacific by as much as a third and force one-month furloughs for as many as 800,000 Defense Department civilian employees starting this spring.
''This is not a game, this is reality,'' Mr. Panetta said emphatically in a speech at Georgetown University, one of his last as defense secretary, in which he blasted Congress for what he said was its failure to live up to its responsibilities. ''These steps would seriously damage the fragile American economy, and they would degrade our ability to respond to crisis precisely at a time of rising instability across the globe.'' 
He added, ''This is no way to govern the United States of America.''
He said Congress had created ''a self-made crisis'' and called the automatic cuts, called sequestration, ''legislative madness.'' He described the cuts, which are scheduled to take effect on March 1, as ''the most serious readiness crisis that this country is going to confront in over a decade.''
Mr. Panetta has been warning in dire terms for months about the effects of the across-the-board cuts, but defense budget analysts have viewed a number of his admonitions as hyperbole meant to prod Congress into making a budget deal. On Wednesday, analysts said Mr. Panetta meant it this time.
''These are real, legitimate impacts,'' said Todd Harrison, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a research group in Washington. Under sequestration, the Pentagon would have to cut nearly $50 billion, or about 9 percent, of current military spending by Oct. 1.
The potential cutbacks in naval operations in the western Pacific are particularly striking since they would undermine what the Obama administration has promoted as a critical part of its defense strategy -- a ''pivot,'' or rebalancing, of forces to the Asia-Pacific region to counter the increasing assertiveness of China's military.
Navy officials said Wednesday that they were considering cutbacks throughout the Seventh Fleet area of operations, which encompasses more than 48 million square miles and ranges from the Korean Peninsula to Guam to Australia and beyond. The officials said that the cuts would potentially reduce the number of ships, aircraft, joint military exercises and personnel in the region.
The furloughs would potentially begin as early as April and would cut one work day a week from the Pentagon's vast civilian work force for the next six months. The employees would face a corresponding 20 percent cut in pay, which Mr. Panetta said would have a substantial negative effect on the economy.
Mr. Panetta said the across-the-board cuts would also force the Pentagon to reduce training and maintenance for the Army, including putting two-thirds of active-duty brigade combat teams outside of Afghanistan at ''reduced readiness levels.'' Army officials said Wednesday that this would mean less training at Army bases like Fort Irwin, Calif., and Fort Polk, La., for troops prepared to respond to crises around the world.
The Pentagon's current annual operating budget for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 is $534 billion, with an additional $88 billion largely for the cost of the war in Afghanistan. The across-the-board cuts would apply to the total of $622 billion, along with some additional funds that have not been spent in previous years.
Mr. Panetta, a former chairman of the House Budget Committee and a former White House budget director under President Bill Clinton, has frequently expressed exasperation about the current climate on Capitol Hill.
''My fear is that there is a dangerous and callous attitude that is developing among some Republicans and some Democrats that these dangerous cuts can be allowed to take place in order to blame the other party for the consequences,'' he said.
But Mr. Harris of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments said that some of the potential military cuts might be good ones. The Pentagon, he said, was heading toward delaying purchases of furniture and disallowing ''nonessential travel'' for conferences.
''That's probably stuff they could do without anyway,'' he said. ''If it's nonessential travel, why were they doing it in the first place? There's going to be a ban on boondoggles.''

HEADLINE: Leader Signals G.O.P. Shift On Wages and College Aid

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
The Republican leader of the New York Senate said Wednesday that his caucus was open to raising the state's minimum wage and creating a private fund to help the children of illegal immigrants pay for college.
Assembly Democrats unsuccessfully pushed for both measures in the legislative session last year, when Republicans controlled the Senate. This year, after losing seats in the fall election, Republican senators formed a power-sharing coalition with an independent faction of Democrats to control the chamber.
The comments by the Republican leader, Senator Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, suggested his caucus was now willing to compromise on two important measures for their coalition partners. 
Mr. Skelos made his comments at a breakfast forum in Manhattan, where he took questions with Senator Jeffrey D. Klein of the Bronx, who leads the independent Democrats. Both men described the coalition as off to a strong start and predicted it would let the Senate produce legislation that would be impossible with just one party in control.
''We're still Democrats, but we think the best way to move a Democratic agenda is in a bipartisan fashion,'' Mr. Klein said of his caucus, adding, ''I think what we have to prove, time and time again, is that negotiation is not a dirty word -- it's an effective means of governing.''
For ''validation that we did the right thing,'' Mr. Skelos said, ''I think all of us just have to look to Washington, D.C., a town where Democrats and Republicans refuse to talk to one another and nothing ever gets done.''
The discussion with the Senate leaders, hosted by Crain's New York Business, offered a preview of some of the areas of agreement, and disagreement, that lie ahead in the legislative session.
A top priority for Democrats, including those who have joined Mr. Klein's breakaway caucus, is to create a private fund to provide scholarships so several state tuition-assistance programs can be open to students regardless of their immigration status.
Mr. Skelos, whose caucus did not embrace similar proposals last year, said Wednesday that legislation setting up a so-called Dream Fund ''has a possibility to pass'' this year. ''I think there is support from people that tend to be a little bit more conservative,'' he said, ''as long as it's private money put into the fund.''
On the wage issue, he suggested he was more willing to consider an increase this year than he was last year. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has proposed raising the state's hourly base wage to $8.75, from $7.25.
''Last year, the economy was in such a fragile state that it was the wrong time to do it,'' Mr. Skelos said, adding, ''What I think can be done this year -- the economy is improving -- is we can have a serious discussion if there's a way to implement it.''
The senators disagreed with Mr. Cuomo in some other areas. Mr. Skelos and Mr. Klein both said the Legislature should have a say over the locations of new casinos if the state's voters decide to legalize expanded casino gambling; the governor wants to give the casino siting authority to a new gambling commission.
Mr. Skelos said he believed that New York City should be considered a possible location for the first round of new casinos, if they are approved. Mr. Cuomo is pushing for the first three casinos to be built upstate in an effort to encourage tourism there. (Last month, the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said for the first time that he would consider a Las Vegas-style casino in the city.)
In a discussion of campaign finance reform, Mr. Skelos cast doubt on the governor's idea to create a system of public financing for state elections. He said that it would be too expensive and that the money would be better used on things like school aid.
Mr. Skelos also made light of Mr. Cuomo's enviable fund-raising under the existing campaign finance laws. The governor, who is up for re-election next year, reported in January that he had nearly $22.5 million on hand. Exaggerating the size of Mr. Cuomo's coffers, Mr. Skelos said, ''If I had $27 million in my campaign fund, I would probably be for public financing.''

HEADLINE: A Crack in the Ice Between Musicians and Management

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH

 BODY:
MINNEAPOLIS -- Sibelius's music is thought by many to reflect the long, deep winters of his native Finland. So if you're looking to Sibelius to shed a bit of warmth, it must be cold.
No, not the weather. (Well, that too.) What most needs thawing here is the frigid standoff between the board and management of the Minnesota Orchestra and its players, who have been locked out since Oct. 1, after they rejected management's proposal for a 32 percent cut in base pay and refused to make a counterproposal.
Mayor R. T. Rybak and Judy Dayton, one of the orchestra's most generous benefactors, tried to warm things up last Friday evening by presenting a special concert in the auditorium of the Minneapolis Convention Center to celebrate the ensemble's Grammy nomination for its Bis recording of Sibelius's Symphonies Nos. 2 and 5. Osmo Vanska, the orchestra's music director, conducted it for the first time since July in blazing performances of both works and, as an encore, Sibelius's rousing ''Finlandia.'' 
The recording is indeed superb, easily one of the best of 2012, and the concert represented it well, despite compromised circumstances. Some quarter of the players, more than 20, were substitutes, filling in for orchestra musicians who had left or taken other work during the lockout. (True, several were regular subs, including some from the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, which is also embroiled in a lockout but said to be closer to a settlement.)
What's more, the acoustics of the convention center's 3,000-seat all-purpose auditorium are not ideal for orchestral music, and some amplification was used. Still, the orchestra played like the truly great ensemble it has become in nine seasons under Mr. Vanska, and he managed to replicate the breathtaking pianissimos and other subtleties of the recording.
The convention center is where the orchestra had planned to play its concerts this season, with Orchestra Hall in the midst of a $50 million renovation that figures prominently in the players' discontent. Some of the change is integral to the ensemble's musical mission, intended, for example, to improve onstage acoustics. But much of it involves amenities, with an expansion of the lobby and new facilities designed to attract social and other events.
The players argue that the construction money should be directed toward their salaries, and some go so far as to suggest that the orchestra association plans to phase out the musical mission altogether. Management says that the money was raised specifically for the renovation, and that the added income the new features may bring is necessary to the ensemble's long-term welfare.
''Everything in the hall is for the betterment of the orchestra,'' said Michael Henson, the ensemble's president and chief executive.
No one questions the need for money. The orchestra reported deficits of $2.9 million in 2011 and $6 million in 2012. Previous budgets were balanced with large draws from the endowment.
The last players' contract, negotiated by the board in 2007, when there was no executive director, was based on optimistic assumptions that were immediately undercut by the recession. The current endowment, $141 million, falls some $90 million short of the 2007 prediction.
That five-year contract was to have given the players a 25 percent raise over its term, though with voluntary givebacks from them, the raises amounted to 19 percent. The current base pay is $113,000 annually, with most players making considerably more, for an average salary of $135,000. The proposed base pay is $78,000, with an average of $89,000.
The cuts that Mr. Henson is advocating would reduce the ensemble's annual budget to $26 million from $32 million. He refuses to consider making further inroads on the endowment, portions of which are restricted from large draws, saying that they would endanger the future of the orchestra.
Jon Campbell, the chairman, concurs. ''We cannot continue on that course,'' he said in a statement, ''or our endowment will be depleted by 2018.''
Management awaits a counterproposal from the players, but they have refused to accept the figures produced by a management-procured audit. They want an independent analysis that would look ahead as well as back.
''We're not throwing grenades,'' said Tim Zavadil, the chairman of the musicians' negotiating committee. ''We're just asking questions.''
The management recently agreed in principle to an independent study, but even if the players agree, it will take time. The orchestra's next concert still on the calendar is scheduled for Feb. 27, but no one expects it to happen.
Amid all the financial and procedural haggling in the time leading up to the Grammy concert, an angelic presence, Eriko Matsukawa, seemed to hover above the fray and at least momentarily direct attention to music and its importance.
Ms. Matsukawa, a blind English teacher, interpreter and translator from Sendai, Japan, fell in love with the orchestra during two years she spent at the University of Minnesota in the late 1990s. When she lost much of her hearing in the 2011 earthquake, she applied her own music therapy.
''I spent eight days listening to music for 24 hours,'' much of it played by the Minnesota Orchestra, she said. Her hearing came back.
When she learned of the lockout last year, she was heartbroken. Though not wealthy, she contributed more than $5,000 to the players. To ease her grief further, she learned origami and made 96 colorful paper cranes, one for each player, which the musicians now display proudly at their unofficial rehearsals and performances.
Ms. Matsukawa, who made the trip from Japan for the Grammy concert, was invited to sit among the players during rehearsals, and at the dress rehearsal on Friday morning she alternately beamed and wept.
So the question is how to get from here to there. Win or lose at the Grammys on Sunday, the orchestra will immediately put itself in the running for next year's awards on Monday, with the release of Sibelius's Symphonies Nos. 1 and 4 (also by Bis). But will another sequel follow?
No one here is making any guarantees about that or about more immediate concerns: Will the orchestra be around to open the renovated hall in the fall? Will it travel to Carnegie Hall next season for its recently announced four concerts of Sibelius, including all the symphonies? In short, will it survive?
It must, for Ms. Matsukawa's sake and for the sake of the world orchestral scene. Still, it is all as suspenseful as the enigmatic ending of that Sibelius Fifth Symphony.

HEADLINE: R.B.S. Fine a Burden for the Bank's Majority Owner, British Taxpayers

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
LONDON - The British government is taking aim at an unlikely target in the latest rate-rigging case: the British government.
The $612 million settlement that the Royal Bank of Scotland reached with authorities on Wednesday over rate manipulation will leave British taxpayers liable for part of the fine.
The government still owns a 82 percent stake in the bank, which was bailed out in 2008 during the height of the financial crisis. 
The British government finds itself on the other side of its case as well because the Financial Services Authority, the country's main financial regulator, has been part of the global investigation into the manipulation of benchmark rates like the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.
The case against the Royal Bank of Scotland has been politically charged after British politicians demanded that bankers' bonuses should be used to pay for the settlement.
"There is a legitimate concern that British taxpayers, who already have bailed out the bank, will be asked to pay for past mistakes at R.B.S.," said Pat McFadden, a British politician who is a member of the opposition party and part of the Parliament's Treasury select committee that oversees the country's finance industry. On Monday, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, also called on the bank to use bonuses to pay the Libor fine.
To help pay for the global settlement, the British bank said it would claw back past and present bonuses totaling $471 million from both the traders implicated in the rate-rigging scandal as well as from employees in the bank's operations, particularly its investment banking unit, which have not been part of the wrongdoing.
Bank officials said the clawbacks were related to the reputational damage caused to the bank, and would also cover potential future legal liabilities. But that money will be used primarily to pay the fines levied against the bank by the United States authorities.
The Financial Services Authority's share of the fine is expected not to come from the bonuses. The money will, in a sense, be recycled since it will go to the British government's coffers.
One of the casualties of the Libor scandal was John Hourican, head of the firm's investment banking division, who resigned on Wednesday. He will forgo past and present compensation worth a combined $14.1 million. Mr. Hourican, who took over the investment banking unit in 2008 and has not been implicated in the wrongdoing, will receive a one-time payout from the bank of around $1 million.
"This has been a soap opera for the last four years because of the ups and downs of this job," the bank's chairman, Philip Hampton, told reporters on Wednesday. "The bank was in a hell of a mess."
The taxpayer stake in the bank sets the latest deal apart from the other two big Libor settlements. Last summer, the British bank Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to settle accusations that it reported false rates. In December, the Swiss giant UBS struck a sweeping $1.5 billion deal with authorities in which its Japanese subsidiary pleaded guilty to felony wire fraud.
But despite the vested interest of taxpayers, the Financial Services Authority did not take the government's ownership stake into consideration when reaching the settlement, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The renewed scrutiny on the bank, however, could hinder the government's ability to sell its stake for a profit, as private investors remain wary of the bank's future liabilities. Since the bailout in 2008, the bank's shares have plummeted, and are currently trading around 32 percent below the initial purchase price.
As part of plans to sell the government's stake in the bank, Vince Cable, the British business secretary, said Royal Bank of Scotland should have been fully nationalized when it was bailed out in 2008. In a speech on Wednesday, he added that one option could be to return shares in the bank to British taxpayers.
"The early hope of reprivatization now looks a very long way off, unless at an unacceptable loss," Mr. Cable said.
Government officials have held preliminary discussions with a number of investors about selling stakes in the Royal Bank of Scotland, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The potential losses facing British taxpayers contrast with the $182 billion bailout of the American International Group in 2008. Over the last two years, A.I.G. issued a series of stock offerings to reduce the United States government's ownership, generating profit of around $22 billion for American taxpayers.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: United States Announces New Iran Sanctions

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
The United States blacklisted Iran's state broadcasting authority, Internet-policing agencies and a major electronics producer on Wednesday, an action that widened the American sanctions effort to pressure the Iranian government over not only its disputed nuclear program but also over the stifling of domestic dissent and access to information. 
A statement by the Treasury Department also announced the formal start of tightened restrictions, under a law passed last year, meant to severely inhibit Iran's already weakened ability to repatriate earnings from the sale of oil, its most important export.
David S. Cohen, the Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, who oversees the sanctions effort, said the actions were meant to ''intensify the economic pressure against the Iranian regime.''
He said, ''We will also target those in Iran who are responsible for human rights abuses, especially those who deny the Iranian people their basic freedoms of expression, assembly and speech.''
The new sanctions targeted Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, which is responsible for broadcast policy in Iran and oversees production at Iranian television and radio channels. Its director, Ezzatollah Zarghami, was included in the action.
Also targeted were the Iranian Cyber Police, which the Treasury Department described as an authority created three years ago to filter Web sites, monitor Internet behavior and hack into e-mail accounts of Iranians deemed to be subversive; and the Communications Regulatory Authority, which the Treasury Department described as an enforcer of Internet filtering and the blocking of Web sites deemed objectionable by the Iranian government.
In addition, the Treasury targeted Iran Electronics Industries, a producer of electronic systems and products, which the Treasury said was responsible for ''goods and services related to jamming, monitoring and eavesdropping.''
Under American sanctions laws, any United States property held by blacklisted companies and individuals is impounded, and they are prohibited from engaging in any transactions with American citizens.
Iran has been hurt by the accumulation of economic sanctions over the nuclear program, which the Iranians contend is for peaceful purposes despite suspicions by others, notably the United States, European Union and Israel, that the program is intended to give Iran the ability to make nuclear weapons. Talks on resolving the dispute, which have been stalled for more than six months, are set to resume in Kazakhstan on Feb. 26.
Iranian rights activists have a mixed view on the sanctions, which have halved Iran's oil exports, frozen the country out of the international banking system and caused a steep slide in the value of Iran's currency, the rial. Some activists worry that the consequences are hurting ordinary Iranians more than the country's leaders.
''While we are very much concerned about comprehensive economic sanctions that impact the livelihoods and well-being of average Iranian citizens, we welcome targeted sanctions against human rights violators and entities engaged in implementing repressive policies and censorship,'' said Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based advocacy group. ''In particular, the sanctions against IRIB are important because this entity is a leading institution in restricting flow of information and is directly implicated in human rights abuses.''

HEADLINE: City Plans to Allot First Part of Storm Aid to Housing and Businesses

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
New York City plans to spend its first $1 billion in federal money for Hurricane Sandy recovery on loans and grants to homeowners and businesses affected by the storm and efforts to protect public housing and critical infrastructure in the future, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Wednesday.
The money will come from a $51 billion disaster relief package that will be distributed to New York, New Jersey and other affected areas. The first installment for the city will total $1.77 billion; in his presentation on Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg did not say how he would use about $725 million of that initial payment. 
Under the plan, the city would spend $350 million on grants to low-, moderate- and middle-income owners of single-family homes -- up to 1,000 homeowners whose primary residences were destroyed by the storm, and up to 8,300 whose primary residences were damaged but not destroyed.
The city would spend $250 million on grants and low-interest loans to help repair up to 12,790 units of low-, moderate- and middle-income housing in multifamily homes and rental buildings damaged by the hurricane. It would spend $120 million to help fortify public housing against future storms, including putting permanent emergency generators in about 100 buildings.
For businesses affected by the storm, the city would offer $100 million in grants to up to 1,300 businesses.
Lastly, the city would spend $140 million on competitions to help utilities protect their networks against future storms, and to jump-start economic development in business districts heavily affected the storm.
The plan, which the mayor announced in a news conference at City Hall, will require federal approval, but he said his administration had already had ''extensive conversations'' with the federal housing secretary, Shaun Donovan, and was hopeful the plans would be approved. In the afternoon, Mr. Bloomberg appeared with Mr. Donovan at a Staten Island pizzeria to thank the Obama administration for releasing the aid so quickly.
Mr. Donovan also met with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in Manhattan to discuss the state's proposals for spending its share of hurricane relief money.
Mr. Bloomberg said it would take a few months to get federal approval for the programs and have them up and running, meaning the city would start taking applications for grants and loans in late April or early May.
But he defended the timing, saying the city had already made roughly $10 million in emergency loans available to businesses, and restored some combination of power, heat and hot water to 9,800 buildings.
By the standards of government, Mr. Bloomberg said, ''this is instantaneous.''
''The government doesn't back up a truck and dump bills on the ground,'' he continued.
Asked about Mr. Cuomo's proposal to offer to buy out homeowners in vulnerable coastal areas, Mr. Bloomberg said he appreciated the governor's efforts, but he expressed doubt that many New Yorkers would accept the offer.
''We're focusing on trying to get people back into their houses right now,'' he said, adding, ''People are very proud of their homes in New York, particularly in these communities, and an awful lot of them just want to stay there.''
Patrick Markee, a senior policy analyst at the Coalition for the Homeless, said that while Mr. Bloomberg's proposals were ''a start,'' they offered little near-term help for what he estimated were 2,000 to 3,000 households, many of them very low income, still living in hotels.
The best way to help them, Mr. Markee said, would be to distribute federal rental assistance vouchers, as was done after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf Coast. He said Congress had authorized Mr. Donovan to allocate recovery money for such aid, known as Section 8 vouchers.
''We think that that's frankly the most urgent need,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Wiped Out by Sandy, an Owner Sizes Up the Risk in Starting Over

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SATALINE

 BODY:
The Automobile Film Club of America has played a supporting role in New York-based film and television productions since 1993. It owns a fleet of vehicles -- including police cruisers, taxis and vintage automobiles -- that have squired stars and models in advertising shoots, TV shows and action films, including two Spider-Man movies and two ''Men in Black'' films. Woody Allen rented a 1964 Porsche Cabriolet for one movie and bought an Aston Martin that was totaled in another. ''When they crash something, they buy it,'' said Ralph Lucci, the owner.
THE CHALLENGE Deciding whether Mr. Lucci, 60, should put his house up as collateral to get a Small Business Administration loan in an attempt to revive his business, which is based in Stapleton, on Staten Island, half a block from the waterfront. In October, Hurricane Sandy's surge swamped the company's 6,000-square-foot lot and garage, submerging 57 cars in salt water. (Three vehicles that were on garage lifts avoided damage.) Lost were an ambulance worth $20,000, taxi cabs that cost more than $5,000 and a police crime scene unit vehicle valued at more than $16,000. 
''I have mechanics, they all say they're totally junk,'' Mr. Lucci said. ''It took five hours to destroy the business.''
After the storm, he spent weeks trying to start cars and ripping out rotting plaster board from his office. The $25,000 tow truck turns over but keeps slipping out of gear. He figures it will cost $400,000 to replace the cars and refurbish the office, the shop and the equipment. Unfortunately, the cars were insured only for liability -- adequate, he thought, for transporting cars from Point A to Point B. (Once they are on a movie set, his vehicles are insured by the production.)
THE BACKGROUND Mr. Lucci began supplying cars to the movie industry in 1975. Lucci Auto Props, a business he owned with his brother, was based in Red Hook, Brooklyn. After the two had a falling out, Mr. Lucci said, he walked away from the company and opened a shop that sold exotic cars. In the late '80s, he took a sales job with a luxury carmaker.
But he never lost interest in the movie business. In 1993, he opened Automobile Film Club, using a lot from the city's Economic Development Corporation. Mr. Lucci said he worked hard to get production companies the exact vehicles they wanted and stayed on set to make sure everything worked.
Over time, his business grew to 350 cars and 14 full-time employees, mostly secretaries and mechanics. The company survived the long drought after 9/11, when the mayor's office stopped issuing film permits. Mr. Lucci said a $45,000 S.B.A. loan helped him get by and has been paid back. In 2008, his best year, the business grossed $1.8 million.
The next year, his contract for the lot ended. Unable to find a large, affordable parcel for his fleet, Mr. Lucci downsized, buying one 10,000-square-foot lot and renting another. He sold hundreds of cars. The payroll dwindled to him and his wife.
During Hurricane Irene in 2011, Mr. Lucci said, 30 of his cars were damaged. Because he was carrying only liability insurance on his vehicles, he could not claim damages. The S.B.A. offered him a $6,000 loan at 4 percent interest. He thought the amount was too small, so he turned it down. The following year, he said, was a struggle.
When Hurricane Sandy hit, Mr. Lucci's vehicles were still insured for liability only. His office and garage were insured, as was $30,000 in equipment. But, like many business owners, he carried no protection against floodwaters or business interruption. After the storm, Mr. Lucci said, he received $5,800 for wind damage and nothing for what was destroyed by water.
THE OPTIONS Mr. Lucci has concluded he has two options. He can close the business for good, or he can borrow a lot of money and try to make another go of it.
New York City has been offering emergency loans to small businesses of up to $25,000, interest-free for the first six months and 1 percent interest for the 24 months after that. The city approved Mr. Lucci for such a loan, but he said it would barely make a dent. ''I couldn't even fix my office,'' he said.
A local office of the Small Business Administration has urged him to apply for a fixed-rate disaster loan. The agency has said businesses can obtain as much as $2 million at 4 percent interest for up to 30 years. One drawback? The S.B.A. told him he would be required to have flood insurance, and Mr. Lucci fears that could cost him up to $25,000 a year.
In addition, Mr. Lucci said he would have to put up the home he shares with his wife as collateral. He turns 61 in May. ''I don't know how I'm going to pay it back,'' he said. ''I'll finish paying when I'm 90. I might not be here.''
He knows that some businesses that get disaster loans end up defaulting -- according to the S.B.A., the government wrote off $153 million, or nearly 2.5 percent, of the $6 billion in loans made after Hurricane Katrina. If the Automobile Film Club is one of those businesses that never rebounds, he knows he could lose everything.
''I want to leave something to my family,'' he said. ''What if I lose my house if something doesn't go good?''
WHAT OTHERS SAY Kevin Langley, co-founder of Ellis Construction, in New Orleans, whose business was devastated by Hurricane Katrina: ''Use the $25,000 New York City emergency loan and the S.B.A. loan to purchase assets that can generate revenues. Consider working out of your house or a temporary office until you are able to rebuild the office with cash flows. Consider the salvage value of the existing damaged fleet and sell off any vehicles and assets that will not generate revenue or that aren't critical to the operation to generate cash.''
William Mathewson, president of Home Comfort Warehouse in White River Junction, Vt., took an S.B.A. loan to rebuild his alternative heating company after it was flooded in 2012: ''I think Mr. Lucci, at age 60, has to ask himself what does he want to be doing in five years. If he wants to retire, he should determine if his business will be sellable in five years and if the projected value is at least what his S.B.A. loan balance will be. He shouldn't take out a large loan, putting his home up for security only to find out the business is worth less than the loan. If that's the case, he might be better off shutting down now and going to work for someone else. I don't think he should spend three years losing money while he rebuilds the business.''
Rohit Arora, co-founder of Biz2Credit, which arranges small-business loans: "If he liquidates the business, what sort of work could he do? It would likely be very difficult for him to find a decent paying job at his age. In rebuilding his company, he knows what he is getting into. One thing he should not do is open again in a flooded area. After being hit twice, why open again in Staten Island when he can set up operations elsewhere in New York City?''
THE RESULTS Offer your thoughts on the You're the Boss blog at nytimes.com/boss. Next week, on the blog and on this page, we will give an update on what Mr. Lucci is planning to do.

HEADLINE: Smoking, Once Used to Reward, Faces a Ban in Mental Hospitals

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

 BODY:
MANDEVILLE, La. -- Annelle S., 64, who has paranoid schizophrenia, took an urgent drag on a cigarette at a supervised outdoor smoke break at Southeast Louisiana Hospital.
''It's mandatory to smoke,'' she explained. ''It's a mental institution, and we have to smoke by law.''
That was 18 months ago, and Annelle's confusion was understandable. Until recently, Louisiana law required psychiatric hospitals to accommodate smokers -- unlike rules banning smoking at most other health facilities. The law was changed last year, and by March 30, smoking is supposed to end at Louisiana's two remaining state psychiatric hospitals.
After decades in which smoking by people with mental illness was supported and even encouraged -- a legacy that experts say is causing patients to die prematurely from smoking-related illnesses -- Louisiana's move reflects a growing effort by federal, state and other health officials to reverse course. 
But these efforts are hardly simple given the longstanding obstacles.
Hospitals often used cigarettes as incentives or rewards for taking medicine, following rules or attending therapy. Some programs still do. And smoking was endorsed by advocates for people with mental illness and family members, who sometimes sued to preserve smoking rights, considering cigarettes one of the few pleasures patients were allowed.
New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that the nearly 46 million adults with mental illness have a smoking rate 70 percent higher than those without mental illness, and consume about a third of the cigarettes in the country, though they make up one-fifth of the adult population.
People with psychiatric disorders are often ''smoking heavier, their puffs are longer and they're smoking it down to the end of the cigarette,'' said William Riley, chief of the Science of Research and Technology Branch at the National Cancer Institute. With some diagnoses, like schizophrenia, rates are especially high.
A report by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors said data suggested that people with the most serious mental illnesses die on average 25 years earlier than the general population, with many from smoking-exacerbated conditions like heart or lung disease.
Now more treatment facilities are banning smoking, with some finding it easier than expected. Others still allow it, usually outside on their grounds during scheduled times. About a fifth of state hospitals are not smoke-free, a survey issued in 2012 by the State Mental Health Program Directors association found. Occasionally, hospitals that banned smoking have reinstated it to avoid losing patients.
Moreover, smoking is so deeply ingrained that smoke-free hospitals can only dent the problem; many patients are now hospitalized only for short stints and resume smoking later.
New research suggests scientific underpinnings for some of the affinity, said Dr. Nora D. Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Nicotine has antidepressant effects and, for people with schizophrenia, helps dampen extraneous thoughts and voices, she and other experts said.
Other chemicals in cigarette smoke set off a perilous cycle, causing some medications to be metabolized faster, making them less effective and allowing symptoms to return. Because patients feel sicker, they may seek even more comfort from nicotine. ''You may think, 'Well, I need to smoke more,' '' said Dr. Steven Schroeder, a professor of health and health care at the University of California, San Francisco.
Then, as smoking increases, ''blood levels of their medication go down, and they end up back in the hospital,'' said Judith Prochaska, an associate professor of medicine at Stanford University's Prevention Research Center.
Socially, smoking provides ''cover rituals for patients having psychiatric symptoms,'' said Dr. Rona Hu, medical director of the acute psychiatric inpatient unit at Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto, Calif. ''You tamp the box, you kind of play with the lighter, you can exhale and look into the middle distance and not look like you're hallucinating.''
Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the C.D.C., said hospitals had historically resisted going smoke-free, fearing it would interfere with treatment. ''In my very first job as an aide in a psychiatric hospital,'' he said, ''if patients behaved better they got additional cigarettes.''
Southeast Louisiana Hospital used such practices when Annelle was there. (The hospital was recently privatized, and she is at another state facility.) Patricia Gonzales, a former director of hospital services for the Office of Behavioral Health in Louisiana, said staff members would say, for example, '' 'John, if you don't get up and get the bed made, you're not going to get your morning smoke break.' ''
Smoke breaks were even used to persuade patients to get medical care. ''We had a couple of patients who needed important CAT scans and M.R.I.'s, and that's how we did it,'' said Dr. Schoener LaPrairie, a former staff psychiatrist.
At hospitals across the country, staff members asked tobacco companies for free cigarettes. In 2000, Dr. Elizabeth Roberson, then a psychiatrist at Hawaii State Hospital, wrote to R. J. Reynolds, seeking donated cigarettes for a patient. ''Whenever he runs out of cigarettes he becomes highly agitated to the point where he has seriously injured staff and other patients,'' she wrote. ''Providing a cigarette is generally much more effective at decreasing agitation than most medications I can provide.''
Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a psychiatrist and advocate for people with mental illness, wrote such a letter as inpatient psychiatric medical director at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., in 1980. ''We often said we could get patients to do almost anything for cigarettes,'' he said in an interview.
He wrote R. J. Reynolds requesting ''5,000 cigarettes a week'' because federal regulations had ''abruptly terminated the hospital's practice of providing a modest number of cigarettes.'' The company denied his request, saying it received so many, it ''cannot possibly grant all of them.''
A 2007 article by Dr. Prochaska and others said documents suggested that the tobacco industry encouraged smoking among people with mental illness through advertising and industry-supported research showing that nicotine elevates mood. It mentioned a 1986 magazine advertisement with a doubled image of a pack of Merit cigarettes, under the word ''Schizophrenic,'' that said, in part: ''Big taste, lower tar, all in one. For New Merit, having two sides is just normal behavior.'' Dr. Prochaska's article said it was unclear if that language was meant to appeal to people with mental illness or all consumers.
David Howard, an R. J. Reynolds spokesman, declined to comment. David Sylvia, a spokesman for Philip Morris USA, said it was difficult to comment ''on stuff that was reported to take place multiple decades ago.'' Regarding the 1986 ad, he said the company did not ''have anybody who can delve back into what they were thinking about when they developed that Merit ad.''
Until relatively recently, many relatives and advocates described smoking as an enjoyable personal liberty for patients. In Maine and Connecticut, advocates and patients went to court in 2006 and 2007 in unsuccessful attempts to prevent tobacco bans in state psychiatric hospitals.
''We ignored it for way too long,'' said Dr. Kenneth Duckworth, medical director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the country's largest mental health advocacy organization. ''We were facilitating it.''
The organization changed its official policy only in 2009. Earlier, it advocated that treatment centers accommodate smokers unable to stop, even if state laws needed to be changed. Now, it supports smoke-free facilities, noting that ''smoking has been inappropriately accepted and even encouraged in therapeutic settings.''
Policies in private and community facilities, which treat more patients than state hospitals, vary. Some states ban smoking only in state hospitals, as New Jersey did in 2009.
The experience of Princeton House Behavioral Health, a private New Jersey hospital, illustrates the issue's complexity. In 2006, Princeton House banned smoking. And although some patients smuggled in cigarettes, ''there weren't as many problems as people thought,'' said Jonathan Krejci, director of clinical programs.
But the ban began threatening the hospital's financial viability because prospective patients were going to competitors that were not smoke-free.
''They would say, 'Where else can I go where they'll allow smoking?' '' said Richard Wohl, senior vice president. Eighteen months after the ban began, Princeton House lifted it. Now, it has four daily ''fresh air'' breaks in outdoor courtyards where patients can smoke, Dr. Krejci said.
''You have to understand,'' said Gary Snyderman, director of nursing services. ''We are a health care facility, so we're not happy about it.''
Some hospitals have had success offering nicotine patches and cessation programs. After the Veterans Affairs hospital in Palo Alto banned smoking, fewer patients were restrained for behavioral problems, and attempts like sticking aluminum foil in electrical outlets to light cigarettes stopped, said Dr. John Brooks, former director of inpatient psychiatry there.
And hospitals have found that while smoking calms some patients, allowing smoke breaks can increase agitation because ''everybody is only thinking of when they can get that next cigarette,'' said Joe Parks, medical director of the Department of Mental Health in Missouri. He said patients pressure others for cigarettes, including by ''bribing with sexual favors.''
Douglas Tipperman, lead public health adviser on tobacco prevention for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, said surveys showed that smokers with mental illness often want to quit, and can with extra support. But they face stiff obstacles, including stress and fewer resources.
At Southeast Louisiana Hospital, where hospital officials requested that patients' last names be withheld, Sarah W., 55, who has paranoid schizophrenia, smoked 16 cigarettes a day, buying a carton of Hat's Off at the canteen weekly. Suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure, she tried quitting, sometimes gradually, and ''sometimes I cold turkey,'' she said. Neither worked.
Dr. Torrey, the psychiatrist and advocate, said his sister, who had schizophrenia, died of lung disease undoubtedly related to her intense smoking. Still, he said, ''if they really have no other pleasures,'' as he believes was true for his sister, ''I personally would let them smoke, even though I understand that it hastens their death.''
In San Francisco, one of Dr. Hu's patients, Garrett Masuda, has been on a roller coaster with smoking for years. After receiving a diagnosis of schizophrenia as a graduate student, he became a two-pack-a-day smoker. Smoking lessens two voices ''speaking to me in a whisper,'' he said, and calling him ''mean things, like loser.''
Mr. Masuda was able to hold jobs in retail stores, but smoking interfered with his schizophrenia medication, Risperdal, and led to his being rehospitalized twice, Dr. Hu said.
One hospitalization occurred after he refused to fly home from a visit to Vancouver, convinced ''people on the plane were out to get me''; another when he feared ''someone was out to break into the house and hurt me,'' he said.
Dr. Hu increased his Risperdal, ''chasing the dose up and up because of the smoking,'' she said.
But while Mr. Masuda had to stop smoking at Stanford Hospital, which became successfully smoke-free in 2007, he resumed smoking after he left. Even when he began working at a medical foundation with a tobacco ban, he got around it by ''hot boxing,'' smoking in his car, windows rolled up, in the parking lot.
And ratcheting up his Risperdal dose caused problems: sleepiness and involuntary eye movements. But when Dr. Hu tried medications less affected by smoking, they worked less well. And when she combined lower-dose Risperdal with other medications, eye-rolling movements continued, interfering with Mr. Masuda's job as a Macy's cashier. Customers became unnerved, and so did he as his internal voices criticized them.
Desperate, Mr. Masuda moved in with his parents and mostly quit smoking. But he was so highly stressed that he took excessive breaks at work, and was fired. Now he is 37, unemployed and smoking. He hopes he can stop, he said, because he knows smoking ''will just make it worse.''

HEADLINE: Profound Weight of Layoffs Is Seen in Work Trends Survey

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Layoffs have touched nearly every American household in some fashion over the last few years, according to new survey data to be released Thursday by the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University.
While about 8 percent of Americans are unemployed, nearly a quarter of Americans say they were laid off at some point during the recession or afterward, according to the survey. More broadly, nearly eight in 10 say they know someone in their circle of family and friends who has lost a job.
''This to me is why the recession was so all-consuming and is likely to influence the American psyche,'' said Cliff Zukin, a public policy and political science professor at Rutgers and co-author of the report. ''Almost everyone, four out of five, were directly or one step removed from unemployment and all that goes with it financially, socially, psychologically.'' 
The survey presented a bleak view of the economic future.
A majority of Americans say they think it will be at least six years before the economy is made whole again, if ever. Three in 10 said the economy would never fully recover from the Great Recession.
''Despite significant improvements in the nation's labor market, American workers' concerns about unemployment, the job market, job security and the future of the economy have not changed much since we conducted a similar survey in August 2010,'' the report said.
Just a third of Americans surveyed in this poll, conducted from Jan. 9-16, said they thought the economy would be better next year, the same share that said so two years earlier.
Of those laid off in recent years, nearly a quarter said they still had not found a job. Re-employment rates for older workers have been particularly bad, with nearly two-thirds of unemployed people 55 and older saying they actively sought a job for more than a year before finding one or had still not found work.
Not surprisingly, those who are unemployed are especially downbeat about many economic issues in addition to their own finances. Of those who were jobless and looking for work, 31 percent said their jobless benefits had run out and 58 percent said they were concerned their benefits would run out before they found work.
Of those who have found work, nearly half say their current job is a step down from the one they lost, and a slim majority say they earn less than they did in their previous job. A quarter of those re-employed said they thought that the hit to their standard of living would be permanent.
The reliance on one's personal network and savings rather than the social safety net showed up frequently in the survey data.
More people reported borrowing money from friends and family than reported using food stamps. A third cut back on doctors' visits or medical treatment. A quarter of the unemployed said they had enrolled in retraining programs of some kind; half of them reported paying for the education on their own or through family assistance. Twenty-three percent received some type of government financing for their training programs.
Unemployed workers were more likely than employed workers to say that the government is primarily responsible for helping the jobless. But even then, a majority of the unemployed thought that workers and employers were more responsible for getting people back to work than the government was.
Americans over all were also somewhat less critical of bankers this time than they were two years earlier. About one in three (35 percent) respondents attributed high unemployment levels to the actions of Wall Street, compared with 45 percent in 2010.
Americans were most likely to attribute high unemployment to cheap foreign labor. Four in 10 also said they believed illegal immigrants were taking Americans' job opportunities -- which does not bode well for political support for an amnesty program now being discussed in Washington.
Most people surveyed lost at least some of their savings. Asked about their financial health, six in 10 Americans said their finances would not improve in the next few years; just 16 percent said their family finances were already back to prerecession levels or suffered no loss in the first place.
More educated, better-off people were substantially more likely to report being as financially secure as they were before the recession began.
Responses are based on an online survey conducted by GfK using a nationally representative sample of 1,090 adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.

HEADLINE: Selling Jewelry and a Lifestyle, a Snapshot at a Time

BYLINE: By CAROLINE TELL

 BODY:
For those who suffer from #fomo (fear of missing out), it's a good idea to avoid the Instagram feed of Dannijo, a fashion jewelry line favored by downtown socialites and celebrities.
The founders of Dannijo -- Danielle Snyder, 27, and her sister, Jodie Snyder, 30 -- are known to post photographs of themselves sunning in Mexico, hobnobbing with billionaires like Richard Branson, and palling with Cynthia Rowley at Art Basel Miami Beach.
That their boho-chic jewelry -- made of oxidized metals, dotted with colorful stones and studded with shards of crystal -- is peripheral in the photos is precisely the point. 
''The No. 1 one thing people say to us is, 'You have great social media,' '' Danielle said. ''People want to see jewelry, but they don't want to be promoted to all the time. If we're at Art Basel or on vacation, people want to see that. It's like flipping through a magazine. They want to see the lifestyle.''
The Snyders are jeweler designers by trade, but it is largely through social media that Dannijo went from a few homemade necklaces, strung together in an East Village apartment, to a top seller at Bergdorf Goodman and Shopbop.com.
Using Instagram and Twitter, the sisters have become editors of a cool-kid style (documenting their way through Paris Fashion Week, South by Southwest, Coachella, St. Bart's and Montauk) with models, actresses and blogger friends in tow.
''They're cool, young, fun girls that are just showing what they're doing at night, places they're going, and then, of course, wearing their jewelry,'' said Hilary Rhoda, a model who has vacationed with Danielle in Jamaica.
Social media allows them to create an intimate bond with customers. Every post on Twitter and Instagram is composed by the sisters themselves, unlike at larger fashion brands, which often farm out the task to digital advertising agencies.
''It helps when a brand puts itself out there in a human and personal way with character,'' said Jack Dorsey, a founder of Twitter, who met Danielle on an airplane going to Coachella, in Indio, Calif., and has since become a friend. ''Often brands are dehumanized a bit and you forget who's behind it.''
In an inventive twist, the sisters also use clever hashtags like #armparty, which they appended to Instagram and Twitter posts as a way for their tech-savvy fans to share the same fashion impulses (in this case, a look that celebrates mismatched arm bracelets). The sisters say it revved up their online bracelet business. Indeed, more than 230,000 instances of #armparty can be found on Instagram, including those used by Michael Kors and Lucky Magazine.
Another hashtag they popularized, #putabibonit, refers to their line of colorful bib necklaces. Their fans picked up on the hashtag, and the sisters estimate it has increased online bib sales by 20 percent.
While the Dannijo sisters enjoy social media, jewelry has always been their passion. They were raised in Jacksonville, Fla., where they taught themselves to make jewelry from their father's old medical tools. After college, they made their way to New York City, Jodie in 2005 and Danielle in 2007, seeking glamorous jobs in fashion.
Jodie got a job running the private-label department at Sam Edelman, a footwear company. Danielle worked in sales at Penny Preville, the jewelry firm. They found the jobs uninspiring, so they returned to their childhood love.
From the fourth floor walk-up they shared on St. Marks Place, they designed their first collection, inspired by ''Star Wars.'' It featured 15 necklaces, each with a twisted, silver-plated piece strung around the back and layered with chains. They started cold-calling department stores, eventually landing a meeting with Bergdorf Goodman in 2008. The store took the pieces on consignment, priced them from $250 to $550 and sold every one.
''We didn't know anyone in the industry, we were in the heart of the recession, and people said we were crazy to start a jewelry company,'' Jodie said. But the timing turned out to be fortuitous. ''Jewelry became the thing to invest in,'' she said. ''Women already had the black dress and were using accessories to complement what they owned.''
The Snyders' biggest break came before they made a sale. In 2007, they spotted Natalie Morales, a ''Today'' show anchor, in a store. Danielle approached her, and the two began chatting. Two days later, Ms. Morales wore Dannijo on the show, and in 2009, she featured the sisters in a segment about young entrepreneurs.
''That's when I realized I'm not afraid to walk over to people and start talking to them, which has become one of my biggest contributions to this brand,'' Danielle said.
Indeed, the sisters seem to put the ''social'' in social media, and are fearless when it comes to introducing themselves to boldface names. Brooklyn Decker followed Dannijo on Twitter before reaching out to the sisters to borrow jewelry for a press junket. ''They invited me into their showroom, and I spent hours there,'' Ms. Decker said. ''We became fast friends. They've been down to my home in Austin.''
The celebrity chef Katie Lee met the sisters last April at Dannijo's showroom in the meatpacking district. By November, they were surfing together in the Caribbean. It was documented, of course, on Instagram.
Other friends include Natalie Portman, who served as an ambassador at a party for a charity Danielle helped found; Alexandra Richards, who appeared in a Dannijo look book; and Questlove, who D.J.'ed at their collection preview last September. (Rashida Jones is hosting their presentation Thursday at the Jane hotel.)
As the Snyders expand the Dannijo business, fans can keep up with their every move over social media. A handbag and ready-to-wear line is planned, as are more trips around the world and A-list parties.
''There are aspects of our business that have put Dannijo more in the public eye, and being into social media is one of them,'' Jodie said. ''But we attribute a lot of our success to being young and open-minded and being part of a changing landscape of marketing and brand building.''

HEADLINE: With A.L.S. in Family, Chief at Bloomberg Joins Fight

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS; Sheelagh McNeill contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Daniel L. Doctoroff watched in pain as his father developed a limp one day, was found to have Lou Gehrig's disease, and died within two years. Then an uncle also developed symptoms of the same disease, and died soon after.
Now Mr. Doctoroff, like many other relatives of Lou Gehrig's disease victims, worries that he or his children may someday develop the illness. 
But unlike many, he is in a position to try to do something about it. At a time when scientists are making rapid gains in the genetic roots of many diseases, Mr. Doctoroff, a former deputy mayor and private equity investor, is working with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and a private equity director, David M. Rubenstein, to put together a $25 million package of donations to support research to try to cure this rare and usually fatal degenerative neurological illness.
''This is a devastating disease,'' Mr. Doctoroff said in an interview this week in the glass high-rise on the Upper East Side that houses Bloomberg L.P., the mayor's media and financial information company, where Mr. Doctoroff is now chief executive. ''Up to now, there's been basically no hope. I have the resources, and I think it's my obligation to do that.''
The gift is part of a wave of investment based on the booming field of genomic analysis. The money will go to a project called Target A.L.S., a consortium of at least 18 laboratories, including ones at Columbia and at Johns Hopkins, the mayor's alma mater, working to find biological ''targets,'' like gene mutations, and the biochemical changes they cause in the spinal cord, that could be used to test potential drug therapies for the disease, formally known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
It comes on top of a previous $15 million gift by Mr. Doctoroff, Bloomberg Philanthropies and other donors. By comparison, the National Institutes of Health, the single largest source of research financing for the disease, expects to give $44 million in 2013.
This is not Mr. Bloomberg's first time supporting charitable causes that are dear to his close associates. The mayor quietly gave at least $1 million to put the name of his top deputy mayor, Patricia E. Harris, on a new academic center at her alma mater, Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa.
Mr. Doctoroff said the conversation about A.L.S. in which he got Mr. Bloomberg involved ''lasted about five seconds.'' He declined to say what share of the money each of the three donors was giving.
Mr. Rubenstein, a founder of the Carlyle Group, said Wednesday that he had long been fascinated with A.L.S. because of its association with Gehrig, the baseball player who died of it. He wondered why more than 70 years later so little progress had been made in treating it.
He said he jumped at the chance to join in because he thought that A.L.S. research was underfinanced owing to the rarity of the disease, and that even a small amount of money could make a big difference.
In the Bloomberg administration, where he was deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding from 2002 to 2008, Mr. Doctoroff was best known for his dogged -- and ultimately dashed -- attempt to bring the 2012 Olympics to New York City. (London got the Games.) Now that he has left City Hall, he no longer rides his bike to work -- he says the 2.6-mile route from the Upper West Side to his office is too short -- but he sometimes runs.
At Bloomberg, he sits in front of a conference room with walls of hot-pink glass, while carp swim in a giant fish tank nearby. He keeps no family photos or other personal mementos on his desk, and talking about his family's disease history does not seem easy for him.
A.L.S. is rare, with about 2 new cases diagnosed a year per 100,000 people, according to the A.L.S. Association. A vast majority of cases are ''sporadic,'' in people who have no family history, while only 5 to 10 percent of cases are inherited. There appear to be no racial, ethnic or socioeconomic predispositions.
There is some speculation about environmental factors, like exposure to toxic chemicals and high physical activity that athletes might endure, ''but nothing firm,'' said Christopher E. Henderson, a researcher at Columbia and the Target A.L.S. project's scientific director. Some researchers suspect a link between A.L.S. and head trauma suffered by professional football players.
Mr. Doctoroff's father, Martin, an appeals court judge in Michigan, received the diagnosis in 2000 and died in 2002. One of Martin Doctoroff's brothers, Michael, was found to have the disease in 2009 and died in 2010.
''When my father contracted the disease and passed away, it was very easy to chalk it up to bad luck,'' Mr. Doctoroff said. ''When my uncle got it, it obviously had broader implications.''
Given his family history, Mr. Doctoroff estimates that there is a 50-50 chance that he has the gene, C9orf72, that could lead to A.L.S. But he has chosen not to be tested, which would have implications not just for him but for his three children. ''It's very personal, but I'm not sure that I want to know,'' he said.
Even when family members develop the disease, it can occur at vastly different ages, so he could still be in suspense even after testing. ''Assuming you have the gene, you don't know when you would actually get the disease,'' he said. His uncle was 71. His father was 66. He is now 54.

HEADLINE: Two-Tax Rise Tests Wealthy In California

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
PALO ALTO, Calif. -- It is getting awfully expensive to be a millionaire in California.
With the new year, big earners are confronting a 51.9 percent federal-state income tax hit on earnings over $1 million, the result of a confluence of new tax-the-rich levies imposed by California and Congress in the closing days of 2012. That is officially the highest in the nation. And at 13.3 percent, the top-tier California income tax is, in addition to being higher than any other state, the steepest it has been since World War II.
Though no one expects traffic jams at 30,000 feet as panicked millionaires make for the state line, the wealthy are once again grumbling about abandoning California for less punishing tax climates. Phil Mickelson, the golfer who collects purses in excess of $1 million, suggested that he might become the latest in a line of athletes and entertainment figures, among them Tiger Woods, who left California for states like Florida, which has no personal income tax.
The Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, firing a new shot in an old interstate war, began putting radio advertisements on the air in California this week summoning burdened businesses his way. ''I have a message for California business: Come check out Texas,'' Mr. Perry said. 
Blood, it seems, is in the water.
''Are you looking to leave California because of the recent tax increase?'' a CNN Money correspondent posted online in an inquiry this week. ''You could be profiled in an upcoming story.''
For all its many attributes, California has long been a state defined by high taxes and the people who hate them; conservatives here were successfully organizing against taxes before anyone heard of the Tea Party. Yet this milestone -- or perhaps millstone -- has sneaked up as an unpleasant surprise for the rich, a cloud in the sky at a time when the state budget has come back into balance (in no small part because of the aforementioned tax increase) and the state economy seems to be snapping back to life.
Mr. Mickelson later apologized for discussing the topic, though that did not prevent Mr. Perry from sending him a message on Twitter: ''Hey Phil ... Texas is home to liberty and low taxes ... we would love to have you as well!!'' Conservatives and antitax activists have cited Mr. Mickelson's remarks as evidence of what they have long argued are the costs California pays for having such a high tax burden.
''It's definitely the highest in the United States,'' said David Kline, a vice president of the California Taxpayers Association, a taxpayers' advocacy organization. ''What we like to point out to people is that there are states with absolutely no personal income tax -- so if you moved from California to Florida, and you are in a high-income bracket, you are automatically giving yourself a 13.3 percent raise.''
For what it is worth, California's big earners can deduct their state taxes from their federal returns, or at least for the time being: were Congress to repeal that deduction, which is now under discussion, the actual tax burden would be 52.9 percent. The top rate in California has been as high as 15 percent and as low as 6 percent, and the combined rate has been higher at times, like when federal income taxes spiked to pay for wars.
Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat who urged voters to approve the latest state income tax surcharge, dismissed Mr. Perry's poaching as political trickery, suggesting that high earners consider other factors in deciding where to locate. ''People invest their money where these big things have occurred,'' he told reporters. ''The ideas, the structures, the climate, the opportunity is right here on the Pacific Rim.''
Some of those earners seem at least resigned to the tax burden as a cost of being able to live in California rather than, say, Texas.
''I am happy to pay my taxes, whatever they are: no problem with me,'' said David Geffen, the entertainment mogul, who owns estates on the oceanfront in Malibu and on the hedge-lined streets of Beverly Hills. He said he thought it could hurt the business climate, but added, ''I don't think anybody of means is really going to move because of it.''
Cristobal Young, an assistant professor of sociology with the Center on Poverty and Inequality at Stanford, conducted a study last fall that concluded that tax rates had little effect on where millionaires choose to live.
Mr. Young said he suspected that few, if any, millionaires would leave or stay away because of the tax increase. More likely, he said, they would find ways of reducing their tax burden, with loopholes or income avoidance, or simply reduce their work.
''I suspect the accountants are busier this year, but I don't think the moving companies are getting a boost,'' Mr. Young said. ''Moving out of state is actually one of the most costly responses they could make. California's high-income earners are clustered in coastal cities far from state borders. Moving to Nevada or Texas or Florida is a very big life change, and means leaving behind family, friends, colleagues and business connections.''
The burden represents a political reality both here and in Washington: while there might be a new willingness to raise taxes to deal with governmental shortfalls, the target of those new taxes is the wealthy.
In December, Congress agreed to increase federal income taxes on income over $400,000 a year. In November, California voters approved the temporary state income tax surcharge, establishing the top marginal tax rate at 12.3 percent. There is also is a 1 percent millionaire surcharge for mental health programs.
The median rate paid by average taxpayers is significantly lower. Still, this new round of upper-income taxes lifted California to the top of the tax mountain, said Gerald Prante, an economist at Lynchburg College in Virginia, who published a report on marginal tax rates across the country. Right behind California is New York City, which has a 51.7 percent marginal rate. (The rest of New York State has a slightly lower rate because the city imposes a personal income tax.)
Hawaii ranks third, and seven states do not have a personal income tax at all.
Mr. Prante also said there was little evidence that the high taxes he charted had chased anyone out of California. ''Has one person ever moved?'' he said. ''Obviously, yes. But how big an effect is it? Taxes aren't the only thing that matters when people move.''
But Bradley R. Schiller, a professor of economics at the University of Nevada, Reno, said the argument that high taxes were not pushing people defied the obvious. The French actor Gerard Depardieu recently left his home country to avoid what he described as a severe increase in income taxes, drawing criticism from France and his fellow citizens. Accordingly, Mr. Schiller said, high-profile millionaires are unlikely to want to draw attention to decisions to leave for states with lower taxes, thus making the migration harder to track.
''Taxes have to be a very important of the equation,'' Mr. Schiller said. ''If you are talking about an income tax of 13 percent on a millionaire in California and an income tax rate of zero percent on a millionaire in Nevada, to argue that it doesn't affect a millionaire's locations decision is to say all millionaires must be stupid.''
Mr. Schiller, who was born in California, now lives in Nevada.

HEADLINE: U.S. Ratchets Up An Economic War Against Tehran

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK and DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- All over this city of 12 million people, high-rises are under construction, local engineers and Chinese contractors are rushing to finish a multilevel highway, and the streets are lined with billboards promoting the latest tablets and washing machines made by South Korean companies like Samsung and LG. Supermarkets are fully stocked, and it seems as if new restaurants and fast food joints are opening up every day, and never lacking for customers.
In short, you would not know that oil exports from Iran have dropped by a million barrels a day, and that the free fall in the currency has caused huge inflation -- a result of American- and European-led sanctions as well as economic mismanagement by the Iranian government. The West escalated the economic war another notch on Wednesday, imposing a new set of restrictions intended to force Iran into what amounts to a form of barter trade for oil, because payments for oil deliveries can no longer be sent to accounts inside Iran.
A senior Obama administration official called the latest step ''a significant turning of the screw,'' repeating the administration's four-year argument that the mullahs here face a ''stark choice'' between holding on to their nuclear program and reviving their oil revenue, the country's economic lifeblood. 
But there is little confidence among American officials in Washington -- and little evidence on the streets of Tehran -- that even newly stringent sanctions have much chance of forcing Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, into striking the deal that most Americans and Europeans, and even some Israelis, say could defuse the crisis.
The sanctions, while the source of constant complaint and morbid jokes, have not set off price riots or serious opposition to the Iranian government. In fact, the past year has not been all that bad, as Saeed Ranchian, 39, a shopkeeper peddling perfumes in Tehran's Grand Bazaar, said the other day while he was sipping tea and as droves of shoppers strolled by on newly paved sidewalks. Surrounded by colognes with elaborate foreign names like ''Le Chevalier Primero,'' Mr. Ranchian admitted that with prices doubling and Iran's currency crashing, ''you would expect people to buy less.''
''But in Iran, when prices go up, people start buying more, fearing even higher prices,'' he said, adding with a laugh that the country's economy ''has rules that no one understands.''
Obama administration officials were disturbed by a new analysis, prepared for the president and his staff, that paints a picture of the supreme leader as so walled off from what is happening with his country's oil revenues that he is telling visitors that the sanctions are hurting the United States more than they are hurting Iran.
''The people may be suffering in Iran,'' one senior official involved in Iran strategy said last week, ''but the supreme leader isn't, and he's the only one who counts.''
The outlines of a nuclear deal have been clear for months: an Iranian agreement to limit the number of centrifuges that produce uranium, a cap on the amount of fuel in Iranian hands, and an agreement to ship its most potent stockpiles -- the stuff that can be quickly converted to bomb fuel -- out of the country. It would also have to agree to expose its history of nuclear work, including any on weapons technology, which it has refused to show international inspectors. In return, Iran would get an acknowledgment that it has a right to peaceful nuclear enrichment, and a gradual lifting of the sanctions. The Iranians have insisted that the sanctions be lifted first.
Instead, Iran announced last week that it would deploy a new generation of centrifuges, four to six times as powerful as the current generation. And while the United States, its European partners and Russia and China agreed to resume talks with the Iranians at the end of the month, administration officials have low expectations for the results.
''The Iranians didn't want to be in these talks, and it's hard to imagine any kind of a deal before their elections'' in June, said one senior official, referring to the coming presidential vote. ''Maybe if they had to put up with two more years of pain.''
R. Nicholas Burns, who as under secretary of state helped push through many of the early sanctions resolutions against Iran during the Bush administration, said, ''Even the tough Obama sanctions on their own are unlikely to work as Khamenei is dug in and obdurate.'' Mr. Burns added that for diplomacy to succeed ''the U.S. must remain patient and commit to direct talks at the highest levels. But, ultimately both Obama and Netanyahu also need to make the threat of force more credible to Tehran. Combined with sanctions, this may be the most effective way to convince Iran to agree to a peaceful, negotiated settlement.''
That does not necessarily mean the sanctions have failed to have any effect. All financial transactions have been cut off, making it extremely difficult for Iranians to make overseas payments. Europe for the first time is boycotting Iran's crude, which is costing the country $4 billion to $8 billion each month.
The existing sanctions on financial transactions have also forced Iran to engage in unfavorable oil-for-goods barter trade with its biggest customers, China and India. Chinese goods and medicine from India are prominently featured in stores and pharmacies across the country.
And now Iranian economic ingenuity will be tested again. Under the new crackdown, the United States is tightening the rules governing countries it has allowed to keep buying Iranian oil, as long as they show they are weaning themselves of it. From now on, when China, Japan, South Korea and India, among others, pay for oil deliveries, they will be required to put that money into a local bank account, which Iran can use only to buy goods within that country.
It is a way of keeping the money from ever being repatriated to Iran, even through third parties. Under American law, violators would be denied access to the United States banking system, though as a political matter it is difficult to imagine that ever being enforced. Meanwhile, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has asked Parliament to approve more cash handouts for most Iranians as a cushion for tougher times to come.
''Of course, the situation could be much better, people are stretching their financial limits,'' Mr. Ranchian said. ''But for now, at least, they are coping.''
The Iranian economy's resiliency could surprise Westerners. The way Iran's economy is structured, with strong links between state bodies and semiofficial and private businesses, helps shield the country, said Saeed Laylaz, an economist and columnist for the Sharq newspaper, which is critical of the government.
Mr. Laylaz, who spent several months in jail after the 2009 protests against President Ahmadinejad's re-election, explained how Iranian importers and exporters are constantly shifting between buying and selling products, making profits on exchange rates. Regional trade is up because of the low rial, he said. ''Some are making a fortune these days.''
Others are more pessimistic, saying the effects of the sanctions have still not been fully felt.
''If the sanctions, government mismanagement and inflation continue naturally in the future, we will encounter serious difficulties,'' said Mohsen Farshad Yekta, a professor of economics at the University of Economic Sciences in Tehran.
Right now, Mr. Obama's aides seem content with stalemate. They believe that Ayatollah Khamenei is proceeding with the nuclear program in the most incremental way, carefully avoiding going above, at least for now, a stockpile of more than 250 kilograms of medium-enriched uranium -- enough to make a single bomb. But to try to demonstrate its seriousness, the American military and two dozen allies are running an exercise this week in the Persian Gulf, practicing how to intercept banned technology and weapons heading into, or out of, Iranian ports.

HEADLINE: E-Mails Imply JPMorgan Knew Some Mortgage Deals Were Bad

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
When an outside analysis uncovered serious flaws with thousands of home loans, JPMorgan Chase executives found an easy fix.
Rather than disclosing the full extent of problems like fraudulent home appraisals and overextended borrowers, the bank adjusted the critical reviews, according to documents filed early Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan. As a result, the mortgages, which JPMorgan bundled into complex securities, appeared healthier, making the deals more appealing to investors.
The trove of internal e-mails and employee interviews, filed as part of a lawsuit by one of the investors in the securities, offers a fresh glimpse into Wall Street's mortgage machine, which churned out billions of dollars of securities that later imploded. The documents reveal that JPMorgan, as well as two firms the bank acquired during the credit crisis, Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns, flouted quality controls and ignored problems, sometimes hiding them entirely, in a quest for profit. 
The lawsuit, which was filed by Dexia, a Belgian-French bank, is being closely watched on Wall Street. After suffering significant losses, Dexia sued JPMorgan and its affiliates in 2012, claiming it had been duped into buying $1.6 billion of troubled mortgage-backed securities. The latest documents could provide a window into a $200 billion case that looms over the entire industry. In that lawsuit, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has accused 17 banks of selling dubious mortgage securities to the two housing giants. At least 20 of the securities are also highlighted in the Dexia case, according to an analysis of court records.
In court filings, JPMorgan has strongly denied wrongdoing and is contesting both cases in federal court. The bank declined to comment.
Dexia's lawsuit is part of a broad assault on Wall Street for its role in the 2008 financial crisis, as prosecutors, regulators and private investors take aim at mortgage-related securities. New York's attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, sued JPMorgan last year over investments created by Bear Stearns between 2005 and 2007.
Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, has criticized prosecutors for attacking JPMorgan because of what Bear Stearns did. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in October, Mr. Dimon said the bank did the federal government "a favor" by rescuing the flailing firm in 2008.
The legal onslaught has been costly. In November, JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, agreed to pay $296.9 million to settle claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission that Bear Stearns had misled mortgage investors by hiding some delinquent loans. JPMorgan did not admit or deny wrongdoing.
"The true price tag for the ongoing costs of the litigation is terrifying," said Christopher Whalen, managing director at Carrington Investment Services.
The Dexia lawsuit centers on complex securities created by JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual during the housing boom. As profits soared, the Wall Street firms scrambled to pump out more investments, even as questions emerged about their quality.
With a seemingly insatiable appetite, JPMorgan scooped up mortgages from lenders with troubled records, according to the court documents. In an internal "due diligence scorecard," JPMorgan ranked large mortgage originators, assigning Washington Mutual and American Home Mortgage the lowest grade of "poor" for their documentation, the court filings show.
The loans were quickly sold to investors. Describing the investment assembly line, an executive at Bear Stearns told employees "we are a moving company not a storage company," according to the court documents.
As they raced to produce mortgage-backed securities, Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns also scaled back their quality controls, the documents indicate.
In an initiative called Project Scarlett, Washington Mutual slashed its due diligence staff by 25 percent as part of an effort to bolster profit. Such steps "tore the heart out" of quality controls, according to a November 2007 e-mail from a Washington Mutual executive. Executives who pushed back endured "harassment" when they tried to "keep our discipline and controls in place," the e-mail said.
Even when flaws were flagged, JPMorgan and the other firms sometimes overlooked the warnings.
JPMorgan routinely hired Clayton Holdings and other third-party firms to examine home loans before they were packed into investments. Combing through the mortgages, the firms searched for problems like borrowers who had vastly overstated their incomes or appraisals that inflated property values.
According to the court documents, an analysis for JPMorgan in September 2006 found that "nearly half of the sample pool" - or 214 loans - were "defective," meaning they did not meet the underwriting standards. The borrowers' incomes, the firms found, were dangerously low relative to the size of their mortgages. Another troubling report in 2006 discovered that thousands of borrowers had already fallen behind on their payments.
But JPMorgan at times dismissed the critical assessments or altered them, the documents show. Certain JPMorgan employees, including the bankers who assembled the mortgages and the due diligence managers, had the power to ignore or veto bad reviews.
In some instances, JPMorgan executives reduced the number of loans considered delinquent, the documents show. In others, the executives altered the assessments so that a smaller number of loans were considered "defective."
In a 2007 e-mail, titled "Banking overrides," a JPMorgan due diligence manager asks a banker: "How do you want to handle these loans?" At times, they whitewashed the findings, the documents indicate. In 2006, for example, a review of mortgages found that at least 1,154 loans were more than 30 days delinquent. The offering documents sent to investors showed only 25 loans as delinquent.
A person familiar with the bank's portfolios said JPMorgan had reviewed the loans separately and determined that the number of delinquent loans was far less than the outside analysis had found.
At Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, employees also had the power to sanitize bad assessments. Employees at Bear Stearns were told that they were responsible for "purging all of the older reports" that showed flaws, "leaving only the final reports," according to the court documents.
Such actions were designed to bolster profit. In a deposition, a Washington Mutual employee said revealing loan defects would undermine the lucrative business, and that the bank would suffer "a couple-point hit in price."
Ratings agencies also did not necessarily get a complete picture of the investments, according to the court filings. An assessment of the loans in one security revealed that 24 percent of the sample was "materially defective," the filings show. After exercising override power, a JPMorgan employee sent a report in May 2006 to a ratings agency that showed only 5.3 percent of the mortgages were defective.
Such investments eventually collapsed, spreading losses across the financial system.
Dexia, which has been bailed out twice since the financial crisis, lost $774 million on mortgage-backed securities, according to court records.
Mr. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said that overall losses from flawed mortgage-backed securities from 2005 and 2007 were $22.5 billion.
In a statement shortly after he sued JPMorgan Chase, Mr. Schneiderman said the lawsuit was a template "for future actions against issuers of residential mortgage-backed securities that defrauded investors and cost millions of Americans their homes."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times 

        
Yielding to a Congress anxious about using drones strikes to target and kill American terror suspects abroad like Anwar al-Awlaki, President Obama will share classified intelligence documents used to justify the policy with the Congressional Intelligence Committees. Michael D. Shear and Scott Shane write that the move is a response to lawmakers demanding that the administration lay out "the scope and limits of what the executive branch believes it has the power to do in national security matters," but transparency advocates note that the memos were not being shared with the committees with jurisdiction over Pentagon strikes or over the Justice Department.
 

        
Senate Democrats hope to produce a plan by the end of the week to delay or avoid nearly $1 trillion in federal spending cuts set to take effect in March. Jonathan Weisman and Elisabeth Bumiller explain the wrangling among lawmakers over the so-called sequester cuts, which are already having an impact on decision-making at the Pentagon and have put about one million jobs on the line.

        
Karl Rove and his allies created the Conservative Victory Project to mount an aggressive effort to help Republicans rebuild their party and regain control of the Senate. But Jeff Zeleny explains that as Republican primaries begin to take shape ahead of the 2014 Congressional elections, Mr. Rove faces a backlash from conservative activists who see party strategists like him and his decision to back candidates in the primaries as part of the party's problem.

        
Adam Liptak writes that Justice Sonia Sotomayor's decision to speak at a conference in April hasput her in the thick of a long-running dispute over Yale University's relationship with PepsiCo, the sponsor of the conference..

HIGHLIGHT: The casualties of a weak economy are legion. 

 BODY:
Catherine Rampell:
While about 8 percent of Americans are unemployed, nearly a quarter of Americans say they were laid off at some point during the recession or afterward, according to the survey. More broadly, nearly eight in 10 say they know someone in their circle of family and friends who has lost a job. 
...
Of those laid off in recent years, nearly a quarter said they still had not found a job. Re-employment rates for older workers have been particularly bad, with nearly two-thirds of unemployed people 55 and older saying they actively sought a job for more than a year before finding one or had still not found work.
But the Very Serious People -- who, I would guess, are for the most part members of the 1 in five who *don't* have anyone in their circle who lost a job -- insist that all of this is as nothing compared with the threat from invisible bond vigilantes.

HEADLINE: In Worldwide Soccer Corruption Scandal, an Asian Tie

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: The reputation of soccer, beloved of many, has been seriously tarnished by a report of massive match-fixing that includes top European games, with the epicenter of the trouble in Asia, investigators said. 

 BODY:
-
BEIJING - Soccer is probably the world's most popular sport, commanding billions-strong audiences from slums to palaces. It may also be the world's most corrupt sport, with the epicenter of the global corruption in Asia, investigators said this week.
The problem is illegal gambling that is tied to corruption and match fixing, said Chris Eaton, a former head of security at FIFA, the world soccer organization based in Switzerland, and now the director of the International Center for Sport Security in Qatar. Asia was attractive to criminals in this area for its lax regulation, he said, and the biggest gambling houses each transacted $2 billion a week. "It's all done with algorithms and machines, almost like any commodity house in the U.S. or London," he said. 
Soccer gambling "is bigger than Coca-Cola, which is a trillion a year. This is a global economy, a growing global economy, and it needs to be regulated and supervised, and governments aren't doing this," Mr. Eaton said in one of a series of Reuters reports this week documenting the scandal.
On Monday, European police said hundreds of matches, including some involving the World Cup, the European Championships and the Champions League, may have been fixed in a global betting scam largely run from Singapore, the Southeast Asian nation with a normally squeaky-clean image.
This colorful account on the investigative Web site Invisible Dog offers apparent details of a trail that it said began with a goalkeeper in an Italian third division team and led to gambling masterminds in Singapore.
If the brains are in Singapore, the three largest gambling houses in Asia, IBCBET, SBOBET and 188BET, are in Manila in the Philippines, Reuters reported. Their operations were "very opaque" and what was known of them came from talking to people familiar with their workings, as there was no government record, Mr. Eaton, the soccer security expert, told Reuters.
"You have under-regulated, gray-area gambling where the regulators are not really serious, transparency rules are not to best practice and government oversight is almost nonexistent," he said.
Exactly how it works was explained by Laszlo Angeli, a Hungarian prosecutor cited by the news agency, who drew on an example of a member of a gambling syndicate in Hungary.
"The Hungarian member, who was immediately below the Singapore head, was in touch with Hungarian referees who could then attempt to swing matches at which they officiated around the world," he said. Accomplices would place bets on the Internet or by phone with bookmakers in Asia.
So far, the German police have concrete proof of (EURO)8 million, or $11 million, in gambling profits from the match fixing, but this is probably the tip of the iceberg, experts say.
In response, FIFA has set up an online reporting site that guarantees anonymity to whistleblowers.
But Asian nations must work together to counter the gangs that run operations, said an analyst quoted by Reuters.
"There has to be collective effort from law enforcement agencies in Asia and beyond to address this issue," said B.C. Tan, head of organized crime research at World-Check, a risk analysis firm.
In January, 41 South Korean players involved in match fixing were banned for life from the game by FIFA, extending earlier sanctions against them (though 21 were offered a reprieve, according to reports.) Three South Koreans involved in the scandal have committed suicide, this report said.

HEADLINE: A Hollow Case for Big Banks

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: What purports to be a research paper on the necessity of too-big-to-fail banks neglects all the current research and lacks credibility, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
An interesting debate is developing within the Republican Party on how to approach the problem of too-big-to-fail financial institutions.
On the one hand, a growing number of influential voices are pushing for measures that would limit the size of megabanks or even push them to become smaller. Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, continues to draw a lot of attention, as does Thomas Hoenig, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and now vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. And Jon Huntsman planted a strong conservative flag on this issue during his run for the presidency in 2011. 
This assessment is now shared much more broadly across the right, as seen in recent opinion pieces by George Will and Peggy Noonan, as well as regular analysis by James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute, some of it on the issue I write about today. See this Holiday 2012 survey, provided by the Dallas Fed, with links to views in favor of and against breaking up the big banks.
Senator David Vitter of Louisiana and Jim DeMint, the former senator from South Carolina who now heads the Heritage Foundation, have also come out hard against very big banks. Both men are usually considered to be in the right wing of the party.
But some other Republicans are pushing back, as seen this week in a paper by Hamilton Place Strategies, a group headed in part by communications professionals who previously worked with President George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney. (The people involved insist that it is not a Republican firm. Of its five partners, four previously had senior Republican jobs, while the fifth worked for Hillary Clinton and other Democrats. Of its three managing directors, two have worked for Democrats and one was a senior staff member on the Romney campaign. Historically, of course, deference to big banks is bipartisan.)

Can Hamilton Place Strategies help turn the tide within Republican thinking? This is not likely, because its paper is not credible and should not be taken seriously for three reasons.
First, it fails to deal with the most important recent work showing the problems with big banks. For example, it essentially ignores the analysis of Andrew Haldane and his colleagues at the Bank of England, which finds no economies of scale and scope for the world's largest financial institutions (the paper mentions the finding that economies of scale do not exist above about $100 billion but does not go into the specifics of this result). I see no mention of Richard Fisher and Harvey Rosenblum of the Dallas Fed, who explain clearly how megabanks weaken the effectiveness of monetary policy and undermine United States influence over all aspects of our financial system (a direct counter to one main point of the Hamilton Place Strategies paper).
The paper makes vague assertions that bank equity capital is now sufficient to withstand future adverse shocks, but it fails to take on any of the many concerns raised by Anat Admati and her co-authors, which are increasingly gaining traction. Professor Admati and Martin Hellwig have a new book, "The Bankers' New Clothes," which will be introduced on Monday at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (where I am a senior fellow); excerpts have been posted on Bloomberg. Anyone who wants to be taken seriously in this debate needs to read the book (and the technical papers already available).
Second, Hamilton Place Strategies denies the existence of too-big-to-fail subsidies for global megabanks. This is laughable. Has it talked to anyone in credit markets about how they price various kinds of risk - and assess the willingness and ability of the government and the Fed to support troubled megabanks? Or have its authors read thethe report on the Safe Banking Act, produced by the staff of Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio? The International Monetary Fund, the Bank of England and other sources cited there put the funding advantage of too-big-to-fail banks at 50 to 80 basis points (0.5 to 0.8 of a percentage point, which is a lot in today's market).
Such subsidies encourage big banks to borrow more - to take more risk and to become even larger. The damage when such a bank fails is generally proportional to its size. So this implicit taxpayer subsidy creates serious risks for the macroeconomy and contributes to the further buildup of taxpayer liabilities - when any financial system crashes, that causes a recession, reduces tax revenue, and pushes up government debt.
Even William Dudley, the former Goldman Sachs executive who now heads the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, acknowledges that too-big-to-fail and its associated subsidies continue. Daniel Tarullo, the lead Fed governor for financial regulation, is in the same place. (Again, neither is cited in the Hamilton Place Strategies document.)
Hamilton Place Strategies contends that large banks can be resolved - taken through liquidation by the F.D.I.C. without difficulties - and that the "living wills" process helps to provide a meaningful road map. I talk to people closely involved with these issues, officials and private-sector participants (as a member of the F.D.I.C.'s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee and as a member of the Systemic Risk Council, led by Sheila Bair, the former chairwoman of the F.D.I.C.). Hamilton Place Strategies is completely wrong on the substance here.
Hamilton Place Strategies also asserts that global megabanks are an essential part of a well-functioning international economy. Again, I don't know where this comes from. As part of my work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at the Peterson Institute, I talk with people who run companies, large and small, operating around the world; they emphasize that they need financial services provided by well-run institutions and markets that have integrity. 
Putting too-big-to-jail banks in charge of financial flows helps no one - except, presumably, the executives at those banks that the Department of Justice has determined are immune from criminal prosecution.
Third, the Hamilton Place Strategies "report" reads as if it is either some form of paid advertising or a sales pitch to potential clients -- but the firm refuses to disclose for whom it is working and on what basis.
In response to an e-mail request for such information, Patrick Sims of Hamilton Place Strategies replied: 
While we don't publicly disclose our individual clients, we make no secret that we do work for large financial institutions, both foreign and domestic, and related associations. It would be fair for you to note that in your writing. But the views expressed in the paper represent the longstanding views of the firm.
I'm not sure what "longstanding" means, as the firm was founded in 2010. But in any case, this lack of disclosure completely destroys the credibility of Hamilton Place Strategies and its work in this area.
The firm is in the business of influencing opinion. As it says prominently on its Web site, "We show clients how to shape opinion, navigate challenges, make informed decisions and create opportunities."
While the firm's clients in this area may not be clear, the language in its report strongly resembles arguments being made by the Financial Services Forum and other lobbying groups for large banks. For example, an unsigned blog post on the Financial Services Forum's Web site from November 2011 has the same arguments and similar wording to what is in the Hamilton Place Strategies report. (It also objects to an earlier commentary I wrote.)
Perhaps all this is a coincidence; the firm has not yet been willing to discuss these points. When I acquainted the firm with what I was writing in this post and sought comment, the only substantive reaction was a request not to characterize it as a Republican firm.
We have seen deceptive lobbying, posing as objective research, many times in the financial reform debate - for example, the case of Keybridge Research on derivatives, which I wrote about in 2011.
If a company's lawyer is quoted in the press, the report will always include mention of the client-lawyer relationship. Everyone is entitled to a spokesperson.
Law firms are not afraid to tell you whom they represent. After Charles Ferguson's Oscar-winning movie, "Inside Job," many academics now disclose when they produce a paper on behalf of an industry association (e.g., Darrell Duffie of Stanford disclosed that a $50,000 donation to charity was made by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a lobbying group, for a paper he wrote opposing the Volcker Rule).
Karen Shaw Petrou, a leading banking analyst with whom I have also disagreed on too-big-to-fail issues, discloses "selected clients and subscribers" in some detail.
Upton Sinclair once quipped, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it." 
Hamilton Place Strategies' decision not to disclose who is paying for its "research" is far more significant than all the errors in its white paper.

HEADLINE: Daily Report: Europe's Plan for GPS Limps to Crossroads

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Europe's commitment to a new, European-controlled satellite navigation system will be decided in Brussels this week, when European leaders will try to hash out a long-term budget for the 27-nation bloc. 

 BODY:
With lofty dreams of European unity increasingly grounded by economic woe and the weight of narrow national interests, an array of computer screens in central Italy blinks with faint signs that - far away in space, at least - Europe's often quarreling nations can still sometimes find common cause, reports Andrew Higgins in Thursday's New York Times. 
Ringed by snow-covered mountains on a plateau east of Rome, the Fucino Space Center stands guard over the European Union's flagship joint project: a satellite navigation system that is years behind schedule, many times over its original budget and unlikely to start operating for at least another year.
Europe's future commitment to the project - which is known as Galileo and is designed to create a new, improved and European-controlled version of America's Global Positioning System - is to be decided in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, when European leaders will try for a second time, after talks failed in November, to hash out a long-term budget for the 27-nation bloc.
With recession and austerity clouding much of the Continent, the leaders will argue over where the ax should fall in a European Union budget for 2014 to 2020 that would total nearly $1.35 trillion as drafted. An over-budget satellite navigation system that is years from completion, largely a duplicate of an American system already widely used in Europe and unlikely ever to generate much revenue would seem to be in the budget cutters' cross hairs.
But Galileo's backers are confident, so much so that they are asking for $8 billion beyond the more than $4 billion already spent. For Galileo promises perhaps the one thing that still seems able to overcome European leaders' devotion to austerity: economic and technological independence from the United States.

: Funny, America's premium-orange-juice wars suddenly look a lot like the primordial cola wars. Hold on: could that be because PepsiCo owns Tropicana, and Coca-Cola owns Minute Maid and Simply Orange? And now Coke is dialing in on the $13 billion pure-juice market, attempting to use sophisticated engineering to beat Tropicana. - Glenn Collins
: How did Cheddar get so huge? -- Jeff Gordinier 
: The names are a little tongue-twisting, but for a bracing winter warm-up, it's worth learning how to pronounce Slivovitz, Zwack Unicum and Becherovka - herbal and fruit-based spirits from Central and Eastern Europe that even come in neat bottles. -- Patrick Farrell
The New York Times: More restaurant chains are featuring smaller portions and lighter fare as consumers -- and the federal government -- demand them. -- Maria Newman
: How Pret A Manger, the sandwich chain based in Britain, uses the principles of "emotional labor" to encourage - some might say enforce -- happiness among its employees. - Julia Moskin
: Supermodels aren't the only ones going hungry during Fashion Week. A reporter chronicles the frantic schedule and on-the-fly nibbles that helped him lose five pounds. -- Patrick Farrell
: When you're cooking in Bologna, there are rules. Strict ones. Although naturally the rules depend on whom you're talking to. -- Jeff Gordinier 
: . . . There are rules, too, when chefs decide to serve their customers breakfast. -- Jeff Gordinier 
: Wait, was stone soup literally Stone Age soup? Scientists once thought that soup-making began 5,000 to 9,000 years ago, but a Harvard archeologist cites new evidence to show that those prior soup assumptions were wrong by at least 15,000 years. - Glenn Collins
The New York Times: Even in Japan, where whale meat is still served despite a world moratorium on commercial whaling, demand for the meat has decreased. The industry shipped 5,000 tons in 2011, down from 233,000 tons in 1962. -- Maria Newman
: As part of its new 35th-anniversary issue, the magazine asked various chefs, thinkers and designers to weigh in on the question of what and how we'll be eating 35 years from now. They offered their musings - on plates. -- Jeff Gordinier 
ScienceDaily: A green-tea-and-red-wine cocktail may just be the miracle infusion. Now researchers at the University of Leeds have found that EGCG extracts from green tea, and resveratrol from red wine, can counter the amyloid-protein "clumping" process that enables Alzheimer's disease to destroy brain cells. - Glenn Collins

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: This time is different, predictably. 

 BODY:
I've often argued on this blog and in the column that now is a particularly bad time to cut spending, because unlike in normal times, the adverse effects on demand can't be offset by cutting interest rates. One way to highlight the point is to compare where we are now with a historical episode: the fairly large cuts in federal purchases of goods and services that took place in the early 1990s, as the US military shrank with the end of the Cold War. Here's federal consumption and investment spending as a share of potential GDP (blue, left scale) versus the Fed funds rate (red, right scale): 
The Fed could and did cut rates, helping to cushion the impact of spending cuts. It can't do anything like this now, because the Fed funds rate has already been cut more or less to zero in an attempt to fight the effects of financial crisis.
Austerity right now is a really, really bad idea.

HEADLINE: The Mets Embrace Tradition, Again

BYLINE: KEN BELSON


HIGHLIGHT: The naming rights for the Mets' spring training stadium once again belong to a Florida real estate developer. 

 BODY:
The Mets apparently have not heard the phrase, once bitten, twice shy. On Thursday, they announced that Tradition Florida, a real estate developer, would buy the naming rights to the Mets' spring training stadium in Port St. Lucie. 
The stadium was named Tradition Field until 2010, when Core Communities, the company that owned the Tradition residential development in Florida, stopped making payments to the Mets and St. Lucie County, which claimed that it was owed $100,000.
Digital Domain, a special effects company, took over the naming rights, but last year that company got into financial trouble and also had its name removed.
Enter Tradition Florida, the new owners of the residential development. According to the proposed deal that the St. Lucie County commissioners will vote on Friday, the company will pay $75,000 in 2013 for the naming rights, with payments increasing each year by the rate of inflation through 2017. There are options to continue the arrangement through 2023.
The Mets and the county had previously received $100,000 in naming rights fees.
Jeff Wilpon, the team's chief operating officer, call Tradition Florida an "iconic name" that "is familiar to Treasure Coast residents and Mets fans."
The spring training facility was expanded last year to include an outdoor hospitality space in right field, a better scoreboard and a Tiki Bar on the third-base side. It is unclear whether the Mets' 2013 squad will represent an upgrade.

HEADLINE: William Janeway: A Golden Age, if We Want It

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: A giant of tech investing says innovation isn't dead, but it is thoroughly misunderstood. If we're going to make great new discoveries, William Janeway says, we have to get government back into basic scientific research as a demanding customer. 

 BODY:
William H. Janeway, one of the great tech investors, would be the first to tell you that being smart and lucky is the best of breaks. "I came to Wall Street in 1970 while still finishing my doctoral dissertation for Cambridge University because I knew what I did not want to do," he writes in his book, "Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy." His doctorate was in economics, and what Mr. Janeway didn't want to do was spend his career inside academia. Instead, he made himself and others a great deal of money by investing in technology.
Mr. Janeway disliked how mathematical models and quantitative techniques had taken over the analysis of business, finance, and the role of government. That quantification of everything, he thought, led to arrogant conclusions, bad policies, and a tragic loss of the real-world color and nuance surrounding our lives in the marketplace. Things may have gotten somewhat better in economics since, he writes, but the false certainties of those mathematical geniuses who created the 2008 derivatives debacle show that we still have a lot of relearning ahead. 
He worked at Warburg Pincus when it first moved into speculative tech investments. He invested in start-ups, turnarounds, and buyouts. The firm helped create BEA Systems, which connected software applications to databases across much of the Internet. A cash investment of $54 million became a payout of $6.5 billion within six years. Most of the stock was sold on the eve of the great Internet stock crash of 2000, something he saw coming thanks to his reading of economic history, and the parallels with the tech stock manias of 1929.
More than a memoir, however, his book is an example-rich theory of the necessary tensions that create innovation and growth. In many cases, he says, developments such as electronics research and biotechnology begin life with government-led funding. Entrepreneurs seize on these discoveries, and shape them to meet social and business needs. Financiers, eager to create opportunities that are not leashed by custom and law, back the entrepreneurs (whom Mr. Janeway, the former financier, assures us they rarely trust with the money.) 
It is a system that has more or less worked for two centuries in Europe and the United States, but is now under threat. I caught up with Mr. Janeway in Cambridge, England, where he is teaching his book, to discuss why. Here is the edited interview. 
 Q. 
 How do you rate the climate for technology innovation today?
 A. 
 A little conflicted. Not only is the information technology revolution not over, as some people argue, it's just starting, with things like cloud computing, mobility, and big data. Friends of mine in the Silicon Valley say it's easy to raise early-stage money, and hard to get money to take companies bigger. It's a happy hunting time for companies that know how to acquire technology.
At the same time, there is lots of stuff we should be doing in basic technology research that isn't being done.
 Q. 
 Such as?
 A. 
 The government should be funding tons of work around decreasing carbon consumption in energy. In computers, government could play a role in areas like natural language processing and machine learning. Not just funding start-ups. It should be funding universities, and giving contracts to big companies that can build things, like General Electric. 
It should be buying and testing products. What is neglected is how much the Department of Defense played a helpful role to the electronics industry in the 1950s and '60s as a customer that guaranteed purchasing, but also insisted on improvement over time, and the sharing of intellectual property.
 Q. 
 Why isn't that happening now?
 A. 
 The government got into a "picking winners" approach when it invested in single start-ups, like Solyndra. They need to set up a more competitive environment for their needs.
A bigger part of the problem is that a lot of people in government don't seem to think government can play a positive role. You could construct an interlocking laundry list of things for the government to invest in. The government has to be empowered on both the production and the consumption side of energy research. But you can't even have that conversation in Congress today.
 Q. 
 Right now in the Valley there are perhaps 40 start-ups that are valued at $1 billion or more. Is this the sign of a bubble, or some special innovation in finance and technology?
 A. 
 I've heard people in the Valley say, "We don't need to do an I.P.O. anymore, we have the Russian billionaires investing now." It's like every oligarch has to have a start-up. We'll see how that one plays out. One or more companies will get public. Whether they do at a price that validates what they say they're worth now, who knows?

HEADLINE: Helping Start-Ups With Local Support and National Networks

BYLINE: SARAH MAX


HIGHLIGHT: Startup America Partnership, a nonprofit organization started in January 2011, seeks to offer entrepreneurs practical help, like brainstorming and connecting with clients in other states. 

 BODY:
When Will Fuentes planned an extended business trip to Seattle last year, he tapped into the local chapter of a national networking group there. Within hours, Mr. Fuentes, who founded the Arlington, Va., software company Lemur Retail, had secured a work space, introductions and even restaurant recommendations via the group, the Startup America Partnership."Before I flew out there, I already had five or six meetings set up with potential clients and other key contacts, as well as one potential acquirer," Mr. Fuentes said.
A couple of years ago, entrepreneurs would have needed several trips to make similar connections outside their own cities. Even in this era of social networks and venture conferences, start-ups are still surprisingly disconnected on a national level. 
"Each region has its ties, but in many cases, entrepreneurs are operating in silos," said Carolynn Duncan, the chief executive of Portland Ten, a mentoring program for early-stage companies, mainly in Oregon. "An entrepreneur in Oregon doesn't have an easy way to network with entrepreneurs in Washington D.C."
 Startup America, a nonprofit organization with an all-star cast of deep-pocketed backers, is trying to bridge the gap. The organization, which was started in January 2011 as the brainchild of AOL's co-founder, Steve Case, and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, wanted to bring a private-sector support to start-ups - without financial strings attached.
"Supporting start-ups throughout the country is the only way to make sure the American economy is firing on all cylinders," said Mr. Case, who is the chairman of the partnership.
Start-ups are a crucial driver for job creation in the United States. From March 1994 to March 2010, businesses less than one year old created 3.9 million jobs a year on average, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, though that number has declined during the recent economic weakness.
The Small Business Administration and United States Chamber of Commerce have long been a resource for start-ups, but these government agencies have a broad mandate. There is a "growing recognition," said Mr. Case, that high-growth start-ups - those with the potential to be national or international companies - have different needs and requirements than traditional small businesses.
Startup America's initial focus was to provide support to start-ups through deals on goods and services, like 40 percent off FedEx shipping and free flights on American Airlines. But the group quickly realized that start-ups needed more practical help, like sharing best practices and networking.
Soon after the partnership's start, entrepreneurs around the country starting contacting Startup America, asking how they could create their own networks and reach out to counterparts in other states. "Most of these regions were already coming up with their own initiatives or thinking about them," said the organization's chief executive, Scott Case, a founder and former chief technology officer of Priceline.com (and no relation to Steve Case). "We're helping to stitch together all these parts."
Taking cues from the entrepreneurs, Startup America has turned its attention to building such a network. Nearly 12,000 members are now affiliated with local Startup America initiatives in 30 states. The partnership expects to add another 10 states this year.
Each Startup America region is spearheaded by local "champions" who come together several times a year at national conferences, communicate via Google groups and have access to an online "idea center" where they can brainstorm about, say, bringing in outside capital or hosting a start-up conference. These envoys are all "founder types" at different stages of their careers, Scott Case said. "Some have exited companies and are looking to continue to feed that creative drive. Others understand that if they can strengthen their community, they can strengthen their own company."
Brooks Bell, founder of an eponymous 22-employee digital consulting business based in Raleigh, N.C., became involved with the partnership in 2011 after realizing that many potential clients considered her area a backwater. "I realized that was impacting my company's brand, too," she said.
Mrs. Bell pointed out that other national groups, like Entrepreneurs' Organizations, offer resources for high-growth companies. Yet, their emphasis is typically on supporting individuals rather than elevating the region and networking nationally. "They also tend to focus on early-stage companies," she said. Until Startup America, she added, "there weren't a lot of opportunities for early-stage companies to interact with funded companies."
Though Startup America regions work off the same blueprint, each takes a slightly different approach. In Maryland, the staff and champions volunteer virtually. Startup Tennessee partnered with the Entrepreneur Center in Nashville, which runs a nonprofit incubator program. Startup Colorado works out of Silicon Flatirons, a center for law, technology and entrepreneurship at the University of Colorado Law School, and finds partners to finance specific projects.
Although the regional chapters operate independently, they benefit from the credibility of a national organization. "It's helping elevate our start-ups nationally and get them in front of audiences we never would have," said Andy Stoll, an entrepreneur in the Iowa City, Iowa, area, where rebuilding from the floods in 2008 has helped generate a boom in start-up activity.
"To have the opportunity to sit in a room with their board and have Steve Case ask me, 'What are the three things that those of us at this table can do to really help support the Indiana community?' is amazing and a humbling experience," said Michael Coffey, a partner at DeveloperTown, an Indianapolis design and development firm that works with companies of all sizes.
In the end, it's all about business.
Aaron Schwartz, a co-founder of the San Francisco-based Modify Watches, initially joined Startup America for the discounts. Now, he's also tapping into the partnership to network, including finding corporate clients who order custom watches and vendors. "I now have a contact in Tennessee who has offered to look into manufacturing our watches there," he said
Mr. Fuentes of Lemur Retail found two potential clients, both national chains, through his connections in Seattle last year; he's currently in talks with those companies. He's also helping his Northwest counterparts make inroads in the Washington area. He likens the experience to a fraternity or alumni organization of entrepreneurs.
"When people contact me from my high school or college, I pick up the phone," he said. "This is no different."

HEADLINE: Don't Make Poison Pills More Deadly

BYLINE: LUCIAN A. BEBCHUK


HIGHLIGHT: The Securities and Exchange Commission should avoid any changes that would make it easier to adopt poison pills that cap ownership at low levels, the author writes. 

 BODY:
Under a publicly announced agenda for 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission is to examine the rules governing when shareholders must disclose the acquisition of a significant position in a public company. An unintended and harmful effect of such a change may be that it will help companies adopt so-called low-threshold poison pills - arrangements that cap the ownership of outside shareholders at levels like 10 or 15 percent. The S.E.C. should be careful to avoid such an outcome in any rules it may adopt. 
Under current S.E.C. rules established under the Williams Act of 1968, outside shareholders who obtain stakes of 5 percent or more of a company's stock must publicly disclose their holdings within 10 days. The S.E.C., however, is planning to consider a rule-making petition, filed by a prominent corporate law firm, that proposes to reduce the 10-day period, as well as to count derivatives toward the 5 percent threshold. 
Supporters of the petition argue that earlier disclosure would benefit public investors by enabling selling investors to obtain the somewhat higher market price that an earlier disclosure might bring. This, however, needs to be weighed against the costs to investors from discouraging activist outside shareholders. As I explained in an earlier column, there is much evidence showing how such shareholders confer significant benefits on their fellow investors. 
Whatever view one takes on this tradeoff, the push for tightening disclosure rules is at least partly driven by the benefits that earlier disclosure would provide for corporate insiders. Supporters of the petition have made it clear that tightening disclosure requirements is intended to alert not only the market but also incumbent boards and executives in order to help them put defenses in place more quickly. 
The drafters of the Williams Act envisioned a landscape that would allow outsiders who were not seeking to control a company to keep accumulating shares, provided that they made the required disclosures. But companies in the United States have been increasingly using poison pills with low thresholds to limit the stakes of outside shareholders they disfavor. 
Poison pills were developed in the 1980s to enable insiders to block a hostile acquisition. Over time, however -- and without sufficient attention by investors and public officials -- companies have started to use poison pills to prevent acquisitions of stakes that fall substantially short of a controlling block. 
Indeed, among the 637 companies with poison pills in the FactSet Systems database, 80 percent have plans with a threshold of 15 percent or less. No other developed economy grants corporate insiders the freedom to cap the ownership of blockholders they disfavor at such low levels. 
The current ability of insiders to adopt low-threshold poison pills is a highly relevant factor for any assessment of the rules governing the relationship between incumbents and outside shareholders. In particular, the S.E.C. should recognize that tightening disclosure requirements could impose costs on public investors and the economy by facilitating the use of such pills. 
Consider a situation in which an investor opposed by management makes a public announcement immediately upon accumulating a 5 percent stake. Then suppose the company quickly adopts a poison pill with a low threshold that prevents or drastically limits further accumulation of stock by the buyer. In this case, the company's response to the immediate disclosure would not enable public investors to capture higher prices for shares they sell to the large shareholders; to the contrary, it would prevent these investors from selling shares to the large shareholder at mutually beneficial prices. 
Furthermore, by entrenching insiders and insulating them from engagement by large outside shareholders, low-threshold poison pills could well impose costs on public investors who do not wish to sell their shares. 
If the S.E.C. does decide that tightening disclosure requirements is desirable, it should design the rules to avoid aiding the use of such poison pills. This could be done by limiting the application of tightened disclosure requirements to companies whose charters do not permit the use of low-threshold poison pills. 
Proponents of the petition, which has thus far failed to attract any supportive comments from institutional investors, should endorse including such a limitation in any reform. Doing so is necessary to address concerns that tightened disclosure requirements might be aimed at protecting entrenched insiders rather than public investors. 
Even if the petition's proponents keep pressing for rules that would facilitate low-threshold poison pills, the S.E.C should avoid serving this objective. As the investor's advocate, the S.E.C. should ensure it does not take any action that would harm investors by facilitating the pernicious use of such poison pills.
This column expands on a discussion that was part of a Conference Board debatewith Martin Lipton.

HEADLINE: The Fed Gets a Bubble Cop

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: In a speech on Thursday, Jeremy C. Stein, who joined the Fed's board of governors last year, focused on parts of the financial markets that show signs of overheating. 

 BODY:
Watch out, Wall Street. The Federal Reserve, a primary banking regulator, is trying harder to spot speculative excesses. 
In a speech on Thursday, Jeremy C. Stein, who joined the Fed's board of governors last year, focused on parts of the financial markets that show signs of overheating. He went into considerable detail, citing metrics that appear designed to spot bubbles. Specifically, Mr. Stein raised a red flag about junk bonds and mortgage-backed securities, and how investors are financing their purchases of such assets.
Wall Street has often been a facilitator of bubbles, and in their formation, financiers find plenty of seemingly sound justifications for strongly rising asset prices. 
Of course, the Fed is against rampant speculation weakening the banks and distorting the wider economy. But central bank officials say they do not want to take tough action like raising interest rates to stamp out speculation in specific asset classes, because such a response may unnecessarily cool large sectors of the real economy that are not frothy. 
Testifying before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in 2010, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, explained why, in the middle of the last decade, the central bank did not raise interest rates to stifle what appeared to be an overheating housing market. 
"Monetary policy is a blunt tool," he said. "Raising the general level of interest rates to manage a single asset price would undoubtedly have had large side effects on other assets and sectors of the economy."
But that stance carries a big risk. What if the Fed fails to spot when localized speculation has tipped into something much more dangerous? 
Mr. Stein's speech shows that the Fed wants to get better at making that distinction.
First, he says, after many months of extremely low interest rates, there are signs of frothiness. He sees it especially in junk bonds and securities backed with mortgages. 
Mr. Stein takes things a step further, though. He addresses those parts of the market infrastructure that could magnify the pain caused by a potential sell-off in such bonds. In particular, he focused on the link between short-term borrowing and bond purchases. Financial firms take out short-term loans and use that money to buy longer-term, higher-yielding assets.
But in jittery times, short-term loans stop becoming available. Investors then have to sell the longer-term assets financed with the short-term debt. On a broad scale, this can cause vicious declines in longer-term assets, and paralysis across the system if the selling turns into a panic. The Fed, therefore, has to make sure that investors are not using too much of this short-term debt. 
Mr. Stein notes with approval that Wall Street firms are using less short-term borrowing to finance their vast inventories of bonds. But he also recognizes that disorderly selling of bonds could come from another source, like exchange-traded funds. 
"If investors in these vehicles seek to withdraw at the first sign of trouble, then this demandable equity will have the same fire-sale-generating properties as short-term debt," he said.
Mr. Stein singles out a sector that has recently grown a lot - the investment funds that buy government-backed mortgages. They use repo loans to finance their investments. As of the fall, these real-estate investment trusts, or REITs, had nearly $400 billion of assets, up from around $150 billion at the end of 2010, Mr. Stein said. If repo costs go up and the mortgage bonds fall in price, the funds could suffer.
Industry analysts who cover such trusts are not worried, however. Even after their growth, the trusts represent only a small portion of the overall market for mortgage-backed bonds, says Bill Carcache, analyst at Nomura. He also said the trusts do not use an excessive amount of borrowed money. "Leverage levels are very comfortable," he said.
Mr. Stein then turned his gaze on commercial banks' mortgage-bond holdings. The longer a bond's maturity, or the amount of time investors have to wait to be fully paid off, the more sensitive it is to movements in interest rates. The Fed governor notes that the maturity of banks' mortgage bonds is near historical highs. "The added interest-rate exposure may itself be a meaningful source of risk for the banking sector and should be monitored carefully," he said, "especially since existing capital regulation does not explicitly address interest-rate risk."
But for all the forensics, Mr. Stein did not say whether there was frothiness in United States Treasury securities. With its enormous bond buying programs, designed to whip up economic growth, the Fed has driven up the price of government bonds. 
Critics say this is creating a bubble in Treasury securities, which has to be serious because they make up such a large asset class. Skeptics add that all the big central banks are buying large amounts of government debt, encouraging unstable levels of government borrowing. This could harm the wider economy in the same way excessive mortgage debt did, they say. 
One critic is Kevin Duffy, a portfolio manager at Bearing Asset Management, a hedge fund. In response to Mr. Stein's speech, he asked, "Where is the mention of debt buildups at the government level that the central banks are enabling?"
 An earlier version of this article misstated the effect of the Federal Reserve's programs on bond prices. The moves have driven the price of government bonds up, not down. (It is the yields on the government bonds that have been driven down by the Fed's actions).

HEADLINE: Ford Expects 900 Dealers for Its Plug-Ins by the Spring

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: The 900 dealerships represent about a third of the company's total sales outlets in the United States, Ford said. 

 BODY:
Ford said Wednesday that it expected to increase the number of dealers certified to sell its plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles to more than 900 in all 50 states by this spring. Amanda Zusman, a Ford spokeswoman, said in an interview that Ford was now "closing in" on 500 certified dealers. "It's moving very quickly," she said. The 900 dealerships represent about a third of the company's total sales outlets in the United States, Ford said. 
Ford is selling the Focus Electric and plug-in hybrid C-Max Energi. The Energi version of the Fusion goes on sale this winter. Only 774 Focus Electrics were sold through January and 2,712 C-Max Energis in the same period. Ford said in a statement that its dealer surge "reflects increased demand for the company's electrified vehicles."
Chad D'Arcy, marketing manager for the Focus Electric, said in an interview that, to become certified, dealers had to undergo product training, install at least two Ford-branded Leviton charging stations, undergo an energy-efficiency assessment, display point-of-purchase materials and acquire the necessary service tools.
Making the cars more available, which Ford has been talking about for months, is just one part of the company's strategy to sell more plug-in cars. Last month the company also reduced the cost of the slow-selling Focus Electric's three-year lease by up to $10,750 for customers taking retail delivery by April 1 and offered a $2,000 discount on cash purchases. Credit buyers get 1.9 percent financing through Ford.
Mr. D'Arcy said the lease price cut was in part a pass-along of the $7,500 federal tax credit that was available to consumers who buy the car, but accrued to the company in leases. "We're making the lease customers whole," he said.

HEADLINE: Rings of Unemployment

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Four out of five Americans have relatives or friends who were laid off during the last few years or were laid off themselves, a study shows. 

 BODY:
Four out of five Americans know relatives or family friends who were laid off during the last few years or were laid off themselves, as I reported in an article on a new report from the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University. 
In a January survey, the Heldrich Center asked Americans about their exposure to layoffs in the recession or its aftermath. A lot of respondents knew several people who had been laid off, but the researchers decided to segment responses by greatest proximity. 
They found that:

        
23 percent lost a job themselves;

        
among those not touched so far, another 11 percent said someone in their household had lost a job;

        
another 26 percent said a member of their extended family had lost a job;

        
another 13 percent said a close personal friend had lost a job;

        
if not touched by any of the conditions so far, another 5 percent said a close personal friend of someone else in the household had lost a job; and

        
the remaining 21 percent of respondents answered "no" to all these questions.
The findings were especially striking because unemployment has been unusually concentrated during the last few years, relative to previous downturns. 
Usually a lot of people churn in and out of unemployment during a recession. In the wake of the recent financial crisis, however, the layoffs were large but appeared more targeted, with people being very unlikely to cycle back into a job once displaced - hence the record lengths of unemployment duration for those who did lose their jobs. 
These new Heldrich data suggest that a lot more people were exposed to layoffs through friends and family. This is seen in other areas of the survey, too; for example, 4 in 10 respondents said they lent money to family or friends in the last few years. (Three in 10 said they were on the other side of this transaction, meaning they borrowed money from family or friends.)

HEADLINE: Makers vs. Takers: An Update

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A survey suggests that even those who might have the greatest need for government assistance subscribe to a mentality of self-reliance and bootstrapping. 

 BODY:
The last election cycle brought a lot of talk about "makers versus takers" in America: a dichotomy featuring entrepreneurial, taxpaying, self-reliant Americans who work hard and keep the economy going, as opposed to those who mooch off the government. 
As I reported in an article in Thursday's paper, though, a new survey suggests that even those who might have the greatest cravings for government cheese still subscribe to more of a bootstrap mentality.
The survey was conducted in January by the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University.
Asked about who should be "mainly responsible" for helping people who are laid off from work, just a quarter of people said the government. Another 42 percent said workers themselves, and 32 percent named employers. (And Americans are less likely to say that the government is mainly responsible for the displaced today than they were when asked in August 2010.)
In January, unemployed workers were more likely than the employed to say that the government was mainly responsible for helping the laid off -- 38 percent versus 27 percent -- but that still leaves only a minority of the unemployed saying they are chiefly the government's responsibility.
That said, when it comes to supporting specific government policies that would help the unemployed, a majority of all respondents supported almost every idea the researchers asked about. 
The one exception was on longer and higher unemployment benefits: Just shy of half of Americans support this. But the unemployed -- those who would presumably benefit from such a policy -- supported this idea by a wide margin, with 6 in 10 saying that benefits should be more generous.
 Unemployed workers were also more likely than the employed to support having the government create jobs for unemployed workers. Employed workers liked this idea a lot, too, though. 
The two groups were equally likely to support providing long-term education and training programs that help people change careers. 
On two proposals, the employed were more supportive than the unemployed: requiring people to enter training programs in order to receive unemployment insurance, and giving tax credits to businesses that hire workers. Again, a majority of both groups favored these ideas.
One caveat to keep in mind when thinking about these maker-versus-taker issues is that a lot of Americans don't realize they're relying on the social safety net when they actually are.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Allies Conduct Drills in Persian Gulf, a Signal to Iran

BYLINE: THOM SHANKER


HIGHLIGHT: The exercise included a simulation to test the policy-making and coordination of the American military and two dozen other nations, as well as drills at sea, in the air and on land. 

 BODY:
Deterring Iran is a delicate balance of diplomacy, sanctions and military muscle-flexing, all intended to send a strong signal - without proving so provocative that the region is pushed toward war. One piece of the effort - halting the proliferation of illicit weapons - got a practice run in the Persian Gulf this week. 
Although the exercise did not explicitly name an adversary, geography certainly pointed to Iran, as well as to militants of Al Qaeda still operating in the region. The exercise, which ended Thursday, included a headquarters simulation to test the policy-making and coordination among the American military and two dozen nations that joined, as well as an extensive component of military drills at sea, in the air and on land.
Pentagon officials do not hide the fact that halting suspected smugglers, and boarding their vessels and inspecting them, is in some ways easier than knitting together a coalition of countries to operate under the decade-old Proliferation Security Initiative. 
While there may be quiet agreement that Iran is a threat to regional stability, many nations - especially Iran's neighbors - want to avoid any appearance of belligerence that might make relations even worse. In fact, several of the countries in this week's exercise declined to officially confirm their participation.
That alliance cohesion problem is not new. When the Proliferation Security Initiative was begun by the administration of President George W. Bush, South Korea initially refused to join, for fear of angering North Korea. The government in Seoul eventually reversed the decision, and South Korea is among the nonproliferation program's current members, a number that has expanded to 102 nations from the original 11.
Separate from this current multinational exercise, American and Yemeni officials disclosed last week that a joint operation had interdicted a boat carrying a large load of explosives and weapons, including shoulder-launched antiaircraft weapons. Intelligence indicated that the shipment came from Iran and was destined for Houthi insurgent militants inside Yemen.
Even before the proliferation exercise ended this week, the American military's Central Command announced the scheduling of another exercise to practice mine countermeasures and maritime security in waters of the Middle East. Those skills would be necessary if Iran tried to close the Strait of Hormuz. More than 20 nations will participate in the exercise, set to begin in May. 
But budget difficulties in Washington may make sustaining a large American military presence in the region more difficult. The Pentagon announced this week that, temporarily at least, there would be only one aircraft carrier strike group on patrol in the region, down from the usual two. The reason: the Defense Department needs to save money.

HEADLINE: A Climate Proposal: Bundling Consumer Buying Power

BYLINE: LISA PALMER


HIGHLIGHT: To promote sustainable practices, a new nonprofit corporation proposes to help people team up when buying standard services. 

 BODY:
Each year, an estimated 46 percent of the population is responsible for 77 percent of discretionary spending in the United States. To strengthen individual buying power, a Santa Barbara-based entrepreneur and philanthropist has proposed a new social enterprise to finance climate change solutions, among other social justice and humanitarian issues.
The Big Idea, a nonprofit corporation founded by the entrepreneur Chris Norton and initially backed by his $11 million donation, is loosely modeled after the A.A.R.P., the membership organization that promotes the interests of retired people. The aim is to unify individuals with common interests. 
Acting as a green intermediary, The Big Idea bundles purchases of regular services like like cellphone plans and auto insurance -- what Mr. Norton calls "low-engagement products" -- to achieve social impact. By harnessing group buying power, members achieve a cost savings and share it with social justice and environmental action groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental Defense Fund and 350.org, among others.
The Big Idea doesn't plan to measure direct benefits to the environment. Contributions will be made to environmental action groups and social justice groups that size up their own success at meeting their strategic goals.
Mr. Norton, a Santa Barbara, Calif.-based executive and the co-author of an e-book titled "113 Million Markets of One," said that individuals may want to wield their economic power to help solve social issues but don't have a mechanism to do so as a group. Most don't take the time to do due diligence themselves, he said, especially on their regular "service" purchases.
"The Big Idea has the ethics of Patagonia, scalability of Facebook, and buying power of Costco," Mr. Norton said. With grass-roots buying power, they can support companies that "pay a living wage to employees, take care of the environment and pay taxes in the U.S.," he said. The group can also help consumers foster environmental solutions through purchases that are not ordinarily associated with the environment.
Is all of this feasible?
Americus Reed, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School, said that social impact branding is a popular topic in marketing these days, especially among start-ups seeking to leverage the idea that consumers can do something for the collective good. He cites Warby Parker, a company that sells designer eyeglasses and donates a certain amount of money to purchase glasses for people in poor countries.
"As a way to differentiate your company right now, social impact branding is a hot branding approach," Dr. Reed said.
Yet as more and more companies develop a social brand, consumers will become desensitized and the tactic will prove less effective, he predicts.
"By the time you hear about the 15th company doing something like this, then sometimes consumers will have a skeptical reaction," he said. " 'It's just a marketing gimmick,' they'll say, as opposed to being an authentic DNA of the company. So that's a big challenge for sustaining this kind of branding over time."
Often consumers doubt that their individual choices will make a difference. "In the tragedy of the commons, everyone assumes everyone else is going to help, and no one ends up helping," Dr. Reed said. In addition, he said consumers have much opportunity with social media to do the philanthropic giving themselves.
Yet a word-of-mouth, groundswell approach might help change consumer thinking around something so tedious as paying a phone bill, he said, if The Big Idea can counter the inertia. 
"It's going to be a huge challenge," he said.

HEADLINE: Growing Work Force Accounts for High Jobless Rate, Study Says

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: A study by the Independent Budget Office seeks to explain the discrepancy between New York's job growth and its high unemployment rate. 

 BODY:
 It has been one of the economic mysteries of post-recession New York: If the city is creating so many jobs, why has the unemployment rate stayed so high? 
 That question has confounded city officials and economists alike for the last two years. While Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been taking credit for healthy gains in employment, the city's official unemployment rate has remained higher than the nation's.
 At the end of 2012, the city's unemployment rate was 8.8 percent, a full percentage point higher than the national rate, according to the federal Labor Department. City officials have dismissed the unemployment figures as flawed and emphasized a different survey by the department that has found the number of private-sector jobs to be growing significantly faster in the city than across the rest of the country.
 In a study released on Thursday (see also below), the Independent Budget Office tested a few explanations for the divergent data and concluded that the job gains have indeed been robust, but the unemployment rate is not exaggerated. 
 How can that be? After analyzing census data, the budget office found that the unemployment rate was rising because the city's labor force was growing just as fast as jobs were being added. That finding supports Mr. Bloomberg's oft-stated claim that the city's relatively strong recovery has attracted new residents seeking work.
 In 2011, census data showed, the number of city residents with jobs rose by 57,000, or more than 10 times as many as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. During that year, the number of unemployed city residents declined slightly to 368,200 from 371,400, the study found. That decline would have reduced the city's unemployment rate very little over the year, to 8.9 percent from 9.1 percent.
 The study, which was prepared by Julie Anna M. Golebiewski, also gave little credence to some theories that economists had offered for the discrepancies in the jobs and unemployment statistics. One of those explanations was that most of new jobs in the city were taken by commuters who lived in the surrounding suburbs. Others included a shift from self-employment to working for bigger companies and an increase in the number of New Yorkers holding more than one job. 
 But the study concluded that "none of the three explanations explain more than a small share of the discrepancy" between the two sets of data. Its conclusion that employment was growing fast but barely fast enough to absorb all the new job seekers is good news for city officials because a growing work force is usually a harbinger of a recovery in employment.

HEADLINE: Bellevue Hospital Fully Returns 99 Days After Evacuation

BYLINE: ANDY NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Bellevue Hospital Center, New York City's flagship public hospital, lost even its backup generators when its basement flooded, and it reopened piecemeal. 

 BODY:
 Ninety-nine days after it was evacuated in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, Bellevue Hospital Center fully reopened on Thursday. 
 Bellevue, New York City's flagship public hospital, had been reopening piecemeal, but it has now resumed its status as a Level 1 trauma center and opened all 828 inpatient beds. Bellevue was evacuated for the first time in its history Oct. 31, two days after the storm first hit the city. The hospital's basement flooded with millions of gallons of water and fuel pumps for its backup power generators failed. Three hundred patients were evacuated in the darkness that night. 
 Part of the work of getting the hospital back on line involved moving major equipment like electrical switching gear from the basement up to the first floor.
 "It has been a labor of almost unimaginable scope, but Bellevue is back," said Alan D. Aviles, president of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation. 
Another city hospital that was forced to evacuate by the storm, Coney Island Hospital, is also making progress. Its Tower Building has reopened along with most of its inpatient beds, and the hospital is admitting walk-in patients from its emergency department and patients from other city facilities, the city said.

HIGHLIGHT: John Boehner's faulty memory. 

 BODY:
John Boehner speaks:
"At some point, Washington has to deal with its spending problem," Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said Wednesday. "I've watched them kick this can down the road for 22 years since I've been here. I've had enough of it. It's time to act." 
22 years, huh? Indeed, Boehner was elected in 1990, and entered the House at the beginning of 1991. So what kind of can-kicking was going on during his first, say, decade in office? Here's the picture:
Hmm -- it sort of looks as if the US was sharply reducing its debt during the presidency of a guy named, I don't know, Bill something or other.
OK, joking aside, this is important. Republicans have invented a history in which it has been fiscal irresponsibility all along -- and far too many centrists have bought into the premise. The reality is that we had low debt and no fiscal problem before Reagan; then an unprecedented surge in peacetime, non-depression deficits under Reagan/Bush; then a major improvement under Clinton; then a squandering of the Clinton surplus via tax cuts and unfunded wars of choice under Bush. And yes, a surge in debt once the Great Recession hit, but that's exactly when you should be running deficits.
The point about the fake history that expunges the Clinton years is that it turns the budget into a story in which nobody is at fault because everyone is at fault, and the problem is a generic issue of runaway spending. No, it isn't; we would have come into this crisis with very little debt if the GOP hadn't always insisted on tax cuts.

HEADLINE: America's Genius Glut

BYLINE: By ROSS EISENBREY. 
Ross Eisenbrey is the vice president of the Economic Policy Institute.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
WHILE genuine immigration reform has the potential to fix a seriously broken system, four senators have introduced a bill to solve a problem we don't have: the supply of high-tech workers.
The bill's authors, led by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, argue that America would benefit from letting more immigrants trained in science, technology, engineering and math work in the country, with the sponsorship of high-tech companies like Microsoft and I.B.M.
But the opposite is the case: the bill would flood the job market with indentured foreign workers, people who could not switch employers to improve their wages or working conditions; damage the employment prospects of hundreds of thousands of skilled Americans; and narrow the educational pipeline that produces these skilled workers domestically. 
The impetus for the bill, which would give six-year visas to as many as 300,000 foreign high-tech workers a year, is the longstanding lament by business leaders that they cannot find the talent they need in the American labor market. In their version, there is a shortage of scientists and engineers, and the United States is failing to keep substantial numbers of foreign students in the country. As a result, our position as the world's leading high-tech economy is in danger.
Fortunately, they argue, H-1B visas -- our guest-worker program for high-tech workers -- brings us ''the best and the brightest'' in the world. We just don't give out enough of them.
But America's technology leadership is not, in fact, endangered. According to the economist Richard B. Freeman, the United States, with just 5 percent of the world's population, employs a third of its high-tech researchers, accounts for 40 percent of its research and development, and publishes over a third of its science and engineering articles. And a marked new crop of billion-dollar high-tech companies has sprung up in Silicon Valley recently, without the help of an expanded guest-worker program.
Nor are we turning away foreign students, or forcing them to leave once they've graduated. According to the Congressional Research Service, the number of full-time foreign graduate students in science, engineering and health fields has grown by more than 50 percent, from 91,150 in 1990 to 148,900 in 2009. And over the 2000s, the United States granted permanent residence to almost 300,000 high-tech workers, in addition to granting temporary work permits (for up to six years) to hundreds of thousands more.
The bill's proponents argue that for the sake of our global competitiveness, we shouldn't train and then return the tens of thousands of Chinese and Indian students who come here every year. But almost 90 percent of the Chinese students who earn science and technology doctorates in America stay here; the number is only slightly lower for Indians. If they're talented enough to get a job here, they're already almost guaranteed a visa.
If anything, we have too many high-tech workers: more than nine million people have degrees in a science, technology, engineering or math field, but only about three million have a job in one. That's largely because pay levels don't reward their skills. Salaries in computer- and math-related fields for workers with a college degree rose only 4.5 percent between 2000 and 2011. If these skills are so valuable and in such short supply, salaries should at least keep pace with the tech companies' profits, which have exploded.
And while unemployment for high-tech workers may seem low -- currently 3.7 percent -- that's more than twice as high as it was before the recession.
If there is no shortage of high-tech workers, why would companies be pushing for more? Simple: workers under the H-1B program aren't like domestic workers -- because they have to be sponsored by an employer, they are more or less indentured, tied to their job and whatever wage the employer decides to give them.
Moreover, too many are paid at wages below the average for their occupation and location: over half of all H-1B guest workers are certified for wages in the bottom quarter of the wage scale.
Bringing over more -- there are already 500,000 workers on H-1B visas -- would obviously darken job prospects for America's struggling young scientists and engineers. But it would also hurt our efforts to produce more: if the message to American students is, ''Don't bother working hard for a high-tech degree, because we can import someone to do the job for less,'' we could do significant long-term damage to the high-tech educational system we value so dearly.
There is no question that the immigration system needs major reform. But let's not break anything else in the process.

Museums
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Life, Death and Transformation in the Americas' (continuing) For generations, one of the first things visitors to Brooklyn Museum encountered was the Hall of the Americas, the two-story rotunda right off the main lobby. And when you were in it, you knew you were home. A few years ago during renovations, the museum put the Americas material in storage, but now it's back in new galleries on the fifth floor. The look is very different -- ultraminimalist Arctic white and sky blue -- but the 102 objects, from a collection that is a jewel in Brooklyn's crown, are utterly gripping. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter) 
Brooklyn Museum: 'Go: a community-curated open studio project' (through Feb. 24) Inspired by ArtPrize, an art competition in Grand Rapids, Mich., that awards money to artists based on votes by the public, and by local open-studios programs, the Brooklyn Museum created a contest in which the award was a spot in this exhibition. More than 1,800 artists registered with the museum; visitors went out to their studios and voted; and the Top 10 artists were whittled down to 5 by Brooklyn Museum curators. The results are less than stellar. ''Go'' has not unearthed any hidden masters of the borough, but it does raise questions about who should choose what appears in museums and what constitutes ''great'' art. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Materializing ''Six Years'': Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art' (through Feb. 17) This big, intellectually enthralling exhibition of Conceptual works from the 1960s and early '70s is not a conventional museum period survey. Rather, it approximates how the rise of Conceptualism was seen while it was happening by one person: the curator, critic and writer Lucy R. Lippard, who was an extraordinarily energetic participant in and promoter of a trend that brought us the triumph of mind over matter in art. Anyone who wants art to be radically defiant of the market-driven system must see it. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Zarina: Paper Like Skin' (through April 21) ''Paper is an organic material, almost like human skin,'' the artist Zarina Hashmi has said. In her exhibition at the Guggenheim, it's that and more: paper is sculpture, poetry, currency and, above all, a kind of permanent home for a nomadic spirit. Her art speaks poignantly, though sometimes opaquely, of relocation and exile; works like the 2001 woodcut ''Dividing Line'' reference the violent 1947 partition of India and Pakistan, while ''Ten Thousand Things,'' a set of small paper collages recreating works from her oeuvre, nods to Duchamp's museum-in-a-suitcase. (Karen Rosenberg)
Jewish Museum: 'Sharon Lockhart/Noa Eshkol' (through March 24) Sharon Lockhart's film installation is based on the dances by Noa Eshkol (1924-2007), a little-known (in this country) Israeli choreographer who, along with the architect Avraham Wachman, developed a system that uses numbers and symbols to record body movement. Ms. Lockhart's photographs are of spherical models designed by Ms. Eshkol and Mr. Wachman; ephemera include actual notation, posters announcing Ms. Eshkol's performances and historical photographs. Textile works on display upstairs were made by Ms. Eshkol later in her life. The total functions as a new project by Ms. Lockhart and as a two-person exhibition, a combination of homage and appropriation that both recuperates a ''forgotten'' artist and respectfully presents her work and ideas, while simultaneously mining them to create a new body of artwork. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through Sept. 2) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'George Bellows' (through Feb. 18) Organized by the National Gallery in Washington, this exhibition starts strong with the lush early paintings of New York City and its residents for which Bellows is justifiably well known. It then devotes more than half its space to a disorganized reprise of his restless but steady artistic decline, which ended with his death in 1925 at 42 from a ruptured appendix. It does little to clarify his achievement, partly because of the short shrift given to his plein air oil studies and late landscape paintings. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Matisse: In Search of True Painting' (through March 17) This stunning exhibition skims across the great French modernist's long, productive career with a mere 49 stellar, often pivotal paintings arranged in pairs or groups according to subject. Examining his penchant for working in series and copying his own canvases, they shed new light on the arduous evolution of Matisse's seemingly effortless art, forming one of the most thrillingly instructive exhibitions about the artist, or painting in general, that you may ever see. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Path of Nature: French Paintings from the Wheelock Whitney Collection, 1785-1850' (through April 21) ''Sparkle with repose'' was the effect the British artist John Constable said he was after in his landscapes. His French contemporaries had the same idea. Today, Constable's a star. But León Pallière? Adrien Dauzats? Alexandre-Hyacinthe Dunouy? Only wonkish scholars are likely to know their names. Lucky for them, and for us, that one of those scholars is Whitney Wheelock III, who has a passion for French art from the years between neo-classicism and Romanticism, and a special love for gleaming little oil sketches done out of doors. In 2003 he gave his pictures to the Met, where 50 of them, along with some exquisitely funky genre paintings, make up this small gem of a show. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Huma Bhabha: Unnatural Histories' (through April 1) In this midcareer survey, long-enduring forms from the ancient world lend some gravity to the throwaway materials that are now commonplace in contemporary sculpture. You could also say that the precariousness of recent assemblage and installation art haunts Ms. Bhabha's monstrous, totemic figures, which are typically made of Styrofoam, clay, rubber, wood scraps and wire mesh; either way, the juxtaposition is arresting. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt: Tender Love Among the Junk' (through April 1) Mr. Lanigan-Schmidt makes luminous art out of trash: candy wrappers, cling wrap, reflective plastics, aluminum foil, plastic bottles, beer cans and too many other kinds of cheap refuse to list. As this four-decade retrospective reveals, his devotion to his materials and hobbylike processes has yielded an oeuvre of transcending beauty, eroticized religiosity and poignant autobiography. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
MoMA PS1: 'Now Dig This! Art & Black Los Angeles 1960-1980' (through March 11) This exhibition of works by black artists who lived and worked in Los Angeles during a time of revolutionary changes happening in art and society had its debut at the Hammer Museum last year as part of the citywide extravaganza ''Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980.'' Focusing mainly on assemblage, the show includes pieces by Melvin Edwards, Betye Saar, David Hammons and nearly 30 others. It contributes a valuable chapter to the American art history of the last 50 years. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Drawing Surrealism' (through April 21) This sensational show of 165 works by 70 artists from 15 countries traces the movement from its early automatist stirrings to the doorstep of Abstract Expressionism. Expanding the field of players with numerous new names, it also has a wonderful clarity, organized according to the techniques that the Surrealists commandeered (collage and photography), breathed life into (frottage, decalcomania and exquisite corpse) and frequently crossbred. It may be among the best encapsulations of Surrealism you will ever see. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Arts and Design: 'Doris Duke's Shangri La: Architecture, Landscape and Islamic Art' (through Feb. 17) The Honolulu estate known as Shangri La is a masterpiece of refined eclecticism. Doris Duke, the owner, referred to it as a ''Spanish-Moorish-Persian-Indian complex.'' Whatever you call it, it looks magnificent in this show and the accompanying book. Both combine sparkling new color shots of the home and gardens taken by Tim Street-Porter; architectural documents and vintage photographs; pieces of the collection; and projects by contemporary artists who had residencies at Shangri La (which has served, since Duke's death in 1993, as the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art). 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Artist's Choice: Trisha Donnelly' (through April 8) The 10th artist invited to select an exhibition from the Modern's collection does the series proud. Installed in three far-flung galleries within the museum's vaunted painting and sculpture collection, her effort disturbs the march of masterworks by concentrating on photographs, drawings and other works on paper as well as several kinds of design. At every turn it asks what is art, who is an artist and what makes for greatness? (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Inventing Abstraction: 1910-1925' (through April 15) The pursuit of the holy grail of early modernism at its most feverish is presented as a multiple-medium, multinational effort in this dizzying, magisterial cornucopia. The 350-plus works by 84 artists encompass painting, sculpture, music, poetry, dance, film and photography; alternate between the tentative and the prescient; and capture something of both the terrors and thrills of the project, with clusters of paintings by Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian among the high points. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Edvard Munch: The Scream' (through April 29) A version of Edvard Munch's ''Scream'' is on view at this museum for the next six months, having come almost straight from the auction block. Protected by a Plexiglas box, like the Mona Lisa, it has been given a prominent perch opposite van Gogh's ''Starry Night'' in the fifth-floor painting and sculpture galleries. There is talk of timed tickets. But if you can put up with all the pageantry, you'll have a rare chance to get acquainted with ''The Scream'' in person and in context. The museum has built a mini-exhibition around the work, surrounding it with Munch paintings and prints that amplify its motifs and mood. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Projects 99: Meiro Koizumi' (through May 6) It would be hard to find another work of contemporary art that protests war with such soulful grace as Meiro Koizumi's ''Defect in Vision'' (2011), the main attraction of this small show. This 12-minute, black-and-white video dramatizes a final conversation between a kamikaze pilot and his wife, both of whom are blind, as they eat together in a small, old-world-style dining room. It is a riveting meditation on the doomed, myth-saturated mind of Japan's warrior class in the last days of World War II. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Tokyo 1955-1970: A New Avant-Garde' (through Feb. 25) Modernist art, insurgent and utopian, ignited like a firecracker cluster in cities across the globe in the early 20th century, and Tokyo was one of them. Rising from the ashes after World War II, it produced huge amounts of new art, feisty, fantastic, often politically subversive. And a wave of it comes surging out at you like a blast of sound -- half noise, half music -- in this surprising exhibition made up of loans from Japan and little-seen material from MoMA's collection. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
Museum of Modern Art: Wolfgang Laib: 'Pollen From Hazelnut' (through March 11) Mr. Laib is the honeybee of the international art world. Since the 1970s, his trademark activity has been gathering pollen from trees and plants in the countryside near his home in southern Germany. He puts the pollen in bottles and flies to distant places around the world to create ephemeral installations of yellow dust on museum and gallery floors and inseminate the minds of his viewers with thoughts of harmony between human civilization and nature. ''Pollen From Hazelnut,'' in MoMA's atrium, is his largest pollen field to date. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through Aug. 5) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Schwendener)
New-York Historical Society: 'John Rogers: American Stories' (through Feb. 18) The sculptor John Rogers (1829-1904) was the Norman Rockwell of his time. For a few decades following the Civil War, his lively, anecdotal, figurative tableaus known as Rogers Groups sold by the tens of thousands to middle- and upper-middle-class folks for about $15 apiece. Including examples of the technically impressive bronze masters from which the multiples were cast in plaster, this exhibition showcases an artist who was as remarkable for his entrepreneurial savvy as for his idealistic vision of life in America. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Radical Terrain' (through April 29) The third and last of three beautifully produced, back-to-back mini-surveys in the series Modernist Art From India, this exhibition combines landscape painting done in India in the years following independence in 1947 with recent work by young artists -- some South Asian, most not -- that corresponds to or comments on the older art. Small in size and unfamiliar in content, the show is large with history. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; South Street Seaport Museum: 'Compass: Folk Art in Four Directions' (through March 31) The American Folk Art Museum presents some 200 works from its unparalleled collection in this beautifully orchestrated exhibition. Paintings, sculpture, textiles, scrimshaw, painted furniture and much, much more are arrayed along themes that reflect the history of Lower Manhattan -- seafaring, commerce, social life and that all-important factor, the weather -- but not too tightly. Poetic license is taken, yielding an intricate constellation of connected artworks, histories and concerns that highlights one of the city's great treasures. 12 Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 748-8600, southstreetseaportmuseum.org; folkartmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Fore' (through March 10) In 2001 the Studio Museum in Harlem opened a dynamite group exhibition called ''Freestyle,'' which turned out to be the first in a series of shows introducing emerging artists of African-American descent. In the latest edition, ''Fore,'' organized by three young staff curators, Lauren Haynes, Naima J. Keith and Thomas J. Lax, covers the waterfront in terms of media, which it samples and mixes with turntablist flair, and in its contents, ranging from abstract to personal to political, sometimes combining all three. Firelei Báez, Sadie Barnette, Crystal Z. Campbell, Zachary Fabri, Yashua Klos, Akosua Adoma Owusu, Valerie Piraino and Nikki Pressley are some of the names to look for. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Sinister Pop' and 'Dark and Deadpan: Pop in TV and the Movies' (through March 31) The dark and truculent mood of this collection show is conversant with recent presentations of Warhol's death-and-disaster paintings, but the curators make plenty of room for other artists (including photographers). The point is not to cast a pall over Pop as we know it; it's to find common ground between the winking consumerism of early-1960s art and the antiwar, anti-corporate sentiment of work made later in the decade and into the 1970s. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)
Galleries: Chelsea
Paul Laffoley: 'The Boston Visionary Cell' (through March 9) Judging by his mandala-type compositions on usually square canvases, Mr. Laffoley has yet to encounter a system of mystical thought he could not absorb into his own project. Profusely annotated with press-on vinyl letters, his works refer to a dizzying array of mental adventurers from Socrates to the Theosophist charlatan Madame Blavatsky. This show is an excellent introduction to one of the most unusual creative minds of our time. Kent Fine Art, 210 West 11th Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets, (212) 365-9500, kentfineart.net. (Johnson)
Daniel Buren: 'Electricity, paper, vinyl...' (through Feb. 16) This well-known French Conceptualist, who reduced painting to awning stripes printed on canvas or paper, has probably eked more mileage out of this end-of-painting motif than anyone should rightly expect. In the better of two concurrent solo shows nearly around the corner from each other, he tailors earlier pieces to the gallery's architecture, creating what are in effect intermittent expanses of wallpaper that alter our sense of a space and create a nice graphic, even decorative punch. Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 456 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9467, petzel.com. (Smith)
Daniel Buren: 'Electricity Fabric Paint Paper Vinyl' (through Feb. 16) Here, the French artist Daniel Buren adds several new twists to his signature awning-striped canvas, including sheets of Plexiglas, luminescence and glowing strands of fiber optics. In addition to being arbitrary, conventional art-objects, the results conjure the early-1960s efforts of artists like Frank Stella and Robert Mangold. These pieces might as well be derivative student works that Mr. Buren abandoned to make the site-specific pieces for which he is known. Bortolami, 520 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2050, bortolamigallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'Distance and Desire: Encounters with the African Archive (Part II: Contemporary Reconfigurations)' (through March 9) Africa is an unstinting source of new photography, of which New York would see little were it not for a few commercial galleries and the Walther Collection. Last fall the Walther, a German foundation with a project space in Chelsea, initiated a series of three consecutive exhibitions under the umbrella title ''Distance and Desire: Encounters With the African Archive.'' The first show included European ethnographic photography. The current one illustrates how much a product of invention and fantasy ethnography can be. The Walther Collection Project Space, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 718, (212) 352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)
Maria Loboda: 'General Electric' (through Feb. 16) The small, isolated works here, by an artist who contributed a ''moving forest'' to last summer's Documenta festival, find natural forces resisting our attempts to tame or harness them. In photographs, traditional English gardens, with their rows of conical shrubberies, are set against marbled backgrounds. More intriguing are the tree branches and clumps of selenite (a mineral found in the desert) that hang from points along the ceiling, and a series of blackened steel bars that define the edges of the gallery. Andrew Kreps, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 741-8849, andrewkreps.com. (Rosenberg)
John A. Parks: 'Paint and Memory' (through Feb. 16) The strange, seemingly innocent paintings that dominate this show are small, based on the artist's childhood memories and painted with his fingers. The loosely Pointillist, somewhat Vuillardian hazes of color, light and form that result demarcate trees, gardens, brick buildings, puffy clouds and, above all, scrambling children, whose feral energy and natural subversiveness are vividly conveyed. The distinction between illustration and painting is rendered moot by the teeming quality of both surface and subject. 532 Gallery Thomas Jaeckel, 532 West 25th Street, (917) 701-3338, 532gallery.com. (Smith)
Jacolby Satterwhite: 'The Matriarch's Rhapsody' (through Feb. 16) Mr. Satterwhite's eight-minute video ''Reifying Desire 5,'' the main attraction of his first solo show in New York, is a hallucinogenic tossed salad of different kinds of animation. In a silver jump suit, Mr. Satterwhite dances athletically through a vertiginous flux of glimmering abstract and representational imagery, including offbeat texts -- rendered like rubbery neon signs -- from drawings by his mother. Monya Rowe, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-5065, monyarowegallery.com. (Johnson)
Suzanne Treister: 'Hexen 2.0' (through Feb. 23) This British artist has a unifying theory about everything that would concern a person worried about the current global state of affairs. Ms. Treister delivers her thinking in the form of a set of Tarot cards, each card illustrating in diagrammatic cartoon drawings and handwritten text a person, idea or event that changed the course of 20th-century history. The individually framed, hand-colored prints resemble the efforts of a paranoid hippie. P.P.O.W, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 647-1044, ppowgallery.com. (Johnson)
Galleries: SoHo
Martin Soto Climent: 'Mariposas Migratorias (Migratory Butterflies)' (through March 2) Martin Soto Climent, who is from Mexico City, is a Conceptual sculptor in the mold of Gabriel Orozco and Damián Ortega; his works, like theirs, often produce succinct poetry from the slightest recontexualizations, juxtapositions and alterations of found objects. That's almost the case in his latest solo show, where the primary material (automobile windshields) and the key metaphor (migratory butterflies) never quite connect. Clifton Benevento, 515 Broadway, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo, (212) 431-6325, cliftonbenevento.com. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Richard Ross: 'Juvenile-in-Justice' (through Feb. 16) Over the past five years Richard Ross has been photographing juvenile detention facilities across the country and inmates, male and female, most in their midteens. Some were imprisoned for violent crimes and would eventually be transferred to adult prisons. Others were in for lesser offenses and less time. Lockdown oversight rather than outreach therapy seems the institutional rule. Conceptually, the show is a sobering trip down the dead-end street that is America's prison system. Visually, it's as gripping as any art around, and comes with a memorable epigraph by Booker T. Washington: ''The study of art that does not result in making the strong less willing to oppose the weak means little.'' Ronald Feldman Fine Art, 31 Mercer Street, (212) 226-3232, feldmangallery.com. (Cotter)
Alexandre Singh: 'The Pledge' (through March 13) One of the first projects done in the United States by the French-born, British-raised artist Alexandre Singh was a sprawling, delirious collaboration with Jonah Freeman and Justin Lowe titled ''Hello Meth Lab in the Sun,'' installed at the Ballroom Marfa in Texas. Mr. Singh's solo exhibition at the Drawing Center is another full-gallery, somewhat psychedelic installation, albeit a considerably more subdued one. Black-and-white inkjet prints of collages that Mr. Singh made in response to interviews with artists and scientists are arranged like maps and schematics on the gallery's walls. It's a sleek display, vibrating with art historical references. But despite the high-tone interview subjects and visual references the show is unsparingly vapid, about as exciting as paging through a design magazine. 35 Wooster Street, Soho, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Schwendener)
Galleries: Other
Maya Bloch: 'here you are' (through Feb. 17) Borrowing a few weapons from the Surrealists' arsenal of automatism, Maya Bloch takes aim at the figure in her third solo at Thierry Goldberg. Muddling oil, ink and acrylic, Ms. Bloch generates an impressive range of effects: some faces are marbled, while others have rivulets of watery paint that bring to mind works by Max Ernst. Pieces with multiple figures, all with dark, deep-set eyes and pasty white faces, start to feel formulaic. But the solo characters have distinct personalities, even if their bodies appear to be on the brink of dissolution. Thierry Goldberg Gallery, 103 Norfolk Street, between Rivington and Delancey Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 967-2260, thierrygoldberg.com. (Rosenberg)
'Beat Memories: The Photographs of Allen Ginsberg' (through April 6) During two periods in his life -- from the early 1950s to about 1964 and from the early '80s until his death in 1997 -- the poet Allen Ginsberg made photographs and added handwritten captions. Images of his now famous pals, including the writers Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs and Gregory Corso, as well as Neal Cassady, their logorrheic muse, make this show required viewing for Beat fans. (A panel of scholars will discuss Ginsberg's work in photography, film and sound on Thursday at 6:30 p.m.) Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info.

Out of Town
&#x2605; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden: 'Ai Weiwei: According to What?' (through Feb. 24) As seen in its first American survey, the work of the lionhearted Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, is no match for his prominent role as a human rights advocate. The sculptures and installation pieces too often adhere to the fashionable international genre of handsome, Conceptually generated artworks. Explanatory labels do much of the heavy lifting, along with historically-charged materials and objects, like Chinese antique furniture and wood from destroyed Qing dynasty temples. The artist's photographs and videos suggest that his documentary work may be best. On the National Mall, at Independence Avenue Southwest and Seventh Street, Washington, (202) 633-4674, hirshhorn.si.edu; free. (Smith)
&#x2605; Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art: 'Oh, Canada' (through April 8) Seesawing between bigness and intimacy, the personal and the communal, this 62-artist survey of contemporary art in the Great White North may tell you more about Canada's identity crisis than it does about Canadian art. A sense of place, if not nationhood, does emerge in stark photographs of Newfoundland by Ned Pratt and Kim Morgan's hanging latex cast of a lighthouse on Prince Edward Island. Elsewhere, cartoonlike pencil drawings by Annie Pootoogook and Shuvinai Ashoona depict contemporary Inuit life and the artist Amalie Atkins stars in a prairie fairy tale involving musical wolves and bears with golden teeth. 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, (413) 662-2111, massmoca.org. (Rosenberg)
Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'The Civil War and American Art' (through April 28) On the surface, this probing, perspective-altering exhibition, one of many events commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, looks straightforward, even ordinary. We know most of the paintings and photographs on sight; they're classics. What we know less well is their meaning within the context of the nation's single greatest internal catastrophe, and that's what the show is about. It travels to the Metropolitan Museum of Art this spring, running from May 21 to Sept. 2. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-7970, americanart.si.edu. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'Nam June Paik: Global Visionary' (through Aug. 11) Including a large and fascinating trove of material from the Nam June Paik archive, acquired by the Smithsonian from the artist's estate in 2009, this survey of the avant-garde musician, multimedia wizard and video art pioneer (1932-2006) looks startlingly current despite the preponderance of analog televisions and other obsolete hardware. It makes clear that contemporary artists like Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza owe a great deal to Mr. Paik's tweaked TV sets and frenetic, technically innovative videos. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-1000, americanart.si.edu. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Yale University Art Gallery (continuing) In a museum era dominated by vying forces of bad economics and compulsive building, it's a miracle when something comes out right, which makes the opening of the splendidly renovated and expanded Yale University Art Gallery a happy event. The angels of art, design and budgetary planning were on duty. Everything worked. The country's oldest university art museum has arrived at a kind institutional ideal of opposites in balance: an encyclopedic teaching museum, big enough to get lost in, small enough for intimate art encounters. New galleries of Indo-Pacific art are a particular attraction, but so are other collections, including one of the countries premier holdings in American art and a small, matchless display of very early Italian Renaissance painting. A special exhibition, ''Societe Anonyme: Modernism for America,'' made up of Yale-owned material, is on view through July 14. 1111 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203) 432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu. (Cotter)
Last Chance
&#x2605; Francis Alys: 'Reel-Unreel' (closes on Saturday) The tiny realist paintings -- sometimes complicated by the television color spectrum -- are negligible, but the video ''Reel-Unreel'' is one of the best efforts yet by this uneven artist. It follows two boys using two film reels connected by film as toy hoops and running them through the chaotic streets of Kabul, a feat of some agility that creates a self-devouring line. If this had been shown in the Kassel, Germany, portion of last summer's Documenta 13, rather than its Kabul offshoot, it would have been one of the exhibition's hits. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2072, davidzwirner.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Raw/Cooked: Duron Jackson' (closes on Sunday) As part of the museum's initiative for showing work of under-known Brooklyn artists, Duron Jackson, based in Bedford-Stuyvesant, has produced a lean, strong, subtle installation linking the historical African slave trade with the present incarceration of African Americans in the United States. A large chair -- A throne? An easy chair? An electric chair? -- made of stacked-up dominoes sits in the center of the space, surrounded by drawings, seemingly abstract, of prison floor plans. The whole black-and-white ensemble is surveilled by a larger-than-life-size 1928 bronze bust by Malvina Hoffman, ''Senegalese Soldier.'' An image of a black combatant from an African country that was a prime source of slaves, he is here both guard and captive. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; 'Calder: The Complete Bronzes' (closes on Saturday) The ingenious master of spare, levitating modern sculpture in wire, wood and sheet metal turns out to have been almost as adept with the ancient dead-weight staple of bronze, as demonstrated by 35 examples and some dozen plaster models in this eye-opening show. They run the gamut from figurative to abstract; dabble in Surrealism; achieve their own kind of levitation; and delve into art history while enabling the artist to use his hands and amazing tactile sense in a different way. Mnuchin Gallery, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, mnuchingallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'Gaylen Gerber' (closes on Saturday) Starting from a gray-painted floor that coincidentally matches the gray-paper installation lining a small back room, Gaylen Gerber's latest New York appearance forms a modest, weirdly perfect entity, as well as a meditation on the monochrome. The monochromes are mostly appropriated artworks and artifacts meticulously painted white, gray or brown that also succinctly and insouciantly extend other 20th-century artistic conventions like the ready-made, appropriation, collaboration and homage as a form of (gentle) transgression. The ensemble bends both mind and eye. Wallspace, 619 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 594-9478, wallspacegallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Buddhism Along the Silk Route: 5th-8th Century' (closes on Sunday) For really fresh news about the past, the Met's temporary, often tucked-away collection shows are a sure bet. This exhibition is exemplary of the type. With more than 100 petite, gorgeous, soul-filled objects culled from storage and put together in the small, high-perched mezzanine gallery of the South and Southeast Asian wing. It tells the story of how art, which we think of as static, is ever on the move. The movement can be physical or in the form of ideas and beliefs. In this case, it spanned much of Asia. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Nathaniel Robinson: 'Outer Air' (closes on Saturday) Mr. Robinson's transporting, walk-in poem of an installation revolves around a watering hole for animals, whose simulated feces are scattered about, on an urban rooftop covered by asphalt paper. Its themes regarding nature, culture and consciousness may be heavy, but Mr. Robinson's deft way with metaphor, which calls to mind the early Robert Gober, keeps things light and fresh.

HEADLINE: Detroit, the Billionaire's Playground

BYLINE: By MARK BINELLI. 
Mark Binelli is a contributing editor at Rolling Stone and the author of ''Detroit City Is the Place to Be: The Afterlife of an American Metropolis.''

 BODY:
DETROIT
WITH the fourth anniversary of the Obama administration's auto bailout approaching, the Detroit comeback narrative has settled into accepted history. Just last week, Chrysler, once the wobbliest of the Big Three, announced a ninefold increase in profits since 2011. In its Sunday Super Bowl ad, the company exuded such confidence, it no longer felt the need to defensively celebrate Rust Belt grittiness with the help of Eminem or Clint Eastwood, going instead with a syrupy paean to the Farm Belt called ''God Made a Farmer.''
It wasn't immediately clear if God also made second-tier assembly line workers starting at 14 bucks an hour, but no matter. Detroit was back! Unless, of course, by ''Detroit'' you meant the actual city rather than the auto industry, in which case, well, the picture becomes a bit more complicated. Battered for decades by the same problems -- a steady loss of people and jobs, a soaring murder rate, a wholesale erosion of its tax base -- the city now faces the prospect of running out of cash as soon as the end of the month, which would mean the largest municipal bankruptcy in United States history. 
Three recent proposals on ways to patch holes in Detroit's budget illustrate just how desperate things have become.
The first, and by far the most serious, came from Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, who offered to lease Belle Isle, a city-owned island park, around 985 acres, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted in 1883. Under the plan, in the works since last summer, the island would have become a state park with an entry fee, thus covering the annual $6 million in maintenance and operations costs -- funds sorely needed for the beloved landmark, which in recent years has fallen into disrepair. When the Detroit City Council president, Charles Pugh, insisted that ''Belle Isle is not about to sink into the Detroit River if we don't approve the lease,'' he was incorrect. And I mean literally: the city has not had the money to perform, in the words of The Detroit Free Press, the maintenance needed to keep the park ''from sinking into the Detroit River.''
Still, the council, under pressure from a vocal minority suspicious of ''outsiders'' looting Detroit's few remaining assets, postponed a long-planned vote on the Belle Isle proposal, prompting Governor Snyder to rescind his offer. Soon after, Mayor Dave Bing, who had supported the governor's plan, announced that he would be forced to close 51 other parks in order to keep Belle Isle, as it were, afloat. That means, according to another Free Press article, that ''Detroit, a city with 700,000 residents, will have only 57 of its 300-plus parks open starting this spring.''
Belle Isle was recently at the center of a different moneymaking scheme. A group of wealthy libertarians suggested that private investors buy the island from the city for the nice, round, Dr. Evil-ish sum of $1 billion and transform it into an independent, self-governing territory. With the price for citizenship set at $300,000, the Commonwealth of Belle Isle would exist as a sort of free-market paradise; within 30 years, the group's Web site predicted, the island would be known as the '' 'Midwest Tiger,' rivaling Singapore as an economic miracle.'' One can order from that Web site a novella about this future Belle Isle, which describes the commonwealth's low taxes, minimal government, even its own currency (called -- seriously -- ''the Rand'').
The book -- a preview of its opening chapter has the hero landing on the rooftop helipad of the commonwealth's 57-story Four Seasons hotel -- makes the entire scheme very easy to mock as Objectivist fan fiction. But it's not entirely a joke: private foundations and deep-pocketed members of the local business elite exercise an outsize influence in a city as broke as Detroit, providing financing for everything from a much-needed light-rail line to the ambitious Detroit Future City plan, which would entirely remap the city.
People like Dan Gilbert, the owner of Quicken Loans and the Cleveland Cavaliers, and Mike Ilitch, a founder of Little Caesars pizza, have been snatching up shuttered skyscrapers and prewar office buildings -- since December Mr. Gilbert has bought at least five buildings and, reputedly, an entire downtown city block -- as if they're Monopoly properties.
The third revenue-generating idea, in fact, came via Mr. Gilbert's Twitter feed. Why not, he mused, build a ''world-class Epcot-like car attraction'' in downtown Detroit? He bristled at indecorous comparisons to AutoWorld, Flint's failed 1980s attempt at just such an automobile theme park, made infamous in the documentary ''Roger & Me.''
Detroiters who are worried about ceding local power to Michigan's Republican governor shouldn't forget the ways in which power has already been ceded to an unelected oligarchy, whose members might, no matter how ostensibly well intentioned, possess questionable ideas about urban renewal.
All three of these tragicomic attempts to stanch the bleeding highlight the obvious: Detroit needs money. While the salvation of the auto companies remains a signature achievement of President Obama's first term, his inability to deal with the entrenched problems of cities like Detroit remains an enormous failure. When New York teetered on the brink of bankruptcy in the 1970s, it was famously told, in the headline of The Daily News, to ''Drop Dead.'' But then President Gerald R. Ford extended the city $2.3 billion in federal loans. That's 1975 billions! An impossible sum to imagine in our current age of austerity.
Here's hoping the libertarian billionaires turn out to be benign sovereigns.

HEADLINE: When Dancing Ended, and Disaster Set In

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
AFTER THE MUSIC STOPPEDThe Financial Crisis, the Response, and the Work Ahead
By Alan S. BlinderIllustrated. 476 pages. The Penguin Press. $29.95.
The title of Alan S. Blinder's highly readable new book on the financial crisis (yes, a readable book about economics) refers to an infamous remark made in July 2007 by Charles O. Prince III, then the chief executive of Citigroup. ''When the music stops, in terms of liquidity,'' he said, ''things will be complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance. We're still dancing.''
Of course, the music did come to an abrupt stop soon. For the United States and the world, the consequences of the fiscal meltdown of 2008 were calamitous, pushing America into the worst economic hole since the Great Depression and leaving us -- years later -- still coping with lingering unemployment, sluggish growth and huge deficit worries. 
Mr. Blinder, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, reminds us that the disaster was years in the making. Starting in the late 1990s and continuing through 2007, he writes, Americans had ''built a fragile house of financial cards'' that was just waiting to be toppled: ''The intricate but precarious construction was based on asset-price bubbles, exaggerated by irresponsible leverage, encouraged by crazy compensation schemes and excessive complexity, and aided and abetted by embarrassingly bad underwriting standards, dismal performances by the statistical rating agencies and lax financial regulation.''
This sorry tale of fiscal irresponsibility and chaos -- and the ways the Bush and Obama administrations grappled with the unspooling crises -- has been told many times before. The economists Nouriel Roubini (''Crisis Economics'') and Joseph E. Stiglitz (''Freefall'') have both written lively, accessible books addressing the causes and consequences of the cataclysm; David Wessel of The Wall Street Journal provided an engrossing account of how the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and President George W. Bush's Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., desperately tried to shore up the United States economy as one fiscal domino after another was toppling (''In Fed We Trust''); and an array of journalists including Michael Hirsh, Noam Scheiber, Ron Suskind and Bob Woodward have written books that look at President Obama's economic team and its handling of the recovery.
Mr. Blinder draws on the work of many of these reporters in his account. But if large portions of ''After the Music Stopped'' feel familiar, the book nonetheless benefits from its wide-angle perspective, as well as from its vantage point in time, now that it's possible to assess the fallout of decisions that were being made on the run by White House and Treasury officials under extraordinary pressures. It also benefits from Mr. Blinder's cleareyed prose and nimble gifts as an explainer -- gifts that sometimes approach those of Bill Clinton, when it comes to making complicated economic issues and policies understandable to the lay reader.
Direct and concise, Mr. Blinder tells it as he sees it. He calls the former Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and the Clinton-era Treasury secretaries, Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers, to account for their antiregulatory stances, which laid the groundwork for the market excesses and snowballing fiscal disasters that would explode in 2008.
He identifies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- with their low-income and subprime mortgage portfolios -- as being only ''supporting actors'' in the debacle. And he calls the collapse of Lehman Brothers on Sept. 15, 2008, the ''watershed event of the entire financial crisis'' and the government's decision ''to allow it to fail'' as ''the watershed decision.''
Not everyone will agree with such assessments. For instance, Mr. Blinder characterizes the reforms instituted thus far in response to the 2008 crash as ''substantial and thorough,'' an evaluation that will perplex skeptics across the political spectrum, from those who feel that not enough has been done about too-big-to-fail institutions and dangerous derivatives to those, on the other side, who argue that the overly complex Dodd-Frank legislation will simply suffocate business in red tape without providing any meaningful safeguards against the sort of chaos that occurred.
Mr. Blinder, however, always makes it clear when he is offering an opinion, and he usually provides a logical dissection of his reasoning, carefully pointing out where he thinks legislators punted: ''Dodd-Frank made no attempt to fix the nation's broken mortgage finance system,'' he explains. ''Nor did it seek a way out of the foreclosure mess.'' He adds that it also failed to specify how ratings agencies should be paid. (In what has been a major conflict of interest, they are paid by the issuers of the very securities they evaluate.)
Over all, however, Mr. Blinder contends that ''the grab bag'' of policy activism done during the tenures of George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- including the Federal Reserve's creation of huge amounts of liquidity, and Congress's expansion of the social safety net and passage of large-scale fiscal stimulus programs -- actually worked: ''not perfectly, of course. But for the most part, the financial system healed faster than most observers expected.''
Why, then, has there been such public anger, and such a ''severe antigovernment backlash'' by Tea Party protesters, by conservative Republicans, and by financial industry titans who have loudly complained about excessive regulation?
What we've got here, Mr. Blinder asserts, is a failure to communicate -- specifically a failure, in his opinion, on the part of the Obama administration to educate the American public about how we got into the fiscal mess in the first place and how the president's policies were going to get us out.
He suggests that the president's reluctance to focus ''like a laser beam on the economy'' -- and his decision instead to take on health care reform too -- resulted in ''a scattershot approach'' to policy that left people confused about his priorities and unconvinced that ''things would have been much worse without the stimulus'' and other rescue plans. Mr. Blinder contends that the public still believes what he calls ''the false notion that the government gave away money to the banks. (It actually made loans and equity investments).''
''It is a measure of the Obama administration's ineptitude in communication,'' Mr. Blinder notes, ''that the public came to see Geithner, Summers, & Company as tools of Wall Street while at the same time the bankers who were saved from oblivion came to hate the administration for vilifying and scapegoating them. Acquiring one of those two images was excusable, maybe even unavoidable. Acquiring both at the same time amounted to gross political negligence.''
What of ''the specter of trillion-dollar-plus budget deficits'' and the partisan dysfunction in today's Congress? Mr. Blinder says: ''America's budget mess is starting to look Kafkaesque because the outline of a solution is so clear: We need modest fiscal stimulus today coupled with massive deficit reduction for the future. Some of that will take the form of higher taxes -- sorry, Republicans. Most of it will be lower spending -- sorry, Democrats.''
''If you view the world through sufficiently rose-colored glasses,'' he goes on, ''you can perhaps see the two parties inching in that direction. But 'inching' isn't good enough. There is plenty of room for partisan bickering over the details, but we need to adopt the Nike solution -- Just do it! -- as soon as possible.''

HEADLINE: States' Group Calls for 45% Cut in Amount of Carbon Emissions Allowed

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the country's first regional system for capping carbon emissions and creating a market in carbon allowances, proposed a fundamental change on Thursday to increase electrical utilities' incentive to cut emissions from fossil-fuel plants by raising the cost of compliance. 
The regional group proposed a 45 percent reduction next year in the total carbon dioxide emissions allowed. The cut is not as draconian as that number suggests, however, because the new total of 91 million tons reflects the current emissions level after five years of a slumping economy and increases in renewable energy and energy-efficiency measures.
The reduction from 165 million tons is expected to raise the price of compliance, and further reductions of 2.5 percent annually were likely to increase the value of the allowances that utilities must submit for every ton of carbon dioxide, or its equivalent, that they emit.
If the proposal goes into effect, the analysis done by the group, which is a collaboration of nine states to cut carbon emissions, indicates that by 2020, allowances that are now trading at $1.93 could trade as high as $10. That would be roughly at the level where allowances for California's new economywide cap-and-trade system were auctioned last fall.
Cap-and-trade, a system of controlling carbon emissions by putting a price on them and therefore creating economic incentives for businesses to cut energy use -- and for investors to back new businesses creating energy from renewable sources -- was abandoned by Congress in 2009, leaving the regional group and the California system to forge new markets on their own.
States in the group are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont.
Richard K. Sullivan Jr., the Massachusetts secretary of energy and environmental affairs, said in an interview that the proposed change was being made in accordance with group's original plans for a five-year review of the program. ''I think there was a genuine expectation that the cap would be reduced to hew to the goal of driving down greenhouse-gas emissions,'' he said.
He said that in his state, 71,000 new jobs had been created in the clean energy sector since the cap-and-trade system covering state utilities was put into place.
But conservative opponents of such systems were quick to label the proposal a new tax on energy consumers. Americans for Prosperity, one such group, released a statement by Steve Lonegan, its New Jersey state director, saying, ''Electricity consumers have been paying a job-killing tax with zero benefit. Now ratepayers in the remaining nine R.G.G.I. states are going to be walloped thanks to this diktat from a bunch of unaccountable bureaucrats.''
New Jersey withdrew from the regional compact after the election of Gov. Chris Christie.
Mr. Sullivan of Massachusetts pointed out that the new proposal included a safety valve for utilities should prices rise too far too fast. That takes the form of a reserve pool of allowances that can be drawn on if prices exceed set levels: $4 in 2014, increasing $2 a year through 2017.

HEADLINE: New Claims For Jobless Edge Down

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell last week and the trend line for jobless claims reached nearly a five-year low, providing signs that the slow recovery in the labor market remains on track. 
Other reports on Thursday showed many top retailers had strong sales in January even as customers were hit with higher taxes, while productivity at businesses slumped in the fourth quarter.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 366,000, the Labor Department said. That was enough to pull down a four-week moving average of new claims, a gauge of the trend in layoffs, by 2,250 to 350,500, its lowest since March 2008.
''The labor market is improving, but certainly not at a robust rate by any means,'' said Russell Price, an economist at Ameriprise Financial.
While employers have pulled back on layoffs, they have added jobs only at a lackluster pace. Economists say the tepid recovery of the labor market means the Federal Reserve is likely to keep buying bonds into next year to keep borrowing costs low.
In a sign of the difficulty many people have in finding a job, the number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid increased 8,000, to 3.22 million, in the week ended Jan. 26.
The economy has shown signs of underlying strength despite a surprise contraction in the fourth quarter.
Consumer spending has been looking stronger, and many retailers reported robust sales. Over all, sales at stores open more than a year rose 5 percent in January for 20 retailers, according to Thomson Reuters, pointing to some resilience in spending despite the increase in payroll taxes that hit most Americans last month.
The Commerce Department's more comprehensive report on January retail sales, due on Feb. 13, is expected to show that sales edged higher from December when adjusted for seasonal swings.
Consumers are borrowing rather readily, a sign of confidence in the recovery. Consumer credit increased by $14.59 billion in December, the Federal Reserve said in a report.
The gains were driven by the biggest increase in nonrevolving credit, which includes student and auto loans, since November 2001.
Separately, the Labor Department said worker productivity outside the farming sector fell in the fourth quarter by the most in nearly two years as output increased only marginally despite steady gains in employment.
Productivity declined at a 2 percent annual rate, the sharpest drop since the first quarter of 2011 and a larger fall than the 1.3 percent forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
Productivity is expected to rebound in the current period because analysts believe weak output during the fourth quarter was partly a result of temporary factors, like an unusually sharp decline in government spending on the military.
The drop in productivity combined with a big increase in hourly compensation to drive unit labor costs up at a sharp 4.5 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
Hourly compensation, which includes wages as well as employer contributions to social insurance and private benefit plans like health care, rose at a 2.4 percent rate.

HEADLINE: Ranchers Find Hope In Flightless Bird's Fat

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

 BODY:
HAMILTON, Mont. -- The Wild Rose Emu Ranch is a survivor in an unusual business.
In 1998, there were some 5,500 farms and ranches across the country raising emus, the gawky, five- to six-foot-tall flightless birds; now, the best guess is that there are 1,000 to 2,000. Once, emus were viewed as a potential growth industry, a godsend to struggling farmers.
But the industry's downward trajectory may have been stayed. 
It is not because the bird's meat, which is very lean, is becoming more popular, although it is. Instead, it is in the large block of fat that covers most of the emu's body, between the hide and the flesh, that ranchers are finding a glimmer of hope.
''The oil is beneficial for almost any kind of skin condition,'' said Clover Quinn, the owner of the Wild Rose, as she rubbed some of the oil on her hands. While there are a few studies that demonstrate the oil's effectiveness for some things, proponents say it has a wide range of uses.
''It's a very nice oil,'' said Mohammed Alam, head of the fats and oils program at Texas A&M University. ''It's not magical. It's similar to other oils. But the mechanism for how it works needs to be figured out.''
The oil's popularity has kept places like the Wild Rose from closing. ''We got into the business in 1996, and the Montana Emu Association had 35 members,'' Ms. Quinn said. Her husband, Joe, was serving an emu omelet for four, made from half the contents of a single black egg that weighs about a pound and a half.
The Quinns watched as fellow emu ranchers began selling off their birds. The Montana Emu Association has just three members now, and two of those are Mr. and Ms. Quinn.
For a while, raising emus seemed like a quick path to wealth. A breeding pair sold for $45,000 in 1993, but as their numbers exploded by 1996, they were $1,000 a pair. ''The following year, they were giving them away,'' Ms. Quinn said.
One problem was that emu meat was thought too exotic by consumers and never managed to gain much traction in the American market.
Still, sales of the meat have improved. The Quinns sell it in health food stores in Missoula and Hamilton because it is very low in fat and high in omega-3 fatty acids and other beneficial substances.
Because emus are flightless birds, they never developed large pectoral muscles. It takes a year and a half to raise one, and they provide just 30 pounds of meat. A single cow has more than 500 pounds of meat.
Emu ranchers also sell the bird's supple leather, and it is made into boots, handbags and clothes. The lustrous blue-black eggs are sold for food, and people collect the empty shells to engrave and paint.
But several years ago, word started getting around about the oil. The birds, like the ostrich, evolved to store a lot of fat to survive in the outback of their native Australia. Processed and rubbed into a person's skin, the oil is hailed as a treatment for wrinkles, burns, acne, arthritis, psoriasis and eczema, among other things. It is used in shampoo and cosmetics. Taken orally, it is used to treat cholesterol, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and allergies.
A single bird produces 250 ounces of oil, and the Quinns sell it for $10 an ounce, subtracting the refining costs. ''It's been an enormous factor'' in profitability, Ms. Quinn said.
The leading emu oil processor, LB Processors, has seen production grow in the last few years to 7,000 gallons a year from 3,000 gallons. ''The last five years, things have really picked up,'' said Paul Binford, the owner and operator of the company. ''The recession didn't hurt us.''
As the price for oil has risen, some producers have been caught cutting the pure oil with soybean or canola oil, says Mike Eppley, an official of the American Emu Association.
Ms. Quinn gave a tour of her 100 birds, which paced behind woven wire fences. As she approached, the female emus started making loud drumming noises that sounded something like banging on the bottom of a plastic bucket.
She approached one group -- gatherings of emus are known as mobs -- and they swarmed over to her. There is something unnerving about bird-watching when the bird is six feet tall and making eye contact.
Inside her hatching house, Ms. Quinn showed off 40 eggs in a warm incubator. This month, the eggs will start hatching, and as many as 100 more will be added to her mob in the next few months.
Ms. Quinn is also an accomplished egg carver and makes art from the emu eggs, engraving mountain scenes into them. In 2008, her carved egg was chosen for the White House Easter egg display, which included one from each of the 50 states. But there was a downside.
''It had to be a chicken egg,'' Mr. Quinn said. ''It couldn't be an emu egg.''

HEADLINE: Fed Governor Raises the Specter of a Bubble in Junk Bonds

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
Some financial markets are showing signs of overheated speculation as investors take larger risks in response to the persistence of low interest rates, a senior Federal Reserve official said in a speech on Thursday.
The official, Jeremy C. Stein, a Fed governor, highlighted a surge in junk bond issues, the popularity of certain kinds of real estate investment trusts and shifts in bank balance sheets as areas the Fed is watching closely, although he played down any immediate threat to the financial system or the broader economy.
''We are seeing a fairly significant pattern of reaching-for-yield behavior emerging in corporate credit,'' Mr. Stein said in St. Louis. He added, however, ''It need not follow that this risk-taking has ominous systemic implications.'' 
Mr. Stein gave no indication that Fed officials were contemplating any change in their aggressive efforts to hold down interest rates. Rather, he described the signs of overheating as an emerging trend that might require a response if it intensified over the next 18 months.
But the speech nonetheless underscored that the Fed regards investment bubbles, rather than inflation, as the most likely negative consequence of its push to reduce unemployment by stimulating economic growth.
Mr. Stein also challenged the general view among central bankers that excessive speculation was best addressed through targeted regulation like loan underwriting standards, and not broad changes in monetary policy. He urged an ''open mind'' about the use of higher interest rates and changes in the Fed's investment portfolio to curtail such speculation.
Such a shift could alter the mechanics of the Fed's eventual retreat from its long-running stimulus campaign, now aimed at maintaining control over inflation.
''By no means does today's speech signify a change in the Fed orthodoxy regarding the use of interest rates to address financial imbalances,'' wrote Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, after the speech. ''But Stein is an emerging thought leader on the board, and his critique is likely to stimulate further debate.''
The Fed has held short-term interest rates near zero since late 2008, and amassed almost $3 trillion of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. The caution of chastened investors is one factor restraining the economic recovery. By lowering the cost of borrowing and limiting the availability of safe investments, the central bank is both pushing and pulling investors to take larger risks.
But low rates can help to drive asset prices to unsustainable levels, as in the dot-com bubble that popped in 2000 and, of course, the recent housing bubble.
Critics of the Fed's policies have pointed to the junk bond market as an area where low interest rates are encouraging excessive speculation. Investors are eagerly providing money to companies and countries with low credit ratings, and they are accepting historically low junk bond interest rates in return. Junk bond issuance in the United States set a new annual record last year -- by the end of October.
''We must not ignore the possibility that the low-interest rate policy may be creating incentives that lead to future financial imbalances,'' Esther L. George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, warned in a speech last month. Ms. George cited this same concern about financial destabilization in casting the sole dissenting vote at the most recent meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee.
The Fed has invested much time and effort in improving its ability to assess market conditions. Mr. Stein said Thursday, drawing on that work, that it did see evidence of overheating in the junk bond market. Relative prices remain around historical norms, but junk bonds make up a rising share of total corporate issuance, historically an indicator that investors are taking outsize risks.
And Mr. Stein said he took the junk bond data, along with similar patterns in other kinds of investments, as potential evidence of a broader trend.
''Overheating in the junk bond market might not be a major systemic concern in and of itself, but it might indicate that similar overheating forces were at play in other parts of credit markets, out of our range of vision,'' he said.
Changes in regulation offer a relatively precise way to address such problems. If mortgage lending standards loosen, the Fed can tighten those standards rather than raising interest rates and reducing other kinds of lending too.
But Mr. Stein said that regulators could fix only the problems they could find. Monetary policy ''gets in all of the cracks,'' he said. ''Changes in rates may reach into corners of the market that supervision and regulation cannot.''
He also suggested that the Fed could reduce the profitability of certain kinds of investments by adjusting its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds.
While emphasizing that he was not seeking imminent changes in policy, Mr. Stein closed on a cautionary note: ''Waiting for decisive proof of market overheating,'' he said, ''may amount to an implicit policy of inaction.''

HEADLINE: A New Front in Global Trade Wars

 BODY:
A 10-year trade dispute between the United States and the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda involving online gambling has reached an important turning point that could set a disturbing precedent for global commerce. Last week, the World Trade Organization authorized Antigua and Barbuda to violate intellectual property protections on American movies, books, pharmaceuticals and other goods as compensation for United States policies that harmed the islands' online gambling business. 
The judgment, if carried out, could open up a whole new front in trade wars, in which countries retaliate against unfair practices by imposing tariffs or quotas on other goods. But while it's relatively easy to dole out tit-for-tat punishment when it comes to goods like bananas, which are easy to measure, it will be much harder to do that with intellectual property, because copies of, say, Hollywood movies, can be further copied.
Antigua made a strong case to the W.T.O. that American policies like restrictions on money transfers have undercut its online gambling sites in violation of trade agreements in which the United States committed not to restrict such businesses. As a result, it says it has lost most of the 4,000 jobs connected to online gambling it once had.
It is unclear how, or if, Antigua will take advantage of the judgment, which limits the amount of harm it can cause to the owners of copyrights and patents in the United States to $21 million a year. Some have speculated that it could pirate American movies or music by offering them for sale online at cut-rate prices, or it could offer generic versions of patented drugs.
Antiguan officials say they would prefer a monetary settlement from Washington. United States officials have offered help in increasing American tourists to the islands, which officials there have said is too paltry a remedy. Both sides need to return to the negotiating table and come up with a deal that does not rely on legally approved piracy.

HEADLINE: 'Looking Back': 'The 7th White Columns Annual'

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
White Columns
320 West 13th Street
(entrance on Horatio Street),
West Village
Through Feb. 23
The White Columns Annual is a highly anticipated recap of the previous art season as filtered through specific curatorial eyes, different ones each time out. This year's selection is by Richard Birkett, the curator at Artists Space. It's a smart roundup, with many unobvious, un-Chelsea choices, which means that all those poor souls stuck in the ''not enough painting'' groove should stay home. A single fine portrait by Alice Neel, from a show at David Zwirner last spring, will hardly fill their needs. 
Which doesn't mean that there's an absence of work that's painting-like, as in the case of Martin Beck's stretched-fabric wall panels and Henrik Olesen's primed canvasses with lines of glued-on screws. Sculpture abounds. Yuji Agematsu, who showed at Real Fine Arts in Brooklyn last spring, has an entire room hung with tiny street-junk assemblages. A hunk of cedar propped up by a flute is a reminder of Gareth James's recent solo at Miguel Abreu.
Sam Lewitt revisits the small miracle of sculptural movement he created from magnetic fluid and air at the 2012 Whitney Biennial. There's a little knotted string thing by the great Harry Smith, and -- the visual pièce de résistance -- a wall-relief dragon with light-up eyes by Sam Pulitzer and Bill Hayden.
Video, photography and text-based work are in good supply. On tape, Alex Israel interviews pseudocelebrities: Bjarne Melgaard and the literary theorist Leo Bersani argue gay politics; Helke Sander takes us back, stirringly, to the youth movement of the 1960s; and Alexander Kluge turns the current economic crisis into a kind of global sitcom. Jason Simon assembles a memorial to the artist Chris Marker, who died last year, with a display of Marker's films and books. In a beautiful tribute, Kaucyila Brooke photographs the wardrobe of the writer Kathy Acker, who died in 1997. And Moyra Davey aligns the lives of female artists and writers in her 2011 video ''Les Goddesses.''
And there's plenty of reading to do with texts by Chris Kraus and Tan Lin, and with Peter Fend's minutely annotated collages, part of an immense project of news clips and e-mails detailing the effects of corporate power on ecology.
Piece by piece, the show feels cool and abstruse, like a set of conceptual locks to be picked. But once you get to work there are many individual rewards and a large overarching one: Mr. Birkett's tour of personal highlights makes the art-season past look far more interesting in retrospect than it did when it was happening.

HEADLINE: Japanese Subsidies Keep Whaling Industry Afloat, Conservation Group Says

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- A wildlife conservation group has said in a report that Japan has been propping up its whaling industry with nearly $400 million in tax money in recent years, stepping up subsidies even as the consumption of whale meat has slumped. 
The report, compiled by the International Fund for Animal Welfare, in Yarmouth Port, Massachusetts, and released Wednesday, challenges assertions by the Japanese government that whaling is a tradition with wide support among Japanese consumers.
Instead, government figures tallied in the report paint a picture of a struggling industry employing fewer than 1,000 people and dependent on public handouts, which have included money meant for reconstruction after the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011.
Most Japanese consumers have turned away from whale meat. The industry shipped just 5,000 tons in 2011, compared with 233,000 tons at the peak in 1962, according to data from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Demand this year is so low that the industry has cut its planned shipments by half, to 2,400 tons.
''Whaling is unprofitable and survives only with substantial subsidies, something cultural and nationalist arguments for whaling obscure,'' said Patrick Ramage, the director of the animal welfare fund's whale program. He said the country would be better off economically and ecologically if it promoted whale-watching tourism instead of hunting whales.
Japan's Fisheries Agency declined to comment on the report, saying it had not yet studied its contents. But an official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said there was ''nothing wrong with these subsidies, which fund an important program,'' though it was ''not the government's responsibility to make whaling economically viable.''
A world moratorium on commercial whaling took effect in 1986, but Japan has taken advantage of an exception allowing whaling for research purposes to continue hunting, though environmental activists who chase whaling boats have made those hunts increasingly difficult. Japan has captured and killed more than 14,000 whales since the moratorium began.
The meat from the whales is sold as ''byproducts'' of research, and it makes its way to supermarkets, restaurants and even school lunches. A government Web site says the most popular whale dishes are fried whale, whale sashimi and medium-rare whale steak.
According to figures from the Institute of Cetacean Research, the nonprofit organization set up to run the whaling program, income from whale meat has failed to cover the costs of whaling for the past five years. So subsidies have been increased and some disaster aid has been diverted to the industry, prompting a public outcry.
The financial picture prompted the government to announce a plan last year to cut costs by reducing the annual catch and to sell more whale meat directly to schools for lunches. But experts doubt that those measures will make the whaling industry self-sufficient again.
''The Japanese government has desperately defended whaling for years, but the question has increasingly become: for what?'' said Yusuke Saskata, a professor of environmental economics at Kinki University in Osaka. ''Supporting whaling culture is one thing, but maintaining whaling at this scale makes no sense.''
Hisako Ueno contributed research.

HEADLINE: Theorizing About Taxing High Earners

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- Academics can be dismissive of the concerns of the popular media. But when it comes to the growth of the superrich, the tabloids may have gotten it right.
The numbers tell the story. According to a study by John Van Reenen of the London School of Economics and Brian Bell of Oxford University, the share of national income earned by the top 1 percent in the United States surged to 18.3 percent in 2007, from 8 percent in 1979. In Britain, the trend was almost identical: The top 1 percent received 15.4 percent of the national income in 2007 compared with 5.9 percent in 1979. And these figures exclude capital gains.
''A lot of the action has been at the very top end of the distribution, the top 1 percent or the top 0.1 percent,'' Mr. Van Reenen, director of the Center for Economic Performance at the L.S.E., told me. ''It shows you that the media's focus on the very rich and on bankers' bonuses wasn't misplaced.'' 
But while much of the shift in income distribution has been at the apex of the pyramid, that is not where most academic research on rising income inequality has been focused.
If anything, Mr. Van Reenen said, academics ''have tended to focus on the bottom of the distribution, much more than the top.''
Mr. Van Reenen and some like-minded colleagues have been working to fill that gap. Their efforts made it to the economic major leagues in January, when Mr. Van Reenen convened a panel discussion on extreme wage inequality at the prestigious annual get-together of the American Economic Association.
One of the most striking findings will probably give comfort to the plutocrats: In contrast to previous generations, the superrich today tend to have earned their fortunes rather than inherited them.
Steven Kaplan of the University of Chicago and Joshua Rauh of Stanford University in California studied Forbes magazine's annual list of the 400 richest Americans. They found that in 1982, just 40 percent of these plutocrats had built their own businesses. By 2011, the superrich had gotten much richer -- the combined wealth of the Forbes 400 was $92 billion in 1982 and had surged to $1.53 trillion by 2011 -- and many more of them had, as the meme of the 2012 U.S. presidential election campaign had it, built it themselves: 69 percent.
''This isn't the Downton Abbey rentier class,'' explained Mr. Van Reenen, who has found a similar trend in Britain. ''These incomes come from the labor market. You can say it is a triumph of the human capitalists over the physical capitalists.''
Among economists who study the surge in pay at the top, it is pretty much a truth universally acknowledged that taxes should rise at the summit, too. ''Economics would suggest that when you have big increases in inequality, the top tax rate should rise,'' Mr. Van Reenen said. ''That seems very right and very reasonable.''
The impact and the structure of higher taxes for the rich are a more complicated and controversial issue. Timothy Besley and Maitreesh Ghatak, both of the London School of Economics, make a robust case for higher taxes on bankers' bonuses. Their work is theoretical, but beyond the campus green, what may be particularly interesting is the way they frame the wider debate.
''Little undermines the case for a market economy more than the perception that there is injustice in the rewards that it generates,'' they argue in a recent paper. ''The greatest clamor for reform should come from those who support the market system.''
''We have shown that some form of bonus taxation in the financial sector is optimal above and beyond standard progressive income taxation,'' they conclude. ''We have identified a form of taxation that we believe makes the market system both fairer and more efficient.''
This robustly pro-market rationale for higher taxes on bankers, who like to think of themselves as the very embodiment of capitalism, is eye-catching, particularly for anyone who spends much time in the United States, where higher taxes and more efficient markets are usually portrayed as being anathema to one another.
Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is one of the pioneering students of incomes at the very top, has offered an even more provocative suggestion. At the American Economic Association meeting, he argued that when tax rates at the top are low, ''top earners extract more pay at the expense of the 99 percent.'' Higher tax rates for the rich, he suggested, ''reduce the pretax income gap without hurting economic growth.''
This is a truly radical idea: that higher taxes at the top can reduce pretax inequality and not weaken the economy as a whole.
Outside the seminar room, however, these elegant ideas may run into political opposition intensified by the trends within the 1 percent that these same economists have documented.
''It may have a political effect,'' Mr. Van Reenen said of the shift from inherited fortunes to self-made ones. ''You feel you've earned it. This does make people more strongly inclined to resist taxation.''

HEADLINE: Comments by Top Banker Send the Euro Down Sharply

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- The president of the European Central Bank on Thursday cited the rising value of the euro as a possible threat to the region's economic recovery, comments that immediately sent the euro down sharply against the dollar and yen.
Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, denied that the central bank was trying to influence the value of the euro, no doubt mindful of provoking a currency war with Japan or the United States. But he then made statements that investors interpreted as meaning the E.C.B. could take action if the euro rose too much. 
''The exchange rate is not a policy target, but it is important for growth and price stability,'' Mr. Draghi said at a news conference after the regular monthly policy meeting of the E.C.B.'s Governing Council, in which the central bank left its main interest rate at 0.75 percent, as expected.
Separately, the Bank of England also kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Thursday, at 0.5 percent, amid worries that the British economy could fall back into a recession for the third time in five years. The pound has been falling against the euro and the dollar this year, pressured by investor concerns that the British economy may not manage to recover anytime soon.
Mr. Draghi, during the news conference, was careful to avoid any explicit threat to take action to push down the euro, or to criticize any other countries. He said the euro's current value was not far from its historical norm. But he noted that economic policy by other countries, none of which he identified, could affect exchange rates.
''Draghi's biggest challenge was to show his magic skills of verbal interventions and to talk down the euro exchange rate,'' Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING Bank, wrote in a note to clients. ''He succeeded.''
Having traded at nearly $1.36 to the dollar earlier on Thursday, the euro dropped to below $1.34 after Mr. Draghi's comments. In July it was trading just above $1.21.
Its record high of just below $1.60 was reached in April 2008, when the U.S. banking crisis was gathering steam.
Recent data have supported the E.C.B.'s view that the euro zone will emerge from recession this year, a view Mr. Draghi repeated Thursday. German industrial production rose 0.3 percent in December from November, according to a report Thursday, reversing a decline in the previous month and signaling a pickup in Germany, which has the largest euro zone economy.
But the recovery is threatened by the rising value of the euro, which could hurt European exports by making them more expensive for foreign buyers. In recent weeks, the euro has risen substantially against the dollar, to its highest levels in a year.
Few analysts had expected the E.C.B. to shift its monetary policy Thursday. Some predict that the benchmark rate could stay at its present level for an extended period as the euro zone slowly returns to growth.
But Mr. Draghi also emphasized Thursday that inflation was headed below the E.C.B.'s target of about 2 percent. The lack of price pressure would allow the E.C.B. space to cut rates if it chose.
Mr. Draghi argued that the appreciation of the euro ''is a sign of return of confidence.'' Some analysts said it could take a bigger increase in the currency's value before the E.C.B. would consider taking action, like a cut in the benchmark interest rate.
A stronger euro means that products ranging from cars to wine become more expensive abroad, putting European producers at a disadvantage against foreign competitors. But there are also positive effects. Imports, particularly oil, become less expensive for Europeans, which helps stimulate the economy.
''The main factor behind the euro strength is the easing of the sovereign debt crisis, which is clearly positive for the euro zone growth,'' Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank, wrote in a note. ''The E.C.B. is likely to tolerate further euro appreciation and is quite unlikely to cut rates again.''
During the news conference, Mr. Draghi deflected persistent questioning about a deal that the Irish central bank announced Thursday. It said that the E.C.B. had agreed to stretch out repayments for the 2009 bailout of Anglo Irish Bank to 40 years, instead of the 10 years previously scheduled.
The Irish Parliament approved legislation early Thursday to liquidate Anglo Irish Bank, after negotiating with the E.C.B. to swap the so-called promissory notes used to bail out the Irish lender for long-term government bonds.
Mr. Draghi said the E.C.B.'s Governing Council merely ''took note'' of the Irish action. But he declined to provide any details.
He may have wanted to avoid any impression that the central bank was giving a financial break to the Irish government. The E.C.B.'s charter prohibits it from directly financing euro zone governments.
Mr. Draghi did, however, applaud efforts by the Irish government to restore growth and get government finances under control. ''All in all the outlook is very positive,'' he said.
He also strenuously defended himself against criticism that, in his previous job as governor of the Bank of Italy, he had not done enough to prevent problems at Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which has required a &#x20ac;3.9 billion bailout by the Italian government.
Mr. Draghi was governor of the Italian central bank, responsible for bank supervision, during the period when Monte dei Paschi was getting in trouble several years ago. The former Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, with whom Mr. Draghi has tense relations, has tried to capitalize on the issue during the current Italian election campaign.
Mr. Draghi said the Bank of Italy had done all it could, and noted that it lacked the power to remove managers at Monte dei Paschi or to pursue criminal wrongdoing. ''You should certainly discount much of what you hear and read as part of the regular noise that elections produce,'' Mr. Draghi said.

HEADLINE: England Takes a Page From Brazil's Playbook

BYLINE: By ROB HUGHES

 BODY:
LONDON -- The British introduced Brazilians to soccer more than a century ago and since then have spent an awful lot of time trying to get their ball back.
No one can doubt that. It goes beyond the fact that Brazil has won five World Cups -- and England just the one, in its own stadium 47 years ago. There has been a chasm in class between the two, mostly stemming from sheer mastery of the ball, for much of that history.
On Wednesday, albeit in a friendly game that counted for no points, England beat Brazil, 2-1, at the rebuilt 90,000-seat Wembley Stadium. 
The score didn't matter, except for the fact that it is the first time in 23 years that England has prevailed over Brazil. More significant was the suggestion that in technical ability -- in skill with the ball and movement without it -- the mother country of the sport might finally be narrowing the gap.
It was embodied in two young men.
Neymar, who turned 21 this week, has a stack of video evidence that suggests he can do so much with the ball, at such extraordinary speed, that he should mature into one of the finest attacking players of his generation.
Arsenal's Jack Wilshere, who also recently celebrated his 21st birthday, outshone Neymar on Wednesday.
It was not simply a case of an Englishman more at home in his own stadium, or one more accustomed to the chill wind on a typically frosty February night.
Wilshere was buffeted at times by Brazilians like David Luiz and Ramires, who both earn their living in London, with Chelsea.
So the excuse that Brazilians came out of their warmth to England's cold does not wash, any more than Americans can simply blame the midafternoon humidity in San Pedro Sula for their 2-1 loss to Honduras on Wednesday.
Climate plays a part, and it might even condition the style in which people play sports in different parts of the world. The more variety, the better.
But maybe the barometer is shifting. We know that the 2014 World Cup will be played in Brazil, and no European team has won the tournament in South America.
Brazilians, Argentines and Uruguayans have traditionally shown a love of the ball and an ability to move it beyond the wit of Europeans when the sun is hot on their backs. Now, however, Europe's Latins -- the Spaniards -- have mastered a game that combines the artistic passing of the South Americans with the stamina of the Europeans.
Spain, which has not lost since late 2011, extended its unbeaten streak by beating Uruguay, 3-1, in Qatar. The scorers, Pedro (twice) and Cesc Fàbregas, were two of the nine Barcelona players who featured Wednesday for the Spanish squad, which was led by Carles Puyol in his 100th appearance for the national side.
That is club soccer turned into a national asset. The English, and the Brazilians, don't have that. They, like all others except Spain, have to knit together what talents they possess from multiple clubs.
In the past few decades, Brazil's gifted sons have migrated to European clubs -- for the money -- almost without exception. Neymar hasn't gone yet because his team, Santos, has been able to call on several high-powered sponsors from the booming Brazilian economy to keep him at home.
And that brings on a polemic that was tested to a degree at Wembley.
Once more, the Neymar and Wilshere comparison is worth considering. The only impediment to the young Brazilian's progress is said to be that by staying at home, he doesn't meet exacting enough competition.
He is quick, bright and daring, and his dancing feet can appear hypnotic. But at Wembley, where his compatriot Oscar -- another Chelsea recruit -- set up chances, Neymar squandered a hat trick.
Wilshere, meantime, was brilliant. He wears his youth like a man, indeed -- facially he looks much older than his years. Wilshere became an Arsenal first-team player at 16 and, given his amalgam of touch and vision and muscular strength, perhaps that early start was premature.
He broke down. His ankle, and then other parts of his lower limbs, required surgery and long, long rest. He spent 14 months out of the game, but in that time he demonstrated just how much he craved getting back into the thick of it.
It was Wilshere's measured pass, and his Arsenal teammate Theo Walcott's electric speed, that created the opening goal. Brazil goalie Júlio César rushed bravely to intercept the move, but the ball then ran loose, and Wayne Rooney drove it into the net with precision.
It seems no time at all since Rooney was heralded as the coming Englishman. Now 27, he is almost old compared with Wilshere and Neymar.
When we say old, however, that brings into the equation Ronaldinho and Frank Lampard. Ronaldinho was fantastic seven years ago; on Wednesday, given a comeback by Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, the 32-year-old Brazilian was pedestrian and peripheral. He fluffed a penalty kick and was taken off at halftime.
Maybe he will get another chance in warmer conditions.
A Brazil substitute, Fred, scored with a curled left-footed shot, and almost doubled that with a right-footed strike against the bar.
Then Lampard won the match with typical opportunism, using his instep to scoop the ball into the goal from 18 yards.
Chelsea intends to release Lampard, now 34, after this season. The Los Angeles Galaxy is supposedly among his options, but England's coach Roy Hodgson appeared Wednesday to advise him against the David Beckham route.
''It's not for me to discuss his future with his current club,'' said Hodgson.. ''But I hope we keep Frank if not in England, then in Europe. That would make my task easier.''

HEADLINE: A Pause in the Markets' Resurgence

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks dropped on Thursday after retailers posted mixed monthly sales and the euro fell against the dollar.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended down 0.2 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent and the Nasdaq composite index declined 0.1 percent. European markets ended mostly lower. 
At a news conference, Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, said the euro exchange rate was important to growth and price stability, remarks that investors took as a sign the bank was concerned with the single currency's recent advance. The euro fell to $1.3385.
Mr. Draghi denied that the E.C.B. was trying to influence the value of the euro, but he then made statements that markets interpreted as meaning the E.C.B. could take action if the euro rises too much.
Separately, the United States government said that weekly initial jobless claims dipped by 5,000 to 366,000. The four-week moving average fell to its lowest level since March 2008, signaling that the economy is continuing to recover slowly.
Another report showed that fourth-quarter productivity registered its biggest drop in nearly two years, while unit labor costs jumped 4.5 percent, more than economists expected.
''Claims didn't look too exciting. They are pretty much in line,'' said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Ill. ''The bigger surprise was the jump in unit labor costs that was pretty substantial. Over all, the market took the whole thing in stride.''
Several American retailers reported mixed January sales results, as consumers faced a hit to their take-home pay from higher payroll taxes. Macy's shares rose 2 percent after the company reported that January same-store sales rose 11.7 percent.
Greenlight Capital, run by the fund manager David Einhorn, said on Thursday that it had sued Apple, saying the company should do more to unlock value for shareholders. Apple shares gained 1.8 percent.
Sprint Nextel edged down 1 percent after the mobile service provider posted higher fourth-quarter revenue, but subscriber numbers that disappointed Wall Street.

HEADLINE: Bangladeshi Admits Trying To Blow Up Federal Bank

BYLINE: By MOSI SECRET; Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A Bangladeshi man who tried to blow up the Federal Reserve Bank of New York remotely only to find that the bomb was fake and his plot had been under the constant surveillance of federal agents pleaded guilty on Thursday to terrorism charges.
The plea of the man, Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis, 21, brought a quick resolution to a case that used one of the government's most popular strategies for identifying and pursuing terrorism suspects: Undercover agents and a confidential source who learned that Mr. Nafis wanted to conduct an attack gave him the materials for a fake bomb and other support, leading him all the way to the moment of detonation before arresting him in October. 
In response to criticism of the law enforcement approach -- and the claim that men like Mr. Nafis could not pull off an attack without the government's help -- Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, emphasized that Mr. Nafis had entered the United States with plans to carry out the attack and that the sting operation was the best way to stop him.
''He came with information about how to make bombs,'' Ms. Lynch said in a news conference outside the Federal District Court in Brooklyn. ''At every opportunity this defendant showed his determination and commitment to this plan.''
Mr. Nafis pleaded guilty to attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. He will be sentenced on May 30 and faces a sentence of 30 years to life in prison. The guilty plea came just four months after he parked a van with the fake bomb outside of the bank, in Lower Manhattan, hoping to destroy the immense building in a fiery explosion and strike a blow to the American economy.
During the hearing, he flinched when Judge Carol B. Amon read the words ''weapons of mass destruction.''
''I had intended to commit a violent jihadist attack,'' Mr. Nafis said, speaking slowly and softly. ''I no longer support violent jihad. I deeply and sincerely regret my involvement in this case.''
The case began last July, when Mr. Nafis, who entered the country five months earlier on a student visa, told a man he met on the Internet about his hopes to conduct a terrorist attack, according to the criminal complaint. That man was a confidential source working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The man introduced Mr. Nafis to a man he said was a member of Al Qaeda but who was actually a federal agent. In a series of meetings, Mr. Nafis and the undercover agent conceived and developed a terrorist plot that Mr. Nafis said would ''destroy America,'' according to the complaint.
''I just want something big. Something very big. Very very very very big, that will shake the whole country,'' he said in one of the conversations recorded by the New York Joint Terrorism Task Force, which includes F.B.I. agents and members of the Police Department.
Mr. Nafis decided to target the financial district. He scouted the Federal Reserve building in August, taking pictures of it while federal agents were taking pictures of him.
The original plan was for a suicide mission, but that changed when Mr. Nafis said he wanted to go home to Bangladesh first to put his affairs in order. The undercover agent responded that Mr. Nafis might then not be able to return to the United States and carry out his plan. Instead, the agent noted that Mr. Nafis could use a remote-control device to stage the attack and go back to Bangladesh afterward.
On an October morning, the men built the fake 1,000-pound bomb in a local warehouse, using batteries, electrical items and large garbage bins that Mr. Nafis had bought, according to the criminal complaint. They assembled a detonator that was to be triggered by a cellphone, and drove in a van to the Federal Reserve Bank. Mr. Nafis was arrested in a nearby hotel after he tried to explode the bomb.

HEADLINE: May Cause Greed, Lust Or Retirement

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
The marketing campaign for ''Side Effects,'' Steven Soderbergh's tight and twisty new pharma-caper, includes a Web site for a fictitious antidepressant called Ablixa. You can tell the site is fake because the ''professional consultation'' it offers is provided by Jude Law, who plays a psychiatrist in the film. But the embedded commercial is a perfect parody of something that has become very familiar in recent years: a vague and seductive montage of sad and happy scenes accompanied by new-agey music and, interrupting the inspiring sales pitch, a sotto voce recitation of warnings and possible complications. 
Mr. Soderbergh, who serves as his own cinematographer (under the pseudonym Peter Andrews), cleverly evokes the style of these ubiquitous drug advertisements in the movie itself. We spend most of the first half-hour in the company of Emily Taylor (Rooney Mara), a young New Yorker who lives in a gray fog of hopelessness. The Ablixa ad represents this condition with cartoon clouds, while Mr. Soderbergh paints Manhattan in watery shades of gloom. Thomas Newman's score mimics and subverts the soothing music of antidepressant sales pitches, composing lullabies that portend a sleep full of nightmares. Ms. Mara, fine-boned and fragile-looking, but with a deep reservoir of scary intensity (see ''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo''), moves through her scenes with a blunted, haunted affect, and Emily stirs the protective instincts of the audience, of Mr. Law's Dr. Jonathan Banks and also of her husband, Martin (Channing Tatum).
He is a former hedge fund cowboy recently (and not all that repentantly) released from prison after serving four years for insider trading. His return coincides with -- or perhaps sets off -- a severe depressive episode for his wife, including a suicide attempt in an underground parking garage. Martin, affable, hunky and upbeat (as I said, Channing Tatum), also represents the principal happiness that Emily has known in her life. A flashback renders the time before his incarceration as a bright blur of delicious shared luxury: Champagne in crystal flutes, a handsome sailboat, a cute little Mercedes in the driveway of a grand Greenwich mansion.
You will note that those signifiers of the good life are material rather than mental. Abundance is bliss. And though ''Side Effects'' (written by Scott Z. Burns, Mr. Soderbergh's collaborator on ''Contagion'' and ''The Informant!'') starts out on the pharmacologically renovated terrain of the psychological thriller -- locating drama and suspense in the puzzles of Emily's inner experience -- it eventually separates the thrills from the psychology, flattening into a somewhat conventional story of double crosses and disguised motives. The movie is finally less about madness and medicine than about lust, jealousy and greed.
Not that those things are entirely unrelated, and not that a clever, old-fashioned noir potboiler is unwelcome in this cold, dumb season. Even as it concentrates on the pathos and pathology of an individual case, ''Side Effects'' glances at the larger economic forces that impinge on Emily's condition. Behind the kind doctors and enticing advertisements lie the interests of big business. Dr. Banks, eager to advance his family's fortune (his wife, who works in banking, is played by Vinessa Shaw), accepts a lucrative consulting gig for the company that makes Ablixa, whose brand seems to be everywhere -- on name tags at conferences, on ballpoint pens and prescription pads.
These tokens of the medical-industrial complex are notable atmospheric details -- minor symptoms or perhaps red herrings -- rather than central concerns. The middle stretch of ''Side Effects'' is a forensic whodunit in which Dr. Banks, with the not always helpful assistance of Emily's previous therapist (Catherine Zeta-Jones), tries to get to the bottom of a ghastly, possibly Ablixia-linked incident.
I don't want to say too much more, since while the plot may be predictable (and more than a little preposterous) in retrospect, Mr. Soderbergh handles it brilliantly, serving notice once again that he is a crackerjack genre technician. He is especially alert to the ways that shifts in the direction of the plot alter the identities of important characters. Mr. Law's transformation is especially impressive, as the good doctor travels a circuit from compassion to confusion to coldblooded fury and discovers that paranoia is less a psychic disorder than a realistic response to circumstances.
Mr. Soderbergh has said that ''Side Effects'' will be his last theatrically released feature film. (''Behind the Candelabra,'' his Liberace biopic starring Matt Damon and Michael Douglas, will be shown on HBO.) As such, it is less a summing up than a greatest-hits package, reminding viewers of some of the things that this protean director has done well in recent years. (In addition to casting Channing Tatum, that is.) It has a clammy medical anxiety that recalls ''Contagion,'' hints of the corporate shenanigans of ''The Informant!,'' the do-gooder convictions of ''Erin Brockovich'' and an eye for high-end New York environments that defined ''The Girlfriend Experience.''
What these films have in common -- and we can add ''Magic Mike'' and even the ''Ocean's Eleven'' pictures to the list -- is a critical interest in the intimate effects of a capitalist economy that bundles ethical risks along with material comforts and opportunities for self-making. Mr. Soderbergh's tales of sex, drugs, illness and crime are also about money. To some extent, of course, money is the unacknowledged obsession of everyone who makes movies, but few filmmakers have put this concern on screen with such intelligence and wit. This honesty is a big reason to miss Mr. Soderbergh and to hope that his retirement is temporary.
''Side Effects'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Sex, violence and bad medicine.

HEADLINE: Helping Start-Ups With Local Support and National Networks

BYLINE: By SARAH MAX

 BODY:
When Will Fuentes planned an extended business trip to Seattle last year, he tapped into the local chapter of a national networking group there. Within hours, Mr. Fuentes, who founded the Arlington, Va., software company Lemur Retail, had secured a work space, introductions and even restaurant recommendations via the group, the Startup America Partnership."Before I flew out there, I already had five or six meetings set up with potential clients and other key contacts, as well as one potential acquirer," Mr. Fuentes said.
A couple of years ago, entrepreneurs would have needed several trips to make similar connections outside their own cities. Even in this era of social networks and venture conferences, start-ups are still surprisingly disconnected on a national level. 
"Each region has its ties, but in many cases, entrepreneurs are operating in silos," said Carolynn Duncan, the chief executive of Portland Ten, a mentoring program for early-stage companies, mainly in Oregon. "An entrepreneur in Oregon doesn't have an easy way to network with entrepreneurs in Washington D.C."
Startup America, a nonprofit organization with an all-star cast of deep-pocketed backers, is trying to bridge the gap. The organization, which was started in January 2011 as the brainchild of AOL's co-founder, Steve Case, and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, wanted to bring a private-sector support to start-ups - without financial strings attached.
"Supporting start-ups throughout the country is the only way to make sure the American economy is firing on all cylinders," said Mr. Case, who is the chairman of the partnership.
Start-ups are a crucial driver for job creation in the United States. From March 1994 to March 2010, businesses less than one year old created 3.9 million jobs a year on average, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, though that number has declined during the recent economic weakness.
The Small Business Administration and United States Chamber of Commerce have long been a resource for start-ups, but these government agencies have a broad mandate. There is a "growing recognition," said Mr. Case, that high-growth start-ups - those with the potential to be national or international companies - have different needs and requirements than traditional small businesses.
Startup America's initial focus was to provide support to start-ups through deals on goods and services, like 40 percent off FedEx shipping and free flights on American Airlines. But the group quickly realized that start-ups needed more practical help, like sharing best practices and networking.
Soon after the partnership's start, entrepreneurs around the country starting contacting Startup America, asking how they could create their own networks and reach out to counterparts in other states. "Most of these regions were already coming up with their own initiatives or thinking about them," said the organization's chief executive, Scott Case, a founder and former chief technology officer of Priceline.com (and no relation to Steve Case). "We're helping to stitch together all these parts."
Taking cues from the entrepreneurs, Startup America has turned its attention to building such a network. Nearly 12,000 members are now affiliated with local Startup America initiatives in 30 states. The partnership expects to add another 10 states this year.
Each Startup America region is spearheaded by local "champions" who come together several times a year at national conferences, communicate via Google groups and have access to an online "idea center" where they can brainstorm about, say, bringing in outside capital or hosting a start-up conference. These envoys are all "founder types" at different stages of their careers, Scott Case said. "Some have exited companies and are looking to continue to feed that creative drive. Others understand that if they can strengthen their community, they can strengthen their own company."
Brooks Bell, founder of an eponymous 22-employee digital consulting business based in Raleigh, N.C., became involved with the partnership in 2011 after realizing that many potential clients considered her area a backwater. "I realized that was impacting my company's brand, too," she said.
Mrs. Bell pointed out that other national groups, like Entrepreneurs' Organizations, offer resources for high-growth companies. Yet, their emphasis is typically on supporting individuals rather than elevating the region and networking nationally. "They also tend to focus on early-stage companies," she said. Until Startup America, she added, "there weren't a lot of opportunities for early-stage companies to interact with funded companies."
Though Startup America regions work off the same blueprint, each takes a slightly different approach. In Maryland, the staff and champions volunteer virtually. Startup Tennessee partnered with the Entrepreneur Center in Nashville, which runs a nonprofit incubator program. Startup Colorado works out of Silicon Flatirons, a center for law, technology and entrepreneurship at the University of Colorado Law School, and finds partners to finance specific projects.
Although the regional chapters operate independently, they benefit from the credibility of a national organization. "It's helping elevate our start-ups nationally and get them in front of audiences we never would have," said Andy Stoll, an entrepreneur in the Iowa City, Iowa, area, where rebuilding from the floods in 2008 has helped generate a boom in start-up activity.
"To have the opportunity to sit in a room with their board and have Steve Case ask me, 'What are the three things that those of us at this table can do to really help support the Indiana community?' is amazing and a humbling experience," said Michael Coffey, a partner at DeveloperTown, an Indianapolis design and development firm that works with companies of all sizes.
In the end, it's all about business.
Aaron Schwartz, a co-founder of the San Francisco-based Modify Watches, initially joined Startup America for the discounts. Now, he's also tapping into the partnership to network, including finding corporate clients who order custom watches and vendors. "I now have a contact in Tennessee who has offered to look into manufacturing our watches there," he said
Mr. Fuentes of Lemur Retail found two potential clients, both national chains, through his connections in Seattle last year; he's currently in talks with those companies. He's also helping his Northwest counterparts make inroads in the Washington area. He likens the experience to a fraternity or alumni organization of entrepreneurs.
"When people contact me from my high school or college, I pick up the phone," he said. "This is no different."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Restored Payroll Tax Pinches Those Who Earn Least

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Jack Andrews and his wife no longer enjoy what they call date night, their once-a-month outing to the movies and a steak dinner at Logan's Roadhouse in Augusta, Ga. In Harlem, Eddie Phillips's life insurance payment will have to wait a few more weeks. And Jessica Price is buying cheaper food near her home in Orlando, Fla., even though she worries it may not be as healthy.
Like millions of other Americans, they are feeling the bite from the sharp increase in payroll taxes that took effect at the beginning of January. There are growing signs that the broader economy is suffering, too.
Chain-store sales have weakened over the course of the month. And two surveys released last week suggested that consumer confidence was eroding, especially among lower-income Americans. 
While these data points are preliminary -- more detailed statistics on retail sales and other trends will not be available until later this month -- at street level, the pain from the expiration of a two-percentage-point break in Social Security taxes in 2011 and 2012 is plain to see.
''You got to stretch what you got,'' said Mr. Phillips, 51, a front-desk clerk and maintenance man for a nonprofit housing group who earned $22,000 last year. ''That little $20 or $30 affects you, especially if you're just making enough money to stay above water.'' So he has taken to juggling bills, skipping a payment on one this month and another next month.
''I'm playing catch-up each month,'' he said. ''You go to the supermarket and you can't spend what you used to.''
Jack Andrews has it slightly better than Mr. Phillips. He earns a bit more than $40,000 a year manufacturing ceramics in a local factory, but because his wife, Cindy, is disabled, he is the sole breadwinner. Something had to give now that he is earning about $800 less a year, or $66 a month, and it was the couple's monthly night out.
''It's just gotten out of reach,'' Mr. Andrews said.
The tax break, which was pushed by the White House to stimulate spending in 2011 and extended in 2012, was always supposed to be temporary. But with pressure building in Washington to reduce the deficit and politicians fighting bitterly over whether to raise taxes on the very rich, the question of how the increase in Social Security taxes would affect the poorest workers did not seem to garner much debate on either side of the aisle.
''I don't see any reason to consider supporting its extension,'' said Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, in testimony last year. Even Nancy Pelosi, a reliable liberal who leads the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, was for letting it expire.
The higher rate applies to all earned income up to $113,700. For a household earning $100,000 a year, the two-percentage-point increase means an additional $2,000 a year in payroll deductions. Economists estimate that the payroll tax increase will reduce disposable income by about $120 billion and shave half a percentage point from economic growth in the first quarter -- a significant blow given that the economy is expected to expand only 1 to 2 percent in the first half of 2013.
''If you wanted to design a policy to squeeze the spending of lower- and middle-income households, raising the payroll tax is the way to do it,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors. ''It's very regressive.''
Retailing analysts and economists say high-end earners will largely be spared.
''I wouldn't expect it to have much of an effect on BMW consumption,'' said Richard H. Thaler, a professor of behavioral science and economics at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. ''The people who will notice it the most are the ones making the least.''
In Medford, Ore., Darchelle Skipwith had to scrap her monthly budget and start over when the law changed.
She is buying less meat; driving less often to see her sister, who lives 12 miles away in Eagle Point; and putting less away in savings. In August, Ms. Skipwith, 42, hopes to get a raise of 50 cents an hour at her job stacking shelves at Walmart, which should help make up the difference.
For now, she has no choice but to change her daily routine.
''I added it up -- it's about $75 a month,'' Ms. Skipwith said. ''That's not a lot for some people, but mine is the only paycheck. I don't have extra money coming in.''
Of course, taxes are going up on wealthier Americans, too, with a rise in marginal rates on income above $400,000 for individuals and higher taxes on capital gains and dividends. But millions of individual decisions by poorer Americans in Medford, Augusta, Harlem and elsewhere are quickly adding up.
Complete monthly data for retail sales in January will not be released until later this week, but the weekly data already available for last month showed a steady deterioration in shopping activity.
''There is something going on,'' said Chris G. Christopher Jr., senior principal economist at IHS Global Insight. ''The payroll tax seems to be cutting into things.''
That pattern was apparent in a Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment released on Friday, according to Richard T. Curtin, who directs surveys of consumers at the university.
When asked how their financial situation had changed in January, 32 percent of people with incomes below $75,000 said their pay had dropped, compared with 13 percent who said it had increased. By contrast, 38 percent of people earning more than $75,000 said their wages had gone up last month, and 23 percent said they had gone down.
''We rarely see such divergent trends,'' Dr. Curtin said. ''Mostly it was the payroll tax hurting the lower incomes, while higher-income folks had a boost from things like dividends.''
In fact, as companies paid out dividends to shareholders early to avoid the higher tax rate for 2013, personal dividend income increased at a seasonally adjusted monthly rate of 34.3 percent in December, compared with a 4.5 percent rise in November.
But that did little to help Jessica Price, who holds down two jobs in Orlando. Most weekends she works at a clothing store in a shopping center near the Universal Studios theme park, within sight of the roller coasters, and she spends weekdays collecting tolls on a local expressway.
Ms. Price, 20, whose annual income is $15,000 to $16,000, prefers shopping at Whole Foods, the upscale supermarket chain, which is healthier but more expensive. But since the payroll tax went up, she has been going more often to Publix and Walmart.
''The food that has a lot of fat and food coloring is cheaper,'' she said. ''It's a lot more expensive to eat healthier. But now I'm actually looking at the price tag on things rather than grabbing them.''

Previews and Openings
'All in the Timing' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) Fresh from his well-reviewed Broadway production of ''A Christmas Story, the Musical,'' John Rando directs the 20th-anniversary revival of this collection of six one-act comedies in which David Ives brings his playful perspective and wizardry with language to matters romantic and existential. The cast for the Primary Stages production includes Jenn Harris, Carson Elrod and Matthew Saldivar. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (David Rooney) 
'Belleville' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on March 3) Amy Herzog's plays continue to take on darker shadows, as family-focused works like ''After the Revolution'' and ''4000 Miles'' give way to ''The Great God Pan,'' which looked at repressed childhood memories, and now this examination of a fraying American couple in Paris. Maria Dizzia and Greg Keller return to the roles the originated at Yale Repertory Theater in 2011, when Charles Isherwood, in his review for The New York Times, called it ''a thrillingly good play.'' It is directed, as it was in 2011, by Anne Kauffman, who does creepy naturalism better than just about anyone (''The Thugs,'' ''Maple and Vine''). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, nytw.org. (Eric Grode)
'The Dance and the Railroad' (in previews; opens on Feb. 25) Each Signature Theater season typically features at least one relative obscurity by the honored playwright, and this year's David Henry Hwang season is no exception. This 1981 play, which was only Mr. Hwang's second, uses the conventions of Chinese opera to illuminate the story of two Chinese immigrant workers in the California mountains during the building of the Transcontinental Railroad. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Grode)
'Donnybrook!' (in previews; opens on Feb. 17) The lyricist Johnny Burke is best known for his longstanding relationship with Paramount Pictures, including more than two dozen Bing Crosby films, but he also contributed the music as well as lyrics to this short-lived 1961 Broadway musical. Its source material -- the classic John Ford film ''The Quiet Man,'' featuring John Wayne as an Irish-American boxer who returns to the old sod -- makes it a natural property for Irish Repertory Theater, which has enlivened similarly forgotten musicals like ''Take Me Along'' and ''New Girl in Town.'' Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Grode)
'Hamlet' (in previews; opens on Feb. 17) The sight of four actors giving thrilling life to Shaw's ''Saint Joan'' was an unexpected delight of the 2012 theater season. Those same four actors (Andrus Nichols, Tom O'Keefe, Ted Lewis and Eric Tucker) are back, and this time they're climbing an even steeper mountain. Mr. Tucker once again directs, as if he doesn't have enough to worry about. (''Saint Joan'' joins it in repertory starting March 6.) Access Theater, 380 Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa, (866) 811-4111, theatrebedlam.org. (Grode)
'Isaac's Eye' (in previews; opens on Saturday) It's ''Amadeus'' with optics! Once again an enterprising playwright (Lucas Hnath, in this case) has attempted to look at centuries-old culture by having a young genius (and partly named title character) do battle with an older contemporary, rising to far greater notoriety when all is said and done. It worked for Mozart, and now it's Isaac Newton's turn, with the scientist Robert Hooke filling in as the embittered eminence destined to relative obscurity. Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Grode)
'Jesus in India' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Feb. 21) What would Jesus do if he found himself in modern-day Indo-Mathura, an area teeming with spiritual innovation and (according to the news release) really good marijuana? Lloyd Suh (''American Hwangap'') tries to answer that question in this contemporary parable, which presents Jesus as a teenager traveling on the back of a camel with his pal Abigail of Galilee. Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, ma-yitheatre.org. (Grode)
'Katie Roche' (in previews; opens on Feb. 25) To the extent that New York theatergoers know anything about the 20th-century Irish playwright Teresa Deevy, it is because of the Mint Theater. The enterprising theater, which is also publishing two volumes of her writings, wraps up its three-play Deevy retrospective with this 1936 drama about a wildly ambitious servant girl. The Abbey Theater brought it to America in 1937, but this is the first American production. The Mint's artistic director, Jonathan Bank, directs once again. 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (Grode)
'The Laramie Project Cycle' (opens on Tuesday) The Tectonic Theater Project's 2000 play, ''The Laramie Project,'' has rightly claimed a place as a milestone in American theater, putting the growing trend of documentary theater in the service of a devastating story: the murder of a gay 21-year-old man in Laramie, Wyo. The troupe went back to Laramie a decade later to create a companion piece. Now the two plays are being performed in repertory, featuring the original cast (many of whom also wrote the plays). Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Grode)
'Luck of the Irish' (in previews; opens on Monday) Kirsten Greenidge made a splash in 2011 with her Obie Award-winning play, ''Milk Like Sugar,'' about teenage pregnancy. Her new play may sound familiar to ''Clybourne Park'' fans; it also looks at race relations, filtered through the eyes of black and white inhabitants of the same house over multiple generations. Ms. Greenidge's play is about the tensions that rise when an Irish family, which is paid to ''ghost buy'' a house in an all-white Boston neighborhood for a black family in the 1950s, comes back to claim the house. Her ''Milk'' director, Rebecca Taichman, returns for this one. Claire Tow Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com, lct3.org. (Grode)
'The Madrid' (in previews; opens on Feb. 26) When a kindergarten teacher one day gets up and walks out of work, she leaves in the lurch not only a batch of blinking 5-year-olds but also a loving husband and a daughter. Liz Flahive makes her return to Manhattan Theater Club, which presented her domestic drama ''From Up Here'' in 2008, with this new work and Edie Falco in tow. Leigh Silverman, who directed ''From Up Here'' and has a way with plays about troublesome parents (''Well,'' ''Coraline''), teams up with Ms. Flahive again here. City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Grode)
'Much Ado About Nothing' (in previews; opens on Feb. 17) Fans of no-frills, shrewdly conceived, elegantly presented Shakespeare have learned to circle their calendars for Arin Arbus's annual Theater for a New Audience productions. This one, her fifth in as many years, features a love-hate relationship not unlike that in last year's ''Taming of the Shrew,'' and Ms. Arbus once again has Maggie Siff (''Sons of Anarchy'') to represent the female half of the equation. Playing Benedick opposite Ms. Siff's Beatrice is the British classical actor Jonathan Cake. The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, dukeon42.org. (Grode)
'The North Pool' (previews start on Thursday; opens on March 6) After several well-received Off Broadway plays, Rajiv Joseph hit the big time in 2011 when Robin Williams starred in his ''Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo'' on Broadway. Now Mr. Joseph heads back downtown with this psychological thriller about a game of cat and mouse conducted between a high school principal and a transfer student from the Middle East. Giovanna Sardelli, who has directed nearly all of Mr. Joseph's other Off Broadway pieces, does the same here. Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Grode)
'The Old Boy' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on March 5) Playwrights as prolific as A.R. Gurney tend not to pick favorites among their works. Who can remember them all? That said, Mr. Gurney has referred to this 1991 play, about a politician who confronts some unexpected demons when he returns to his New England prep school, as ''a favorite but somewhat neglected child.'' Enter the Keen Company to bestow a little attention. Mr. Gurney has also done a bit of revisiting, as the script is being billed as ''newly revised.'' Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Old Hats' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on March 4) There are few details about this piece, but here's all you really need to know: Bill Irwin and David Shiner are together again. The duo created stage magic in various iterations of the uproarious ''Fool Moon,'' and now they and their director, Tina Landau, promise more of the same: mime, magic, music (courtesy of Nellie McKay) and mayhem. Mr. Irwin's more recent stage performances have included convincing takes on Albee, Shakespeare and even Beckett, but he still presumably has a good pratfall or three left in him. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Grode)
'Passion' (previews start on Friday; opens on Feb. 28) With the recent glut of Stephen Sondheim revivals, revues and tributes, you may have forgotten that the last time a new Sondheim show had its debut on Broadway was in 1994. That's when his and James Lapine's haunting chamber musical about love and obsession opened, only to close after eight months. A revival is long overdue, and the director John Doyle (this time dispensing with his usual actors-doubling-as-musicians tactic) has cast two formidable women who have also been much missed on the New York stage, Melissa Errico and Judy Kuhn. Ryan Silverman rounds out the central love triangle. Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Grode)
'Really Really' (in previews; opens on Feb. 19) The premise of this new work sounds less than groundbreaking: College pals turn on one another after a boozy party. But Paul Downs Colaizzo's play has plenty going for it, including a good track record (it was a smash for the Signature Theater in Washington last year), TV darlings in the cast (Zosia Mamet of ''Girls,'' Matt Lauria of ''Friday Night Lights'') and, most intriguing, the infinitely resourceful director David Cromer (''Tribes,'' ''Our Town''). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Grode)
'Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella' (in previews; opens on March 3) The 1957 television musical of ''Cinderella'' was a runaway smash and almost immediately began spawning stage incarnations, starring Eartha Kitt, Everett Quinton and Jean Stapleton (though they weren't cast in the title role). But this staging is the property's first appearance on Broadway, complete with a new book by Douglas Carter Beane (''Sister Act,'' ''The Little Dog Laughed'') and four fairly obscure songs from the Rodgers and Hammerstein catalog. Laura Osnes stars as Cinderella, and she is surrounded by three formidable scene stealers: Harriet Harris, Victoria Clark and Ann Harada. Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Talley's Folly' (previews start on Friday; opens on March 5) Two years after his death, Lanford Wilson is beginning to receive his due on New York stages. The Signature's revival of his ''Mound Builders'' opens in a few weeks, but first comes Mr. Wilson's 1980 Pulitzer Prize winner, a wistful 1940s romance between a Jewish immigrant (Danny Burstein) and a Protestant nurse (Sarah Paulson) in rural Missouri. Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Grode)
'This Clement World' (in previews; opens on Sunday) A decade into Cynthia Hopkins's working relationship with St. Ann's Warehouse, she isn't just resting on her laurels. In addition to a handful of new characters portrayed by the versatile Ms. Hopkins and a collection of original avant-folk compositions (performed by a septet and a choir), her latest piece includes video footage that she shot during a three-week Arctic expedition. It's designed to address climate change, but straight-ahead agitprop isn't exactly Ms. Hopkins's style. 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Grode)
Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' A four-alarm urgency infuses Scarlett Johansson's performance in Rob Ashford's oxygen-starved revival of Tennessee Williams's 1955 drama of sex and lies. If Ms. Johansson is oddly un-feline as Maggie the Cat, she sure has presence. The rest of the cast, including Benjamin Walker and Ciaran Hinds, gets lost in the heavy atmospherics (2:40). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes's Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Other Place' Laurie Metcalf gives a captivating, complicated performance in Sharr White's clever puzzle of a drama, portraying a woman grappling with sudden onset of a mysterious illness at the same time as her personal life -- disloyal husband (Bill Pullman), estranged daughter (Zoe Perry) -- threatens to implode. Joe Mantello's nimble direction ratchets up the suspense (1:10). Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (800) 432-7250, mtc-nyc.org. (Isherwood)
'Picnic' A torso stars in Sam Gold's stultifying revival of William Inge's time-yellowed 1953 play, set in lusty, dusty Kansas. The torso belongs to Sebastian Stan as a handsome drifter whose bare pecs and abs stir deep longings in lonely bosoms.

&#x2605; 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Pam MacKinnon's shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee's hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of ''August: Osage County'' fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder. Not to be missed (3:05). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'Airswimming' Charlotte Jones's story of two single women sent to a hospital for the criminally insane in 1924 because they had babies is not about the outrage at their treatment but about the sisterhood they build that helps them endure. Modestly staged, impressively acted, poignant, intelligent and at times wickedly funny (1:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Anita Gates)
'All the Rage' In Martin Moran's artfully rambling one-man show about anger (expressed and sublimated), the map of self-discovery is part of no known GPS program. Mr. Moran, directed by Seth Barrish, is very much his own tour guide, in a chatty but soulful show that leads you into thought-and-emotion-stirring territory not often visited at the theater (1:20). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Bethany' A single mother (the terrific America Ferrera) fights to win back custody of her child -- lost to foster care when she became homeless -- in Laura Marks's smart, compassionate play, featuring a fine supporting cast and sensitive direction by Gaye Taylor Upchurch (1:30). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Isherwood)
'Collision' Taken as a fast, creepy exercise in suspense, Lyle Kessler's play about a college roommate from hell might be reasonably diverting. But as David Fofi's production for the Amoralists company sprints and staggers toward an apocalyptic conclusion, it doesn't sustain the scrutiny invited by its too-topical plot (imagine ''Leopold and Loeb with automatic weapons'') (1:40). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, collisiontheplay.com. (Brantley)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Gates)
'5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche' This frolicsome play, about a women's club in 1956, ventures into such heady excesses of absurdism, it deserves to be called Mama-ist. (Dada wouldn't do at all.) As written by Evan Linder and Andrew Hobgood, with Sarah Gitenstein directing, ''Quiche'' takes a giant leap from punning smirkiness into the outer space of nonsense (1:15). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, sohoplayhouse.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Forever Dusty' If Kristen Holly Smith turned up to your costume party in Dusty Springfield drag and started singing, there would be no mistaking the woman she was channeling. But doing a passable impersonation is a far cry from capturing the essence of one of the most distinctive female vocalists of all time, as this amateurish inflated cabaret act demonstrates. Written in by-the-numbers basics by Ms. Smith and Jonathan Vankin, and directed with minimal finesse by Randal Myler, this misconceived bio-musical is a soulless tribute to the platinum-haired, panda-eyed queen of white soul. She deserves better (1:40). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, foreverdusty.net. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)

'Love in the Time of Cholera' Directed by José Zayas and performed by an efficient four-actor crew, Caridad Svich's adaptation of the Gabriel García Márquez novel is pleasing but lightweight. A production cannot live on romance alone. In Spanish with subtitles (2:00). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 889-2850, repertorio.org. (Claudia La Rocco)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30).

'Women of Will' Mixing casually delivered scholarly exposition with intensely rendered performance, this impassioned exploration of Shakespeare's heroines by Tina Packer traces their evolution through their language. When Ms. Packer and her co-star, Nigel Gore, get down to the business of acting, it's not just poetry in motion, it's thought made flesh. Eric Tucker directs (2:30).

'Working on a Special Day' This two-hander, directed and performed by Ana Graham and Antonio Vega, adapts Ettore Scola's 1977 film ''A Special Day'' for the stage. With the humblest of means -- chalk drawings, a few props -- the actors create a world, a refuge for two, playfully reminding us that theater is a place for make believe and that imagination can be a bulwark against oppression (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org, playco.org.

Off Off Broadway
'Here We Are' Like many Living Theater productions, this experimental, participatory performance is part examination of historical anarchist movements, part indictment of the current sociopolitical order and part team-building love-in. It would be easy to be cynical about the chanting, hugging, dancing and sandal-making (yes, sandal-making) of this loosely structured performance. But it's also easy to get caught up in the dramatic drum circle (1:15). Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (866) 811-4111, livingtheatre.org. (Catherine Rampell)
'The House of Von Macramé' A flamboyantly gory musical spoof of slasher movies, set in the fashion world, where everyone is either wearing or wielding a stiletto (metaphorically speaking). Delicious performances abound, and Matt Marks's songs are fun, but Joshua Conkel's script could stand to lose a few inches off the hemline (2:15). Bushwick Starr, 207 Starr Street, between Irving and Wyckoff Avenues, Brooklyn, (800) 836-3006, thebushwickstarr.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00). Duplex Cabaret Theater, 61 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, pattiissues.brownpapertickets.com. (Rooney)
'The Vandal' The playwriting debut of the actor Hamish Linklater is a modest comedy-drama of two lonely souls, a widow (the wonderful Deirdre O'Connell) and widower (Zach Grenier, ditto), brought together by a talky youngster played by the puckish Noah Robbins.

Last Chance
'Le Cid' (closes on Saturday) When Rodrigue's father is insulted, Rodrigue must seek vengeance. Inconveniently, his target happens to be his future father-in-law. It is the original Corneillian dilemma, named for this 1636 play by Pierre Corneille, of a choice between honor and love. The infatuations with face-saving veer from the tragic to the comic, usually by design. An uneven cast struggles with some of the meatier roles, but the rarely produced masterwork is still worth seeing (1:55).

'The Heiress' (closes on Saturday) Masterpiece Theater on Broadway. Moisés Kaufman's revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's sturdy war horse, starring a one-note Jessica Chastain, is lovely to look at, easy to follow and -- aside from a vivid supporting performance from Judith Ivey -- about as full of real life as an Olde New York Christmas window in a department store (2:45). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Moose Murders' It's back -- and not better than ever. Arthur Bicknell's farcical mystery was perhaps the most infamous Broadway flop of the 1980s.

HEADLINE: You Won the Prize, Now Get to Work

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
''The Job,'' CBS's awful new post-Super Bowl schedule filler, does have one redeeming aspect: It makes clear why so many Americans are unemployed. Some of them, it turns out, don't know how to make themselves worthy of hiring.
In the show, which begins on Friday night, five contestants face a potential employer in a ridiculously tarted-up competition format that results in a job offer for one of them. And in the two episodes provided for review it is evident that when it comes to job seeking we are a sorry lot indeed. 
One candidate turns up for an on-the-job tryout as assistant manager at the flagship Palm Restaurant in New York, underdressed even by Burger King standards. Another, seeking a job as an editorial assistant at Cosmopolitan, has pretty clearly not looked at a recent edition of the magazine. Two of her competitors can't spell.
Yes, it's tough being an employer with jobs to fill, even the not exactly top-shelf jobs offered in these two episodes. (The assistant manager position at the Palm is preposterously described as ''one of the most coveted jobs in the restaurant industry.'') But the poorly prepared candidates aren't nearly the most painful thing about this show, whose unfortunate host is Lisa Ling, a woman with some decent journalism on her résumé.
The really insufferable part is the format, which tries desperately to invest the awarding of an unspectacular job with drama and pathos. Five candidates are judged by representatives from the employer of the week, first based on a cursory tryout in the job in question, then with a silly quiz. (''What 'Avatar' actress became the first-ever cover girl of the new Cosmopolitan for Latinas?'')
Since none of that is very exciting, the show co-opts a gimmick from ''The Voice'' to add tension: Three alternate employers are standing by and can try to steal the best candidate with a job offer of their own. Also, a few of the candidates have the obligatory hard-luck stories, which here just seem exploitive.
It's all coated in a veneer of public service that includes no-brainer tips like, ''When you're interviewing for a job, make sure you don't start off with asking, 'When is my first vacation?' '' And don't apply to Cosmo without reading the danged thing first.
All this might be less embarrassing if the jobs at stake were substantial -- head of reality programming at CBS, for instance. That's not to minimize the plight of people who can't find even an entry-level position, but spending an hour of prime time trumpeting a job like editorial assistant as if it's a career-crowning achievement somehow diminishes what's happening in the real employment world. Heck, this show can't even claim to be microscopically reducing unemployment, at least not directly. Some of these candidates already have jobs.
Try as it might ''The Job'' can't hide what it really is: an hourlong advertisement for the Palm, Cosmopolitan and whatever other employers have signed up for an episode.
The Job
CBS, Friday nights at 8, Eastern and Pacific times; 7, Central time.
Produced by Sony Pictures Television and Embassy Row. Created by Michael Davies; Mr. Davies, Mark Burnett and Jay Bienstock, executive producers.

HEADLINE: A $10K Degree (Your Price May Vary)

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Arthur C. Brooks (''My Valuable, Cheap College Degree,'' Op-Ed, Feb. 1) suggests that in place of traditional classroom degrees we substitute $10,000 degrees (the so-called 10K-B.A.) delivered remotely, so as to address rising costs of public tuition. He does not suggest that the 10K-B.A. would be equivalent to the traditional education one gets at a public college or university.
Thus, he suggests solving the moral problem of providing access to those who can't afford a traditional degree by giving them less of an education for less money. 
Why has tuition at state institutions gone up? Collectively, states spend 10.8 percent less on higher education than before the recession. Furthermore, financing in 2011 was down 40.2 percent from 1980.
A better solution to the problem of access is for states and citizens to reinvest in public higher education, so that a quality degree can be delivered at a reasonable cost to students and their families.
KIRK LUDWIG Bloomington, Ind., Feb. 2, 2013
The writer is a professor of philosophy at Indiana University.
To the Editor:
The headline ''My Valuable, Cheap College Degree'' implies that a college degree costing $10,000 is equivalent to a traditional one costing many times that amount because both award the same bachelor's degree, the assumption being that the object of the exercise is the degree, not an education. Such an equivalency is false.
No one would argue that a BMW and a Ford Focus are equivalent, although both are cars. And I would argue that a bachelor's degree from Stanford is worth more than one from an online school, particularly if the standard is what was learned, not the degree granted.
Robert M. Hutchins, a onetime chancellor of the University of Chicago, reportedly once said we should award the B.A. at birth so that only those who want to learn will attend college. I agree.
BRUCE W. JOHNSON Hyannis Port, Mass., Feb. 1, 2013
To the Editor:
Arthur C. Brooks extols the virtues of an online education, which for him proved to be a much cheaper and apparently more successful educational endeavor than the ''unedifying year in college'' he spent in a traditional classroom.
I suspect that some of Mr. Brooks's success when he returned to school in his late 20s may be attributed to another factor: he had spent 10 years living life, becoming a musician and traveling abroad. These experiences probably taught him more than college courses ever could, and enabled him to return to his studies with one critical ingredient for college success: the desire to learn.
As Mr. Brooks himself put it, ''I was ready.''
CATHY BERNARD New York, Feb. 1, 2013
The writer is an associate professor of English at the New York Institute of Technology.
To the Editor:
You can get a good education at a bad school and a bad education at a good school. Education is what you make it. My 1970 degree from Villanova was a highlight of my life and a wonderful experience.
In today's world, a degree requires a cost-benefit assessment, and if you do not have an online component, you have missed some modern means to learn and communicate.
PHIL LUNNEY Roswell, Ga., Feb. 2, 2013
To the Editor:
With luck, the irony was not lost on Arthur C. Brooks: the value he says came from his thrifty 10K degree -- his master's, doctorate, professorship and even current job (president of the American Enterprise Institute) -- was made possible entirely from traditional educational institutions.

HEADLINE: Success of Immigrants' Children Measured

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
Americans who were born to immigrant parents, many of them the adult children of an enormous wave of immigrants who began arriving in the 1960s, are doing better than the foreign born on important measures of socioeconomic success, and in at least one area -- education -- have outperformed the population as a whole. 
Those findings were among many details released on Thursday by the Pew Research Center in a 130-page report that is perhaps the most detailed study of adult children of immigrants in the modern era of American immigration. The report relied on data from the Census Bureau and surveys Pew conducted itself over the last several years to produce what it called ''A Portrait of the Adult Children of Immigrants.''
Of the 36 million people in this group, some 20 million have reached adulthood, and, according to the report, they are less likely than the foreign born and the general population to be in poverty. Their rates of homeownership are on par with those of the general adult population.
In terms of educational attainment, 36 percent have at least a bachelor's degree, compared with 29 percent of the foreign born and 31 percent of all adults.
''In all the ways our country measures how well you're doing, the second generation is doing very well,'' saidPaul Taylor, the executive vice president of the Pew Research Center.
The median age of a second-generation adult is 38, and the group is distinct in its racial and ethnic mix: no one group holds a majority and it also has an above-average intermarriage rate. Of the group, 46 percent are white, 35 percent are Hispanic, 12 percent are Asian-American and 4 percent are black.
More than a third live in the West.
The findings come as a national debate is intensifying about a possible overhaul of immigration policy.
Given current immigration trends and birthrates, virtually all of the growth in the nation's working-age population between now and 2050 will be accounted for by immigrants and their children.
The Pew report also offers some insight on the social integration of immigrant families. For example, overwhelmingly, adult children of immigrants Americans speak English, Pew found.
Hispanics and Asian-Americans, who make up about half of that group, place more importance on hard work and career success than the general public, according to the report. And they are also likely to consider themselves a ''typical American.''
But the report offers some caveats. One is that the data, in aggregate, sometimes conceal subgroup differences by race and ethnicity.
''Throughout history, the second generation is the one that marches into the mainstream and makes advances on the economic front,'' Mr. Taylor said, ''and we see that playing out in the modern era.''

HEADLINE: Business and Labor United

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
After decades of friction over immigration, the nation's labor unions and the leading business association, the Chamber of Commerce, have formed an unusual alliance that is pushing hard to revamp American immigration laws.
These oft-feuding groups agree on the need to enact a way for the 11 million immigrants illegally in the United States to gain citizenship. And they are also nearing common ground on a critical issue -- the number of guest workers allowed into the country -- that has deeply divided business and labor for years and helped to sink President George W. Bush's push for an immigration overhaul in 2007.
In redefining what constitutes a guest worker and in revamping the method to determine how many should be allowed in, business and labor groups are sketching out new proposals that are distinct departures from earlier legislative approaches. 
The issue has long been one of contention, with businesses like hotels and farmers saying they need a large supply of seasonal workers while unions complain that these workers are often exploited. To try to resolve their differences, they are discussing what they call a ''data-driven system'' that would determine how many ''provisional workers'' would be let in each year to work on farms, summer resorts and elsewhere.
One proposal labor is pushing would have Congress establish a panel that would use economic, industry and regional data (like unemployment rates) to determine how many provisional workers should be allowed in annually to work in industries, like farming, that have seasonal surges in their demand for laborers. But business groups say they worry that such a panel would be unwieldy and act too slowly to meet employers' needs.
Under the proposals, the number of provisional workers permitted might increase when America's unemployment rate was low and then shrink if the rate was high. In addition, many of these provisional visa holders, after working successfully in the United States for several years, might be given permanent residency that could lead to citizenship.
In another important step forward, many labor unions have joined with the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups in embracing E-Verify, a federal electronic system that uses Social Security numbers and other data to verify that newly hired workers are in the country legally. Union leaders have frequently denounced E-Verify as error-prone, a continuing concern. They said it often declared that immigrants with valid papers were not authorized to work.
When President Bush pushed for an immigration overhaul in 2007, many unions -- long detesting the guest-worker program -- helped to persuade the Senate to phase out that program within five years. Once that phaseout was approved, many business groups grew far less enthusiastic about the immigration effort. That encouraged many Republicans -- already uneasy about what they viewed as ''amnesty'' -- to vote against the plan.
Maria Elena Durazo, the chairwoman of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s immigration committee, said labor's opposition to the guest-worker program was longstanding. ''Guest workers have no rights and no voice and no possibility of ever becoming legalized,'' she said. ''If they protest about wages or unsafe conditions, they risk getting deported.''
Many businesses have complaints with the current guest-worker program, disliking the frequent requirement to place advertisements to determine whether American workers are available before they can bring in guest workers.
''You have to go through four government agencies and often hire a lawyer and an agent,'' said Shawn McBurney, senior vice president of governmental affairs at the American Hotel and Lodging Association. ''It's unbelievably complicated, cumbersome and expensive.''
Labor unions have urged business to embrace a plan pushed by Ray Marshall, labor secretary under President Jimmy Carter. He suggests creating a commission of experts who would use economic data to determine, for instance, whether 20,000 or 40,000 immigrants should be granted provisional visas to do seasonal work nationwide at shellfish plants, restaurants or apple orchards.
''Instead of a system that works at the whim of any employer, it will be a data-driven system,'' said Richard Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Under the current system, he noted, employers have applied repeatedly for new batches of guest workers. A data-driven system would ensure an adequate flow of immigrants to help employers meet seasonal needs, he said.
Mr. McBurney of the hotel association disagreed. ''It will never work,'' he said. ''There are no experts who will know exactly what the economy will need -- this was proved by command and control economies. The bureaucracy will never be able to respond to the economy. The economy is a very dynamic thing. Bureaucracies aren't so dynamic.''
Randel K. Johnson, senior vice president for labor policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce, agreed. ''We oppose the commission because it would never be able to determine shortages in a timely manner that reflect the always-changing realities of the marketplace.''
Angelo Amador, vice president for labor policy at the National Restaurant Association, serves on the business-labor group seeking a consensus approach. ''I'm optimistic about reaching an agreement,'' on guest workers, he said. ''The pressure on both sides is great. If we don't come up with something, someone else is going to be drafted by other people.''
Demetrios G. Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington research group, predicted that it would be ''extremely difficult'' for the two sides to reach agreement on guest workers. He warned that without a deal between business and labor, the whole push for immigration changes could fail.
''They could get very close on this issue but might not be able to build a bridge to the other side,'' he said. ''One side starts from wanting zero guest workers and the other starts from unlimited. The unlimited side might move a lot, but the one that started with zero might not.''
He said the stakes were high for the union movement because if it plays a major role in gaining legal status for illegal immigrants, labor's image will soar among immigrants, and that might help persuade many immigrants to push to join unions.
Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, said labor unions were making a huge push for immigration changes.
''If we are going to make conditions better for all workers, we need to make sure that undocumented workers have the same rights as everybody else,'' he said. ''Otherwise, they'll be used to lower labor standards.''

HEADLINE: Kick That Can

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
John Boehner, the speaker of the House, claims to be exasperated. ''At some point, Washington has to deal with its spending problem,'' he said Wednesday. ''I've watched them kick this can down the road for 22 years since I've been here. I've had enough of it. It's time to act.''
Actually, Mr. Boehner needs to refresh his memory. During the first decade of his time in Congress, the U.S. government was doing just fine on the fiscal front. In particular, the ratio of federal debt to G.D.P. was a third lower when Bill Clinton left office than it was when he came in. It was only when George W. Bush arrived and squandered the Clinton surplus on tax cuts and unfunded wars that the budget outlook began deteriorating again. 
But that's a secondary issue. The key point is this: While it's true that we will eventually need some combination of revenue increases and spending cuts to rein in the growth of U.S. government debt, now is very much not the time to act. Given the state we're in, it would be irresponsible and destructive not to kick that can down the road.
Start with a basic point: Slashing government spending destroys jobs and causes the economy to shrink.
This really isn't a debatable proposition at this point. The contractionary effects of fiscal austerity have been demonstrated by study after study and overwhelmingly confirmed by recent experience -- for example, by the severe and continuing slump in Ireland, which was for a while touted as a shining example of responsible policy, or by the way the Cameron government's turn to austerity derailed recovery in Britain.
Even Republicans admit, albeit selectively, that spending cuts hurt employment. Thus John McCain warned earlier this week that the defense cuts scheduled to happen under the budget sequester would cause the loss of a million jobs. It's true that Republicans often seem to believe in ''weaponized Keynesianism,'' a doctrine under which military spending, and only military spending, creates jobs. But that is, of course, nonsense. By talking about job losses from defense cuts, the G.O.P. has already conceded the principle of the thing.
Still, won't spending cuts (or tax increases) cost jobs whenever they take place, so we might as well bite the bullet now? The answer is no -- given the state of our economy, this is a uniquely bad time for austerity.
One way to see this is to compare today's economic situation with the environment prevailing during an earlier round of defense cuts: the big winding down of military spending in the late 1980s and early 1990s, following the end of the cold war. Those spending cuts destroyed jobs, too, with especially severe consequences in places like southern California that relied heavily on defense contracts. At the national level, however, the effects were softened by monetary policy: the Federal Reserve cut interest rates more or less in tandem with the spending cuts, helping to boost private spending and minimize the overall adverse effect.
Today, by contrast, we're still living in the aftermath of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and the Fed, in its effort to fight the slump, has already cut interest rates as far as it can -- basically to zero. So the Fed can't blunt the job-destroying effects of spending cuts, which would hit with full force.
The point, again, is that now is very much not the time to act; fiscal austerity should wait until the economy has recovered, and the Fed can once again cushion the impact.
But aren't we facing a fiscal crisis? No, not at all. The federal government can borrow more cheaply than at almost any point in history, and medium-term forecasts, like the 10-year projections released Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office, are distinctly not alarming. Yes, there's a long-term fiscal problem, but it's not urgent that we resolve that long-term problem right now. The alleged fiscal crisis exists only in the minds of Beltway insiders.
Still, even if we should put off spending cuts for now, wouldn't it be a good thing if our politicians could simultaneously agree on a long-term fiscal plan? Indeed, it would. It would also be a good thing if we had peace on earth and universal marital fidelity. In the real world, Republican senators are saying that the situation is desperate -- but not desperate enough to justify even a penny in additional taxes. Do these sound like men ready and willing to reach a grand fiscal bargain?
Realistically, we're not going to resolve our long-run fiscal issues any time soon, which is O.K. -- not ideal, but nothing terrible will happen if we don't fix everything this year. Meanwhile, we face the imminent threat of severe economic damage from short-term spending cuts.
So we should avoid that damage by kicking the can down the road. It's the responsible thing to do.

HEADLINE: Obama Fund-Raiser Said to Be Cabinet Candidate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Penny Pritzker, an heiress to the Hyatt hotel fortune, is a leading candidate to become President Obama's next commerce secretary as the president slowly moves to complete his second-term economic team.
Ms. Pritzker, who led the groundbreaking fund-raising effort for Mr. Obama's first presidential campaign, withdrew from consideration for the same position in 2008, with some people suggesting that her family's immense wealth might complicate her nomination at a time of deep financial crisis.
Now, however, people familiar with the president's thinking, who declined to be named because no announcement had been made, said he may yet turn to Ms. Pritzker to lead the Commerce Department and join the administration's effort to recharge the still sluggish economy. She would succeed Rebecca M. Blank, who has been acting secretary since John Bryson resigned last year, citing health reasons. 
A formal announcement of who will lead the department is still weeks away, a White House official said, and Mr. Obama could still choose someone else. In the meantime, the president is also searching for replacements in other crucial agencies and departments. The official declined to be named discussing personnel issues.
The economic team is to be led by Jack Lew, the former chief of staff whom Mr. Obama nominated to be Treasury secretary. The Senate has not yet considered confirming Mr. Lew's appointment.
Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the president of the Walmart Foundation and a former budget official for President Bill Clinton, is viewed as the leading candidate to become director of the Office of Management and Budget, replacing Jeffrey Zients, who is running the department as its deputy director.
Mr. Zients is viewed as a top contender to become the United States trade representative. Ron Kirk, the current trade representative, announced last month that he was leaving the administration.
In the coming weeks, the president must also fill the top spots at the Departments of Labor, Transportation and Energy, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency.
If Mr. Obama chooses Ms. Pritzker -- a close personal friend -- to lead the Commerce Department, it could elevate the post after four years in which a series of secretaries and acting replacements largely failed to play a central role in the president's economic deliberations.
By contrast, Ms. Pritzker would enter as a close confidante of Mr. Obama's. A fellow Chicagoan, Ms. Pritzker's tireless fund-raising efforts in 2007 made it possible for Mr. Obama to compete against Hillary Rodham Clinton in the long series of Democratic primaries.
By connecting Mr. Obama to a vast network of bankers and business executives, Ms. Pritzker helped raise nearly $750 million for Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign. But her personal fortune and her family's hotel chain made her a target for criticism, including some from organized labor, which has long accused Hyatt of providing poor working conditions for housekeepers.
During the 2012 campaign, Ms. Pritzker played a less prominent role, raising money for the campaign but not leading the effort.
At Commerce, Ms. Pritzker could provide the president with a new way to reach out to the business community, which has sometimes been skeptical of his administration's policies. Ms. Pritzker has degrees in law and business from Stanford.
As a woman, she would also help increase the diversity in his second-term cabinet after the departures of several women and minorities. Mr. Obama chose white men to serve at the State Department, the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency and as his chief of staff.

HEADLINE: Success of Immigrants' Children Measured

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
Americans who were born to immigrant parents, many of them the adult children of an enormous wave of immigrants who began arriving in the 1960s, are doing better than the foreign born on important measures of socioeconomic success, and in at least one area -- education -- have outperformed the population as a whole. 
Those findings were among many details released on Thursday by the Pew Research Center in a 130-page report that is perhaps the most detailed study of adult children of immigrants in the modern era of American immigration. The report relied on data from the Census Bureau and surveys Pew conducted itself over the last several years to produce what it called ''A Portrait of the Adult Children of Immigrants.''
Of the 36 million people in this group, some 20 million have reached adulthood, and, according to the report, they are less likely than the foreign born and the general population to be in poverty. Their rates of homeownership are on par with those of the general adult population.
In terms of educational attainment, 36 percent have at least a bachelor's degree, compared with 29 percent of the foreign born and 31 percent of all adults.
''In all the ways our country measures how well you're doing, the second generation is doing very well,'' saidPaul Taylor, the executive vice president of the Pew Research Center.
The median age of a second-generation adult is 38, and the group is distinct in its racial and ethnic mix: no one group holds a majority and it also has an above-average intermarriage rate. Of the group, 46 percent are white, 35 percent are Hispanic, 12 percent are Asian-American and 4 percent are black.
More than a third live in the West.
The findings come as a national debate is intensifying about a possible overhaul of immigration policy.
Given current immigration trends and birthrates, virtually all of the growth in the nation's working-age population between now and 2050 will be accounted for by immigrants and their children.
The Pew report also offers some insight on the social integration of immigrant families. For example, overwhelmingly, adult children of immigrants Americans speak English, Pew found.
Hispanics and Asian-Americans, who make up about half of that group, place more importance on hard work and career success than the general public, according to the report. And they are also likely to consider themselves a ''typical American.''
But the report offers some caveats. One is that the data, in aggregate, sometimes conceal subgroup differences by race and ethnicity.
''Throughout history, the second generation is the one that marches into the mainstream and makes advances on the economic front,'' Mr. Taylor said, ''and we see that playing out in the modern era.''

HEADLINE: A Detour on the Road to an Electric Future

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: A small municipal electric provider in Connecticut says its experience with electric vehicles leaves room for skepticism. 

 BODY:
When I embarked on a test of Tesla's new East Coast electric vehicle charging network, I did not expect to become a rate-paying customer of Norwich Public Utilities, a small municipal electric provider in Norwich, Conn. But my Tesla Model S was running dangerously low on juice and I needed a quick fill-up to make it to the Tesla Supercharger station in Milford, Conn., about 60 miles away. 
The Norwich utility, taking advantage of a grant from the Department of Energy under President Obama's 2009 stimulus package, recently installed four medium-power electric-vehicle charging posts at its customer service center. But they haven't proved terribly popular.
Jeanne Kurasz, programs coordinator for the utility, said that only five people had applied in the past year for the electronic cards needed to activate the J1772 chargers, which work on most electric vehicles, including the Tesla.
When I walked into the service center looking for a few amps for the Tesla, I had to fill out a form to establish an account so they could bill me for the electricity the car would draw. When I returned to the car after a little more than an hour of charging, I found a note from Ms. Kurasz saying that the company would forgo the charge if I'd return the electronic card. I had drawn 8.4 kilowatt-hours for a total cost of about $1.36. It would have cost more to prepare and mail the bill and keep me as a customer -- I live in a Maryland suburb of Washington -- than the billing was worth to the utility. In a follow-up telephone conversation, Ms. Kurasz expressed some skepticism about electric vehicles, based on the sparse use of the charging station as well as the utility's experience with battery-powered vehicles.
She said the company owned a Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid and a Ford Transit Connect vanconverted to run on battery power alone. The Volt, she said, drove perhaps 30 miles before switching to its gasoline engine, which then generates the electric power that turns the wheels. The Ford van, which promised 100 miles of range, got a fraction of that and could not complete a day's work before having to be plugged in. "It wasn't good for what we purchased it for, so that was a disappointment, and then the company that did the conversion went bankrupt," she said. "So, O.K."
The company powers much of its day-to-day fleet with compressed natural gas, which she says is clean, quiet and cheap.
"That's a success," she said. "If you want to talk about alternative fuels for transportation, C.N.G. is more successful than electric."
Certainly my trip along Tesla's East Coast electric highway proved disappointing -- my high-tech Model S test car ended up stranded off Interstate 95, requiring a flatbed truck to get to the Supercharger in Milford. You can read the entire account of the trip here, and post your comments below.

HEADLINE: 8 Things I Learned From Reading Every Last Word of Baku

BYLINE: JON KELLY


HIGHLIGHT: The magazine, not the city. 

 BODY:
In this Sunday's magazine, Peter Savodnik explores Baku's attempt to become a new hub for the itinerant filthy rich. In some sense, the article was born a couple years ago when Peter and I worked on a piece for Bloomberg Businessweek about Eurovision, the pan-European song contest in which "American Idol" meets Davos with drum machines. Azberbaijan, which isn't even really in Europe, was hoping to use its 2011 victory to jump-start a nation rebranding campaign. As it happens, it might just work out.
Azerbaijan has adapted numerous facets of American nouveau riche culture. And I learned about a new one this weekend when Hugo Lindgren, the magazine's editor, e-mailed me to ask, "Have you seen the Jason Binn-style magazine called Baku?" 
I hadn't, but I was hardly surprised that Baku had its own version of Hamptons or Capitol File, two of Binn's more memorable magazines. The point of those magazines, after all, is for the newly rich to celebrate their richness, and that, of course, seems to be the entire point of Baku, the city. Naturally, Baku, the magazine, would follow.
What did surprise me, however, is that the magazine isn't that bad (I read it in print; its Web site appears to only function in Russian). Even in broken English, it was superior to Hamptons. (Only after reading it did I realize that it was published by Condé Nast.)
Here are eight things I learned from the latest issue.
 1. How rich is Baku, the city? The first four ads in Baku, the magazine, are Dior, Bulgari, Tom Ford and Celine. The next page features an ad from Eren Yorulmazer, an architect and interior designer whose work seems to reflect what a high-end strip club would look like on Pluto.
 2. There's an emerging art scene. (No surprise - after countries like China and India became rich, their native art markets experienced their own booms.) I still cannot describe Azeri art.
 3. How rich is Baku, the city, Part 2? Burberry recently opened a children's store there.
 4. Azerbaijan recently hosted the Under-17 Women's World Cup. That was particularly surprising for a predominantly Muslim country.
 5. I admit to sort of being charmed by the headline "A Sultan of Bling," which goes with a profile of Roberto Cavalli. So much better than I could do in Azerbaijani!
 6. The fashion story about Baku's winter looks, with models shot amid the city's 18th-century architecture, was pretty amazing and could have easily been in W. Great fashion credits, too. Prada and Chanel were side by side with smaller designers like Christopher Kane.
 7. Great story on Lotfi Zadeh, the Baku-born University of California, Berkeley, mathematician. The layout looks as if it could have appeared in an American magazine like Wired.
 8. Jennifer Lopez has been to Baku! Jennifer Lopez loves Baku! Says Jennifer Lopez: "I have an amazing view out of my hotel. Wow. It's gorgeous. The Flame Towers are beautiful. What's that building by the waterfront that looks like a rolled up thing? The National Carpet Museum? That's amazing!" I think she is actually talking about the Zaha Hadid-designed Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center. But it definitely does look like a bunch of rolled-up carpets.
An earlier version of this post misspelled the given name of a Baku-born mathematician who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley. He is Lotfi Zadeh, not Lofti.

HEADLINE: The Family and Medical Leave Act, 20 Years Later

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON


HIGHLIGHT: Twenty years after President Clinton signed the Family Leave and Medical Act, much remains to be done to expand its benefits to all workers, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Laura D'Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and was chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton. 
Twenty years ago, just a few weeks after his inauguration, President Clinton fulfilled a campaign pledge and signed his first bill - the Family and Medical Leave Act. The law sent a strong signal of his commitment to provide more opportunities for American workers in return for more personal responsibility. 
The legislation covers workers in businesses with more than 50 employees who satisfy additional eligibility conditions, such as hours worked during the last year. About 60 percent of all workers are covered and eligible for leave under the act. Covered and eligible workers are allowed to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to recover from a medical condition or to provide care for sick family members or a new child. 
The benefits of the Family and Medical Leave Act are real and significant. Although the provided leave is unpaid, it ensures job protection and the extension of health insurance when workers are temporarily unable to work for medical or family reasons. Moreover, a just-published Labor Departmentsurvey finds that most employees who take leave for family and medical reasons receive partial pay (17 percent) or full pay (48 percent ) for short leaves (fewer than 10 days), often drawing on paid leave days they have accrued during the previous year. However, workers in low-wage jobs are much less likely to receive even partial pay during a leave than workers in high-wage jobs.
Since its passage, the law has been used more than 100 million times to improve the lives of American workers. Meanwhile, dire predictions by critics that it would destroy jobs and harm business have proven wrong. Employers covered by the law report little or no difficulty complying with its provisions. Indeed, many businesses credit the law with reducing turnover and increasing worker morale. 
The Labor Department survey also reveals how American workers choose to use their rights under the law. About 16 percent of covered and eligible workers under the Family and Medical Leave Act took leave last year, a share comparable to that in 2000. About 5 percent reported that they needed leave but were unable to take it, primarily because they could not afford to sacrifice their pay. This is about double the share in 2000 when real median wages and family incomes were higher. About 57 percent of all leaves are taken by workers because of their own medical conditions, with another 22 percent for pregnancy or birth of a child and 20 percent to care for a sick family member. 
Most leaves are short - about 42 percent last fewer than 10 days and about 17 percent last more than 60 days. Almost all workers who take leave return to their employers. Less than 10 percent decide not to return to work. The Family and Medical Leave Act appears to strengthen, not weaken, worker attachment to the labor force, increasing employment and income stability over time. 
Not surprisingly, because they bear children and still shoulder much of child- and elder-care responsibilities in families, women are a third more likely to take leave than men, and women with children are significantly more likely than men to report unmet leave needs. Over all, however, it appears that the Family and Medical Leave Act has had a small effect on parental-leave usage by mothers and no discernible effect on parental leave usage by fathers, indicating that there are financial limits on the extent to which families are willing and able to use unpaid leave for this purpose. 
Women account for about 50 percent of all workers in the United States, which boasts one of the highest labor-force participation rates for women in the world - about 70 percent for women with children and about 60 percent for women with children under the age of 6 in 2011. 
Most children now grow up in families without a full-time stay-at-home parental caregiver. More than 25 percent of American children live in single-parent households, the highest share in the developed countries, and about 75 percent of these households are headed by a woman. In the United States, single mothers work more hours and yet have higher poverty rates than single mothers in other high-income countries. The percentage of children living in poverty in the United States is considerably higher as a result. 
Yet the United States is the only developed country that does not provide paid parental leave to women workers (or their spouses) to bear and care for children. 
And businesses have not filled the policy void. Only about 25 percent of employers in the United States offer fully paid "maternity-related" leave and about 20 percent offer no such leave whether paid or unpaid. About 46 percent of workers have access to some paid parental leave, sometimes through a combination of earned sick days or vacation time, but access varies by wages and education. 
Workers whose average wages arein the lowest 25 percent within their industry are about one-fourth as likely to have access to paid family leave than those whose wages are in the highest 25 percent. According tothe Census Bureau, between 2006 and 2008 about two-thirds of new mothers with a bachelor's degree or higher had access to paid parental leave, compared with only 18 percent of new mothers with a high school diploma or less. 
Like other employee benefits, employer-sponsored parental leave programs heighten inequality among American workers and fail to address the daunting problems confronting low-income single mothers and their children. This population is themost vulnerable and least served by the current mix of family-support policies. 
Contrary to concerns that paid parental leave is a disincentive to work, access to parental leave, paid or unpaid, increases the likelihood that a woman will return to work after the birth of a child. Among new mothers who work while pregnant and are able to take paid leave, almost 90 percent return to work within one year. And harsh necessity makes these "return to work" incentives stronger for less-educated and lower-income women. 
According to research by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the World Economic Forum, paid parental leave programs, along with affordable child care, improve employment levels among women, increase the returns to their education and reduce gender inequalities in earnings and promotion opportunities. The results are faster and more equitable growth and a lower incidence of poverty among children.
The Family and Medical Leave Act has been a success. But its effectiveness at addressing the challenges confronting American workers is limited for two reasons. First, the law is not universal and many of those not covered and eligible are young adults in their childbearing years, are from minority backgrounds and are low-wage workers. Second, many eligible workers are not able to take leave because it is unpaid and they cannot afford to give up their wages. 
It is time to consider extending the Family and Medical Leave Act to provide all workers with access to paid family and medical leaves that are job-protected and include some financial support. Researchers at the Center for American Progress have outlined a plan, called Social Security Cares, to achieve this goal. Social Security Cares is a family and medical leave insurance program that would cover all workers for the same life events covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act and offer partial wage replacement. The Social Security Administration would administer the program, which would be paid for with a small increase in the payroll tax. California has hada similar paid family-leave insurance plan for the last decade, and New Jersey and Washington have passed comparable legislation. 
Back in 1993, when President Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act after more than 10 years of debate and opposition, it was clear that American families were changing. Change has continued. We should open a new debate about how to modernize the Family and Medical Leave Act to address the needs of modern American families.

HEADLINE: In the Rockies, Growing Support for Renewables

BYLINE: NATE SCHWEBER


HIGHLIGHT: Across the region, poll respondents tended to favor investment in wind or solar power over investment in fossil fuels. 

 BODY:
A new poll tracking the conservation attitudes of residents of the six Rocky Mountain States shows that support is strong for greater protection of public lands and investment in renewable energy. It also offers some clues to why public policy does not dovetail with public opinion in those areas.
In early January, two polling companies questioned 2,400 registered voters across Arizona, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. Brendan Boepple, program coordinator for Colorado College's State of the Rockies Project, said the results highlighted "the disparity between the reality and the rhetoric among Western voters." 
In a region where fossil fuel extraction has long been an economic linchpin, wind and solar ranked first in most states when voters were asked what two energy sources they wanted to see more money spent on.
In Arizona, for example, greater investment in solar energy was supported by 74 percent of those polled, and wind, by 43 percent. Support for more oil drilling and coal extraction registered at just 8 percent and 6 percent, respectively. (Support for solar power was far lower in Montana and Wyoming, however.)

"Overwhelmingly, they're pointing to renewables," said Lori Weigel, a partner with Public Opinion Strategies, which regularly conducts polling for the Republican Party. The other polling firm, Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz and Associates, is associated with the Democratic Party.
A majority of respondents said that while some public lands should be drilled, environmentally sensitive places should be off limits forever. Ms. Weigel said the poll indicates that Rocky Mountain residents want a better balance.
"They don't want to shut the door on development, but it's pretty clear they want to see more protection," she said. "They want to make sure that their clean water, clean air, wildlife and places to recreate are protected."
The poll was released on Thursday, a day after the Obama administration announced the nomination of Sally Jewell as the new secretary of the interior. Ms. Jewell's blend of oil expertise, enthusiasm for the outdoors and conservation advocacy is viewed by some as emblematic of the evolving land ethic across the Rocky Mountain states. 
The survey results also come on the heels of a speech in Washington in which Bruce Babbitt, a former interior secretary, admonished the Obama administration for opening public lands to drilling without making commensurate conservation efforts. 
Nine in ten people polled said that national parks, forests, monuments and wildlife preserves are essential to the economy. Three in four said that those lands furnish good jobs, and more than seven in 10 said that no public lands should be sold to private corporations. 
Three in five said that drilling should not be allowed in "critical locations" near recreation areas, water sources or wildlife. Only 35 percent said that more public lands should be opened to "responsible energy development."
To reflect the region's changing demographics, the poll was also conducted in Spanish. Sixty-four percent of Latino respondents described themselves as pro-conservationist, virtually mirroring the result for the Rocky Mountain states as a whole. 
While support for more conservation has remained constant during the three years since the poll began, David Metz, who works for the Democratic-leaning polling company Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz and Associates, said he set out this year to understand why western politics and policy depart in some ways from public opinion. 
He learned that 54 percent of Rocky Mountain residents are unaware of how their leaders have voted with regard to protecting land, air and water. "People don't have a clear idea of what their elected officials are doing," Mr. Metz said.
For example, more than two-thirds of people interviewed either said that no drilling was taking place on public lands or that they didn't have enough information to answer whether it was or not. In reality, 38 million public acres across the United States, including land in 42 national park units are leased for oil and gas drilling, something that most western lawmakers support.
"There's a mismatch," Mr. Metz said. "One of our goals with this poll is to show a common scientific set of data to better connect where public officials are and where the public is."
The poll suggested that voters would have a "more favorable" impression of any candidate who voiced support for public land protection. But the degree varied depending on the candidate's party affiliation. 
The results suggest that Republican candidates stand to gain the most by championing land conservation; a Republican candidate who took that stance would draw support from more Democratic voters than a Democratic candidate would from Republicans.
Walt Hecox, faculty director for the State of the Rockies Project, argues that politicians should pay close attention to the study. "Westerners see the permanent protection of their public lands as an economic imperative and essential to their quality of life," he said in a statement. "Decision-makers would do well to take notice."
The poll also showed that while 85 percent Rocky Mountain residents engage in at least one outdoor recreational activity, 83 percent of parents worry that children don't spend enough time outside.

HEADLINE: White House Delivers Dire Warning About Automatic Cuts

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: White House officials described as dire the effects of the automatic, across-the-board cuts to defense and domestic spending that will kick in on March 1 unless Congress and President Obama agree on a plan to put them off. 

 BODY:
 5:12 p.m. | Updated With a real blizzard bearing down on New England, the policy wonks in the White House tried every which way they could on Friday to warn of the dangers of a different kind of storm.
The officials gathered reporters to describe what they believe will be the effects of sequestration, the automatic, across-the-board cuts to defense and domestic spending that will kick in on March 1 unless Congress and President Obama agree on a plan to put them off. 
The string of adjectives was meant to be chilling: "large and arbitrary," "severe," "significant and harmful," "very significant," "blunt," "mindless" and "extraordinarily troublesome."
They didn't stop with just adjectives, though. In their effort to pressure Republican lawmakers to agree to tax increases as well as spending cuts, White House officials predicted specific consequences that Americans might not like. 
Among them, they said: 70,000 young children will be kicked off Head Start early education programs; hundreds of federal prosecutors will be furloughed; food safety inspections will be cut back; 600,000 women and children will lose nutritional benefits; and small-business loans will be cut by about $500 million.
"The cuts would cause very significant disruptions that would be felt far and wide across the country," said Danny Werfel, the federal controller of the Office of Management and Budget. "This is just the tip of the iceberg. We can't plan our way out of these consequences or take steps to soften the blow."
The briefing was the latest attempt by Mr. Obama's White House to try and make sure that Republicans receive the blame for the consequences of the automatic cuts -- if they happen.
Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the House speaker, John A. Boehner, tried to deflect that blame, noting that the House has already proposed alternative spending cuts as a way of avoiding the automatic ones. Mr. Obama has said he wants a mix of spending cuts and tax increases.
And a news release from the speaker's office had the headline: "White House Outlines Devastating Consequences of President Obama's Sequester."
"The president is out of excuses," Mr. Buck said in a statement e-mailed to reporters. "We're glad they're laying out the devastating consequences of the president's sequester, but the question remains: what are they willing to do to prevent it?"
A spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said in a message on Twitter after the White House briefing: "Words not used at WH briefing to describe sequestered budget cuts: 'Here's our plan.' "
At the White House, the economic officials conducting the briefing lamented the lack of flexibility in the sequestration law, which they noted was intentional.
"It was intended to drive Democrats and Republicans in Congress to compromise," Mr. Werfel said. "It does not represent a responsible way to achieve deficit reduction."
And yet, none of Mr. Obama's aides were willing to say that the president regretted signing the law that put the sequestration plan into effect. Jay Carney, the president's press secretary, said the automatic cuts were the only way to avoid a default on the national debt in the summer of 2011.
White House officials are quick to point out that Republicans in the House embraced the idea of the automatic cuts as a way to force deficit discipline. They point out that 174 House Republicans voted for sequestration, including Mr. Boehner, who proclaimed himself pleased when it passed.
Mr. Carney said the idea that the automatic cuts were all the president's idea is a "fanciful confection" invented by Republicans. 
And yet, none of Mr. Obama's aides were willing to say that the president regretted signing the law that put the sequestration plan into effect. Mr. Carney said that because of Republican opposition to tax increases, the automatic cuts became the only way to avoid a default on the national debt in the summer of 2011.
"He could not let the country default for the first time, thus the sequester," Mr. Carney said. "The whole point in its design was that it would never come to pass."

HEADLINE: Poet and Prophet of El Barrio May Soon Be a Pauper

BYLINE: DAVID GONZALEZ


HIGHLIGHT: Side Street: Jesus "Papoleto" Melendez, 62, one of the founders of the Nuyorican Poetry movement, is three months behind on rent and finding that work opportunities for a poet are few. 

 BODY:
 Update, Feb. 12 | Many readers have expressed interest in donating to Mr. Melendez. Here is his address: P.O. Box 268, New York, N.Y. 10029-0260. Also, a fellow poet, Roberto Garcia, has begun an online fund-raising campaign through the site fundly.com. Click for his fund-raising campaign.
The poems of Jesus "Papoleto" Melendez have a bopping rhythm, where words cascade down the page and - when he recites them - swirl around the room, through the window and out onto the streets of El Barrio. Among the founders of the Nuyorican Poetry movement, his poems are carefully crafted reflections on urban life, with equal doses of humor, anger, love and absurdity. 
He learned just how absurd in recent months, when his poems were translated into Spanish for "Hey Yo! Yo Soy!" a collection stretching back 40 years.
"We are so used to our poverty, to the conditions we suffer through," Papoleto said. "You're accustomed to seeing homelessness in your neighborhood. We talk casually about ghetto things. But when you read it in Spanish, it blows your mind. How can a people live like this?"
This is not a rhetorical question. He is three months behind on his $662 rent for his tiny one-bedroom apartment on East 111th Street - the same narrow warren where he spent the first 14 years of his life. Unemployment benefits he had thought would be extended through March - when several events related to his book would be held - instead ended in December. He is looking for work, but opportunities for a poet are few.
On a bookcase crammed with dog-eared tomes, rests a letter rejecting him for food stamps. He awaits a decision about welfare. At 62 years of age, a man who has been a poet, a prophet and king - Gaspar, in the neighborhood's Three Kings Day Parade - now might end up being a pauper.
"The weeks of unemployment I thought I had left were enough to keep me afloat, even while teetering on the edge of catastrophe," he said. "Now, I'm in the black hole."
He had cobbled a living from workshops and recitals and by teaching local classes until 2011, when a program that employed him lost funding. Colleges and classrooms have increasingly turned to younger "spoken word" artists who have laid claim to the Nuyorican tradition, but not his discipline. Nor his life experience.
"There is a lot of vanity, where they've co-opted our movement and watered down everything," he said. "They don't teach technique. They teach shouting."
Sandra Maria Esteves, a poet who wrote the introduction for his book, said it was not uncommon for Papoleto to do 20 revisions or more for one poem. Then he would rehearse, alone, with a microphone to get the cadences down pat. She can relate to his craft, as well as his predicament.
"Ultimately, we're in a society that does not support paying poets," she said. "Poets show up, often for no pay, and in the past few years the pay scale has gone way down. I haven't gotten much lately."
A poster by his desk declares "Embryonic Poet Laureate" - his riposte to learning about someone being named a teenage poet laureate. It adorns the apartment he returned to in 1997 after seeing the building being renovated - he wrote the landlord an essay to snag the place. His early life there was formed as much by his father's absence as his presence. Abraham Melendez - a tinted photo of him looking dapper in a suit adorns the living room - was a Merchant seaman, musician and junkie.
The building where his father cooled his heels - between voyages or benders - was a playground for him and his friends. They would play cowboys and Indians on the twisty stairways and narrow halls. But other things happened too.
"My memories of my father are potent, but few," he admitted. "I remember once he was shooting up in the hallway upstairs. Even then, he would tell me stuff he knew. 'Do you know there are two New Yorks?' he asked me. 'There's New York City and New York State.'"
He betrayed no irony in the retelling, considering his circumstances. Instead, he shared pictures of the old days - from rooftop scenes to super-sharp club dates - cradling them in his hands like treasures. With a smile, he held out a snapshot of him and Pedro Pietri, a fellow poet, facing the 1977 blackout with candles and bottle of rum.
Filing cabinets are crammed with neatly organized files: of poems past, present and future. He ducked into the sunny bedroom - the only place where sunlight graces the walls - and emerged with a worn leather saddlebag. Gently, he plucked out a thick volume of poems he bound in soft, floppy leather. The onionskin pages gently rustled as he flipped through to his early work.
Within moments, he began to read. Whatever worry creased his face vanished. He swayed gently, as his words flowed through the room, the room with his memories, his writings, his life. The room he may lose.
But not today. Not now.

HEADLINE: Home Equity as Nest Egg

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
Even though the housing market has not recovered, nearly half of older working Americans expect to use equity in their homes to help finance their retirement, a new survey finds. 
Roughly 47 percent of employed Americans ages 50 to 70 said they were relying on equity in their homes, the Retirement Check-In survey from Ameriprise Financial found. The finding is surprising, an accompanying report notes, because housing values in many parts of the country remain below the level they were before the recession. Also, 37 percent of homeowners say they're not on track to pay off their mortgage before they retire.
More people said they were relying on home equity now compared with before the recession, the report finds. When participants were asked whether, before the downturn, they had expected to rely on home equity to help pay for their retirement, just 39 percent said yes.
While the reason for that shift isn't entirely clear, the report says it is plausible that the loss in value of other investments during the recession may have been so steep that many older workers feel they have no other alternative, even if their homes are worth less than they used to be.
"My hypothesis is that people didn't think they were going to need to tap into equity because they thought they would have sufficient assets," said Suzanna de Baca, vice president of wealth strategies at Ameriprise Financial. "Now, despite the fact they have reduced home equity, the shortfall between what they've saved and what they need is greater."
The finding is typical of a "perplexing disparity" between Americans' emotional outlook for retirement and the reality they face, the report said.
For instance, nearly three-quarters indicated that their dream retirement included taking "really nice vacations." Yet, when asked if they would be able to afford the essentials in retirement, fewer than half said they felt "extremely" or "very" confident. And just 38 percent said they were confident they could afford the extras they had been anticipating in retirement, like traveling and hobbies.
The telephone survey included 1,000 employed Americans age 50 to 70, with investable assets of at least $100,000 (including employer-based retirement plans, but not real estate) and who are planning to retire at some point. Koski Research conducted the survey on behalf of Ameriprise Financial from Oct. 31 and Nov. 14, 2012. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
What role does home equity play in your retirement plans?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: By Gender and by Age, an Unequal Recovery

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
SINCE the job market in the United States hit bottom more than three years ago, men have benefited from the recovery far more than woman have, with middle-aged women doing particularly poorly.
From December 2009 through last month, the economy added 5.3 million jobs, according to the Labor Department's monthly survey of households. Only 30 percent of them went to women. To some extent, that is simply a reflection of the fact that the recession hit men much harder than women, but the result has been at least a temporary reversal of the long trend of women holding an ever-increasing share of jobs.
The proportion of jobs held by women, which was around 28 percent when the household survey began in 1948, rose to a peak of 47.5 percent in January 2010, just after the economy hit bottom. During that period, there was only one substantial setback to the trend, in 1952 and 1953, when the end of the Korean War brought soldiers back to the civilian economy. 
But in the first months of this recovery, that number fell as low as 46.6 percent, and it was at just 46.8 percent in January.
The household survey is separate from the establishment survey, which asks employers how many people are on their payrolls. That survey hit bottom in February 2010, and showed 5.5 million jobs had been added. But it does not collect information on gender, as the household survey does.
The accompanying charts show the changing employment patterns since the end of 2009 for men and women in various age groups, from 20 to 24 years to over 55. Because demographic shifts have been abrupt for some groups, like the baby boomers -- there are a lot more people over 55 now, and fewer people aged 35 to 54 -- the charts look at changes in the employment-to-population ratio.
That ratio differs from the more widely noted unemployment rate in that it compares the number of people who have jobs with the total population, not just with the total number of people who say they were working or looking for jobs during the month.
In January, 54.6 percent of women over the age of 20 had jobs. That was the lowest proportion since 1993, and 0.8 percentage point lower than the figure in December 2009. By contrast, 67.6 percent of men over 20 had jobs, a rate that is 1.3 percentage points higher than it was at the end of 2009, although still below prerecession levels.
The sharpest declines in employment for women were in the 20-to-24 and 45-to-54 age groups. The decline in the younger group may reflect the difficulties young people face in trying to start a career, but the decline in the middle-aged group is not so easily explained.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors, said it might be a result of who has, and has not, been hiring. He pointed to the Institute for Supply Management's survey of manufacturers, which has indicated that companies are hiring, and to the survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, which indicates that its members are not. ''Women are more likely to be employed by small service-sector companies than by large manufacturers,'' he said.
The largest increase in the proportion of women with jobs has come among those over 55, which is also the group that is growing the fastest. It seems likely that more men and women are delaying retirement. The proportion of women aged 55 to 59 with jobs does not appear to be increasing, but the proportion of women aged 60 to 64 with jobs has been rising.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Narrows, Countering a Report of a Contraction

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The United States economy most likely expanded slightly in the fourth quarter, instead of contracting, according to trade data released Friday that suggested a surprise drop in gross domestic product reported last week may have been overstated. 
The country's trade deficit narrowed to $38.5 billion in December, its lowest reading in nearly three years, Commerce Department data showed. The decrease was driven by a drop in oil imports and a surge in exports. The overall trade gap was far smaller than analysts polled by Reuters had expected.
''Trade data for December paint a reassuring and encouraging picture of the U.S. economy at the end of last year,'' said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that wholesale inventories unexpectedly declined in December, a factor that could hamper the stronger trade figures' effect on growth.
Still, the two reports together suggested the government could revise up its reading on fourth-quarter G.D.P., which showed the economy contracting at a 0.1 percent annual rate. That decline was driven by an expected drop in exports, smaller gains in inventories and a plunge in military spending.
Barclays said that even with December's decline in wholesale inventories, the economy most likely expanded 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter, thanks to the higher export numbers in Friday's trade report.
American exports increased by $8.6 billion in December over the year-ago month, lifted by sales of industrial supplies, including a $1.2 billion rise from November in nonmonetary gold.
Reflecting the country's current boom in oil and natural gas, petroleum exports rose by nearly $1 billion during the month to a record high.
A fall in petroleum purchases led overall imports to decline by $4.6 billion in December from the year-ago period.
For the entire year, the country's imports of crude oil fell to their lowest levels since 1997 in terms of volume.
Stocks prices on American exchanges rose as investors took note of the strong trade data, which included the United States figures as well as readings showing stronger exports and imports in China during January. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note also rose.
For all of 2012, the United States trade gap shrank by 3.5 percent, to $540.4 billion. Running trade deficits means the country loses dollars, which drags on the economy; rising exports reduce that effect.
Exports last year rose 4.4 percent.
Even the American trade balance with China had a silver lining. While imports from China increased to a record high last year, so did American exports there. The December trade deficit in goods with China, not seasonally adjusted, narrowed by $4.5 billion from the previous month on a drop in imports.
Also in December, United States wholesale inventories unexpectedly fell as auto dealers and agricultural suppliers drew down their stocks.
The Commerce Department said stocks of unsold goods at wholesalers dropped 0.1 percent during the month and grew less than initially estimated in November.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected wholesale inventories to rise 0.4 percent.

HEADLINE: To Earth, Seeking Goodness

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
A small fire broke out during a preview performance of the Foundry Theater's enchanting production of Bertolt Brecht's ''Good Person of Szechwan.'' Alarms clanged; the actors stood still. Eventually performers and audience members dutifully trooped out of the Ellen Stewart Theater at La MaMa, to return only after a small phalanx of firefighters had clomped in and out.
The jarring interruption might have spelled doom for most productions -- especially since it came just as the play drew to a close, with a trio of gods sitting in judgment on the beleaguered heroine, the prostitute turned shopkeeper Shen Te. But in this case, the drama offstage seemed only to enhance the drama onstage. Figuratively speaking, Brecht wanted his audiences to escape from the theater -- at least the kind of theater intended to coddle spectators with entertaining illusions. His writing aimed to enforce contemplation of society's flaws. 
The impinging of real-life problems on the cultivated fiction onstage seemed particularly apt because this marvelous production, directed by Lear deBessonet and starring the magnetic Taylor Mac, ranks among the best -- and most authentic-feeling -- Brecht productions I've seen. In presenting the story of Mr. Mac's good-hearted Shen Te, struggling desperately to maintain her moral equilibrium in a society corrupted by economic hardship, it is also perhaps the only one I've seen that seems to be bringing urgent news of the current state of our world: rough and getting rougher for seemingly everyone but a privileged elite.
''Authentically Brechtian!'': a description to send a chill down many a theatergoer's spine. I've certainly sat through my share of well-intentioned, theoretically sound and utterly moribund Brecht productions. But if you set aside any antipathies acquired after enduring one misfired ''Threepenny Opera'' after another, you may be surprised at how fresh, vital and funny Brecht's work remains when it is presented with style, invention and a healthy dose of irreverence.
Not that Ms. deBessonet's staging, which employs (somewhat loosely) a translation by the noted Brecht scholar John Willett, takes major liberties. The casting of Mr. Mac in the role of the female Shen Te might seem to be a provocation. This distinctive writer and performer looks as he usually does onstage: pale bald head unwigged and gleaming, trademark glittering lashes and penciled eyebrows in place, wearing a sloppy red dress and gold strappy heels over socks. But like Brian Bedford as Lady Bracknell in the recent Broadway revival of ''The Importance of Being Earnest,'' Mr. Mac is not in the business of travesty; on the contrary, he acts with simplicity and sincerity that still allows for ample humor and sharp Brechtian sallies through the fourth wall.
Speaking of laughs: The actor and playwright Lisa Kron (''Well'') supplies generous doses of the same in her two supporting roles, as a nasal-voiced, stooped Mrs. Mi Tzu, the grasping landlady of the tobacco shop acquired by Shen Te, and Mrs. Yang, the big-haired, fiendishly fingernailed (and grasping) mother of Shen Te's beloved, the would-be airmail pilot Yang Sun (a sexy Clifton Duncan).
Grasping, in fact, describes almost everyone surrounding the ''good person'' whom three gods descend to earth in search of (Vinie Burrows, Annie Golden and Mia Katigbak -- collectively adorable in their addled divinity and frayed white finery). Their expectations aren't too high: they'll settle for just one upstanding citizen.
But the water seller they employ to find a softhearted soul to put them up for a night, played with impish high spirits by David Turner, doesn't find his commission so easy. After knocking on several doors -- the funky sets, by Matt Saunders, feature tin-can footlights and nifty little cardboard houses and clouds -- he finally persuades the poor but kindly Shen Te to put them up.
Brecht's moral fable begins making its trenchant points about the difficulty of doing good while keeping your head above water when Shen Te is rewarded for her hospitality with a sum of money that allows her to acquire that tobacco shop. Once in business, she is harassed by freeloaders exploiting her charitable instincts. Only by disguising herself as a mercilessly practical-minded male cousin, Shui Ta, can Shen Te bring herself to rebuff the hangers-on and keep her small business from going under. (Zipped into a pinstriped suit, with a bowler hat and curlicued mustache, Mr. Mac's Shui Ta suggests Hercule Poirot on a crash diet.)
Music was an important weapon in the Brecht arsenal, and it is wonderfully delivered here by the Brooklyn indie pop-rock band the Lisps, led by César Alvarez. Their original compositions -- Mr. Alvarez adapted Brecht's lyrics -- smoothly thread together various strains in American music new and old, and the action is occasionally punctuated by twangs and thumps that recall the use of percussion in Kabuki theater. Mr. Mac happens also to be a terrifically gifted singer, as is Mr. Turner, whose vaudevillian lament over the rains that dampen his water-selling trade is among the musical highlights. (Mr. Mac, by the way, is at work on a 24-hour history of pop music, excerpts from which will be performed on Feb. 25 at Joe's Pub.)
Every element in Ms. deBessonet's production feels carefully thought through without being heavy-handed. The sardonic humor emerges with particular vitality, leavening Brecht's didacticism. And Mr. Mac manages to imbue the conflicts that tear at poor Shen Te with a sense of real emotional consequence: her devotion to Yang Sun, even after his selfish indifference to her has been exposed, strikes a piteous, deeply human note.
How do you live the good life -- meaning a virtuous one, not a luxuriously appointed one -- in a world that often rewards the self-seeking, the venal and the cutthroat while punishing the moral but powerless? It's hardly a question that feels remote or archaic today, and without ever trespassing into the territory of hectoring, this production implores us with wit and good cheer to keep probing for answers within our own hearts.
Ms. Kron delivers the almost Shakespearean epilogue, concluding, ''Ladies and gentlemen, in you we trust: There must be happy endings, must, must, must!'' I hope I don't sound too hectoring myself when I suggest that theater engaging heart, mind and funny bone as nimbly as this production deserves as wide and welcoming an audience as anything I've seen this season. Here is a show that must be seen, must, must, must!

HEADLINE: Freedom Has Its Own Constraints

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- On the surface, all they have in common is their Sunday airtime, at least in the United States. One television show is about English aristocrats, crisp, proper, well-dressed even in bed. The other is about four young women, often lost and very often unclothed, in a setting quite different from Yorkshire: Brooklyn, New York.
But ''Downton Abbey'' and"Girls,"both hugely popular, sometimes seem to be talking to each other. And it is a conversation of richer importance to our politics and culture than the nudity on one show and the costumes on the other might initially suggest. 
On issue after issue, Americans continue to debate the limits of individual freedom -- whether to abort a fetus or own a gun or sell stocks or buy drugs. And in different ways, the two television shows address the promise and limitations of the modern, Western emphasis on -- even sacralization of -- the individual.
''Downton'' and ''Girls'' serve as bookends in an era defined by a growing cult of the self. ''Downton'' is about the flourishing of selfhood in a rigid, early-20th-century society of roles. ''Girls'' is about the chaos and exhaustion of selfhood in a fluid, early-21st-century society that says you can be anything but does not show you how.
"Downton Abbey," "Girls" and the Arc of the Self
''I don't know what the next year of my life is going to be like at all,'' says Marnie, a smart, pretty, rather lost twentysomething on ''Girls.'' ''I don't know what the next week of my life is going to be like. I don't even know what I want. Sometimes I just wish someone would tell me, like, 'This is how you should spend your days, and this is how the rest of your life should look."'
''Downton'' returns us to an earlier stretch of selfhood's arc, when too little guidance was rarely the problem.
Set on a manor in which the hierarchy and fixedness of the country -- indeed, of the Empire -- are especially concentrated, ''Downton'' is a world where there is a way to do everything, from cleaning spoons to dressing for dinner. Status has been and still seems immovable, and servants must act at least as convinced of their inferiority as the masters are. Novelty and that great leveler, money, are reflexively suspected.
The drama is this world's cracking under the pressure of new ideas like individualism. Thus the family driver, believing in equality and marrying for love, runs away with the family daughter; thus the men wear black tie instead of white to dinner one night; thus a new generation of servants is less servile, more willing to question.
Mary McNamara, a television critic at The Los Angeles Times, has described ''Downton'' as ''the tale of an oppressive social and economic system that is finally being called into question.'' The drama comes from watching our world slowly, inevitably defeat theirs: ''the bondage of social bylaws and expectation, the fear of new technology, the desire to cling to old ways.''
But now fast-forward a century, and these social upheavals, beginning auspiciously, have ended badly on ''Girls.''
What begins on ''Downton'' as a new liberty to follow your heart, to dare love that others find unwise, has culminated in ''Girls'' in romantic pursuits that are dully mercenary and often unwise.
The daughters of the sexual revolution are depicted without much agency: Far from being conquerors, initiators, even equals, the girls of ''Girls'' are reactors, giving in to an ex who changes his mind, or a gay man wanting to try something, or a financier seeking a threesome that he manages to upgrade to traditionally twosome marriage.
What begins on ''Downton'' as a welcome questioning of age and status roles has snowballed by the ''Girls'' era into grave role confusion: parents who cannot teach their children how to live because they feel guilty about parenting, or want to be friends more than guides, or still dress like teenagers and call their offspring ''prude.''
Nowhere is this overshooting truer than with the roles of the sexes. If ''Downton'' shows a world in which women are starting to claim their own sexuality, ''Girls'' portrays a sexual dystopia in which those women seem to have negotiated poorly: Men now reliably get what they want, while women must often content themselves with scraps, as when the character Hannah celebrates ''almost'' satiation in bed as the best she is likely to get.
The creator of ''Girls,"Lena Dunham, is a self-proclaimed liberal. But her show is, as some conservatives gleefully note, full of ammunition for their side.
''There are reasons for conservatives not to like or even to refuse to watch 'Girls,"' Peter Lawler, a political philosopher in the conservative Catholic tradition, wrote recently, adding: ''But we have to admit that things that are really revolting from a moral or relational point of view are actually portrayed quite negatively.''
If seen as a work of criticism rather than celebration, ''Girls'' makes Mr. Lawler optimistic: ''The hope the show gives us is the persistence of relational human nature,'' despite the characters' failures, for now, to achieve it.
''Girls'' is about atoms that desire in vain to form molecules; about sex lives that breed more confusion than excitement; about people with the liberty to choose every day, on various dimensions, whom to be -- and who grow very tired of the choosing.

HEADLINE: Who Wants to Be No. 1? Anyone?

BYLINE: LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
The way college basketball is headed these days, March has some company in the madness department. January got the silliness started and now February is staging its own string of wild endings and unpredictable matchups and all the glorious byproducts of parity run amok. How do you explain five No. 1 teams falling in five consecutive weeks? How does the latest temporary No. 1, Indiana -- coached by a Harbaugh brother-in-law! -- forget how to play defense on the final play, making Illinois's buzzer-beater an open layup? Why are all those big-name coaches walking around with glassy stares and throbbing headaches?
This is not friendly empire-building in the mold of college football, where the move is toward simply declaring the Southeastern Conference champion the national champion and saving everyone a lot of time and travel expenses. In basketball, almost anyone can win on any given night in March, February or January. The list of powerhouse programs stumbling through their season is long, and headlined by North Carolina, as Jeff Goodman points out on CBSSports.com. Indiana's loss came so quickly after it ascended to No. 1, as Bob Kravitz writes in The Indianapolis Star, Tom Crean is now being treated for occupational vertigo. As Andy Glockner writes on SI.com, does anyone want to be No. 1? 
(The latest piece of chaos came on the heels of college football's signing day, which was such an exhibition of the rich getting richer that Ohio State Coach Urban Meyer was chastising his fellow Big Ten coaches for falling so far behind the SEC in recruiting.)
The other sport that seems to be making some moves toward parity is -- stunningly -- baseball. In the midst of another free agent signing season in which the Yankees aren't the mad overspending shoppers of old, Seattle, of all teams, won the race for the whopper contract of the season by signing pitcher Felix Hernandez for an amount roughly equal to the gross national product of Venezuela. Yes, he deserves to be the highest paid pitcher in baseball, writes Joe Lemire on SI.com, and Mariners fans might have staged a mutiny if the team let Hernandez walk, as Larry Stone writes in The Seattle Times. But it could also be part of a trend of smaller-market teams trying to keep their stars from migrating to the Yankees and Red Sox and Dodgers and Angels, Danny Knobler writes on CBSSports.com. That sound you hear is George Steinbrenner throwing a temper tantrum from the great beyond.
Hockey is used to a certain amount of standings chaos (if you can remember that far back, a No. 8 seed -- Los Angeles -- did win the last Stanley Cup), but Washington's charge from elite team to doormat has stunned even seasoned N.H.L. chaos observers, as Scott Burnside writes on ESPN.com. It might seem the Islanders are making a charge in the other direction by trading for a Stanley Cup winning goalie in Tim Thomas, but it really isn't much more than a salary cap move considering Thomas's indefinite sabbatical, writes Katie Strang on ESPN.com. The one thing we do know about hockey is, you have to be tough even if you're just a sideline reporter. MSG's John Giannone was up to the task Thursday night, taking a puck to the face and barely missing a beat.
Football keeps talking tough about ratcheting back on its violence level, but then went ahead and reinstated the bounty scandal's chief scapegoat, Gregg Williams, from his indefinite suspension, and he promptly joined the staff of the Titans. It wasn't all that surprising considering how much the N.F.L. is trying to usher the scandal into the ancient history books, and, as Don Banks writes on SI.com, the move certainly made sense for Williams and the Titans. But the speed of his reinstatement also signals that the league wasn't all that outraged by Williams's violent approach to the game, as Jen Floyd Engel writes on Foxsports.com, so holding him up as the lone scapegoat did not make much sense, either.
But if you're looking for sense, don't go trying to find it in college basketball. Those coaches are as confused as anyone else.

HEADLINE: Republican's Mayoral Bid Attracts Wealthy Donors, but High Hurdles Remain

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Kenneth G. Langone, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot, has pledged his financial backing. Peter S. Kalikow, the real estate investor, has cut a big check. And James S. Tisch, the chief executive of the Loews Corporation, is on board.
Titans of New York City business are buzzing about the mayoral candidacy of Joseph J. Lhota, a former investment banker, Giuliani administration official and chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, whose Republican bid is built on his reputation as a skilled manager.
Mr. Langone, a prodigious Republican donor, is even entertaining the possibility of an independent political action committee, unbound by spending limits, devoted to electing Mr. Lhota. ''All I know is that Joe is not going to want for money,'' he said in an interview.
But as big-name donations begin to roll in to the campaign, Mr. Lhota is confronting a persistent question, even from his own supporters: Can a latecomer to the race raise enough money to overcome the financial might of a billionaire rival from within his party and the electoral advantages of a well-known Democrat? 
As soon as Mr. Lhota jumped into the race, jolting a relatively tepid Republican field, the owner of the Gristedes supermarket chain, John A. Catsimatidis, officially declared his candidacy for the party's nomination, vowing to dip into his own vast fortune, Bloomberg-style, to prevail. Mr. Lhota does not have such resources; aides say he is likely to participate in the city's campaign finance program, which matches private donations with public funds for candidates who agree to abide by a strict spending cap.
''Joe has an uphill battle,'' said Mr. Kalikow, a former owner of The New York Post. ''I did tell him that.''
Mr. Kalikow, who said he admired Mr. Lhota's decision to run for mayor, is a case in point: He has also donated to the Democratic mayoral campaign of William C. Thompson Jr., a former city comptroller, whom he called a ''very good friend.''
Mr. Lhota's résumé and his record in the business-friendly administration of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani make him a natural candidate of the city's corporate and real estate crowds, long a reliable source of campaign contributions.
But Mr. Lhota's Democratic rivals have made deep inroads with the city's business community over the past four years, earning the good will -- and campaign dollars -- of many real estate and finance moguls.
In interviews, a dozen such executives expressed personal affection for Mr. Lhota but skepticism about his ability to win a general election. In the city, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans six to one.
The executives contend that Mr. Lhota, who has never sought public office and has relatively low name recognition, will struggle to distinguish himself given the spending limits imposed by the campaign finance program.
''Republicans in New York only win under special circumstances,'' said a major developer, who has spent time in city government, and insisted on anonymity to protect his relationship with the candidates. ''I don't know anything that helps Lhota. There's no crisis. The city's not broke or torn to pieces by rioting.''
Mr. Lhota's biggest hurdle may be the support already claimed by the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, a Democrat who has quietly become a fund-raising powerhouse in the corporate corridors by working closely with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and by taking a moderate approach to legislation affecting businesses.
An analysis of campaign contributions from employees of about 100 of the city's most politically active corporations and organizations shows that Ms. Quinn is by far the biggest recipient, commanding 67 percent of their donations in the current election cycle. (Some of the donations are carried over from 2009, when she considered a mayoral run but opted out.)
For instance, employees of the Related Companies, a major developer, have given $40,050 to her, dwarfing the employees' $3,450 in contributions to the second-biggest recipient, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, another Democratic candidate.
Mr. Lhota recently spoke with top executives from Related, people told of the conversations said. But according to these people, the company's leaders are loath to do anything that might alienate Ms. Quinn. She has even won the backing of several donors to Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, who would seem to be ideological allies of Mr. Lhota. One of them, Ronald O. Perelman, the financier and chairman of Revlon, said Ms. Quinn and Mr. Bloomberg ''made a great team.'' He called her ''tough, fair-minded and extremely competent.''
Another Romney donor, Randy L. Levine, the president of the Yankees, who served alongside Mr. Lhota as a deputy mayor in the Giuliani administration, has given sizable contributions to both Ms. Quinn and Mr. Thompson, citing his longstanding relationship with them.
A Lhota spokeswoman said his fund-raising was ''on schedule'' but declined to discuss it in detail. The extent of his fund-raising will not be known until he files a required report with the city in mid-March.
The candidate's advisers are adamant that he can raise enough money to prevail in a primary and the general election, pointing to his deep network of relationships with business leaders; his ties to Mr. Giuliani, who has pledged to tap into his network of donors; and the track record of his wife, Tamra Lhota, a former Giuliani fund-raiser.
During a recent talk to members of a Republican club in Brooklyn, however, Mr. Lhota suggested that his wife would not join the campaign in a formal capacity, playfully bemoaning the occupational hazards of working too closely with a spouse.
So far, Mr. Lhota is eschewing big fund-raising events that might count toward his spending limit. Instead, he is favoring a few smaller events at donors' homes and encouraging supporters to give online. He plans to hire Tamara Hallisey, a fund-raiser for John McCain in the 2008 presidential campaign.
Still, Mr. Lhota's backers are leaving open the possibility that an outside group might form to bolster his candidacy.
Mr. Langone, who raised millions of dollars for Mr. Romney, said, ''I plan to do everything I can to help Joe Lhota get elected, as long as it's ethical and as long as it's legal.'' He called Mr. Lhota ''a superb manager.''
On Feb. 22, Mr. Langone and Mr. Lhota will host a breakfast at the Harvard Club that is expected to draw donors and fund-raisers. Many of those attending say Mr. Lhota is singularly qualified to lead the city in the post-Bloomberg era, when they predict an uneven economy will test the city's finances and public worker unions will seek to exploit close ties to Democratic candidates.
''I worry a lot about the fiscal health of New York City,'' said Mr. Tisch, the head of Loews and an invitee to the Lhota breakfast. ''As I look around at the group of people running for mayor, the person I think has the best capacity of dealing with these issues is Joe.''

HEADLINE: SUNY Trustees Vote Unanimously to Shutter Long Island College Hospital

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
The State University of New York trustees voted unanimously Friday to close Long Island College Hospital, saying it was in such bad shape financially that it threatened the viability of the university's Brooklyn medical school and related facilities.
The university system acquired the hospital, also known as LICH, in 2011, hoping to turn it around and use it to train students and medical residents. The hospital serves Cobble Hill, Brooklyn Heights and nearby neighborhoods and has about 2,000 employees, who may soon lose their jobs. 
''Any financial crisis of this order impacts the entire system,'' Nancy L. Zimpher, the SUNY chancellor, said after the vote, held at SUNY's College of Optometry in Midtown Manhattan. The SUNY system, she said, includes 64 campuses and four academic medical centers, with 465,000 students and 88,000 employees.
Dr. Zimpher said the SUNY board had authorized $75 million in loans, drawn from reserves that had already been committed to other campuses, just to keep SUNY's Downstate Medical Center, which includes LICH, operating. She said the trustees had to ''stop the bleeding because we can't afford it.''
Shouting, angry and sometimes visibly distraught members of 1199 SEIU, the hospital workers' union, protested the vote. Clarence Brotherson, the union representative for LICH, and a former emergency room technician there, said that the union believed that the fight was not yet over and that it still had a chance to appeal to the State Health Department and the governor for help.
''We still have a shot,'' Mr. Brotherson said.
The SUNY vote, which was unanimous among the 12 voting members who were present, authorizes Downstate to present to the Health Department a plan for closing the hospital; the department will make the final decision.
But Dr. John Williams, president of Downstate, said Friday that ''realistically we know as soon as word gets out today, patients are going to stop coming,'' and that doctors and nurses who could find other jobs would leave. Nonetheless, he said, the hospital planned to maintain operations until the Health Department made a decision.
A state comptroller's audit last month said SUNY Downstate was approaching insolvency and had $117 million in operating losses in 2011, of which $44 million was attributable to the acquisition of LICH, which had been losing money for many years.
Although the hospital is amid some of Brooklyn's wealthiest neighborhoods, the area's residents tend to favor hospitals in Manhattan, leaving LICH with a poor, largely unprofitable patient base.
A public hearing Thursday on the eve of the vote drew about 200 people and was dominated by union members. Opponents of the closing said LICH's 50,000 emergency patients a year would suffer if they had to travel longer distances to other hospitals.
The nearest hospital, Brooklyn Hospital, is about a mile and a half away; New York Methodist Hospital is about three miles away; and Lutheran Medical Center, almost five miles away.
Studies suggest that travel time, and the ability of other hospitals to absorb the extra traffic, contribute to patient outcomes.
One study of heart attack patients from 1996 to 2005, supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, found a small increase in mortality rates when the drive to the hospital increased by less than 10 minutes. The study found ''substantial'' increases in mortality, especially among older patients, when the increase was more than half an hour. But most of the adverse effects disappeared after some period of transition, as other hospitals adjusted to the increased patient load.
A New York City study conducted in 1999 and 2000 found that overcrowding of emergency rooms led to more deaths in heart attack patients, from a combination of longer travel times when ambulances were diverted from hospitals that were full, and delays in treatment when the destination hospital was overburdened.
''We calculated about 80 more deaths per year from heart attacks, and as I recall Brooklyn was actually the borough that had the most heart attacks,'' perhaps because the population was older, said Linda V. Green, a co-author of the study and a professor of business at Columbia University. She said that including stroke and accident victims could result in an even greater toll.
Dr. Williams of Downstate acknowledged that each minute indeed made a difference. ''but the majority of people don't live around the corner from their hospitals.'' he said.
SUNY officials also denied assertions by hospital workers that Downstate wanted to close the hospital so it could sell its real estate for cash, though given Downstate's precarious financial position and LICH's prime location, seeking a buyer would seem to be a logical move.
''The answer is no,'' H. Carl McCall, SUNY's chairman and a former state comptroller, said Thursday when pressed on the issue of selling the property. ''There is no plan whatsoever with respect to real estate.''

HEADLINE: S.&P. Extends Its Rally to a Five-Year High

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up to a five-year high on Friday, extending a rally that started in January.
The S.& P. 500 rose 8.54 points, to 1,517.93, closing up 0.3 percent for the week. The index is at its highest point since November 2007 and has advanced for six weeks, the longest streak of gains since August.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 48.92 points, or 0.35 percent, to 13,992.97. 
The Dow had its best January in almost two decades and closed above 14,000 on Feb. 1 for the first time since 2007. The index is up 6.78 percent so far this year; the S.& P. 500 is up 6.43 percent.
The Nasdaq composite index climbed 28.74 points, or 0.91 percent, to 3,193.87.
A last-minute budget deal in Washington to avoid tax increases and spending cuts has helped to power the rally, on top of optimism about housing and gradual improvements in the jobs market.
The S.& P. 500 finished the week higher despite logging its biggest daily decline in almost three months on Monday after worrying news from Europe. The index fell 1.2 percent that day as bond yields in Spain and Italy rose on concern that the region's politicians would drag Europe back into crisis. The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, made cautious comments about the region's economy on Thursday, which also weighed on markets.
''Everybody seems to be saying this market needs to correct,'' said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners. ''Nobody wants to be in it, but nobody wants to be out of it.''
Largely positive corporate earnings reports and a report that showed that the United States trade deficit narrowed sharply in December provided more fuel for the market's advance on Friday.
The trade deficit fell nearly 21 percent in December from November, to $38.5 billion, the smallest point in nearly three years, as exports rose while oil imports plummeted. The smaller trade gap means the economy most likely performed better in the final three months of last year than first reported last week.
''The trade balance was surprisingly very good,'' said Philip J. Orlando, chief market strategist at Federated Investors.
The government estimated that the economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the last three months of 2012. Mr. Orlando said that may now be revised to growth of 0.5 percent.
Shares of LinkedIn, the online professional networking service, jumped $26.39, or 21.27 percent, to $150.48, after the company reported fourth-quarter results late on Thursday that beat analysts' forecasts.
AOL shares soared $2.31, or 7.35 percent, to $33.72, after the company said its quarterly revenue grew for the first time in eight years, helped by strength in worldwide advertising.
Analysts are expecting earnings for the fourth quarter of 2012 to rise 6.5 percent for S.& P. 500 companies, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. That is an increase from the 2.4 percent growth rate recorded for the preceding quarter.
Stocks have benefited as investors poured a net $4.1 billion into stock mutual funds since the start of the year, according to data provided by Lipper.
''I'm very encouraged by the fact that, finally, for the first time in many years, individual investors seem to be participating in this,'' said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J. P. Morgan Funds.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 2/32, to 97 4/32, and the yield fell to 1.95 percent from 1.96 percent late on Thursday.
Trading volume was light as Wall Street braced for a large winter storm. Up to two feet of snow was forecast along the densely populated Interstate 95 corridor from the New York City area to Boston and beyond.

HEADLINE: Innovation Nation At War

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
CHICAGO
''I decided it would be fun to do patent trials,'' said Richard Posner.
We were sitting in his spacious office in the federal courthouse in downtown Chicago, where, for more than three decades, Posner, 74, has been a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Posner is one of the most prolific writers in the country, not just of legal opinions but of books and articles on a staggering variety of subjects.
He is also one of the most highly regarded appeals court judges. His first book, ''Economic Analysis of Law,'' written in 1973, ''showed how economic principles could be fruitfully applied to many legal problems,'' as the legal writer Roger Parloff once put it in Fortune magazine. It has had a profound effect on the law. 
In recent years, Posner has done something you don't see appeals court justices do very often. He has volunteered to serve as a district judge in lawsuits involving patent claims. One case, Apple v. Motorola Mobility, was a high-profile smartphone lawsuit. The other, Brandeis and GFA Brands v. Keebler, involved a patent for cookie formula, and was mainly of interest to the patent cognoscenti.
But ''fun'' is hardly Posner's only motive. To put it more bluntly than he ever would, he is adjudicating patent cases in an effort to change a legal system that now gives companies rich incentives to bring costly, time-consuming and often prideful patents lawsuits. It desperately needs to be done.
America's patent system is a mess. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, understaffed and overwhelmed, issues too many needless patents. Patent trolls buy or create patent portfolios whose only purpose is to extort fees from the companies that actually make the things that the patents supposedly cover. Technology companies sue competitors for billions for infringing patents that are nothing short of silly -- the rounded corners on the iPhone, for instance. Google spent $12.5 billion to buy Motorola Mobility in no small part to get its patent portfolio, which became a legal weapon.
In Posner's view, many patents are unnecessary. Patents, he believes, are important for drug companies that spend hundreds of millions of dollars bringing a new drug to market -- a drug that can easily be copied by a competitor. Without the protection that a patent affords, pharmaceutical companies would have far less incentive to come up with new drugs.
But patents in fast-moving industries like technology? ''When you are dealing with products that have very short lives, you often don't need patents because by the time competitors wise up, you've moved on,'' Posner says. Indeed, in such industries, patents -- which are primarily intended to encourage innovation -- have the exact opposite effect: they discourage innovation. The smartphone industry, meanwhile, led by the ever-litigious Apple, is spending more time and effort filing lawsuits over patents infringement than it is coming up with innovative new products.
Posner told me that among the things a judge can do is assign a neutral expert to assess the claims of damages from both sides. He can make sure he has a deep understanding of the issues, and can explain it to a jury in a jargon-free manner.
But by far the most important thing he has done is to change the calculation by which companies can demand damages for patent infringement. Instead of allowing companies and their experts to come up with pie-in-the-sky estimates of what they are owed by the infringer, Posner insists that they calculate precisely how much the infringing component is driving demand for the product. For things like rounded corners, it's probably not much. ''If they can meet that challenge, then fine. But it's difficult,'' he says.
Thus, in the Apple-Motorola litigation, Posner tossed the case out of court after concluding that neither party had come close to calculating damages appropriately. As the Reuters legal blogger, Alison Frankel, put it last June, when Posner rendered his withering decision, ''Would any rational economic actor engage in litigation under those terms, spending millions on an apparently impossible quest'' to satisfy Posner's damages criteria?
Which is exactly the point. Just a few weeks ago, Posner severely narrowed the damages calculation in the cookie formula case. Their incentives thus radically changed, the two sides came to their senses. They e-mailed Posner to say they had settled the case (though they have yet to submit a motion to that effect).
Apple, of course, has appealed Posner's decision in the Motorola case. If he is upheld, there is a decent likelihood that his new formulation will become the standard in the federal judiciary -- and the costly patent wars, which take money from shareholders and consumers alike, will finally come to an end.
It won't make Apple very happy. But it's the best thing that could happen for American innovation.

HEADLINE: Post Office Slows Rate Of Losses For Quarter

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Holiday shipping and the 2012 election helped the Postal Service stem its losses, but the agency's financial woes continued in the first quarter, which ended Dec. 31.
The Postal Service posted a $1.3 billion loss in the first quarter, compared with a $3.3 billion loss over the same period the previous year. The agency said the first quarter has traditionally been one of its strongest periods.
Total mail volume continued to decline, however. It was 43.5 billion pieces for the quarter, down from 43.6 billion for the same period a year earlier, according to agency officials. 
Revenue from first-class mail, which provides the bulk of the revenue for the Postal Service, declined $237 million, or 3.1 percent, from the same period the previous year, with a decrease in volume of 834 million pieces, or 4.5 percent. Revenue from advertising mail increased $141 million, or 3.1 percent, in the first quarter compared with the same period a year earlier on a volume increase of 783 million pieces, or 3.6 percent. The increase is largely attributable to official election mail and political campaign advertising related to the presidential and Congressional elections mailed during the quarter, which began Oct. 1.
The agency's shipping and packaging business increased by $154 million, or 4.7 percent, over 2012 first-quarter results, fueled by the growth of online shopping and the success of Postal Service marketing campaigns.
The agency also said that it cut its operating costs to $18.9 billion from $20.9 billion over the same period last year, a decrease of 9.8 percent. The agency attributed the savings to a number of cost-cutting measures, like staff reductions and the consolidation of some mail processing centers.
But postal officials said the agency's actions alone were not enough. ''The encouraging results from our holiday mailing season cannot sustain us as we move deeper into the current fiscal year and face continuing financial challenges,'' said Patrick R. Donahoe, the postmaster general. ''We urgently need Congress to do its part and pass legislation that allows us to better manage our costs and gives us the commercial flexibility needed to operate more like a business does. This will help ensure the future success of the Postal Service and the mailing industry it supports.''
The agency announced this week that it would seek to move to a new delivery schedule beginning the week of Aug. 5. The post office would stop delivering or picking up mail on Saturdays, ending a practice that goes back to the 1890s. Packages would continue to be delivered Monday through Saturday. The Postal Service said the change could result in an annual cost savings of about $2 billion.
Members of Congress, postal unions and some businesses strongly oppose the move. But Mr. Donahoe said the Postal Service's dire financial situation calls for drastic measures.
Current projections show the Postal Service will have less than five days of operating cash reserves by the end of the 2013 fiscal year, which the post office said would leave it unable to react to possible economic downturns or other issues.
The Postal Service wants Congress to remove a 2006 requirement that it pay nearly $5.5 billion a year for health benefits to future retirees, a mandate imposed on no other agency, which officials have said has crippled the post office. It had an operating income of $100 million this quarter, but the prefunding dragged it into the red. The agency defaulted on two payments last year for the first time and said it would not be able to pay them this year. The agency also wants to be able to enter new businesses, like shipping beer and wine, now prohibited.
Last April, the Senate passed a bill that would have allowed the Postal Service to ship beer and wine, reduced its work force, and let the agency recoup more than $11 billion it overpaid into an employee pension fund. The Senate refused to stop Saturday deliveries. The House has taken no action on its postal overhaul.
''Our liquidity concerns can only be fully resolved if Congress takes action to address our unsustainable business model, including resolving the overly aggressive payment schedule to prefund retiree health benefits,'' said Joseph Corbett, the agency's chief financial officer. ''The Postal Service will continue to prioritize payments to our employees and suppliers ahead of those to the federal government to ensure that we maintain high-quality customer service.''

HEADLINE: Cellphone Service Without Signing on the Dotted Line

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
LAST month, I upgraded my son's cellphone -- something he had looked forward to with breathless anticipation ever since his last cellphone drowned in a California pool over the summer.
He paid $150 of his hard-earned money for his choice model. But I couldn't help feeling annoyed and slightly ripped off, as the salesman asked us to pay a $35 upgrade fee, made sure we understood that we would have to put up additional money for the new phone until the rebate came through and then tried to sell us things like cases and new data plans.
But I also felt that I had no other option than to pay all the costs and sign up for another two-year contract.
When I got home, though, I decided to investigate. And it turns out, a lot of people are checking out how they can get cellphone convenience without cellphone contracts. 
According to figures from Sprint about wireless use across all carriers, the number of no-contract cellphone customers is expected to rise to 30 percent of the share of total wireless customers in 2015, from 18 percent in 2008. It is already about 28 percent.
''People are fed up,'' said Logan Abbott, president of MyRatePlan.com, a comparison shopping engine primarily for cellphones. The site receives a commission when someone purchases a phone, a contract plan or a prepaid plan, but does not have exclusive deals with any providers or manufacturers to promote their products or services.
No-contract phones -- or prepaid, which is essentially the same thing -- have been around for quite some time, but most consumers thought they were ''for people who couldn't afford a better phone or couldn't pass a credit check,'' said Jayne Wallace, a spokeswoman for the Sprint Prepaid Group, which was formed in 2010. Sprint owns Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile, both of which offer no-contract phones.
The Great Recession shook things up, though, as people started looking at where they could cut back on monthly bills -- and began to investigate new cellphone options. At the same time, good phones were getting cheaper.
''It used to be you were stuck with a plastic flip phone,'' Mr. Abbott said. Now almost every major carrier offers no-contract phones, as do smaller companies that specialize in them, including Straight Talk, which sells primarily through Walmart and Cricket. And customers can get a top-of-the line smartphone -- or fairly close to one -- with or without a contract.
In addition, unlike in the past, many prepaid phones come with data plans that allow Web surfing and e-mail access.
And if you are unhappy with your service, you can easily move to another carrier -- rather than waiting up to two years, or paying as much as $350 to break your contract.
So what is the downside? The main one is that you have to pay for your phone upfront, because you are not subsidizing it through a two-year contract. But that doesn't mean you are paying more in the long run.
A Consumer Reports article in January on cellphones compared the two-year cost under various plans of an iPhone 5 with 16 gigabytes. Straight Talk came out the cheapest, even though the upfront cost for the phone, $650, was the highest. With a monthly cost of $45 for unlimited data (read further down for more on what unlimited really means), the total came to $1,730 after two years.
At Verizon, the cost of the same iPhone was $200, but a similar monthly plan -- with a data allowance of two gigabytes -- was $100 a month, bringing the cost up to $2,600 for two years. AT&T was even more expensive -- although it offered a data plan of four gigabytes -- at $2,840.
And, of course, if you don't need the newest, hottest phone, cheaper ones are available. Cricket offers a Samsung Android smartphone for $159, with plans that cost $25 to $60 a month.
You don't necessarily have to buy a new phone, even if you are moving from a contract to no-contract. If you are still happy with your phone after your existing contract has ended, you can usually switch to a no-contract plan, even if it is on another network.
And various plans are available, from a monthly flat fee to a pay-as-you-go plan, in which you keep a prepaid account and every call is debited from the account. This kind of plan is good if you don't use your phone a lot.
But there are things to watch out for. If you are not buying from one of the big carriers like Verizon or T-Mobile, make sure you know which network the phone you are buying operates on. Virgin Mobile, for instance, operates on the Sprint network. Is that a good option for you?
And it is not always clear which phone company works from what network, so it is best to ask when considering purchasing the phone, Sascha Segan, lead analyst for PCMag Mobile, said.
If it is a service none of your friends use and you have never heard of, you would be wise to be wary, he added.
He also suggested reading the fine print, or at least going online to see if other consumers have had problems with a certain plan. For example, he said, ''Some prepaid phones have really high international calling rates and some have really low rates unless you pay a flat monthly fee.''
Also, make sure you know what you are paying for. That unlimited data I referred to earlier? There have been many complaints, Mr. Segan said, that after using about two gigabytes a month (which is plenty for most people, unless you're streaming lots of videos or music or playing games all the time) Straight Talk starts throttling, or slowing down the service considerably.
In a statement, Straight Talk has denied such practices, saying it cuts off users only after warnings, or those who are abusing the data system.
Over all, however, Mr. Segan said, no-contract phones ''often look like a great deal and often are a great deal.''
When aren't they? If you have complicated multidevice family plans, you will almost certainly get a better deal with a two-year family plan contract. It can be helpful to go on Web sites like billshrink.com, which has a tool to analyze how you use your cellphone and whether there may be a better plan at a better price. MyRatePlan.com also offers similar help. Since we have lost and waterlogged a few phones (and thanks in advance, but putting the wet phones in a bowl of uncooked rice never worked for us), I am a little worried about insurance.
First of all, Michael Gikas, senior editor for Consumer Reports, said that a very small percentage of people actually lose phones, so insurance isn't that great a deal. The best idea is to keep an old phone around, so if you do need one, you have a free one ready to activate.
But, since younger users, in particular, tend to play rougher with their phones, most no-contract plans do offer insurance. Ms. Wallace of Sprint said that Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile offered insurance of $5 a month for a lost, stolen or damaged phone, with a deductible of $25 to $100 depending on the phone.
What about customer service? Some experts, like Mr. Abbott, argue that the lack of a contract makes you more valuable as a customer -- since you can switch at any time -- and therefore should ensure better customer service. Nonetheless, there are plenty of gripes all over the blogosphere about poor customer service for many prepaid phone services.
That said, the same is largely true for most wireless carriers, in general.
There is no perfect option. But I feel better now, knowing that there are cellphone choices out there that don't require me to make a long-term commitment.

HEADLINE: Following A Herd Of Bulls On Apple

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Last September, Apple shares hit a record $705. And to the overwhelming majority of Wall Street analysts, that meant one thing: buy.
By November, with Apple stock in the midst of a precipitous decline, they were still bullish. Fifty of 57 analysts rated it a buy or strong buy; only two rated it a sell. Apple shares continued their plunge, and this week were trading at just over $450, down 36 percent from their peak.
How could professional analysts have gotten it so wrong?
It wasn't supposed to be this way. A decade ago, Congressional hearings and an investigation by Eliot Spitzer, then the New York attorney general, exposed a maze of conflicts of interest afflicting Wall Street research. There were some notorious examples of analysts who curried favor with investment banking clients and potential clients by producing favorable research, and then were paid huge bonuses out of investment banking fees. Many investors and regulators blamed analysts' overly bullish forecasts for helping to inflate the dot-com bubble that burst in 2000. 
After a global settlement of Mr. Spitzer's investigation by major investment banks and the Sarbanes-Oxley reform legislation in 2002, investment banking and research operations were segregated. Conflicts had to be disclosed, and research and analyst pay was detached from investment banking revenues, among other measures.
These reforms seem to have worked -- but only up to a point. Other conflicts have come to the fore, especially at large brokerage firms and investment banks. And studies have shown that analysts are prone to other influences -- like following the herd -- that can undermine their judgments. ''The reforms didn't necessarily make analysts better at their jobs,'' said Stuart C. Gilson, a professor of finance at Harvard Business School.
It may be no coincidence that the only analyst who even came close to calling the peak in Apple's stock runs his own firm and is compensated based on the accuracy of his calls. Carlo R. Besenius, founder and chief executive of Creative Global Investments, downgraded Apple to sell last Oct. 3, with shares trading at $685. In December, he lowered his price target to $420, and this week he told me he may drop it even further, to $320.
Mr. Besenius founded his firm a decade ago after spending many years in research at Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers. ''I saw so many conflicts of interest in trading, investment banking and research, so I started a conflict-free company,'' he said this week from Luxembourg, where he was born and now lives. ''Wall Street is full of conflicts. It still is and always will be. It's incompetent at picking stocks.''
Since the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley, several studies have documented a decline in the percentage of analysts' buy recommendations, albeit a modest one, while sell recommendations have increased. ''Before 2002, analyst recommendations were tilted toward optimistic at an extreme rate,'' Ohad Kadan, a professor of finance at Washington University in St. Louis, and co-author of one of the studies, told me this week. ''That's still true today, but it's not as extreme. It's a little more balanced.''
While investment banking conflicts have been addressed, ''the most obvious conflict now is that research is funded through the trading desks,'' Professor Gilson said. ''If you're an analyst and one way your report brings in revenue is through increased trading, a buy recommendation will do this more than a sell. For a sell, you have to already own the stock to generate a trade. But anybody can potentially buy a stock. That's one hypothesis about why you still see a disproportionate number of buy recommendations.'' That may be especially true for heavily traded stocks like Apple, which generate huge commissions for Wall Street.
But no one thinks conflicts alone can explain the analysts' abysmal recent Apple performance. ''There's too much unanimity,'' Bruce Greenwald, a professor of finance and asset management at Columbia Business School and a renowned value investor, told me this week. ''That's what's so troubling. When that many analysts are in agreement, they can't all be conflicted.''
He and other experts say there are additional documented factors that help explain why Wall Street analysts are so often wrong: they extrapolate from recent performance data; they chase momentum; they want to please their customers; and they show a tendency toward herd behavior. Which is to say, they fall into the same pitfalls that afflict most investors.
''Why aren't they more sophisticated? You'd hope they would be,'' Professor Kadan said. ''But they always fall into the same traps.''
Professor Greenwald agreed. ''When something goes up, they all put out buy recommendations. Their models extrapolate past performance into the future. They chase momentum. With Apple, they were right at $600, and they were right at $650, which reinforced the trend. So why would they be wrong at $700?''
Professor Kadan said that momentum investing has its adherents, and is often right, at least in the short term that many investors focus on. ''You'd hope that analysts, of all people, would be able to anticipate an abrupt reversal, but they're not very good at it. They loved Apple at $700. I'm sure they were trying to do their best, but they're prisoners of momentum.''
Another factor is that analysts have a tendency to tell their audience what it wants to hear. ''The analysts are in the end sales people,'' Professor Greenwald said. ''Their credibility depends on their not upsetting their investors too much. Everybody loved Apple, everybody did well. The bears were always wrong. It took an enormous amount of courage to fight the tide.''
Professor Kadan agreed. ''Analysts tend to herd. There's no big penalty if you're wrong, because everyone else is wrong. You've got cover. You're not going to lose your job. If you take a different opinion, either you get a big prize if you're right, or you lose your job. An analyst needs to be really courageous to say something different from most other analysts.''
Mr. Besenius, the one analyst who downgraded Apple near its peak, said, ''I'm not afraid to make big, controversial calls,'' but attributed his decision less to courage than to survival. ''I'm paid based on performance,'' he said. ''I have to go to my clients and explain why they should pay for my research when they can get it for nothing from the firms where they pay their trading commissions.''
Mr. Besenius based his recommendation on technical factors -- as Apple hit $700, its upward momentum and trading volume were slowing -- as well as more fundamental concerns about product quality and innovation, as well as growing competition from rivals like Samsung. And there were more subjective factors. Mr. Besenius said he became uncomfortable with what he deemed Apple's arrogance. ''I loved Steve Jobs,'' he said. ''He built a great company. But he was one of the most arrogant C.E.O.'s I've ever met. The way he introduced new products was one big display of arrogance. He ridiculed Microsoft as 'Micro who?' That's a good reason to be cautious. A little humility is a good thing.'' (An Apple spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Besenius's observations.)
It galls Mr. Besenius that market regulators don't measure the performance of Wall Street's research recommendations, and he said he believed that they should require firms to disclose the track records of stocks their analysts recommend. ''They're not being held accountable'' for bad recommendations, he maintained. ''Little firms like ours have to be better than the big firms. We have to prove we can add value. Otherwise, we wouldn't have an existence.''
Apple is only one prominent example of egg on analysts' faces, and bullish Wall Street analysts were right for years -- until they were wrong. Even today, analysts remain overwhelmingly positive about Apple. This week, 44 analysts rated it a strong buy or buy, although 10 now rate it a hold, according to Thomson Reuters.
Should anyone listen?
Many brokers still rely on their analysts' research, and offer the analysts' reports to clients for guidance in picking stocks to buy and sell. But the Securities and Exchange Commission takes a skeptical approach. Despite the reforms it helped put in place, it warns on its Web site of continuing conflicts of interest and says flatly, ''As a general matter, investors should not rely solely on an analyst's recommendation when deciding whether to buy, hold, or sell a stock.'' It notes that many brokers aren't allowed to contradict recommendations from their own research departments.
Professor Gilson of Harvard said: ''Analysts are like movie critics. Some are good and some are bad. I find some of them extraordinarily useful. I advise my students to look to them, but you have to read their recommendations smartly with a very critical eye.''
Professor Greenwald was more dismissive. ''I never pay attention to them, '' he said. ''When a dog barks, if the dog barks all the time, you stop paying attention.''

HEADLINE: A Look at Turkey's Past Gives Some Insight Into Its Unresolved Troubles

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO; Sebnem Arsu contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- Two galleries in this city's old European quarter recently opened exhibitions that showcase the political violence that convulsed the country in the 1970s. The echoes for contemporary Turkey were unmistakable.
On one wall are rows of old newspapers that chronicled through blaring headlines and grainy photographs the bloody street fighting and chaotic demonstrations that culminated in a military coup in 1980.
''Socialist revolution can only be achieved in Turkey through armed victory,'' is how one newspaper of the time described the aims of a radical left-wing group that promised to use ''revolutionary terror'' and ''urban chaos'' to realize Marxist rule. 
That bloody past burst violently into the present with last week's suicide bombing of the American Embassy in the Turkish capital, Ankara. Initially assumed by many to be the work of Islamic extremists, the attack was quickly traced by the authorities to a man who sneaked into the country by boat from a Greek island in the Aegean Sea and was linked to a homegrown left-wing extremist group whose roots lie in the tumult of the '70s.
As such, the bombing -- even though it struck an American target and was motivated in part by American policy in the Middle East -- revealed more about modern Turkey, its violent past and potential for instability than it did about the United States' campaign against terrorism.
''This was no Benghazi,'' wrote Ross Wilson, a former American ambassador to Turkey, in an online column for the Atlantic Council, referring to last year's attack by Islamic extremists on a diplomatic outpost in Libya that resulted in the death of the American ambassador and three others.
For Turkey, the attack was an unpleasant reminder that despite a decade of reforms under the current ruling party, which is rooted in political Islam and headed by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey has yet to fully emerge from its dark past. Coming at a time when Turkey, with its prosperous economy and political stability, is trying to present itself as a model for countries convulsed by the Arab Spring revolutions, the attack served for many Turks as a reminder of the work left to put their own house in order.
''I think what people have forgotten, because of what happened here in the last 10 years, was how violent Turkish politics used to be,'' said Gerald Knaus, of the European Stability Initiative, a policy research organization based in Istanbul. ''In the last 10 years Turkey tried to emerge from this period of political violence and confront the skeletons in its closet. But we've forgotten how many skeletons there were.''
The attack also underscored how Turkey's rulers sometimes use those skeletons to justify a growing crackdown on dissent, particularly with a campaign against the news media that has Turkey as the world's leading jailer of journalists -- more even than China or Iran.
''If the activist who blew himself up today had possessed a press card, they would have called him a journalist,'' Mr. Erdogan said in comments broadcast on Turkish television shortly after the bombing last week that were immediately condemned by the advocacy group Reporters Without Borders.
Before the attack, Turkish security forces rounded up nearly 100 people accused of ties to the outlawed Revolutionary People's Liberation Front, the organization the perpetrator belonged to, among them journalists, lawyers, even members of a rock band. The arrests were condemned by human rights groups as another example of Turkey's broad use of antiterrorism laws to crack down on domestic opponents, particularly journalists and human rights lawyers, with no links to violent activities.
''Turkey's overbroad antiterrorism laws have been used against an ever-widening circle of people charged for nonviolent political activities and the legitimate exercise of freedom of expression, association and assembly,'' Human Rights Watch wrote in a report condemning many of the arrests.
Efkan Bolac, a member of the Contemporary Lawyers Association, was detained in that roundup but was released for lack of evidence.
''A lawyer doesn't become a rapist if he represents one, or a drug dealer if he represents one,'' Mr. Bolac said. ''They claim we are members of a terror group, but how is that possible when we spend our entire time at courthouses?''
This week the American ambassador to Turkey, Francis J. Ricciardone Jr., said the F.B.I. was investigating the attack and suggested that the Justice Department might prosecute the group that carried out the bombing.
Yet the attack seemed out of another time and carried a whiff of cold-war-era intrigue, when links between the C.I.A. and Turkey were central to efforts by the United States to counter Soviet influence in the region. It also upended the conventional narrative about modern terrorism. ''You'd think 10 years after the war on terror things would be clearer rather than more obfuscated,'' said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University.
In his column in The Hurriyet Daily News, Nihat Ali Ozcan, a security specialist at the Economic Policy Research Foundation in Ankara, likened the attack to a ''cold-war-style proxy war'' that he speculated was the work of Syria, given the historical links between the group and Syrian intelligence. His observation was reminiscent of the paranoia of a bygone era. At one of the art galleries here, newspapers chronicled the 1977 May Day celebration in Istanbul, when leftist groups gathered for a demonstration that turned bloody.
''This attack is a provocation that links all the way to the C.I.A.,'' one headline shrieked.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Devalues Currency by a Third Amid Shortages and Inflation

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela announced Friday that it was devaluing its currency, a step that had long been deemed necessary but could push the spiking inflation even higher.
The devaluation, which lowered the currency's value against the dollar by nearly a third, was aimed at solidifying government finances and easing a tight market for dollars that has choked back imports and led to shortages of basic goods. 
The move had been widely anticipated, but it had been unclear whether officials would make what could be a politically risky decision with President Hugo Chávez still out of the country after undergoing cancer surgery in Cuba on Dec. 11.
If Mr. Chávez were to die or were too ill to continue as president, a special election would have to be called, and many analysts thought that the government might try to postpone a devaluation until after that occurred.
''It is a sign of pragmatism that they carry out a devaluation even though we're all aware there is some likelihood of a presidential election being held soon,'' said Francisco Rodríguez, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ''This shows that they're willing to correct basic economic distortions.''
The currency, the bolívar, will be set at 6.3 to the dollar. It had been set at 4.3.
Venezuela's finance minister, Jorge Giordani, said that Mr. Chávez, who has not been seen or heard in public for more than eight weeks, had approved the measures.
''Here is the president's signature if you want to recognize it or if you still have doubts,'' Mr. Giordani said, holding up a document during a televised news conference.
The devaluation will help the government balance its books by giving it more bolívars for the dollars it earns selling oil on the world market. Venezuela's economy is highly dependent on oil, with petroleum sales making up about 95 percent of total exports. The country is the fourth-largest foreign oil supplier to the United States.
Government spending soared last year during the campaign to re-elect Mr. Chávez, leading to a large deficit, even though, at more than $100 a barrel, the price of oil is very high.
Pressure to devalue had been building for months, as the black market exchange rate rose to more than four times the official rate. The imbalance was evident in the prices of many goods. A Big Mac at McDonald's costs 70 bolívars, or $16.27, at the official pre-devaluation rate.
But the devaluation will also make imported goods more expensive, which will probably make inflation worse. Inflation for the 12 months ended on Jan. 31 was 22.2 percent, one of the highest rates in Latin America.
Surging inflation could cause political problems for the government. But the exchange rate had reduced the dollars available to importers, leading to shortages of goods like sugar, chicken and toilet paper. Many analysts believe that voters blame the government more for shortages than for inflation.

HEADLINE: A Bad Deal With Uzbekistan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''As NATO Prepares for Afghan Withdrawal, Uzbekistan Seeks War's Leftovers'' (news article, Feb. 1) cites what seems like an appealing option for American policy makers charged with removing war matériel from Afghanistan: In exchange for its airfields, Uzbekistan requests a share of the military hardware. 
Despite its immediate appeal, this option will incur far greater costs in the long run if Uzbekistan is unable to weather the tumultuous years ahead. With an aging autocrat (who has no clear successor), a decrepit infrastructure, deep-seated corruption and growing economic inequalities, Uzbekistan has a government that is not only coercive but potentially unstable as well.
Policy makers ought to consider that any divested high-tech weaponry might fall into the wrong hands should Uzbekistan's weak state descend into violence. Then the United States would face an adversary armed with the very weapons it left behind.
LAWRENCE P. MARKOWITZ Glassboro, N.J., Feb. 2, 2013
The writer is an assistant professor of political science at Rowan University and the author of a forthcoming book on resources, corruption and organized violence in Central Asia.

HEADLINE: Scientists Explore Options as Polar Bears Face New Threats

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A closer look at steps that may be taken to aid polar bears as the Arctic warms. 

 BODY:
The surge of hunting that depleted many polar bear populations in the 20th century is largely under control. But just as the species has been recovering from that threat, global warming is creating new pressures through the loss of summer sea ice and other impacts on the bears' preferred maritime habitat.
Recent DNA analysis has shown that polar bears are a far older species than was thought even a few years ago, and they clearly are adaptable and resilient. But it's also clear that some populations will have a very hard time in coming decades. What should people do in such cases? 
I've written previously about a valuable proposal by some scientists to start planning a long-term conservation strategy focused on regions of the Arctic where sea ice is expected to persist even with substantial warming.
But a new policy paper in Conservation Letters, "Rapid ecosystem change and polar bear conservation," proposes a series of steps that could kick in a lot sooner -- including everything from relocation programs to feeding of starving bears or in some cases "intentional population reduction" -- a k a culling. There's a solid look at the paper in Yale Environment 360.
The relocation and feeding seemed a bit of an overreach compared to what has been done for other species, particularly predators, when they're in extremis. So
I reached out to the lead authors, including Andrew Derocher, a professor of biology at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, who (along with at least two other authors of the paper) is an adviser to Polar Bears International, a private group campaigning to conserve the Arctic predator.
Here's my query (slightly adjusted): 
I've got to say that the proposal strikes me as an overreaction, particularly when you compare the responses to what humans do for other endangered species.
What other wild species -- particularly predators -- are fed to fend off starvation?
There are relocation programs for nonpredators (Asian rhinos in Nepal) and some predators to new habitats (mountain lions to Florida), But in those cases it's to reintroduce something to depopulated habitat, not save individuals from starvation on their home range. (Again there may be other examples; happy to hear of them.)
Here's the thoughtful and thorough reply from Derocher, who's also the author of "Polar Bears: A Complete Guide to Their Biology and Behavior":
I don't think the public views polar bears the same way as most other endangered species and this is one of the reasons that we laid out some of the options. If there is a species where we may make extraordinary efforts, polar bears likely fit right up there with giant pandas and California condors. The paper isn't a prescription for what should be done but rather what could be done. 
This is a policy perspective paper and what is clearly lacking is policy and plans about what will happen when we see a sudden change in a polar bear population. Our analyses of sea ice suggest such events will happen and likely much sooner than expected in Hudson Bay. The worst time to make policy and management plans is in the middle of a crisis. If you consider the response that is generated by a whale stranding event in the U.S., you have a sense of what is possible. We could see an impending starvation event in polar bears and there is no established response plan anywhere. Some wildlife managers I've spoken too are worried about exactly such events: they know the problem will land on their desks and the pressure from the top will be intense.
We lay out the whole spectrum of options in the paper: do nothing, euthanize the starving, right through to feeding bears. Europeans keep their brown bear populations alive in many countries by feeding them. Black bears in Washington State are fed to reduce damage on trees (e.g., Ziegltrum. 2006, "Cost-effectiveness of the black bear supplemental feeding program in western Washington," Wildlife Society Bulletin). We can feed black bears to protect trees so I find it hard to believe there won't be a major push to feed polar bears for at least part of the year to either keep populations from crashing in the early stages of collapse or even in the longer term to artificially support a semi-wild population. If I'm not mistaken, California condors are given clean carcasses as a supplemental food source. I can foresee huge pressure on politicians and wildlife managers to intervene. The "do nothing" option isn't likely acceptable to many but for others, it will be the preferred option. We need to have these discussions in advance and nothing happens in the north without consultation as it is often mandated to consult with communities.
All of us involved in polar bear science have received many e-mails with well-intentioned input from the public about what we should be doing. The usual options are making plastic "ice" floes but feeding polar bears is a common theme. Shipping in "overabundant" seals from Newfoundland and Labrador is a frequent suggestion. I was particularly struck by a truck driver who contacted me with the idea of shipping all the dead wildlife he sees along the side of the roads he travels. Moving polar bears is another common theme - sometimes north but often to the Antarctic (the latter obviously not an option). This paper was intended to generate discussion and hopefully, some planning. The Arctic is changing incredibly fast but it seems that, in Canada at least, this is simply viewed as an economic opportunity (more mining, more drilling, more shipping, and new fisheries). 
There are some bright spots - the recent involvement of WWF to assist a community in deterring bears away from town. Similar projects in eastern Russia are helping out but these are NGO driven program with limited resources and these sorts of actions will be required across the Arctic over time.
Ultimately, conservation biology is a forward-looking practice. For polar bears, we have many managers stuck in the past. Many politicians and upper level bureaucrats are ignoring the issues. We're not dealing with greenhouse gases so we will be dealing with starving polar bears and disappearing populations.

HEADLINE: Chicago Auto Show Features Few Introductions

BYLINE: PAUL STENQUIST


HIGHLIGHT: Chicago's McCormick Place convention center has more floor space than any other United States arena where auto shows are held. 

 BODY:
The Chicago auto show, which opened to the public on Saturday, may not be counted among the world's most significant in terms of new-model introductions or international prominence, but the city's McCormick Place convention center does have more floor space than any other United States arena where auto shows are held. 
A couple of years ago, when the Detroit auto show was slipping into oblivion, the Chicago show featured many new model introductions and appeared to be gaining prominence. But Detroit came roaring back this year, and Chicago seems to have taken a hit. Media types who roamed the city's vast lakefront facility on Thursday and Friday press days found only a scant handful of new or redesigned vehicles. A brief review of a select few follows.
 2014 Chevrolet Cruze Clean Turbo Diesel A diesel-powered Chevy Cruze isn't breaking news, as General Motors announced its intentions to sell it in the United States more than a year ago, and a similar car has been available in Europe and Australia (as Holden Cruze) for several years. But the automaker finally revealed the oil-burning Cruze in Chicago on Thursday. 
The United States Cruze diesel will be equipped with the German-built 2-liter turbodiesel offered in a number of Opel vehicles sold in Europe. The stateside version will develop an estimated 148 horsepower and 258 pound-feet torque. Fuel economy is estimated at 42 m.p.g., highway, with an automatic transmission. A Chevrolet spokesman, Tom Read, said in a phone interview that the Opel engine was chosen for the domestic market over the diesel used in the European Cruze because it was better suited to United States emission and calibration requirements. 
The Cruze diesel is scheduled to arrive at dealerships in 13 markets during the second quarter of 2013. National availability will come 60 to 90 days later. The base price is $25,695, including destination charges. 
 Kia Cross GT Concept Built on the same platform as the Kia GT, the Cross GT is longer, wider and lower than the maker's Sorento crossover. While the Cross GT looks like a crossover, Peter Schreyer, the Kia Motors Corporation president, said it was meant to illustrate that the brand was exploring the possibility of offering a rear-drive luxury sedan. Interior trim that includes reharvested walnut and leather supports that positioning. The hybrid powertrain mates a 3.8-liter V-6 and electric motor for a total output estimated at 400 horsepower.
 2014 Kia Forte 5-door This hatchback version of the Kia Forte, which was introduced on Thursday, will be offered in two versions: an SX model powered by a 1.6-liter turbo 4-cylinder that produces 201 horsepower or in EX trim with a 173-horsepower 2-liter 4-cylinder. It's scheduled to arrive at dealerships in the third quarter of 2013. Pricing has yet to be announced.
 2014 Toyota Tundra Toyota unveiled a redesigned version of its Tundra full-size pickup on Thursday. The automaker said it was the first major change since the current generation of Tundra was introduced in 2007. 
In keeping with the trend toward ever more expansive, more aggressive-looking front-end treatments on pickup trucks (which arguably began with the 1994 Dodge Ram), the restyled Tundra sports a huge grille with hard edges. Sharp character lines define the hood and front fenders. Inside, the truck gets a more modern, more luxurious look. That too seems to be the way the truck market is going. The running gear is mostly carryover from the 2013 Tundra with some changes to suspension tuning and steering.
 2013 Nissan Juke NISMO The Juke NISMO, which is scheduled to arrive at Nissan dealerships in March, is a high-performance version of the automaker's stylistically odd but well-received Juke mini crossover that was introduced to the United States market at the 2010 New York auto show. 
NISMO is Nissan's motorsports division, and the company brands performance versions of its passenger cars with the nameplate. The Juke NISMO is powered by a 197-horsepower 1.6-liter turbo 4-cylinder. Other performance gear includes a recalibrated suspension system and revised aerodynamics. Deeply bolstered front seats and 18-inch wheels further distinguish it from its more common Juke brethren.
 2014 Nissan GT-R Track Edition Although it doesn't get the NISMO tag, the GT-R track edition is by far the most potent of the performance cars Nissan showed in Chicago. This limited edition of the automaker's 545-horsepower supercar is equipped with a firmer suspension and aerodynamic enhancements. In true race car fashion, the back seat has been tossed. Only 150 units will be offered in the United States, and, beginning in May, they'll be available through select GT-R certified Nissan dealers.
 2014 Volkswagen Beetle GSR Volkswagen joined the Chicago performance parade with the introduction of the Beetle GSR. With a 210-horsepower 2-liter 4-cylinder it's like no Beetle we could have imagined 40 years ago when the original Bug was in the final years of its reign as the world's economy king. 
But even way back in 1973, Volkswagen was apt to warm things up a bit now and then, and it introduced a performance Beetle called the GSR, an acronym for Gelb Schwarzer Renner - yellow black racer. Only 3,500 copies of that 50-horsepower special edition were built in the 1970s, and for 2014 the automaker is sticking to the production number while greatly magnifying the horsepower figure. As one might expect, all Beetle GSRs will wear yellow and black. The car is scheduled to go on sale in the third quarter of 2013. Pricing information is not yet available.
 2014 Ram Promaster Ram, which was a Dodge back then, has been without a full-size van since the Daimler marriage ended in an ugly divorce and the German automaker pulled the plug on its large van that had been sold in the United States with Dodge Ram branding. Now that Chrysler Group LLC is happily wedded to Fiat, Ram will get its own version of the Fiat Ducato, a front-wheel-drive large work van that has long been available in the European market. 
The Ram Promaster will be available with a choice of two roof heights, three wheelbases and four body lengths, making numerous configurations possible. Engine offerings include a 3-liter diesel 4-cylinder and Chrysler's 2.6-liter Pentastar V-6.
 Mopar '13 Dart In the confusing world of Chrysler Group branding, where a Dodge isn't always a Dodge and a Ram is never a Dodge, the performance version of the compact Dodge Dart - shown to the public for the first time at the Chicago auto show - is branded Mopar. That means it will be built wearing a variety of Mopar parts and accessories, including a lowered suspension, low-profile tires, dual exhausts, upgraded brakes, and aerodynamic enhancements. 
While the '13 Dart may be a Mopar in the order book, it's a Dodge under the hood, and is powered by the same 1.4-liter turbo 4-cylinder that is available in Dodge-branded Darts.

HEADLINE: In China, a Vast Chasm Between the Rich and the Rest

BYLINE: SIM CHI YIN


HIGHLIGHT: The gulf between China&#8217;s booming cities and its poor countryside has become a major source of social unrest. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - The passing coal miners in remote Shaanxi Province took one look at our marooned Audi and walked on, leaving us stuck on the sleet-covered mountain road.
As dusk fell, I managed to mingle with some young migrant workers, and trek with them through a snowy mountain pass and onto the last bus for the day. "We thought you were rich city people, coming out here in an Audi," one worker told me. "That's why no one helped you."
He had become chatty only after I assured him that I had taken a ride in a friend's Audi - the car make of choice for Chinese government officials - only because I was rushing out to the mountains to visit a dying villager I had been photographing over for a year. 
The disdain that working-class Chinese have for the rich did not surprise me; it was a timely reminder of the sentiments surrounding the growing chasm between the haves and the have-nots in China. 
This gulf, between the prosperous and booming cities and the poor rural areas, has been expanding since the 1990s. Along with official corruption, inequality is a major source of social unrest. In Chinese cybercommunities, where sentiments are aired honestly and anonymously, cynical and celebratory comments abound over any spectacular fall of the wealthy, corrupt or privileged. Often, anger erupts over the arrogant misbehavior of the "fu er dai" - the children of wealthy families, who often have powerful political connections. On Tuesday, the government announced a vague plan to address "stark problems in income distribution."
Last month, China reported that income inequality peaked in 2008 and has narrowed since then, though many economists believe the problem is understated. For the first time in 12 years, the government reported figures for the Gini coefficient - an indicator of inequality. It said the coefficient was 0.474 last year, down from a high of 0.491 in 2008. (Zero would represent perfect equality, and 1 would represent complete inequality.) The Gini coefficient for the United States, after taxes and transfers, is 0.378 through the late 2000s, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
China has 2.7 million millionaires and 251 billionaires (in United States dollars). But 13 percent of its people live on less than $1.25 per day, according to United Nations data. Meanwhile, average annual disposable income in the cities is about $3,500.
Over the past year or so, the income gap in China has been one focus of my work.
In Shanghai, I followed around a trash collector, Zhang Chunying, 47, riding on the back of her cardboard- and plastic-laden tricycle past Gucci and Ermenegildo Zegna stores at the Xintiandi shopping and entertainment district. By collecting and selling cardboard and other recyclables, Ms. Zhang and her husband make about $15 a day, which they are using to put their son through college.
I also photographed migrant workers on a street in downtown Shanghai that turns into a flea market at night. They stand around picking out used clothes and shoes to buy for a few dollars. Some got upset with me for documenting what they see as their embarrassing existence.
In Beijing, I photographed a curbside cobbler, Gao Minghe, 48, just across the street from five-star hotels and an alley behind stores selling Aston Martins and Maseratis. He repairs the shoes of migrant and office workers from dawn till dusk, rain, shine or snow.
Beneath the skyscrapers and apartment blocks in the capital, a parallel universe of inhabitants lives in cramped, boxy, windowless rooms partitioned out of basements. These subterranean dwellers - which the local press unkindly calls the "rat tribe" - are migrant workers in the service industry. Over two years, I made portraits of these women and men, trying to show their dignity and aspirations.
I have also shot the so-called "ant tribe," which comprises graduates from provincial and unprestigious universities who flock to the capital in search of their Beijing Dream, only to find themselves working low-paying jobs and living in dorm-style hostels on the outskirts of the city. Years after graduating, they still live like students and cuddle in dark parking lots for lack of a space to call their own. Most were happy to chat and share their stories.
Hours after photographing this tribe, I was with another. I hung out with the young and wealthy members of a sports car club who did practice rounds in their McLarens, Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Porsches at a racetrack in Beijing. Decked out in Prada shoes, holding Louis Vuitton bags and escorted by their trophy girlfriends, who never stepped out of their air-conditioned cars, they seemed proud to be photographed by a foreign photographer, but were not forthcoming when asked any personal questions - including the nature of their jobs or the source of their wealth.
With the "rats" and "ants," the trash collectors, cobblers and couriers, it took time to build rapport and trust. But it was even harder to get wealthy Chinese - perhaps like rich people everywhere - to open up. Most live in gated, guarded communities on the outskirts of the city, and socialize behind closed doors. A few months ago, I was granted rare permission to photograph inside an exclusive club in Beijing for high rollers, and only at a party where some members were in costume.
The migrant workers and the poor mostly accept that life is unfair, at least for now.
"There is no difference between me and the people who live in the posh condominium above," Zhuang Qiuli, 27, a "rat tribe" pedicurist who lived in a basement apartment, told me in Beijing. "We wear the same clothes and have the same hairstyles. The only difference is we cannot see the sun. In a few years, when I have money, I will also live upstairs."

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths KENNA, EDGAR DOUGLAS

 BODY:
KENNA--Edgar Douglas, Jr. "Doug", age 88, of North Palm Beach, FL, passed away on January 28, 2013. Doug is survived by his wife, Jean; son, Edgar Douglas Kenna III (Debi); daughter, Susan Cronk (Shanler) and numerous grandchildren and great grandchildren. Doug Kenna attended the University of Mississippi for one year before being appointed to West Point in 1942. As a cadet, he excelled in athletics, was a cadet captain and regimental commander, and was elected president of his class. 
Upon his graduation from West Point, he was commissioned in the Infantry and beginning in the fall of 1946, Doug Kenna returned to West Point on temporary duty each fall as an assistant football coach under head coach Earl Blaik. In that capacity, he was instrumental in developing two more unbeaten Army teams, and, when he turned to civilian life, he stayed on at West Point coaching football for three more years. Mr. Kenna's illustrious career in business included his work at Avco as Vice-President of the Missiles, Space, and Electronics Group, and later as Vice-President in charge of Marketing and Planning, where he made significant contributions to the defense and security of the United States. He went on to become President of Fuqua Industries, increasing sales eight-fold; joined Robert B. Anderson, Ltd in a partnership that provided broad financial services and marketing throughout the world. In 1973, he was selected as President of the National Association of Manufacturers, an organization of over 12,000 members. While in this position, Mr. Kenna founded and directed the United States/USSR Trade and Economic Council. His enthusiasm and innovative planning made this visionary project a reality. In 1977, Mr. Kenna left the National Association of Manufacturers to become President of Carrier Corporation and in 1981 he became a partner and director of G.L. Ohrstrom & Co., a capital investment firm where he served until his retirement. Mr.Kenna has served as chairman and director of many companies during his long and brilliant career in business. Among these is Vinnell Corporation, a Trustee of Eisenhower College and Northeastern University; he is a member of the Vincent T. Lombardi Cancer Foundation; he has been active as Chairman of the United Way campaign and the Hiawatha Boy Scout Council for Upstate New York; and he is a Trustee Emeritus of the Association of Graduates of the United States Military Academy, and was also Vice-Chairman of the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame. Doug Kenna served two Presidents of the United States as chairman of investigative committees, devoting his time and energy as willingly as he has assisted charitable organizations during his career. He is a recipient of the Freedom Foundation Medal and the Gold Knight Award of the National Management Association. A Graveside Service will be held at the Lakewood Memorial Park, Jackson Mississippi, on February 11, 2013 at 11:00am.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths YUDELMAN, MONTAGUE

 BODY:
YUDELMAN--Montague, was a pioneer and a central figure in the field of international agricultural development both within the United States and around the world. His influence was felt in many important global economic, planning and organizational developments regarding food production, agricultural research, water resource use, and rural economic advancement. He played a prominent role in the development and propagation of a major agricultural research network that continues to be utilized around the world. The network was instrumental in addressing local and worldwide food security needs as part of the first "green revolution," and it is now helping again as part of the second "green revolution" that is focusing on food insecurity in Africa. 
Monty's career included work and contributions at many of the top research and lending institutions and nongovernmental organizations including FAO, University of Michigan and Harvard University, Rockefeller Foundation, OECD, World Resources Institute, World Wildlife Fund, Population Reference Bureau and the World Bank where he was the Director of Rural and Agricultural Development. As an economic specialist, experienced leader, and a person with a deep understanding of what it meant to farm, Monty's views were respected and sought by organizations and governments around the world. Monty was raised in a deeply rural part of Southern Africa, called the Transkei, where his father had opened a trading post as part of the early 20th century Eastern European Jewish Diaspora. Monty used to say that he got his start in agricultural economics because of his interests as to why European and African farmers had such different agricultural production practices. After boarding school, he spent much of the Second World War with the South African Air Force, serving as a navigator in both bombing squadrons and the dangerous "pathfinder" aircraft in the African and European theaters. For his service he received the Distinguished Flying Cross. After the war, he went to Berkeley, CA, working his way there as a carpenter's mate on a cargo vessel. At Berkeley, he attended the University of California and obtained an undergraduate, Masters and PhD degree in agricultural economics in six years. Monty will be remembered for his extraordinary life story and career and his love for his family and friends. He was an exceptional person who was known for his leadership, work ethic, sense of humor, youthfulness and generosity. Monty had a gregarious and outgoing personality and was also a great intellect who was happy to engage on topics from world politics to agricultural economics to mystery novels to the Washington Redskins. He was a superb raconteur and a dedicated fan of the crossword puzzle, having completed almost every Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle for the last 40 years. Monty was an inspiration for his wife of 40 years, Sally (died 2008), his family, former colleagues and countless numbers of young people. Finally, he was a dog's best friend. His neighborhood will miss his constant presence walking his dogs. Monty is survived by his daughter (Jane) and her partner (John Bullitt); two sons and their spouses (John, Paul, Linda and Rachel) and half-sister (Tanya Yudelman-Bloch), his two stepsons and their spouses (Christian and Ethan Miller and Pascale and Eileen) and nine grandchildren. A memorial service is being scheduled for the spring. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions can be made to the Malthus Lecture Fund c/o the Population Reference Bureau or The International Food Policy Research Institute.

HEADLINE: Relax! You'll Be More Productive

BYLINE: By TONY SCHWARTZ. 
The chief executive officer of The Energy Project and the author, most recently, of ''Be Excellent at Anything.''

 BODY:
THINK for a moment about your typical workday. Do you wake up tired? Check your e-mail before you get out of bed? Skip breakfast or grab something on the run that's not particularly nutritious? Rarely get away from your desk for lunch? Run from meeting to meeting with no time in between? Find it nearly impossible to keep up with the volume of e-mail you receive? Leave work later than you'd like, and still feel compelled to check e-mail in the evenings?
More and more of us find ourselves unable to juggle overwhelming demands and maintain a seemingly unsustainable pace. Paradoxically, the best way to get more done may be to spend more time doing less. A new and growing body of multidisciplinary research shows that strategic renewal -- including daytime workouts, short afternoon naps, longer sleep hours, more time away from the office and longer, more frequent vacations -- boosts productivity, job performance and, of course, health.
''More, bigger, faster.'' This, the ethos of the market economies since the Industrial Revolution, is grounded in a mythical and misguided assumption -- that our resources are infinite. 
Time is the resource on which we've relied to get more accomplished. When there's more to do, we invest more hours. But time is finite, and many of us feel we're running out, that we're investing as many hours as we can while trying to retain some semblance of a life outside work.
Although many of us can't increase the working hours in the day, we can measurably increase our energy. Science supplies a useful way to understand the forces at play here. Physicists understand energy as the capacity to do work. Like time, energy is finite; but unlike time, it is renewable. Taking more time off is counterintuitive for most of us. The idea is also at odds with the prevailing work ethic in most companies, where downtime is typically viewed as time wasted. More than one-third of employees, for example, eat lunch at their desks on a regular basis. More than 50 percent assume they'll work during their vacations.
In most workplaces, rewards still accrue to those who push the hardest and most continuously over time. But that doesn't mean they're the most productive.
Spending more hours at work often leads to less time for sleep and insufficient sleep takes a substantial toll on performance. In a study of nearly 400 employees, published last year, researchers found that sleeping too little -- defined as less than six hours each night -- was one of the best predictors of on-the-job burn-out. A recent Harvard study estimated that sleep deprivation costs American companies $63.2 billion a year in lost productivity.
The Stanford researcher Cheri D. Mah found that when she got male basketball players to sleep 10 hours a night, their performances in practice dramatically improved: free-throw and three-point shooting each increased by an average of 9 percent.
Daytime naps have a similar effect on performance. When night shift air traffic controllers were given 40 minutes to nap -- and slept an average of 19 minutes -- they performed much better on tests that measured vigilance and reaction time.
Longer naps have an even more profound impact than shorter ones. Sara C. Mednick, a sleep researcher at the University of California, Riverside, found that a 60- to 90-minute nap improved memory test results as fully as did eight hours of sleep.
MORE vacations are similarly beneficial. In 2006, the accounting firm Ernst & Young did an internal study of its employees and found that for each additional 10 hours of vacation employees took, their year-end performance ratings from supervisors (on a scale of one to five) improved by 8 percent. Frequent vacationers were also significantly less likely to leave the firm.
As athletes understand especially well, the greater the performance demand, the greater the need for renewal. When we're under pressure, however, most of us experience the opposite impulse: to push harder rather than rest. This may explain why a recent survey by Harris Interactive found that Americans left an average of 9.2 vacation days unused in 2012 -- up from 6.2 days in 2011.
The importance of restoration is rooted in our physiology. Human beings aren't designed to expend energy continuously. Rather, we're meant to pulse between spending and recovering energy.
In the 1950s, the researchers William Dement and Nathaniel Kleitman discovered that we sleep in cycles of roughly 90 minutes, moving from light to deep sleep and back out again. They named this pattern the Basic-Rest Activity Cycle or BRAC. A decade later, Professor Kleitman discovered that this cycle recapitulates itself during our waking lives.
The difference is that during the day we move from a state of alertness progressively into physiological fatigue approximately every 90 minutes. Our bodies regularly tell us to take a break, but we often override these signals and instead stoke ourselves up with caffeine, sugar and our own emergency reserves -- the stress hormones adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol.
Working in 90-minute intervals turns out to be a prescription for maximizing productivity. Professor K. Anders Ericsson and his colleagues at Florida State University have studied elite performers, including musicians, athletes, actors and chess players. In each of these fields, Dr. Ericsson found that the best performers typically practice in uninterrupted sessions that last no more than 90 minutes. They begin in the morning, take a break between sessions, and rarely work for more than four and a half hours in any given day.
''To maximize gains from long-term practice,'' Dr. Ericsson concluded, ''individuals must avoid exhaustion and must limit practice to an amount from which they can completely recover on a daily or weekly basis.''
I've systematically built these principles into the way I write. For my first three books, I sat at my desk for up 10 hours a day. Each of the books took me at least a year to write. For my two most recent books, I wrote in three uninterrupted 90-minute sessions -- beginning first thing in the morning, when my energy was highest -- and took a break after each one.
Along the way, I learned that it's not how long, but how well, you renew that matters most in terms of performance. Even renewal requires practice. The more rapidly and deeply I learned to quiet my mind and relax my body, the more restored I felt afterward. For one of the breaks, I ran. This generated mental and emotional renewal, but also turned out to be a time in which some of my best ideas came to me, unbidden. Writing just four and half hours a day, I completed both books in less than six months and spent my afternoons on less demanding work.
The power of renewal was so compelling to me that I've created a business around it that helps a range of companies including Google, Coca-Cola, Green Mountain Coffee, the Los Angeles Police Department, Cleveland Clinic and Genentech.
Our own offices are a laboratory for the principles we teach. Renewal is central to how we work. We dedicated space to a ''renewal'' room in which employees can nap, meditate or relax. We have a spacious lounge where employees hang out together and snack on healthy foods we provide. We encourage workers to take renewal breaks throughout the day, and to leave the office for lunch, which we often do together. We allow people to work from home several days a week, in part so they can avoid debilitating rush-hour commutes. Our workdays end at 6 p.m. and we don't expect anyone to answer e-mail in the evenings or on the weekends. Employees receive four weeks of vacation from their first year.
Our basic idea is that the energy employees bring to their jobs is far more important in terms of the value of their work than is the number of hours they work. By managing energy more skillfully, it's possible to get more done, in less time, more sustainably. In a decade, no one has ever chosen to leave the company. Our secret is simple -- and generally applicable. When we're renewing, we're truly renewing, so when we're working, we can really work.

HEADLINE: A Hunter's Menu Served With Colonial Charm

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER BROOKS

 BODY:
Having perfected her cooking during stints in Hawaii; Manhattan; New Orleans; Phoenix; Santa Fe, N.M.; and Telluride, Colo., Adrienne Sussman, the owner and chef of Adrienne Fine American Dining, settled in New Milford in 1996, largely because she found an eighteenth-century building there that could house her restaurant and herself. ''One of the reasons I'm still surviving in this economy is I can live upstairs,'' Ms. Sussman said.
Part of that house, including a four-table alcove, dates to 1749, with the larger dining room added a few decades later. The restaurant's colonial-era pedigree is accentuated by broad plank floorboards, numerous fireplaces (with bric-a-brac covered mantels) and faux-candle sconces. Shade-covered tapers, their flickering light powered by LED technology, light the linen-draped tables. With subdued background music, attentive-yet-discreet service and old New England charm, Adrienne Fine American Dining is a great choice for a romantic dinner, on Valentine's Day or any other special occasion. 
Occasionally, Adrienne's traditional cuisine -- featuring venison, rabbit, quail, duck and pheasant -- flashes a cosmopolitan flair, with the inclusion of a red Thai curry here, mushroom risotto there, a pinch of quinoa, a dash of cranberries, a whiff of wasabi, or, in the case of polenta, a sprinkling of Gorgonzola. That cheese, softly oozing over three warm corn cakes, provided a wonderful accent to the crispy-outside, velvety smooth-inside polenta. Walnuts and balsamic-dressed greens completed this delightful appetizer.
Fresh goat cheese and pecans accompany an appetizer of grilled eggplant, layered first with warm, fluffy cheese, then the nicely toasted nuts. A salad of mixed greens lightly dressed in a sherry vinaigrette served as a deliciously tart foil.
A few greens -- a sprig of cilantro, perhaps, or possibly basil -- would have improved the look of a dish of jumbo lump crab meat and acorn squash, also a starter, but there was no quibbling over how well the red Thai curry sauce complemented the squash without its peppery zing and notes of vanilla and coconut overwhelming the delicate nature of the crab. A butternut squash bisque, while not as thick as a true bisque, was puréed to a creamy consistency. Matchsticks of leek, fried and dotting the surface of the soup, though, were crisp but oily.
The only letdown among appetizers was a rabbit stew, which was less a stew than a sauté. The small morsels of white meat were well-browned but a little tough and strong-flavored -- more like hare than rabbit. I did enjoy the white wine-based sauce, with its interplay of spinach, smoky pancetta, garlic and pickled peppers.
The port wine sauce of a grilled venison entree was nowhere to be seen, and I was disappointed to find baby spinach in lieu of the watercress promised by the menu. But those complaints receded in the presence of a magisterially prepared cut of venison, its surface branded darkly with grill marks, the lean and tender flesh cooked to a perfect medium-rare.
A pair of roasted quails displayed similar finesse, both in the kitchen's deboning of the poultry and in their thyme-seasoned, pecan-and-wild-rice stuffing. Yet here, too, instead of the maple glaze promised on the menu, they were merely dusted in pepper and coarse salt; the mâche also had been replaced by chopped spinach.
Mâche, also known as lamb's lettuce (or corn salad), is a delicate green of crisp texture and lovely nuttiness. In every instance, over three visits, spinach was substituted -- without warning -- for both it and watercress. That applies to an otherwise excellent entree of roasted salmon (moist, flaky and topped by crushed walnuts), to sautéed duck breast (rendered to a just-right pinkness) and to a portobello mushroom risotto. More surprising, however, was the absence of portobellos in that risotto, with shiitakes and cremini serving in their stead. To my taste, that was an improvement: the smaller mushrooms were a good match for the risotto's intense overtones of Gorgonzola and roasted red peppers. Still, someone should have mentioned the absence of the portobellos, and the mâche, and the watercress when we ordered.
No romantic meal is complete without a sweet ending. At Adrienne, all desserts, including several excellent sorbets and ice creams (try the salty caramel), are made in house. From the crème brûlée, with an expertly bronzed crust over a thin layer of custard, to a not-too-sweet pear crumble cake, to a sinfully rich (and nearly mousselike) bittersweet chocolate torte, it is hard to go wrong. Years ago, Ms. Sussman served as a pastry chef at the Waldorf-Astoria's Peacock Alley, and she clearly still has the knack.
ADRIENNE FINE AMERICAN DINING: 218 KENT ROAD (ROUTE 7), NEW MILFORD; (860) 354-6001; ADRIENNERESTAURANT.COM GOOD The Space Free-standing 18thcentury Colonial house with one large dining room and an attached alcove, which together seat about 60. Wide plank floorboards, off-white walls with fauxcandle sconces, and fireplaces (their gas-fed ''logs'' rarely turned on) in every room contribute a bit of old-fashioned New England charm. Wheelchair accessible. The Crowd Mostly mature couples and foursomes looking for refined food in a relaxed, romantic environment. The Bar No bar, but a fair selection of wines largely from the United States, Italy, France, Spain and Australia ($6.75 to $9.25 by the glass; bottles start at $21.50). The Bill Appetizers, $8 to $15; entrees, $23 to $32.50; desserts, $9. All major credit cards accepted.

HEADLINE: A Doubly Trying Season For Same-Sex Couples

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
FOR Colette Hayward and Margaret Selby, the problem is this: Maryland recognizes their 2009 marriage, but the federal government does not.
The ramifications are maddeningly complex, no more so than when they deal with the Internal Revenue Service. Two years after taking legal action to assert their rights as a married couple, they are paying a price when they pay their taxes.
For Ms. Hayward, 47, a lawyer who owns two construction businesses, and Ms. Selby, 48, a Baltimore County police officer, a big issue involves insurance benefits they fought to achieve. They are paying taxes on those benefits, even though such benefits for spouses normally are not taxed. 
For same-sex couples across the United States, an offshoot of being married is a dizzying set of complications in computing taxes. Although nine states and the District of Columbia have approved same-sex marriages -- two others recognize marriages conducted elsewhere -- the federal 1996 Defense of Marriage Act prohibits such unions from being recognized by the federal government.
Ms. Hayward, 47, and Ms. Selby, 48, have two children and three grandchildren. They were together for 18 years before they married in Massachusetts. Soon after their marriage in 2009, Ms. Selby filed a request with the Baltimore County Police Department to add Ms. Hayward to her health care coverage and to make sure she was eligible for other benefits available to officer's spouses. She was turned down.
Lambda Legal, the gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy organization, filed an administrative grievance, arguing that denying benefits to a married couple, gay or straight, was contrary to Maryland law. It cited a 2010 opinion by the Maryland attorney general, Douglas F. Gansler, which noted the state's longstanding law recognizing out-of-state marriages, including same-sex ones.
In 2011, an arbitrator ruled in the couple's favor. But the victory came with a catch. Generally, health insurance benefits are not taxable, and adding a spouse or child to an insurance policy has no tax consequences. But because of DOMA, their insurance is treated not as a spousal benefit, but as imputed income, and thus subject to federal income tax. Ms. Hayward said Baltimore County told the couple that adding her to the policy increased the cost of the insurance by about $8,000 a year. She figures that it will increase their overall tax bill by about $2,500 to $3,000.
''We never expected this,'' Ms. Hayward said. ''We didn't sit there studying the I.R.S. code thinking we might be facing a major tax hit.''
Tax issues for same-sex married couples are numerous and often require expert advice to navigate.
Because same-sex couples are not permitted to file federal returns jointly, they cannot combine incomes and deductions to take advantage of lower tax rates and the benefits that can accrue, say, from balancing profits and losses in financial transactions.
Issues also arise when same-sex couples have children or other dependents, because they cannot file joint tax returns and may not both be legal parents. That complicates exemption claims and child care benefits, including education tax breaks.
PERHAPS most significantly for couples with major assets, DOMA prevents same-sex couples from taking advantage of estate tax exemptions, about $5.1 million for 2012 -- but double that for couples -- after indexing for inflation. If one member of a same-sex couple dies and leaves a spouse $5 million, those assets would be taxed. For heterosexual couples, there would be no tax.
That tax disparity is at the heart of the first challenge to DOMA to reach the United States Supreme Court. It was filed by Edith Windsor, who married Thea Spyer in 2007. When Ms. Spyer died in 2009, she left Ms. Windsor her share of their cottage in Southampton, N.Y., valued at $550,000 and an apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan valued at $1.3 million. The result was a $600,000 federal and state estate tax bill.
''I was indignant and hurt,'' Ms. Windsor said. ''If her name had been Theo instead of Thea I would have owed no taxes.''
The extra costs extend even to the tax-filing process. For same-sex couples in states that recognize their marriages, couples must prepare two sets of federal returns -- one that they will actually file, and another prepared as if they were married, to help prepare their state tax return.
Not having a marriage recognized for tax purposes can actually be an advantage, and the repeal of DOMA could cost some same-sex married couples some money. Just as many married couples are hit with the so-called marriage tax, many same-sex couples save money by being forced to file separately.
''I think a lot of same-sex married couples in high income ranges have no idea that once their marriage is recognized they will be paying a lot more in federal income tax because of the marriage tax penalty,'' said Patricia Cain, a tax law professor at Santa Clara University, who is herself in a same-sex marriage. ''I just ran the figures on a couple in the $2 million range, and in 2013 they'll be paying $35,000 more in federal tax filing jointly.''
Still, she said, both for social-equity reasons and because of the contradictions, ambiguities and holes in the current tax system, the repeal of DOMA cannot happen too soon. The confusion applies not just to marriage but to its dissolution as well, she said.
''We need to have marriage recognized, so we can know how to do divorce,'' she said.
She said that she was confident DOMA would eventually fall, but that there was no way to predict what the Windsor case would bring or whether the Supreme Court would make a broad ruling on DOMA or a narrow one -- say, on how it would affect the estate tax for same-sex couples.
Back in Maryland, Ms. Hayward said she and Ms. Selby had considered dropping the insurance but had decided against it.
''It's going to cost us more, but we fought so hard for it, we figure we should stick it out,'' she said. ''We're hoping there's going to be some movement on DOMA that will make this a nonissue. I'm very optimistic. I may be naïve, but I'm very optimistic.''

HEADLINE: In Urban China, a Vast Chasm

BYLINE: By SIM CHI YIN

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The passing coal miners in remote Shaanxi Province took one look at our marooned Audi and walked on, leaving us stuck on the sleet-covered mountain road.
As dusk fell, I managed to mingle with some young migrant workers, and trek with them through a snowy mountain pass and onto the last bus for the day. "We thought you were rich city people, coming out here in an Audi," one worker told me. "That's why no one helped you."
He had become chatty only after I assured him that I had taken a ride in a friend's Audi - the car make of choice for Chinese government officials - only because I was rushing out to the mountains to visit a dying villager I had been photographing over for a year. 
The disdain that working-class Chinese have for the rich did not surprise me; it was a timely reminder of the sentiments surrounding the growing chasm between the haves and the have-nots in China.
This gulf, between the prosperous and booming cities and the poor rural areas, has been expanding since the 1990s. Along with official corruption, inequality is a major source of social unrest. In Chinese cybercommunities, where sentiments are aired honestly and anonymously, cynical and celebratory comments abound over any spectacular fall of the wealthy, corrupt or privileged. Often, anger erupts over the arrogant misbehavior of the "fu er dai" - the children of wealthy families, who often have powerful political connections. On Tuesday, the government announced a vague plan to address "stark problems in income distribution."
Last month, China reported that income inequality peaked in 2008 and has narrowed since then, though many economists believe the problem is understated. For the first time in 12 years, the government reported figures for the Gini coefficient - an indicator of inequality. It said the coefficient was 0.474 last year, down from a high of 0.491 in 2008. (Zero would represent perfect equality, and 1 would represent complete inequality.) The Gini coefficient for the United States, after taxes and transfers, is 0.378 through the late 2000s, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
China has 2.7 million millionaires and 251 billionaires (in United States dollars). But 13 percent of its people live on less than $1.25 per day, according to United Nations data. Meanwhile, average annual disposable income in the cities is about $3,500.
Over the past year or so, the income gap in China has been one focus of my work.
In Shanghai, I followed around a trash collector, Zhang Chunying, 47, riding on the back of her cardboard- and plastic-laden tricycle past Gucci and Ermenegildo Zegna stores at the Xintiandi shopping and entertainment district. By collecting and selling cardboard and other recyclables, Ms. Zhang and her husband make about $15 a day, which they are using to put their son through college.
I also photographed migrant workers on a street in downtown Shanghai that turns into a flea market at night. They stand around picking out used clothes and shoes to buy for a few dollars. Some got upset with me for documenting what they see as their embarrassing existence.
In Beijing, I photographed a curbside cobbler, Gao Minghe, 48, just across the street from five-star hotels and an alley behind stores selling Aston Martins and Maseratis. He repairs the shoes of migrant and office workers from dawn till dusk, rain, shine or snow.
Beneath the skyscrapers and apartment blocks in the capital, a parallel universe of inhabitants lives in cramped, boxy, windowless rooms partitioned out of basements. These subterranean dwellers - which the local press unkindly calls the "rat tribe" - are migrant workers in the service industry. Over two years, I made portraits of these women and men, trying to show their dignity and aspirations.
I have also shot the so-called "ant tribe," which comprises graduates from provincial and unprestigious universities who flock to the capital in search of their Beijing Dream, only to find themselves working low-paying jobs and living in dorm-style hostels on the outskirts of the city. Years after graduating, they still live like students and cuddle in dark parking lots for lack of a space to call their own. Most were happy to chat and share their stories.
Hours after photographing this tribe, I was with another. I hung out with the young and wealthy members of a sports car club who did practice rounds in their McLarens, Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Porsches at a racetrack in Beijing. Decked out in Prada shoes, holding Louis Vuitton bags and escorted by their trophy girlfriends, who never stepped out of their air-conditioned cars, they seemed proud to be photographed by a foreign photographer, but were not forthcoming when asked any personal questions - including the nature of their jobs or the source of their wealth.
With the "rats" and "ants," the trash collectors, cobblers and couriers, it took time to build rapport and trust. But it was even harder to get wealthy Chinese - perhaps like rich people everywhere - to open up. Most live in gated, guarded communities on the outskirts of the city, and socialize behind closed doors. A few months ago, I was granted rare permission to photograph inside an exclusive club in Beijing for high rollers, and only at a party where some members were in costume.
The migrant workers and the poor mostly accept that life is unfair, at least for now.
"There is no difference between me and the people who live in the posh condominium above," Zhuang Qiuli, 27, a "rat tribe" pedicurist who lived in a basement apartment, told me in Beijing. "We wear the same clothes and have the same hairstyles. The only difference is we cannot see the sun. In a few years, when I have money, I will also live upstairs."

HEADLINE: Return of a Tabloid Dreamscape

BYLINE: By ZACHARY WOOLFE

 BODY:
Thomas Adès's operatic version of ''The Tempest,'' which had its premiere in 2004 at the Royal Opera House in London and arrived at the Metropolitan Opera last fall, was conceived as a capital-M Masterpiece: three acts, big cast, full chorus, Shakespearean source.
Its ambitions are grand, and there is a great deal of sheer pleasure in its surging, glinting orchestral score. But many of its beauties seem either disconnected from the development of character and plot or shackled by the relentlessly rhyming couplets of Meredith Oakes's libretto.
Mr. Adès has indeed written a masterpiece of contemporary music drama, but ''The Tempest'' isn't it. It is his first opera, the keener, funnier, sadder ''Powder Her Face,'' an intimate two-act, four-singer chamber work first performed at the Cheltenham Festival in England in 1995, when he was just 24. 
On next Friday evening New York City Opera's new production, directed by Jay Scheib, opens at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. A semistaged version was performed at the academy in 1998, but this will be New York's first full experience of a work that seems more precise and moving with each passing year, both cooler and more warming.
Operas of a slightly earlier period that featured real-life characters from the recent past -- like Philip Glass's ''Satyagraha'' (1980) and John Adams's ''Nixon in China'' (1987) and ''Death of Klinghoffer'' (1991) -- had chosen subjects of historical importance and seriousness. Mr. Adès and his librettist, Philip Hensher, went with a far more trivial story about the fame- and money-hungry Margaret Whigham, whose 1963 divorce from the Duke of Argyll was pure tabloid fodder, focused on salacious accusations of her promiscuity.
Mr. Adès and Mr. Hensher imagined the piece as a kind of dreamscape told in flashbacks to its heroine's climb, scandal and descent into mental instability and penury. The opera begins near her end, in 1990, with the duchess sick, poor and querulous, holed up in a hotel room she cannot pay for and assisted by her maid, an electrician and the hotel manager.
These three take turns as the rest of the opera's characters: the libretto indicates transformations like ''Hotel Manager as Duke'' and ''Electrician as Lounge Lizard.'' The Maid and the Electrician become rubberneckers at the divorce trial, veering with casual cruelty from opinion to opinion on the proceedings.
The Hotel Manager gives a long monologue as the judge who condemns the Duchess as ''a Don Juan among women.'' At one point the Electrician plays a waiter on whom the Duchess very visibly (and while singing) performs fellatio, a sequence that gave the opera an air of notoriety that lingers to this day but is far more disconcerting than arousing, with brutal vocal lunges.
Mr. Adès's Duchess is an expressionist femme fatale in the tradition of Berg's Lulu and Janacek's Emilia Marty (in ''The Makropulos Case''). But she is also, like the Marschallin in Strauss's ''Rosenkavalier,'' an aristocrat who faces aging with a bittersweet mixture of fear, humor and resignation.
She is simultaneously risible and pitiable, and those sides come together in two tour de force arias, the first just after her trial. ''So that is all,'' it begins, with a repeated figure in the woodwinds and tremolos that pass through the strings under a sad vocal line that soars on the words ''I am still loved,'' then starts to fragment into angry declamation, prefiguring the Duchess's insanity with eerie slides in the strings and a postlude of heaves and clicks.
In the final scene the Duchess, by this point living in a world of her memories, reflects on the servants who have worked for her over a long life, dwelling on her maid. ''She died,'' she whispers, setting off a low groan in the orchestra. A gentle melody in the strings and brasses rises to a fury as she throws a perfume bottle against the wall. ''Broken,'' she sings. ''It's broken. Gone. It's the last thing I had.''
The music of ''Powder Her Face,'' like that of ''The Tempest,'' manages to be eclectic in a way that never sounds like pastiche and always sounds like Adès. Set into the spiky texture of much of the score, its occasional lilting snippets of 1930s-style popular songs could, in other hands, be the stuff of simple-minded parody. But Mr. Adès always brings in an unexpected note, a destabilizing rhythm, a mood that won't stay put.
It is a style in which one thing flows endlessly, effortlessly into the next, just as the characters constantly change their costumes and the staccato brass tweets at the end of the overture lead seamlessly into the Maid's laughter in the opening scene. The action -- consisting of the Duchess's memories or fantasies or both -- seems to flow too, often dreamily stretching out as it unfolds in a way that seems both ominous and tender, conveying the boredom of the Duchess's frenetic yet empty life without ever being boring.
Mr. Adès's Duchess may lack the stature of Philip Glass's Gandhi or John Adams's Nixon. But ''Powder Her Face'' is not merely frivolous, particularly not in 2013.
''Fancy,'' the Maid as Waitress bitterly sings, with both wonder and anger, as she considers the Duchess. ''Fancy being rich.''
The Duchess counters after her trial, ''I do not care what lies are told about me by members of the middle classes.''
Since its premiere ''Powder Her Face'' has been known as an opera about tabloid culture and the transience of modern celebrity, and it certainly is that. But more clearly than ever it also comes across as a work about class resentment, about the coruscating, deadening effects of money. ''In the end,'' as the Maid and the Electrician sing, ''it evaporates into air.''
It is surely an appropriate piece for this time of income inequality, global economic depression, crisis in the euro zone and austerity in Britain, in the same way that the Met's 2011 revival of ''Satyagraha,'' with its message of political resistance, spoke strongly to a New York in the throes of Occupy Wall Street. ''Powder Her Face'' could not sound more different from Mr. Glass's opera, but it is just as relevant to a city and a moment.

HEADLINE: The Tax Deal That Simplified Nothing

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
IF 2012 was the beginning of a long, inevitable slide toward tax increases, 2013 might just turn out to be the lurching start of tax reform.
For more than a decade, lawmakers in both parties have lamented the complexity of the federal tax code, even as they layered on new deductions, credits and variable tax rates intended to reward some activities and punish others.
The deal struck by the White House and Senate on New Year's Day to head off the huge tax increases of the so-called fiscal cliff actually made matters worse on the complexity front. The highest marginal tax rate was increased to 39.6 percent from 35 percent for couples earning over $450,000 ($400,000 for individuals). In doing so, however, negotiators increased the total number of tax brackets to seven from six.
Tax rates on capital gains and dividends for families earning less than that $450,000 threshold remain at 15 percent, but those who earn more will have some of their investments taxed at 20 percent. And personal exemption and tax deduction phase-outs, known as PEP and Pease, are coming back starting at incomes as low as $250,000. President George W. Bush banished those in 2001. (PEP stands for personal exemption phaseout, and Pease for former Representative Donald J. Pease, the Ohio Democrat who created the deduction cap.) 
The changes may sound like enough to make you ditch your tax-preparation software and run screaming as fast as you can to a professional accountant.
But by the end of the year, efforts in both the House and Senate to overhaul the tax code, simplify it and strip out many bewildering and contradictory tax breaks might bear fruit. That's because both political parties have an incentive, although not the same incentive, to move forward.
''Tax reform is alive and well,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. ''There's such a need to simplify the code, to help the code be more competitive, to address a lot of inequities,'' he said, adding that because the New Year's tax deal did practically nothing to close loopholes and unclutter the tax code, ''the road is clear.''
Republicans are being driven by a long-held desire for simplification, pressed hard by the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Representative Dave Camp of Michigan. Conservatives in the House have been clamoring to take on tax reform since they swept to power in 2010. And after a year of listening sessions, tutorials and hearings, Mr. Camp and the rest of the House Republican leadership want to move forward.
For Democrats, it's mainly about the money. The deal to avert the fiscal cliff contained tax rate increases, which President Obama has been demanding since his 2008 run for the White House. But the rate increases were not as inclusive as those he had campaigned for -- he wanted tax rates to rise on incomes above $250,000, dividends to be taxed as ordinary income and inherited estates to face considerably higher rates and lower exemptions from taxation than the final deal demanded.
On the estate tax, Mr. Obama wanted to subject the value of estates over $3.5 million to a 45 percent tax, higher than the 2012 level of 35 percent on estates over $5 million. The final deal did get a higher rate -- 40 percent -- but kept the exemption at $5 million, or $10 million for married couples, indexed for inflation. With that indexing, the exemption comes in at about $5.1 million for 2012 -- double for a couple -- a level that exempts all but a tiny number of inheritances.
By raising taxes on incomes over $400,000, Congress also effectively raised only the top marginal income tax rate, not the top two, as the president and most Democrats had wanted. (It is the ''marginal'' rate because it applies only to income above a certain threshold.)
Raising tax rates further won't be simple, said Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who as a leader of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has spent more than a decade examining tax shelters and dodges. The only way to raise more revenue for deficit reduction at this point, he said, lies with a tax code overhaul that curtails or eliminates breaks that favor the affluent and hits corporations that use offshore tax structures to shelter profits.
Think mortgage interest deductions for second homes, the low ''carried interest'' tax rate paid by many private equity fund managers who take their fees in the form of capital gains skimmed off their clients' earnings, or post office box subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands. There could even be some limit on deductions for charitable giving.
''To me this is not about tax increases,'' Mr. Levin said. ''This is tax-avoidance termination, long overdue.''
The maneuvering over these issues is well under way in Congress. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Senate Democrats hoped to pass a budget blueprint this spring that would include a parliamentary device called reconciliation to put tax reform on a fast track. Under reconciliation, a Congressional budget gives instructions to the tax-writing committees to draft legislation that saves (or costs) a specific amount of money over the window of the budget, usually 10 years.
Reconciliation protects that legislation, drafted later in the year, from a filibuster in the Senate, meaning that it could pass with a simple, 51-vote majority. Mr. Bush passed his large 2001 and 2003 tax cuts under these terms. Now Democrats want to turn the tables and use the tactic to raise revenue. They have yet to say how much, but Mr. Obama's last offer to Republicans for a deficit-reduction ''grand bargain'' asked for $1.2 trillion in new revenue over 10 years. The tax increases of the New Year's deal raised about half that much, so another $600 billion in revenue through tax reform is a likely target.
But Mr. Schumer's suggestion has created its own problems. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the finance committee, said the reconciliation device would poison any tax reform effort, leaving Republicans feeling strong-armed and voiceless.
''I know Chuck wants to order the committee to do what he wants it to do,'' Mr. Hatch said of the Schumer plan. ''But that isn't the way it's going to work. In fact, that's the way to create chaos.''
The House budget, likely to be passed by April 15, will also include tax reform instructions. But the House's version would raise no more revenue than the current tax code -- albeit at the higher level of the post-fiscal-cliff tax regime.
In normal times, Senate and House negotiators working out a final budget blueprint for both chambers might be counted on to split the difference, say, with a plan that raised $300 billion over 10 years. But these are not normal times, and Republicans in the House and Senate say that when it comes to taxes, they have given in enough.
Moreover, the white-shoed tax lobbyists of K Street are already circling the Capitol, seeking to protect the tax breaks that their clients have paid them to protect. Before a formal push for tax reform even begins, a coalition of universities, philanthropies and others have all but made sure that no real harm will come to the deduction for charitable giving, for example. And electric power utilities have banded together to protect the low rate on dividends, saying that most dividends go to ordinary retirees, not the superrich.
To those who remember the struggle with lobbyists over the 1986 tax-code overhaul, 2013 is developing into ''Showdown at Gucci Gulch II.'' Then again, no one gave the 1986 tax reform effort much chance at success -- yet it was enacted.
''There are a lot of crosscurrents here: the need for revenues, spending cuts,'' Mr. Baucus said of the task at hand. ''There's just a lot going on.''

HEADLINE: It's Not Easy Being Green

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times and the author of a new e-single, ''Here's the Deal.''

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
GREEN jobs have long had a whiff of exaggeration to them. The alternative-energy sector may ultimately employ millions of people. But raising the cost of the energy that households and businesses use every day -- a necessary effect of helping the climate -- is not exactly a recipe for an economic boom.
The stronger argument for a major government response to climate change is the more obvious argument: climate change. The continental United States endured its hottest year on record in 2012, and the planet's 13 hottest years have all occurred since 1998. Major storms and wildfires are increasing in many regions. The air in much of China resembles soup. The seas are rising faster than forecast only a few years ago, and the costs of extreme weather are rising, too.
In Washington, the economic case for responding to climate change has made little progress, with Democrats failing to pass a sweeping bill when they controlled Congress and Republicans remaining strongly opposed. And President Obama has subtly shifted his approach, talking less about green jobs and more about extreme weather. 
As he prepares to deliver the first State of the Union address of his second term, on Tuesday night, he and his advisers face some big decisions on climate policy. One is how to make the biggest dent in carbon emissions through executive-branch actions, given the long odds of Congress's passing any substantial bill. Another is to rethink the economics of climate policy now that the early burst of green-job enthusiasm has waned.
Alternative energy may not be a solution to our economic problems. But neither is it guaranteed to make those problems much worse, despite the continuing claims of opponents. Mr. Obama has a range of options with the potential to have different economic consequences. Some may indeed do harm, but others could have economic benefits that equal their costs, particularly in a world in which temperatures, storms and uncertainty just keep rising.
The most intriguing choice facing Mr. Obama is whether to resuscitate a version of the centerpiece of the Democrats' failed 2009 climate push: a cap-and-trade program. He has little chance of creating such an economywide program, because Republicans and some coal-state Democrats oppose it. But he may be able to create a scaled-down version specifically for power plants -- no small thing, given that power plants produce about one-third of the country's carbon emissions.
To economists, the best climate policies are those that allow market incentives to work, and the most damaging tend to be those heavy on mandates. ''Telling companies they have to install this or that equipment is the more expensive way to proceed,'' says Michael Greenstone, an M.I.T. economist and former Obama administration adviser. ''Instead of a one-size-fits-all solution, you should allow companies to find the least-cost solution.''
Mandating that every power plant use turbines with a minimum efficiency, for instance, is likely to impose large costs on some. Perhaps the plants are designed in a way that makes it easier -- and cheaper -- for them to use their old turbines and reduce emissions another way. A turbine mandate could force them to raise prices for consumers more than necessary to achieve the same climate benefit.
A cap-and-trade system works differently. It requires companies to buy permits for their emissions and allows the companies to decide how best to meet their targets. A company that finds inexpensive ways to reduce emissions can sell its unused permits to companies that would have had to spend large sums to reduce emissions, lowering prices for everyone.
In previous decades, the United States reduced acid rainfall and the levels of lead in gasoline through similar approaches, both at lower costs than predicted.
White House officials have already signaled that Mr. Obama is likely to use a 2007 Supreme Court decision -- which gave the Environmental Protection Agency authority to regulate greenhouse gases -- to regulate existing power plants. In the first term, the E.P.A. relied on that decision to negotiate a steep increase in fuel-economy standards with automakers and to overhaul standards for newly constructed power plants. The rules for new power plants would effectively halt the construction of new coal plants.
Those rules relied mostly on mandates, like requiring automakers to have a certain average fuel efficiency across their entire fleet. And mandates can indeed reduce carbon emissions. In the second term, aides say Mr. Obama may also mandate that home appliances and office buildings produce fewer emissions.
BUT even largely successful mandates, like the one on autos, often bring little-noticed costs. So environmental economists are watching to see if Mr. Obama will also take steps to keep economic growth at the center of his climate policy, by attempting to regulate existing power plants with market-friendly permits.
Such a step would most likely draw legal challenges, but so would any move by the administration to regulate power-plant emissions.
The system would not be a true cap-and-trade program, because it would lack a nationwide cap on power-plant emissions, notes Nathaniel Keohane, a vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund and another former White House economist. Still, the system would create credits that efficient plants could sell to less efficient plants.
The program would still be vulnerable to political caricature as a ''cap-and-tax'' program, much as the 2009 cap-and-trade bill was. This time, though, individual Congress members would not need to vote for it. The administration could implement it, fight for it in the courts -- and hope, as in the past, that the costs end up being far lower than critics predict.
''Realistically, there is very little prospect of progress in this Congress,'' Mr. Keohane told me. ''Ultimately, we have to have a comprehensive policy,'' he argued, given the scale of the problem. ''But we can get started in the short run.''
Beyond a market-based system, financing for research is a second major way Washington can try to slow climate change without harming economic growth. The federal government will spend $3.8 billion this year on clean-energy research and development, according to the Brookings Institution.
It is a tiny sum relative to the $30 billion for medical research or the $15 billion for agriculture subsidies, let alone the $800 billion for Social Security. A cross-ideological report, from the American Enterprise Institute, the Breakthrough Institute and the Brookings Institution, has recommended an additional $25 billion a year for alternative energy.
Of course, in the current fiscal and partisan environment, so much additional financing is about as likely to pass Congress as a carbon tax. The more realistic hope, many scientists and economists say, is for the government to spend its existing money more effectively.
The small Energy Department program Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, known as Arpa-e -- modeled after Darpa, the Pentagon research lab that built the Internet -- should be a model, say Mr. Greenstone and others. The program finances high-risk research when the private sector is unlikely to find it profitable and makes decisions based on peer review. But Arpa-e is the exception, and much federal research spending has lower odds of major success.
The government could play a further role by making its own buildings and operations more energy efficient. Doing so could have a modest effect on the country's total emissions. Perhaps more important, it could bolster the nascent market for alternative energy.
In some cases, such changes may even save taxpayers money over the long run. In most cases, however, they probably will not. Government agencies, like households and businesses, use dirty energy today because it is cheaper. And while it's true that new clean-energy companies may help the economy by earning profits and employing workers, the same is true of coal and oil companies.
The two sides in the climate debate have spent recent years offering dueling -- and dubious -- economic claims. Switching to more expensive, cleaner energy does not promise a free lunch of more prosperity and a healthier planet. But it also does not need to result in stagnation. A federal climate response brings a mix of costs and benefits, and the specific policies that Mr. Obama and Congress pursue will help determine the balance.
In the end, the strongest economic argument for an aggressive response to climate change is not the much trumpeted windfall of green jobs. It's the fact that the economy won't function very well in a world full of droughts, hurricanes and heat waves.

HEADLINE: After Ron Paul, Then What?

BYLINE: By BRIAN DOHERTY. 
A senior editor at Reason magazine and the author of '', Ron Paul's Revolution: The Man and the Movement He Inspired.''

 BODY:
RON PAUL, Republican of Texas, has retired from the House, after winning more than two million presidential primary votes in 2012. He took the party's libertarian wing from ignorable fringe to significant faction. His son, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, is angling to lead that faction, very possibly as a presidential candidate himself.
The libertarian wing's dissatisfaction with Mitt Romney led the Libertarian Party to earn 1.2 million votes in the presidential election for its candidate, the former New Mexico governor (and former Republican) Gary Johnson. That was its largest vote total ever. In at least seven national House and Senate races a Libertarian beat the spread between a winning Democrat and a losing Republican. From the Republican point of view, losing the libertarians can mean losing elections.
''There's a whole swath of people not getting adequate attention from Republicans or Democrats,'' Senator Paul told me recently. These are independent voters who want to seriously cut government spending the way the Tea Party faction does but who also want a ''foreign policy more of defense and less offense,'' as Senator Paul put it, and a ''more socially tolerant attitude.'' 
Senator Paul, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, tried this week, in a talk at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, to become the voice of a new vision of Republican foreign policy. Rejecting the neoconservatism that has dominated Republican foreign policy thinking since at least 2001, Senator Paul summoned the spirit of George F. Kennan, the author of America's cold war policy of containment, to suggest that the United States can manage Islamic terror, and even possibly a nuclear Iran, without necessarily waging open war.
Senator Paul said that he agreed with those who say that ''Western occupation fans the flames of radical Islam.'' That opinion turned many Republicans against his father. Senator Paul's speech pushed a less interventionist foreign policy in terms designed to appeal to Republicans. The Constitution, after all, dictates that Congress, and not the president alone, should decide when we go to war. With the debt crisis, the United States simply can't afford all its current and possible future military interventions. Fiscal conservatism, by this line of thinking, means peace.
Just as his father made ''Audit the Fed'' a popular cause, Senator Paul told me in January, ''I think I can do the same with 'Audit the Pentagon' '' and fold defense cuts into his party's conception of fiscal responsibility.
Ron Paul's son is not his only legacy in Washington. A small group of freshman or second-term representatives he endorsed are admired and scrutinized by his supporters. The most prominent House ''Paulite'' is the second-termer Justin Amash, of Michigan. There is a new breed of Republicans who ''are much more libertarian in their views and have the debt as their primary concern and will fight to protect civil liberties,'' Mr. Amash told me last month. ''It's only a matter of time before these individuals work their way up in ranks and become leaders.''
Mr. Amash embraces the libertarian label. ''In my district, people have a good idea what it means: limited government, economic freedom, individual liberty,'' he says. ''They see I'm against wasteful spending and for protection of civil liberties.'' Mr. Amash relishes how his libertarianism marks him as a rebel in his own party. He was booted in December from his Budget Committee seat by the Republican House leadership for, he says, voting against leadership-approved budgets that didn't shrink spending enough for his taste. Then Mr. Amash encouraged a revolt against House Speaker John A. Boehner in his January speaker election. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a Ron Paul-endorsed freshman, voted for Mr. Amash over Mr. Boehner. Mr. Amash says that the leadership's anger pleases his constituents; they are ''excited about my independence, excited to have a representative fighting for them and not just following the party line on everything.''
While Senator Paul and Mr. Amash alienate some Republicans, libertarian stands against policies like the bailouts and the federal drug war have potential crossover appeal for Democrats and independents. ''If we are ever going to win in California again, or Washington, we need someone who is a libertarian Republican,'' Senator Paul told me.
The party that nominated Mr. Romney, and that gave only 16 Senate votes in May 2012 to Rand Paul's five-year path to a balanced budget, might not agree. The consistency of the libertarian philosophy -- roughly, that government exists only to protect citizens' lives and property from assault -- leads them to buck party discipline on spending. Senator Paul was among the few Senate Republicans who voted against the fiscal cliff deal. It also leads them to oppose civil liberties encroachments like the Patriot Act and the indefinite detention provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act and to condemn ''crony capitalism'' as exemplified by the Troubled Asset Relief Program and other government bailouts they see as illegitimately serving Wall Street and banking interests.
Mr. Amash is sure that libertarian consistency helps him, and could help the Republican Party. ''It gives you credibility with people who might be mistrustful because you are Republican,'' he told me. ''It shows you are serious about following the Constitution and defending American people's liberties.''
Ron Paul understood his mission as educational, not just political. He thought more Americans needed to be taught the economic and ethical benefits of a government that pretty much leaves us alone. His successors optimistically think Americans will embrace their libertarianism; more important, they are sure Americans need to, to avoid a fiscal and debt crisis they fear intensely.
''We need to institute a gradual solution for entitlements'' like increasing retirement ages, Senator Paul says, ''or we might need quick ones.'' He sees debt and potentially inflationary Federal Reserve policy not as abstract problems but as possible triggers for ''1923 Germany in the United States.''
This acute sense that our budget and fiscal problems are not just political games, that we face economic destruction of historic proportions, energizes the world that arose around Ron Paul, even as it risks striking the average voter as manic. Mr. Amash echoes that sense of crisis: ''Hopefully, a lot of people who have been recently elected understand the dire consequences of failing to get our fiscal house in order. But whether we'll get enough people in positions of influence within the party structure fast enough to make these changes, I don't know.''
Mainstream party leaders are blaming failures with technology and grass-roots organizing for their party's bad results in 2012. The libertarian wing argues instead that Republicans need to separate a core limited-government constitutionalism from the obsessions of other party factions, whether it's the social traditionalism of the religious right (losing its grip on a changing America) or an expansionist foreign policy (unaffordable and dangerous). At stake, they think, is not just their party's viability, but America's solvency. From the libertarian point of view, we might soon be facing the choice of Rand Paul 2016 or bust.

HEADLINE: In Nigeria, You're Either Somebody Or Nobody

BYLINE: By ADAOBI TRICIA NWAUBANI. 
The author of the novel ''I Do Not Come to You by Chance'' and a fellow with the African Leadership Institute.

 BODY:
ABUJA, Nigeria
IN America, all men are believed to be created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. But Nigerians are brought up to believe that our society consists of higher and lesser beings. Some are born to own and enjoy, while others are born to toil and endure.
The earliest indoctrination many of us have to this mind-set happens at home. Throughout my childhood, ''househelps'' -- usually teenagers from poor families -- came to live with my family, sometimes up to three or four of them at a time. In exchange for scrubbing, laundering, cooking, baby-sitting and everything else that brawn could accomplish, either they were sent to school, or their parents were sent regular cash.
My father detested it when our househelps sang. Each time a new one arrived, my siblings and I spent the first few evenings as emissaries from the living room, where our family watched TV after dinner, to the kitchen, where the househelps washed dishes or waited to be summoned. 
''My daddy said I should tell you to stop singing.''
Immediately, they would shush. Often, they forgot and started again -- if not that same evening, on a subsequent one. Finally, my father would lose his imperial cool, stomp over to the kitchen and stand by the door.
''Stop singing!'' he would command.
That usually settled the matter.
I honestly cannot blame my father. Although they hailed from different villages across the land, their melodies were always the same: The most lugubrious tunes in the most piercing tones, which made you think of death.
Melancholic singing was not the only trait they had in common. They all gave off a feral scent, which never failed to tell the tale each time they abandoned the wooden stools set aside for them and relaxed on our sofas while we were out. They all displayed a bottomless hunger that could never be satisfied, no matter how much you heaped on their plates or what quantity of our leftovers they cleaned out.
And they all suffered from endless tribulations, in which they always wanted to get you involved.
The roof of their family house got blown off by a rainstorm. Their mother just had her 11th baby and the doctor had seized mum and newborn, pending payment of the hospital bill. Their brother, an apprentice trader in Aba, was wrongfully accused of stealing from his boss and needed to be bailed out. A farmland tussle had left their father lying half-dead in hospital, riddled with machete wounds. Their mother's auntie, a renowned witch, had cursed their sister so that she could no longer hear or speak. They were pregnant but the carpenter responsible was claiming he had never met them before ... Always one calamity after the other.
Househelps were widely believed to be scoundrels and carriers of disease. The first thing to do when a new one arrived was drag him off to the laboratory for blood tests, the results of which would determine whether he should be allowed into your haven. The last thing to do when one was leaving was to search him for stolen items. In one memorable incident, the help in my friend's house, knowing that her luggage would be searched, donned all the children's underwear she had stolen. And she nearly got away with it. But just as she stepped out the door, my friend's mother noticed that the girl's hips had broadened beyond what food could afflict on the human anatomy in such little time, and insisted that she raise her skirt.
Every family we knew had similar stories about their domestic staff. With time, we children learned to think of them as figures depressed by the hand of nature below the level of the human species, as if they had been created only as a useful backdrop against which we were to shine.
Not much has changed since I was a child. My friend's daughter, who attends one of those schools where all the students are children of either well-off Nigerians or well-paid expatriates, recently captured this attitude while summarizing the plot of my novel to her mother. ''Three people died,'' the 11-year-old said, ''but one of them was a poor man.''
It reminded me of the conversation in Mark Twain's ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' when Huck tries to explain a delay in a journey:
''It warn't the grounding -- that didn't keep us back but a little. We blowed out a cylinder-head.''
''Good gracious! anybody hurt?''
''No'm. Killed a nigger.''
''Well, it's lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt.''
BIGOTS and racists exist in America, without a doubt, but America today is a more civilized place than Nigeria. Not because of its infrastructure or schools or welfare system. But because the principle of equality was laid out way back in its Declaration of Independence. The Nigerian Constitution states, in Section 17(2)(a), that ''every citizen shall have equality of rights, obligations and opportunities before the law.'' However, this provision is in a portion of the document that contains ''objectives'' of the Nigerian state. It is not enforceable; it certainly isn't reality.
The average Nigerian's best hope for dignified treatment is to acquire the right props. Flashy cars. Praise singers. Elite group membership. British or American accent. Armed escort. These ensure that you will get efficient service at banks and hospitals. If the props prove insufficient, a properly bellowed ''Do you know who I am?'' could very well do the trick.
This somebody-nobody mind-set is at the root of corruption and underdevelopment: ingenuity that could be invested in moving society forward is instead expended on individuals' rising just one rung higher, and immediately claiming their license to disparage and abuse those below. Even when one househelp is made supervisor over the rest, he ends up being more callous than the owners of the house.
Some years ago, I made a decision to start treating domestic workers as ''somebodys.'' I said ''please'' and ''thank you'' and ''if you don't mind.'' I smiled for no reason. But I was only confusing them; they knew how society worked. They knew that somebodys gave orders and kicked them around. Anyone who related to them as an equal was no longer deserving of respect. Thus, the vicious cycle of oppression goes on and on.
Nigeria is one of Africa's largest economies; it produces around two million barrels of crude oil per day. And yet, in 2010, 61 percent of Nigerians were living in ''absolute poverty'' -- able to afford only the bare essentials of shelter, food and clothing. In one state in northern Nigeria, where extremist groups like Boko Haram originate, poverty levels that year were as high as 86.4 percent.
Economic growth will continue to bypass the majority, the gap between rich and poor will continue to widen, so long as we see ourselves as divided between somebodys and nobodys. Only when that changes will the househelps sing more cheerful tunes.

HEADLINE: California Schools Finance Upgrades By Making the Next Generation Pay

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- School officials in Santa Ana were in a bind several years ago: they wanted to build hundreds of new classrooms, but feared that voters would rebel against tax increases to pay for the construction.
So in 2009, the Santa Ana Unified School District borrowed $35 million using an inventive if increasingly controversial method known as capital appreciation bonds, which pushed the cost of the construction on to future taxpayers. Not a cent is owed until 2026. But taxpayers will eventually have to pay $340 million to retire that $35 million debt.
Since 2007, hundreds of school districts and community colleges across California have used capital appreciation bonds to raise nearly $7 billion for various construction projects, according to data from the state treasurer's office. The bonds have allowed school districts that are short on cash to finance classroom renovations and new athletic facilities while delaying payment for years, or even decades. 
But these new facilities often come at an enormous cost to future taxpayers, who will be liable for huge interest payments that sometimes balloon to more than 10 times the amount borrowed over as much as 40 years. By contrast, repayment on traditional school bonds usually costs no more than two to three times what was borrowed.
''It's the school district version of printing money,'' said Bill Lockyer, the state treasurer. ''These bonds are bad deals for taxpayers, and they contribute to the general view that the government doesn't spend their money intelligently.''
In San Diego, property owners owe $630 million on a $164 million bond. For the Folsom Cordova Unified School District, a $514,000 bond will cost $9.1 million.
And in the most expensive case yet, the Poway Unified School District borrowed $105 million to finish modernizing older school buildings, which local property owners will be paying off until four decades from now at an eventual cost of nearly $1 billion. Because payments on the bond do not start for 20 years, current school board members faced little risk of resistance from property owners.
Still, residents and elected officials have expressed growing outrage at the bonds since news of the Poway deal was reported.
A bill making its way through the State Assembly would cap the maturity of the bonds at no more than 25 years and the total debt at no more than four times the amount borrowed.
''Right now, if they don't have the revenue, school boards can say, Let's just kick the can down the road 20 years and let them deal with it,'' said Assemblyman Ben Hueso, a Democrat from San Diego who co-sponsored the bill.
Capital appreciation bonds have become especially popular in California and Texas, according to Fitch Ratings, which evaluates risks for bond investors.
Some states -- including, until recently, California -- have strict laws to curb use of these bonds. Michigan has barred school districts in the state from selling capital appreciation bonds at all.
But in 2009, as the housing market crash drove down tax revenues for schools and state education financing was cut, California lifted its requirement that long-term bonds be paid off at approximately the same rate each year, opening the door for bonds that delay payments for 20 years.
Tom Duffy, a former superintendent of the Moorpark Unified School District who now works as a lobbyist for the Coalition for Adequate School Housing, said long-term capital appreciation bonds offered school districts needed flexibility. He criticized efforts to limit them again.
''California school districts have a very limited number of tools available to them when it comes to financing public infrastructure,'' he said.
The bonds let school districts embark on costly school renovations with minimal immediate pain for property tax payers.
A bond measure that Santa Ana voters approved in 2008, which authorized the district to borrow $200 million, has financed the replacement of hundreds of temporary classrooms with new, permanent ones. More than 800 existing classrooms have been renovated.
District officials had pledged to complete all those projects without raising property taxes further. To keep those promises, they had to turn to long-term bonds, said Michael Bishop, an associate superintendent for the Santa Ana school district.
Although the 2009 capital appreciation bond brought in only 17 percent of the $200 million authorized by the 2008 bond measure, it accounts for more than half of the total debt the district incurred. As a result, more than half the cost of all the projects will fall on the shoulders of taxpayers decades from now.
In addition, if property values do not continue to rise in the intervening years, as district officials are anticipating, future school board members may have to raise taxes to pay for 30-year-old classrooms.
Still, Mr. Bishop said, the incentives to build as soon as possible included low construction costs in 2009 and the promise of millions of dollars in matching money from the state that would otherwise have gone to other school districts. And future taxpayers, he said, will also benefit from the new classrooms.
''We are not financing a computer over 30 or 40 years,'' he said. ''We are financing buildings that will probably be operating a good 50 to 60 years after that bond was issued.''
As Mr. Lockyer sees it, the only people these deals benefit are the financial advisers, who have collected millions of dollars helping school districts sell capital appreciation bonds, according to the treasurer's office.
Many voters -- and even some school board members -- said they did not realize when they supported the bond measures that they would be signing up for huge debts that local homeowners would still be paying off 40 years from now.
''If you asked the average voter,'' said Assemblywoman Joan Buchanan of Alamo, a co-sponsor of the Assembly bill, ''I think they would have no idea what a capital appreciation bond is.''

HEADLINE: Portrait of Newton, Hold the Gravity

 BODY:
Lucas Hnath didn't plan a career as a playwright. He arrived at New York University determined to pursue a pre-med degree in 1997. But then he saw ''Benita Canova'' by the avant-garde director Richard Foreman. ''After that I decided I had to transfer into dramatic writing because I wanted to make things like that,'' he said.
Raised in Orlando, Fla., Mr. Hnath, (pronounced nayth) 33, grew up enraptured by the theatricality of Disney World and the evangelical church he attended. But New York called to him. ''I like a lot of stimulation, a lot of noise,'' he said. After earning a dramatic writing M.F.A. at 21, Mr. Hnath remained in New York, laboring as a writing instructor, a literary manager and working with law students on unemployment insurance cases, ''which actually ended up being really, really great story training,'' he said. 
All that time he kept writing, rehearsing shows with friends and ''literally making props from stuff I found in the dollar store.'' A decade or so on, he seems poised to break out Off Broadway. Ensemble Studio Theater is presenting ''Isaac's Eye'' (through Feb. 24), his comedy about one of Isaac Newton's more outré explorations: jamming a needle into his own tear duct. And on April 30 Soho Rep's artistic director, Sarah Benson, will be at the helm of Mr. Hnath's experimental script, ''A Public Reading of an Unproduced Screenplay About the Death of Walt Disney.''
On a break from ''Isaac's Eye'' rehearsals Mr. Hnath, looking cheerful if slightly bleary-eyed and clutching an enormous container of coffee, spoke to Alexis Soloski about backyard theme parks and the surprising usefulness of long hair. These are excerpts from the conversation.
Q. What tempted you to write a comedy about Isaac Newton? Was he a funny guy?
A. I didn't set out to write a funny play about him, it just inevitably happened. Newton was by many accounts very difficult to get along with, a curmudgeon. Towards the end of his life he was heading up the mint, and he really prided himself on how many counterfeiters he had executed. In some ways he was kind of a deeply unpleasant person, which I find funny.
Were you a theme park addict in Orlando?
Yeah. I had a pretty big backyard, and I was always trying to build theme park rides -- a wagon on a rope, holes I'd dug up and filled with water, pieces of wood on pulleys.
You often write about real figures. How much research do you do?
I'm in many ways a sloppy researcher. I'll start reading things, but I won't finish anything. I want to start writing before I know too much about the truth. And then there comes this point late in the process where I'll think I'm making something up, but I'll go back and do my research and I'll realize, ''Wait a minute, that really did happen.'' I hope the messier research process leads to work that doesn't feel researched, but more organic and less like a book report.
You have scripts about Anna Nicole Smith, Street Fighter II, Godard films, classic Japanese Noh plays. How do you navigate between high art and pop culture?
I guess the trick is I don't navigate. But there is a kind of blending of high and low culture. A lot of the Disney play story is cribbed from ''King Lear.''
The Humana Festival asked you to write a play about sleep science. Do you sleep well yourself?
During the process of writing that play [''Nightnight''] I actually became a better sleeper. I can sleep through pretty much anything. I slept through lightning hitting my house when I was a kid and the firefighters coming in and evacuating, and I don't remember any of it.
You have exceptionally good hair for a playwright. Is there any Samsonesque relationship between your hair and your creativity?
Hair can be very useful if you're in the audition room and need to hide your reaction. So I grew my hair out. Like Newton, unfortunately, I am starting to get gray hair. He started to gray in his 20s. So did I.

HEADLINE: In Address, President Will Lay Out Agenda Focused on the Middle Class

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Tuesday will seek to move beyond the politics of the moment to define a second-term agenda built around restoring economic prosperity to the middle class, using his State of the Union address to unveil initiatives in education, infrastructure, clean energy and manufacturing.
Having secured four more years in the White House by arguing that the nation's economy is tilted against ordinary Americans, Mr. Obama will vow to use the power of his office to recapture robust job growth and economic expansion, according to White House officials who have seen the speech. Both eluded him during his first term.
Mr. Obama will insist that only ''a thriving middle class'' can stimulate long-term growth and that Americans must be given the tools to succeed, according to the officials, who discussed the speech on the condition of anonymity. His call for new government investments -- many of which Republicans successfully blocked in his first term -- is an effort to shift the emphasis away from simply reducing the deficit and will serve in part as an answer to Republican criticism that he has not focused enough on jobs. 
''I think you will hear him talk about some new proposals that build on his earlier efforts to help middle-class Americans,'' said Nancy-Ann DeParle, who until recently was Mr. Obama's deputy chief of staff. ''I think his message will be -- as he is -- very positive and optimistic: 'We're strong, and we're moving in the right direction. The economy is improving, but we have more work to do to ensure that all Americans can take advantage of a stronger economy.' ''
White House aides declined to describe the initiatives in the four subject areas, and said there would be other proposals in the address as well. But the officials familiar with the speech said that any proposed spending would be offset by new savings or revenues to avoid adding to annual budget deficits.
The president is structuring his fifth annual address to a joint session of Congress around three main economic points: making the nation a ''magnet for jobs and manufacturing''; providing Americans the ''skills they need'' for those jobs; and ensuring that ''hard work leads to a decent living,'' officials said.
Mr. Obama will try to summon the nation's support for two major initiatives that are already consuming the first weeks of his second term: the passage of stricter gun laws in the wake of the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., and an overhaul of immigration policy that would allow 11 million illegal immigrants to eventually become citizens.
He will also confront his looming clash with Congress over taxes and spending next month with a blunt warning to his Republican adversaries -- that continued fiscal brinkmanship could cause an economic slump that would be devastating to millions of Americans. He will renew his call for a ''big deal'' that would lower the deficit by cutting spending, revamping the tax code and making long-term changes to slow the growth in spending for Medicare and to stabilize Social Security.
But the main focus of the address, the officials said, will be on finding a new balance in the economy by expanding opportunities for average Americans without saddling the next generation with enormous debt.
''Our economy succeeds and our economy grows when everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is getting a fair shake and everybody is playing by the same rules,'' Mr. Obama told House Democrats at a legislative retreat last week, offering a peek at the themes he will discuss on Tuesday night.
Mr. Obama's agenda faces certain skepticism and opposition from a Republican Party that has fought for years against what it views as runaway spending, big government and overreaching regulation. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will deliver the Republican response.
Mr. Obama will not soon get a similar opportunity to shape the trajectory of his presidency. Millions of people are likely to tune in for what has become an annual ritual in which presidents set expectations for Congress, for the public and for themselves.
The address, in the House chamber, has evolved into a mix of politics, policy and pageantry, and Mr. Obama will heed modern tradition by hosting a group of Americans whose presence is intended to send a message about his priorities.
The president's speech opening his second term comes amid economic recovery, in contrast with the financial crisis that was the backdrop for his address in 2009. While housing and most other economic indicators point toward slow and steady growth, unemployment remains near 8 percent and is projected to decrease only fitfully.
Throughout his presidency, Mr. Obama has struggled to claim credit for economic successes without seeming out of touch with the millions of Americans who remain jobless and frustrated about the pace of improvement in their lives.
''One of the hardest things to get right is that one line where you describe, 'The state of our union is -- blank,' and how you fill in that blank,'' said Donald A. Baer, the chief executive of the global public relations firm Burson-Marsteller and a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton.
Last month, in his second Inaugural Address, Mr. Obama made an aggressive case for a liberal agenda that included having greater tolerance toward immigrants, advancing gay rights, preserving the social safety system and confronting climate change. The White House officials said the president viewed Tuesday's speech as a second act in the same play.
For Mr. Obama, the State of the Union address is an oversize opportunity to confront and challenge Republicans directly on issues like immigration, stricter background checks for gun buyers, marriage equality and further tax increases on the wealthy -- all issues where the public is on his side, according to polls.
On guns, Mr. Obama will renew his call for a broad package of legislation focused on reducing violence by restricting some access to firearms. He will urge Congress to ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons, put limits on high-capacity ammunition magazines, improve background checks and prevent sales of firearms to people with mental illness.
In remarks in recent weeks, the president has made it clear that he views universal background checks for gun purchases as the most likely measure to pass in a divided Congress, though aides have said that he would not back away from his support for a new assault weapons ban if it can pass.
On immigration, the president will say he intends to make good on his promise to revamp the nation's immigration system and eventually provide a pathway to citizenship for the millions of immigrants in the country illegally.
Buoyed by big support among Hispanics and Asians in his re-election, Mr. Obama is betting that Republicans are ready to join him in that effort. But as in the fight over guns, success may hinge on reaching the kinds of compromises that have proved exceedingly difficult during the past four years.
As in previous years, Mr. Obama will not spend much time in the speech focusing on foreign policy, though his administration faces numerous challenges around a complicated world: instability in the Middle East, nagging questions about Afghanistan's ability to maintain security after American troops leave, growing scrutiny of a continuing drone campaign against terrorists, threats from Iran and North Korea, and increasing global competition from China.
A year ago, as he headed into his re-election campaign, Mr. Obama opened his State of the Union address by heralding the death of Osama bin Laden and the shrinking American troop presence in Iraq and Afghanistan.
With the election behind him, Mr. Obama could return to some of the promises he made in his first term, including a vow to reduce the world's nuclear stockpiles and a pledge to work on peace between Israel and the Palestinians.

HEADLINE: The Brewer Kings of Staten Island

BYLINE: By SARAH HARRISON SMITH

 BODY:
Even before Hurricane Sandy struck, the north shore of Staten Island called out for attention and appreciation. Plans to encourage the local economy include building a 60-story Ferris wheel near the St. George Ferry Terminal and, a short walk away in Stapleton, redeveloping the old Navy Homeport site. But Stapleton remains curiously trapped in its past, with remarkable buildings and an interesting if slightly down-at-heel commercial center. 
The town was named in 1836 for William J. Staples, who laid out its streets and established ferry service to Manhattan with his partner, a son of Daniel D. Tompkins, the sixth vice president of the United States. Abundant local springs and a steep hillside perfect for ''lagering'' beer in caves attracted breweries; the largest of these was George Bechtel's, founded in 1853.
Old stables on Van Duzer Street are all that remain of the brewery, but the grand houses on St. Paul's Avenue recall the Bechtel era. The meticulously maintained Victorian at 387 St. Paul's Avenue, built in 1888 as a wedding gift for Mr. Bechtel's daughter, has not escaped notice by the ''Boardwalk Empire'' film crew. If you prefer your ladies unpainted, there are other houses nearby in a spooky, if romantic, state of dishevelment. A hike through the Serpentine Art and Nature Commons offers a clear view of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and the chance to spy hawks, owls and scaly, green serpentine rock.
The St. Paul's Avenue area was landmarked in 2004. Now the more modest houses of Harrison Street, known as the Nook, are under consideration; a vote could take place this spring. Included are the Henry Warth House at 53 Harrison Street, with a steeply pitched mansard roof and striped brickwork; the Richard G. and Susan M. Tompkins Smith House, at No. 92, built for the vice president's daughter; and two-family rental houses.
Despite empty storefronts in the heart of Stapleton, there is much to see. In Tappen Park, a picturesque town hall from 1889 has a European gabled roof. Overlooking it, a 1907 Carrère & Hastings library will reopen midyear with an airy, 7,000-square-foot addition. And at 81 Water Street sits Delano & Aldrich's Staten Island Savings Bank, a remarkably elegant triangle of a building. Its rotunda-like entrance faces the shore; its side walls flaunt dolphin-shaped sconces and, carved in limestone, fraying ropes and scallop shells.
Stapleton's diverse population includes younger, arty people drawn to the area by low rents and the proximity of the ferry. But there are few places to gather: on one afternoon, the closest thing to a scene was the group of older men sitting companionably among the secondhand treasures at Ira's Curiosity Place. Crowded with well-loved dolls, Victrolas and stained glass windows from an old synagogue, the shop attests to Stapleton's lively history; all it -- and the town -- lacks are visitors.

HEADLINE: The Dice Are Rolling On Dell's Legacy

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
IN 1984 -- the year Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook creator, was born -- Michael S. Dell started a tech company in his dorm room, dropped out of college and changed the world.
By making personal computers that were powerful, reliable and inexpensive, and by selling directly to buyers who customized their PC features, Mr. Dell revolutionized his industry.
''The original PC industry was long on people with great technical ideas but short on people who were able to turn those ideas into opportunities -- into products that people really wanted,'' said Timothy Bresnahan, a Stanford economist. Along with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, as well as Scott Cook of Intuit, Mr. Dell was one of those few great innovators, he said. ''These people are very rare.'' 
Mr. Dell's early achievements were formidable, but unless his latest effort to turn around his company is successful, the Dell legacy today is very much in doubt. Last week, along with Silver Lake Partners, a private equity firm, he made a $24.4 billion buyout offer for his company -- an apparent bet that, without the scrutiny of public shareholders, he can get Dell back on track.
Dell, the company, has been losing ground for years as the industry it once dominated has undergone upheavals that its founder failed to foresee. ''The very nature of technology is that it changes a lot,'' said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''And Michael has conceded publicly that he has missed some big changes -- he failed to foresee smartphones or tablets -- and both of these shifts have been highly detrimental to the PC world.''
He has lagged in a crucial area of corporate strategy as well, said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Sterne Agee in San Francisco. While Mr. Dell has always been attuned to the needs of corporate clients, he is 20 years behind I.B.M. in embracing a strategic shift to enterprise software and services, Mr. Wu said: ''That's a higher-margin business that Dell would like to go after, but I.B.M. and others have got tremendous leads. It will be very difficult for him to catch up.''
If Dell shareholders accept an offer price of $13.65 a share, Mr. Dell, who is contributing his stake of more than 14 percent in the company plus hundreds of millions more, would end up with more than 50 percent of the new company's equity, Mr. Sacconaghi estimated. Mr. Dell, who declined to comment for this article, would control the company without being subject to the day-to-day pressures of the stock market, which has pummeled Dell shares because its earnings have weakened.
While Dell reports that 50 percent of its revenue is directly related to PCs, Mr. Wu says the figure is 70 to 80 percent when indirect revenue, like that for computer monitors, printers and services, is included. ''The company has made big investments in other areas, but it's still mainly a PC company,'' he said.
That's a big problem for several reasons. Once considered the low-cost provider in the field, Dell now faces lean Asian competitors like Lenovo, Asus and Acer that make PCs more cheaply and accept lower profit margins. Yet these companies, particularly Lenovo, have also garnered praise for making excellent computers, not merely well-priced ones. At the same time, Dell's vaunted reputation for quality and service has waned.
Lenovo, which makes the ThinkPad line of notebook computers formerly sold by I.B.M., ''has been picking up corporate customers from Dell,'' Mr. Wu said.
THEN there is a deeper issue: the entire PC industry is stagnant at best. Worldwide PC shipments declined 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter, versus the year-earlier period, according to Gartner, a market research firm. Consumer preferences are shifting. With the ubiquity of smartphones and tablets -- segments where Dell is absent or very weak -- consumers aren't replacing PCs as often.
''We don't expect people to abandon PCs, but they won't rely on them as much in the future,'' said Mikako Kitagawa, a Gartner analyst. Dell's share of this no-growth market has been shrinking, to 10.2 percent worldwide in the fourth quarter of 2012, from 12.2 percent the previous year, Gartner said.
Facing such headwinds, Mr. Sacconaghi said, Dell hopes to ''hold PC profits flat or, worst case, down 5 percent a year, while they grow the rest of the business to more than offset that.'' But the market is skeptical. Dell's shares fell 30 percent in the 12 months before Jan. 14, when reports of an imminent buyout appeared.
The leveraged buyout will layer $15 billion of new debt on the company. Microsoft, with which Dell has had close ties, is providing $2 billion. Because interest rates are extraordinarily low, servicing all that debt should be manageable, assuming that Dell maintains its current cash flow, Mr. Sacconaghi said.
It's not clear how much the debt load will constrain Dell's investments in research and development. Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor, said a study for which he was a co-author found that after leveraged buyouts, most companies maintained their ability to innovate, largely by focusing research in ''their core competencies.''
In other words, he said, ''Dell might be able to prosper after a buyout; it would depend on how Michael Dell manages the company.''
Is the price being offered for the company fair? It's often unwise to bet against company insiders, especially founders like Mr. Dell, who may be presumed to know their companies' value better than outside investors.
Consider John W. Kluge, who took Metromedia private in 1984 in a $1.1 billion leveraged buyout. Mr. Kluge, Metromedia's founder, promptly liquidated it, selling television stations (to Rupert Murdoch) and sundry assets like the Harlem Globetrotters and the Ice Capades. In the end, Mr. Kluge tripled his take -- to the chagrin of many former shareholders.
Mr. Kluge, who died in 2010, wasn't interested in preserving his company or revolutionizing an industry, however. He merely wanted to make money. ''When we buy an asset, we look at it as a return on the investment,'' he said in 1980.
For Mr. Dell, whose name is on the door, other factors may be in play. ''Another chapter is still to be written,'' Mr. Bresnahan said. Money will be part of it. So will the Dell legacy.

HEADLINE: India in the Slow Lane

 BODY:
India's economy is about to clock its slowest annual growth rate in a decade. The government said recently that gross domestic product would likely grow at just 5 percent in the fiscal year that ends in March, a sharp fall from the 9-plus-percent growth rates of the mid-2000s. 
This slowdown should alarm the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has been far too timid in addressing the country's economic challenges. It will be particularly devastating for the hundreds of millions of Indians who are struggling to lift themselves out of poverty; this growth rate means that the country's per-capita income is growing at just 2.9 percent a year.
This weakness should also worry the rest of the world, which increasingly needs India to play a bigger role in the global economy. While India has been hurt by the economic troubles of Europe and the United States, its current problems are largely attributable to the passivity of Mr. Singh and Sonia Gandhi, the leader of the Indian National Congress Party, who put him in the job.
Under their leadership, the economy remains hobbled by widespread corruption, counterproductive regulations, weak infrastructure, and government ownership of most banks and many major corporations. As finance minister 20 years ago, Mr. Singh played an important role in freeing some areas of the economy from a stifling ''license raj,'' in which businesses were required to get government approval to set up shop and even to change production levels. But as prime minister he has done little to follow up on those important early reforms.
The finance minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, appears to realize the urgent need to shore up the economy. In recent months, at his prodding, the government has begun making changes -- for example, distributing subsidies like scholarships and pensions directly to citizens instead of channeling them through corrupt bureaucracies.
Still, one finance minister cannot turn India around. It will require Mr. Singh and Ms. Gandhi to push for legislative and administrative changes to build roads and rail lines, add capacity to backlogged courts, improve primary education and bring transparency to the corrupt way in which political parties are financed.
The money to pay for needed improvements could come from privatizing inefficient state-owned companies and banks. It will be difficult to sell these reforms to Indian political leaders, many of whom are ideologically opposed to the free market or benefit from the dysfunction, but that should not stop the duo from pushing them.
India will hold elections next year, and many analysts are already speculating that the Indian National Congress Party could suffer a big defeat because of corruption scandals and its poor record of governance. The party further tarnished its image recently by reacting callously to the brutal rape of a 23-year-old New Delhi student and ordering the police to attack protesters demanding justice. Ms. Gandhi now needs to devote her full attention to reviving India's economy.

HEADLINE: Sierra Club Taking Aim at East Texas Coal Plants

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
FAIRFIELD -- Staring across a lake at the oldest coal-fired power plant in Texas, Mayor Roy W. Hill thinks back to the early 1970s, when his father helped bring the plant to the area.
''Quite honestly, this plant saved Fairfield,'' Mr. Hill said. Should it close, he said, the economic impact would be ''catastrophic.''
But closing Big Brown, as it is known, and two other 1970s-era coal plants in East Texas has emerged as a top goal of the Sierra Club. The group is escalating a campaign against the plants' corporate owner, Dallas-based Energy Future Holdings, whose subsidiaries include the state's largest power generation company. Coal combustion produces mercury and other pollutants, and environmentalists say that the old plants are especially harmful to the climate and to Texans' health.
''We can't fix the climate problem in the United States unless we fix what's happening'' at Energy Future Holdings, said Al Armendariz, who is leading the Sierra Club's anti-coal effort in Texas. E.F.H., the club says, operates some of the nation's dirtiest coal plants. 
The company says that its plants meet environmental requirements and provide round-the-clock power needed by the growing state. (Energy Future Holdings is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)
The campaign is ''misguided in that it's not based in reality, and it lacks facts,'' said Mac McFarland, the chief executive of Luminant, the company's power-generation arm. He said that E.F.H. meets or exceeds every environmental regulation, at both the federal and state levels, and that the coal plants will keep running.
Tensions had already existed between Luminant and Mr. Armendariz, who was appointed by President Obama in 2009 to head the regional office of the Environmental Protection Agency in Dallas. Mr. Armendariz resigned last spring after a video containing controversial comments about his enforcement philosophy surfaced. During his tenure, he and Mr. McFarland had met once.
Coal accounts for 70 percent of the energy produced by Luminant. A majority of the power produced at the East Texas coal plants targeted by the Sierra Club -- Big Brown in Freestone County, Martin Lake in Rusk County and Monticello in Titus County -- comes from lignite, a relatively dirty type of coal mined near the plants. (The club is also targeting an older unit of another Luminant plant in Milam County.)
The Sierra Club has two coal-related lawsuits pending against the company and has issued two more notices of intent to sue. Last July, the E.P.A. sent Luminant a notice saying that the company had violated the Clean Air Act at its Big Brown and Martin Lake plants.
Now, the Sierra Club is using mailings, phone calls and door-to-door advocacy, and it plans to take its concerns about E.F.H. to residents and policy makers in Dallas, which is downwind from the plants. The group says it will highlight the plants' emissions and contributions to ozone and climate change.
The old Luminant plants account for zero to 2 percent of Dallas' ozone, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Mr. Armendariz says closing the plants would help Dallas work toward compliance with federal ozone standards.
The club aims to persuade Dallas residents to switch from TXU Energy, another E.F.H. company that sells power to homes and businesses. Last week the Sierra Club started a Web site, www.beyondtxu.org, and a Facebook campaign. The goal is to hurt the revenues of Energy Future Holdings, which carries huge debts and lost $407 million in the third quarter of 2012. In December, the ratings agency Standard & Poor's predicted that E.F.H. ''will face a sharp liquidity decline in 2014.''
Michael Patterson, TXU Energy's director of communications, said that his company offers numerous energy-efficient and renewable initiatives in its power-service plans. ''It's almost ironic that they're targeting us as a retailer, because we're doing more than anyone'' to encourage customers to save energy, he said.
Sierra Club officials would not disclose how much they planned to spend on the Texas effort. But it will draw from a $50 million donation made in 2011 by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York to the group's national Beyond Coal campaign, according to Bruce Nilles, the operation's San Francisco-based senior director.
''Without a doubt, this is one of the top two or three most important campaigns we have,'' Mr. Nilles said.
Other environmental groups, like Public Citizen and the SEED Coalition, are helping the Sierra Club.
The tension between environmentalists and Energy Future Holdings goes back years. In 2007, private equity investors executed the nation's largest leveraged buyout, a $45 billion acquisition of TXU, a giant Texas utility, and broke it into Luminant, TXU Energy and Oncor, which is a power-line utility.
Initially, E.F.H. sought to build 11 new coal plants in Texas. Amid environmentalists' opposition, most got canceled. Texas currently has 19 coal plants.
A study by the Environmental Integrity Project, a green group, found that four of the top five mercury-emitting power plants in the United States belonged to Luminant in 2011. Mercury is a toxin that can harm the brain.
Some residents are alarmed by the pollution. ''I'm worried about my grandkids,'' said Helen Pickett, who lives within 20 miles of Big Brown. She said she hoped the plant would close but would be sorry about local job losses.
Luminant said that it spent $270 million last year for environmental controls across its fleet of power plants to comply with recently established federal mercury standards and other E.P.A. regulations, and that it planned to spend another $500 million from 2013 to 2017.
''Look, if the E.P.A., the T.C.E.Q. set the rules, set the speed limit at 70, we're going 55, and they want us to go zero,'' Mr. McFarland said of environmentalists. ''The standard isn't zero.''
But environmentalists worry that Luminant lacks the money for upgrades, a notion Mr. McFarland rejects. Big Brown lacks a sulfur-dioxide scrubber, a common but expensive cleaning technology. Luminant says that it blends lignite with low-sulfur coal at Big Brown, and that it has cut sulfur dioxide emissions across its power plants by 20 percent since 2005.
Without Luminant's old coal plants, Texas' power grid would reel. The coal facilities the Sierra Club is targeting account for nearly 8 percent of the state's power capacity, and even Mr. Armendariz says he recognizes that ''we can't shut these plants down tomorrow.'' But the club would like the plants gone by 2018, replaced with renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. Mr. McFarland says that goal is unrealistic.
Coal power is already flailing in Texas and nationwide, as cheap natural gas undercuts the coal plants' competitiveness. The proportion of coal energy on the Texas grid fell to 34 percent last year from 39 percent in 2011. Two of three units at Luminant's Monticello plant are shuttered until June because of low power prices.
Future federal rules could affect such plants. The E.P.A. this year may designate new restrictions on sulfur dioxide emissions. More greenhouse gas regulations may be coming, and a rule aimed at reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions across state lines may be reissued. (Luminant fought an earlier version of the cross-state rule, which a federal court threw out last year.)
''I think there are people in the environmental community who are going to retire,'' Mr. Armendariz said, ''when we finally win this fight.''

HEADLINE: Perry Swoops Down on California Business, and Jerry Brown Is Not Impressed

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
What could be more fun than a throwdown between Governor Goodhair and Governor Moonbeam?
Rick Perry is on a four-day ''business recruitment trip'' to California, escalating his raids on Jerry Brown's economy and getting enough attention to, maybe, get some businesses to think about moving. With new taxes that were imposed by California and Congress at the end of 2012, Californians -- including decision-making executives -- are among those who pay the highest taxes in the country.
Mr. Perry recently spent a pittance -- $24,000 for a radio advertisement in a state like California has a smaller audience than a tweet from Paris Hilton -- to tweak Mr. Brown's nose on jobs. 
In the ad, Mr. Perry talks about how easy it is to do business in Texas, suggesting the job-makers on the West Coast would have a better time if they would simply moved here.
That's nothing more than air support for a news release. And it worked. Mr. Perry's proposition quickly became a big story, eclipsing that teensy radio play. Mr. Brown took the bait, scolding reporters in his home state for pestering him about something so insignificant.
It is a lovely thing when two avatars of politics slug it out in public. The little radio advertisement has so far become a weeklong conversation about the relative virtues of the nation's two biggest states.
In other words, Mr. Perry got just what he wanted. The first part of persuading someone to move is getting them to consider that idea.
Behind the ads and the commentary is a serious competition between the states for economic pre-eminence. In that corner, Athens. In this one, Sparta. Each serves as the other's foil, the Ali to its Frazier, the Moriarty to its Holmes, the red to its blue. Each sees itself as the economic, cultural and political engine of the future.
Over the past decade, Texas has been knocking the feathers out of the competition, adding jobs faster than any other state. That's one of Mr. Perry's brags, and it would have been a centerpiece of his 2012 presidential campaign, had he kept that effort alive long enough to need a centerpiece.
Not from Texas? Here's one argument heard lately in California: Mr. Perry and Texas didn't create all those jobs. They stole them. When Countrywide Financial (may it rest in peace) moved to Texas from California in 2004, Texas threw $20 million at the company, which in turn promised 7,500 jobs. Even the rosiest spin on that deal failed to add up to the number of jobs in the universe. It just relocated them.
You can put all of the eggs under one chicken, but that does not make that chicken the best egg-layer in the coop. On the other hand, it does make that chicken the one with the most eggs.
The governor versus governor and state versus state competition is a king of the hill thing, with winners and losers. For a national candidate, it is a harder sale to make, because a president gets blame or credit for the overall picture and not just for health in one precinct of the country. Both governors have been national candidates; Mr. Perry hasn't ruled out being a national candidate again.
Maybe he just wants to make friends. If you had both states in the bag, you'd be the next president. It would be highly unlikely that a candidate could take Texas and California and lose.
But at the moment, it is highly unlikely that anyone could get them into the same camp. New friends or not, Mr. Perry would find the same stiff political headwind in California that Democrats face in Texas.
In his speeches, the Texas governor says other states -- he doesn't mention the big rival here -- have been ''trying to beat us at our own game'' by, among other things, ''aggressively courting major employers.''
Texas' low taxes and regulations are in there, too -- that's Mr. Perry's stock in trade. ''We led the nation out of recession and into recovery, and remain the nation's prime destination for employers and job-seekers alike,'' he told lawmakers last month.
The Californian is good at this economic development thing, too. The state's finances are getting better, and the economy there is improving more quickly than the national average. And he has a different audience, too.
Texans might be rooting for Mr. Perry's marauding out West. Californians have to be cheering Mr. Brown's unwelcoming response.

HEADLINE: Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor And Your Economists, Too

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard. He was an adviser to President George W. Bush.

 BODY:
ALL the recent talk in Washington about reforming immigration policy brings to mind Pat Paulsen, the comedian who, every four years, conducted faux campaigns for president.
''All the problems we face in the United States today,'' Mr. Paulsen would say, ''can be traced to an unenlightened immigration policy on the part of the American Indian.''
That quip contains a deep truth. Almost all Americans today are beneficiaries of a policy that welcomed our ancestors when they arrived at the border. 
As an economist, I am often surprised at the hostility that some segments of the population express toward immigration. Most members of my profession are far more receptive to it, and for three main reasons.
First, many economists, especially conservative ones, have a libertarian streak. Ever since Adam Smith taught us about the wonders of free markets and the magic of the invisible hand, we have been loath to prohibit mutually advantageous trades between consenting adults. If an American farmer wants to hire a worker to pick fruits and vegetables, the fact that the worker happens to have been born in Mexico does not seem a compelling reason to stop the transaction.
Second, many economists, especially liberal ones, have an egalitarian streak. They follow the philosopher John Rawls's theory of justice in believing that policy should be particularly attuned to its impact on the least fortunate. When thinking about immigration, there is little doubt that the least fortunate, and the ones with the most at stake in the outcome, are the poor workers who yearn to come to the United States to make a better life for themselves and their families.
Third, economists of all stripes recognize that our own profession has benefited greatly from an influx of talent from abroad. In just the last few weeks, the economics department at Harvard, where I am chairman, has brought in six candidates to be considered for two assistant professor positions. Of the six, three are Americans, one is German, one is Argentine, and one is a New Zealander. The jobs will be offered to those deemed to have most promise as teachers and scholars, regardless of nationality.
The competition from foreign-born economists makes it harder for American economists to get the best positions. But it would be hypocritical for American economists to argue against such competition, as we have long preached that nations are better off over all when they pursue a policy of free and open trade. This principle applies not only to manufactured goods like textiles and aircraft but also to labor services, including lectures on economics.
The system of higher education in the United States is the world's best in large part because it has long taken a global approach to hiring. The best students from abroad often come to the United States to earn their Ph.D.'s, and the best of these often stay here and join the faculties of American institutions. In my own department at Harvard, we have professors who were born in Canada, England, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Poland, India and South Africa.
THIS competition from abroad may reduce the salaries of American-born economists like me, but it has improved the university, much to our students' benefit. For one thing, such competition keeps down the university's labor costs. Many parents are shocked at how high college tuition is, but it could be worse.
The willingness of universities to tap foreign talent also means that our students can learn from the worlds' best minds. America's superb system of higher education has been an engine of growth for the entire economy, thanks in part to the immigration of scholars from abroad.
I understand that not all workers in the United States will embrace foreign-born competitors with the same equanimity as a Harvard professor. That is especially true of those with fewer skills and opportunities.
Over the last several decades, for the most part, the wages of workers without any higher education have stagnated, while the wages of those with advanced degrees have risen. The main forces driving these trends are technological change, which tends to increase the demand for skilled workers relative to unskilled workers, and, to a lesser extent, international trade. But the immigration of unskilled workers from abroad may be a contributing factor, and one that is all too obvious when these immigrants vie for the same jobs as unskilled workers born in the United States.
The best solution to wage stagnation is to promote educational attainment among Americans. That's easier said than done, but the task is imperative nonetheless. We won't substantially help unskilled workers who are already here by denying the American dream to others who wish to pursue it.
In the end, even as an economist committed to rational policy analysis, I have to acknowledge that the immigration debate also has a visceral, emotional element. In my case, that is shaped by family history.
I am the grandson of four immigrants from Ukraine, who arrived in the United States about a century ago. None of them had more than a fourth-grade education, and none could speak English when they set foot on their new homeland. Yet they found work, made a living and raised families. They lived modest lives, but their children did better than they did, and their grandchildren did better still.
Lucky for me, the American Indian did not pursue the enlightened immigration policy suggested by Mr. Paulsen.

HEADLINE: Fate of the Earth Takes Center Stage

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
Where is the great American play about climate change? Is there even a good one?
Say what you will about the potential end of civilization as we know it, but there's no denying it is dramatic stuff. That's why it's odd that as climate change finally moves forward in the national conversation, with President Obama making it a centerpiece of his inauguration speech, New York theater has mostly avoided it.
Short works and the recent Off Broadway play ''If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet'' have touched on the issue, but no drama exploring what many believe is the fundamental challenge of our time has made a significant impression. Steve Cosson, the artistic director of the Civilians -- a theater company whose drama ''The Great Immensity'' is preoccupied with what it would take to transform public consciousness about climate change -- puts it bluntly: ''On a cultural level, we are behind.'' 
That may start to change with ''This Clement World,'' an ambitious new work now at St. Ann's Warehouse by the writer-performer Cynthia Hopkins, who filters the complexity of the science through her charmingly eccentric aesthetic. (After a run in Kansas City and some further development, ''Great Immensity'' will have a New York staging in 2014.)
''It's difficult to find a personal connection because we're not feeling the full effects now,'' Ms. Hopkins explained in a recent interview. ''We have to act on behalf of people who aren't born yet. To grasp that dramatically requires imagination.''
Alison Carey, a writer who last month posted online a play called ''Tonight's Fire,'' presents the challenge this way in an e-mail: ''How do you write about change on this scale -- across time, across the globe -- when the major players are atmospheric forces rather than individuals?''
Ms. Hopkins's solution is to ruthlessly exploit the freedom of nonrealistic theater. Creating a work of dizzying scope, she zips through space and time, plays a multitude of characters, and uses video and song. Early in ''This Clement World'' (the title comes from Carl Sagan's book ''Cosmos''), as an alien she delivers a history of the world that includes the creation of the sun and the death of the dinosaurs. Ms. Hopkins also plays the ghost of an American Indian issuing a warning to those who think their way of life will never be under threat. These monologues make the implicit and sometimes explicit argument that our currently hospitable world is much more fragile than it appears.
''Sure, it's chilly,'' Ms. Hopkins said, gesturing to the snow outside a Park Slope coffee shop. ''But generally living on this earth, it's pretty awesome. It's hard to imagine that it won't always be the case. With the Native American character, here's a way of life that existed and now does not.''
Ms. Hopkins was inspired to write ''This Clement World'' by a speech at a 2009 conference on climate change at the Columbia University Earth Institute. Jeffrey Sachs, the economics professor who is the director of the institute, talked about how artists could help with the widespread miscommunication about this issue in a way that politicians and journalists could not. ''I realized,'' Ms. Hopkins said from watching him, ''that I could use my bizarre skill set for something vital.''
Two months later, she went on an exhibition to the Arctic, sponsored by Cape Farewell, a British organization that fosters communication on climate change between artists and scientists. This trip became a backbone of her show, which includes Ms. Hopkins's playing many of the scientists, including a German physicist she encountered who argued unexpectedly that there is some beauty in the end of the human species.
For an artist who often makes quirky, introspective work (the death of her mother inspired ''The Accidental Trilogy''), the new play represents a departure. While still very personal and filled with showmanship, it aims to raise awareness and to persuade an audience of the severity of the crisis. It has an activist streak, but it's worn very lightly.
She still tells a personal story, including her struggle with alcoholism, but it's as a prism to understand and clarify a political issue. ''Alcoholism is an excellent metaphor for the climate change crisis,'' she announces at one point onstage. ''We're addicted to behavior that is making us sick.''
For a short 2008 festival in New York, ''Climate of Concern,'' the journalist and professor Lawrence Weschler commissioned nine short plays on climate change from writers like Jon Robin Baitz, Sarah Ruhl and Don DeLillo, with the hopes that they would be mounted by other theaters. So far, only one has been produced. Mr. DeLillo's post-apocalyptic ''The Word for Snow'' had a run last year in London where it has lately been joined by several other plays on the issue.
Richard Bean, the author of ''One Man, Two Guvnors,'' even wrote a comedy, ''The Heretic'' that poked fun at the scientific consensus on the issue. More recently, the Royal Court presented ''Ten Billion'' a fact-filled lecture with projections delivered by the Cambridge scientist Stephen Emmott that The Guardian critic Michael Billington called ''one of the most disturbing evenings I have ever spent in a theater.''
In Nick Payne's ''If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet,'' a professor's obsession with the disastrous impact of climate change blinds him to the looming catastrophe in his own family. The play's most polemical element might be its design, which in the recent Roundabout Theater Company production featured rising water levels actually washing away parts of the set.
Mr. Cosson of the Civilians chalked up the cluster of plays in Britain to that nation's tradition of political theater as well as greater public financing for the arts. But in America, he said, ''Our theater tends to be more risk-averse because it depends on keeping their audience and supporters happy.'' And it's not just climate change that isn't an easy sell, he noted: ''After a few war plays the message from theaters about Iraq is that we've had as much as our audience wants.''
Still, both ''Great Immensity'' and ''This Clement World'' have enjoyed significant outside support, with the Civilians piece receiving a rare and unusually large $700,000 arts grant from the National Science Foundation.
Unlike the kind of documentary theater the Civilians are known for, ''Great Immensity'' is fictional, packaging a story about the radical measures required to save the environment in a mystery plot about a woman trying to find her missing sister. The play paints a grim contemporary portrait while trying to grapple with the potential for change.
Indeed, while a bleak disaster plot has its dramatic appeal, it can also numb its audience. Al Gore's Oscar-winning documentary, ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' is so far the most successful popular entertainment on the topic, though its suggestions for change were modest. ''This subject really sorts out the pessimists from the optimists,'' said Ruth Little, an administrator with Cape Farewell, which plans to continue to sponsor expeditions as well as give grants to artists.
''It's a tricky thing,'' Ms. Hopkins said. ''I think a big part of the skepticism is because it's so terrifying that it's easily overwhelming and paralyzing. The challenge is to communicate that there's also hope and agency.''

Exploding Words, Exploding Time
Velcro, dear theatergoers, to the word-fracturing, time-splintering world of David Ives. And Harvard U? Oh, you don't speak Unamunda? All right then: ''Velcro'' means ''Welcome'' and ''Harvard U,'' how are you of course. Unamunda, which is practiced in one of the short plays that make up Mr. Ives's ''All in the Timing'' is the creation of a two-bit huckster, but that doesn't mean it's that different from any other language.
One of the points of this anthology of comic sketches from the early 1990s, which opens on Tuesday in a Primary Stages production at 59E59 Theaters, is that language, like time and space, is utterly, confoundingly relative. That means that communication is a desperate, random and -- as Mr. Ives presents it -- exceedingly funny proposition. This 20th-anniversary revival, directed by John Rando, reintroduces New Yorkers to Mr. Ives's mind-bending riffs on cultural and intellectual touchstones like Einstein, Trotsky, Philip Glass and those immortal monkeys with typewriters. (Opens Tuesday, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, 212-279-4200, primarystages.org, $70.) BEN BRANTLEY
A Jazz Queen, Joined by Friends 
Any number of jazz singers today can transfix a small room; an elite few can effortlessly conquer a concert stage. Dianne Reeves is the rare exception who seems to accomplish both feats at once, powering through whatever song is at hand with a bearing both relatable and regal. She's an heir to Sarah Vaughan, but not an imitator, and she makes a virtue of her open-mindedness, mingling songbook standards with bossa nova staples and original pop-gospel exhortations.
For her concert at Carnegie Hall on Saturday, billed as ''Dianne Reeves and Friends,'' she'll be joined by her cousin and longtime producer, the pianist George Duke; several guest vocalists, notably Lalah Hathaway and Esperanza Spalding; and the drummer Terri Lyne Carrington, who featured Ms. Reeves and Ms. Spalding on ''The Mosaic Project,'' which won a 2012 Grammy for best jazz vocal album.

Dutch Orchestra's Double Engagement
Greatest orchestra in the world, or greatest orchestra, ever? Such questions are as reckless as they are unanswerable. Still, they arise any time you think about the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the noble Dutch institution deemed the world's best orchestra by a panel of critics assembled by Gramophone magazine in 2008. As demonstrated by ''Anthology of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra,'' a newly completed series of seven 14-CD boxed sets, featuring recordings made from 1935 to 2010, this ensemble has long been among the world's elite ensembles.
Those boxed sets are crammed with intriguing rarities and modern works, assets generally absent from the orchestra's touring programs. Still, with the prospect of hearing Mariss Jansons conduct Mahler's Symphony No. 1 on Wednesday and Bruckner's Seventh Symphony on Thursday, no one is likely to complain. (8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $22.50 to $140.) STEVE SMITH
Fresh Off the Boat From America
On the economic front relations between the United States and China are strained, but ''Shanghai Calling'' takes a stab at finding humor there with a cross-cultural tale involving an American lawyer and his efforts to adjust to the city of the title. Daniel Henney stars as the lawyer, Sam, who is less than pleased when he is sent to Shanghai by his New York firm to handle clients there.
''Ever been to China before?'' a character played by Bill Paxton asks.
''I've never been above 79th Street before,'' Sam answers.
The film, which opens on Friday at the Quad Cinema, traffics in incongruity. Americans, so often paranoid about immigration, are the immigrants this time, and the Asian-American Sam is often mistaken for a local. Geng Le is a problem-solving reporter with the unlikely name of Awesome. ''In my defense,'' he explains to Sam, ''I chose this nickname long before advertisers started overusing it to sell lame products to young people.''

Her Life Revealed on Her Own Terms
There's enough high-voltage performance footage to rival her Super Bowl halftime spectacular. But peel back the spangles and special effects, and the Beyoncé Knowles on display in ''Life Is But a Dream,'' to have its premiere Saturday at 9 p.m. on HBO, is subdued, barefaced and emotionally raw. Directing the documentary with Ilan Benatar, Ms. Knowles, a 16-time Grammy Award winner, uses home movies from her Houston childhood and turns her laptop on herself to show a woman trying to have it all: a loving home life with her husband, the rapper Jay-Z; a successful career; and the freedom to simply be.
''I'm still trying to learn that I don't have to kill myself and be so hard on myself and be so critical, and I can smell the roses,'' she says before discussing the need for independence that drove her to dismiss her father, Mathew Knowles, as her manager in March 2011. ''I don't want to never be satisfied. I don't think that's a healthy way to live.''
She also addresses conspiracy theorists who maintain that the couple hired a surrogate to carry their daughter, Blue Ivy, born in January 2012. The proof: Beyoncé artfully exposes her naked silhouette to the camera three weeks before giving birth.KATHRYN SHATTUCK
A Triple Bill of Balanchine
Pacific Northwest Ballet, a Seattle company directed by Peter Boal that is justifiably proud of its diverse repertory, is offering a glimpse of its eclectic programming. A triple bill of masterpieces by George Balanchine from three periods of his career -- ''Apollo'' (1928), ''Concerto Barocco'' (1941) and ''Agon'' (1957) -- forms an exciting trio, but New Yorkers can see it only on Wednesday. All the company's other performances are devoted to ''Roméo et Juliette,'' Jean-Christophe Maillot's version of Shakespeare's tale of star-crossed lovers, set to music by Prokofiev.
Mr. Maillot, who directs Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, emphasizes emotional turbulence; hands appear to swim through the air, arms fly as if out of control and there are many off-kilter balances. All of this suggests youthful impulsiveness, and the production speeds ahead with an almost cinematic sweep. (7:30 p.m. Wednesday, 8 p.m. Friday; 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday, City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan; 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $35 to $120.) JACK ANDERSON
Renaissance Star Within Reach
Piero della Francesca, a pillar of the Italian Renaissance, is arguably the 15th-century painter most revered by modern artists. His mastery of light and space, his majestic figures and singing, subtle colors coalesced into some of the most spellbindingly still yet psychically charged images of his, or any, time. In the measured silence of Piero's pictures we can almost hear his people think.
More than five centuries after his death in 1492 Piero is finally having his first solo show on this continent. ''Piero della Francesca in America,'' opening Tuesday at the Frick Collection, will present all but one of the seven paintings in public collections in this country, and one loan from abroad.
The highlight will probably be ''Madonna and Child Enthroned With Four Angels'' from the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass., but don't miss his ''Saint Anthony,'' with his furrowed brow and his cape emblazoned with scenes from Jesus' life, all the way from Lisbon.

THE ENDGAMEThe Inside Story of the Struggle for Iraq, From George W. Bush to Barack Obama
By Michael R. Gordon and Bernard E. TrainorIllustrated. 779 pp. Pantheon Books. $35.MY SHARE OF THE TASKA MemoirBy Stanley McChrystalIllustrated. 451 pp. Portfolio/Penguin. $29.95.
Two graphs introduce the text of ''The Endgame,'' Michael R. Gordon and Bernard E. Trainor's instructive yet analytically shallow account of the Iraq war after the fall of Baghdad. The first depicts weekly attacks in Iraq from early 2004 to mid-2010, the second civilian deaths from January 2006 to May 2010. The graphs present identical images: bad news getting worse until early 2007, then pronounced improvement. The message is clear: In early 2007 a decided turn occurred. As with the Civil War after Gettysburg or the war in the Pacific after Midway, a conflict that had been going badly suddenly started heading in the right direction. 
In early 2007, of course, Gen. David H. Petraeus had arrived in Baghdad to assume command of all coalition forces. Petraeus brought a revised strategy known as counterinsurgency, or COIN, that he himself had played a key role in formulating (or at least rediscovering). Soon thereafter, additional United States forces began deploying to the war zone. All of this -- a new commander, revised strategy, more troops -- formed what has since become enshrined as the ''surge.''
Groups and individuals invested in the proposition that the surge ''worked'' -- many members of the officer corps, most Republicans and virtually all neoconservatives -- will welcome ''The Endgame'' as an account sustaining their conviction that the Iraq war, however belatedly, ended up in the win column. While by no means overlooking the egregious blunders occurring along the way, Gordon and Trainor grant that claim a qualified endorsement. Not insignificantly, they title their concluding chapter ''Mission Accomplished.'' Yet to accept any such verdict -- no matter how narrowly defined the mission -- is to misconstrue the war's outcome and significance.
As chroniclers of combat, Gordon and Trainor make a formidable team. Both are seasoned journalists, with Trainor having the added credential of being a retired Marine three-star general. Gordon is the chief military correspondent of The New York Times, and Trainor worked for the paper from 1986 to 1990. ''The Endgame'' completes their Iraq trilogy. The first two volumes -- ''The Generals' War''(1995), dealing with Operation Desert Storm, and ''Cobra II'' (2006), which focused on the 2003 invasion -- covered events from the battlefield back to the White House, but were notable for their stringent criticism of senior American military leaders. When it comes to evaluating general officer performance, the two are not dazzled by the press-briefing version of events.
Here again their narrative extends from Washington to the fighting front, while drawing on an astonishing array of classified documents. (The arrest of Pfc. Bradley Manning apparently did little to curb the military's penchant for leaking secrets.) ''The Endgame'' seeks to ''provide the most comprehensive account to date'' of the events it describes. It achieves that. Even so, where it matters most, the authors come up short.
Future historians may well classify the surge as a myth concocted to perpetuate a fraud. The myth centers on the claim that a strategy devised in Washington and implemented by a brilliant general saved the day. The fraud is that a 20-year military effort to determine the fate of Iraq yielded something approximating a positive outcome. Although ''The Endgame''provides an abundance of evidence to demolish the myth, Gordon and Trainor shy away from doing so. With the American public and political elites inclined simply to forget the Iraq war, ''The Endgame''provides a rationale for doing just that.
''The paternity of the surge would be long debated,'' Gordon and Trainor write, ''all the more so once it became clear that it succeeded militarily.'' They are surprisingly reluctant to resolve that debate. More surprising still is their willingness to accept the verdict of success.
In fact, the term used to describe the campaign that American forces pursued beginning in 2007 is a misnomer. Rather than a ''surge,'' something like an ''accommodation'' is more apt, capturing the shift to buying off insurgents instead of seeking to defeat them. As Gordon and Trainor make clear, the impetus for the so-called Sunni Awakening came from the bottom up rather than the top down. ''In practice,'' they write, ''it was not generals but leaders at the battalion and company level'' who took the initiative in cutting deals with warlords. Paying off the enemy did not appear among the principles touted by General Petraeus's famous counterinsurgency manual. His contribution was to put his seal of approval on actions instigated by subordinates wrestling with earlier failures of American generalship.
Meanwhile, responsibility for killing those who could not be bought -- chiefly foreign fighters filling the ranks of Al Qaeda in Iraq -- fell increasingly to the special operations forces commanded by Gen. Stanley McChrystal. As Gordon and Trainor make clear, and as McChrystal's memoir ''My Share of the Task'' recounts in graphic detail, the process of honing ''black ops'' capabilities had begun long before the surge. Here too, Petraeus inherited and exploited improvements for which others also deserve credit.
Taking command at a moment when American efforts in Iraq were manifestly failing, Petraeus identified a path that avoided abject defeat. This rates as no small achievement. Yet avoiding defeat should not be confused with winning.
Back in Washington, the Bush administration was intent on pretending otherwise. To shore up flagging public support for the war, it published a White Paper entitled ''The National Strategy for Victory in Iraq,'' based on ''the mantra of clear, hold and build.'' But this was, according to Gordon and Trainor, simply ''an egregious bit of deceptive advertising'' cooked up by the White House staff. Coined to suggest that the administration had finally formulated a coherent blueprint for success, it amounted to little more than ''an elaborate bumper sticker.''
In truth, victory no longer defined the objective. In overthrowing Saddam Hussein, Bush had sought to ''upset the established order to spread the gospel of freedom.'' By 2007, the administration had deep-sixed such grand ambitions. ''Behind closed doors, defeating the insurgency was not the goal,'' the authors write. ''Rather, the goal was to whittle it down to manageable proportions so that the Iraqi forces could handle the fight for a protracted period.'' This accurately describes what Petraeus and his successors achieved: they ''tamped down the violence,'' thereby ''tamping down the sectarian infighting,'' which enabled them to ''tamp down the crisis.'' In short, the surge stanched the bleeding, allowing the White House to congratulate itself on a job well done.
To distract attention from the mistakes and consequences of the war, the administration -- with eager news media collaboration -- elevated Petraeus to the status of cult figure. The retired Army general Jack Keane, a behind-the-scenes promoter of the surge and of Petraeus himself, ''had argued that with so much going wrong in the war the American public needed a hero.'' For such a role, the shrewd Petraeus, equally adept at cultivating journalists and courting politicians, came right out of central casting. Installing him alongside the likes of Ulysses S. Grant and George Patton in the pantheon of American greats helped refurbish an image of United States military prowess badly battered by actual events in Iraq. That ''The Endgame''includes no graphs tallying cumulative war costs and casualties or correlating recent American economic woes with the Iraq war's duration qualifies as somehow fitting.
After a brief gestation period, the misbegotten Iraq war gave birth to its own misbegotten offspring, namely, naïve faith in the generalissimo as war-redeemer. The principal beneficiary and victim of this idea was McChrystal, tapped by President Obama in 2009 to save the day in Afghanistan as Petraeus had purportedly done in Iraq. Heralded at the time of his appointment as cut from the Petraeus mold, McChrystal lasted barely a year in the job, felled by -- take your pick -- a) an unethical reporter with an ax to grind; or b) his own obtuseness. In either case, before he had effected an Afghan turnaround, McChrystal's military career came to a crashing halt. ''My Share of the Task'' offers little to suggest that success was in the offing regardless of how long he might have stayed in the job.
Over the course of five years spent fighting Al Qaeda in Iraq, McChrystal had demonstrated an impressive aptitude for military tactics. Afghanistan, however, required something more. Job 1 was to design a comprehensive campaign that was political as well as military. Persuaded (mistakenly) that counterinsurgency had produced magical results in Iraq, McChrystal set out to apply a similar formula in Afghanistan (which resembled Iraq about as much as New Jersey resembles New Mexico). The key to success, he believed, lay in forging ''durable, genuine friendships'' with Afghan and Pakistani leaders willing to pursue an American-engineered plan for nation-building. Although McChrystal cajoled -- or maneuvered -- President Obama into giving this a shot, progress by the time he departed Afghanistan was far from clear. His successor in command, Petraeus, fared little better. With Petraeus having since given way to Gen. John R. Allen, scheduled to be replaced in the coming weeks by Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the infatuation with counterinsurgency has now run its course, and four-star generals have returned to the ranks of mere mortals, a process punctuated by Petraeus's own recent fall from grace.
Of the several occasions when he himself attracted critical attention -- the Pat Tillman affair, for example, or the leaking of his Afghan strategic assessment -- McChrystal offers explanations that fall somewhere between perfunctory and disingenuous. The truth is that he comes across as a skilled craftsman perhaps but an astonishingly unreflective architect. Few if any senior American officers have spent more time than McChrystal in the post-9/11 combat theaters. Yet as to what those wars have wrought and at what cost to the United States or to others, he is essentially mute. Like Gordon and Trainor, McChrystal represses any inclination to probe too deeply.

HEADLINE: By the Book: Katherine Boo

 BODY:
As a child, the author of ''Behind the Beautiful Forevers'' appreciated books in which ''the weak were rarely bullied for long, and the bad guys didn't get away.''
What book is on your night stand now?
I'm currently reading ''Ways of Going Home,'' by the Chilean novelist and poet Alejandro Zambra. If it's only half as good as his novella, ''Bonsai,'' it'll still be a fine way to lose a weekend.
What was the last truly great book you read? 
George Saunders's ''Tenth of December,'' as much as I hate to say so given that recent obnoxious headline in The New York Times Magazine [''George Saunders Has Written the Best Book You'll Read This Year'']. Saunders's earlier books had left me faintly less amazed than I felt I'd ought to be, but ''Tenth,'' in addition to being funny and stylistically cunning, contains some of the best writing about the psychological toll of inequality that I've read in years. Plus, like Alice Munro, Saunders knows when to end his stories -- the moment when the best choice a writer can make is to slip away and leave the reader to assemble the last parts on her own.
What is your favorite literary genre? Any guilty pleasures?
When your work is nonfiction about low-income communities, pretty much anything that's not nonfiction about low-income communities feels like a guilty pleasure. Among recent happy diversions were Ben Fountain's ''Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,'' Junot Díaz's ''This Is How You Lose Her,'' Cheryl Strayed's ''Wild'' and the poet Jeet Thayil's first novel, ''Narcopolis,'' about the drug-hazed Bombay of the 1980s. Fountain, Díaz, Strayed and Thayil have nothing in common except the most important thing, a total lack of pretension. They don't beat you down with their self-seriousness, and it's only when you're done that you realize how much wiser you are for their books.
Were there any novels that helped prepare you to enter the world of the slums?
What helped me prepare for the slum reporting was the immersion work I'd done in the United States. Though every community is different, my personal rule is pretty much the same: It's O.K. to feel like an idiot going in as long as you don't sound like an idiot coming out.
Where novels come in, for me, is when the reporting stops and the writing begins, because fiction writers seem to know more than nonfiction writers about distillation -- conveying their analytical or psychological insights with economy. Being intent on conveying the diversity of experiences in a single slum (and equally intent on not writing a 1,000-page tome), I paid particular attention to novels where points of view shifted quickly, among them ''The Yacoubian Building,'' by Alaa Al Aswany. I'm also obsessed with the documentary films of Frederick Wiseman, who stays out of the picture and allows the so-called subjects of his work to emerge gradually.
Are there any Indian writers with recent or forthcoming books you're especially excited about?
Aman Sethi's ''A Free Man,'' about an itinerant laborer in a Delhi slum, is one of my recent favorites -- an original sensibility joined to a passion for reported fact. I'm also eagerly awaiting Naresh Fernandes's ''The Re-Islanding of Mumbai,'' which should be out by the end of the year. When deep in my work at Annawadi I found it difficult to meet people from more affluent parts of Mumbai because the disconnects were too great. But talking to Naresh was different. He's a genuine humanist in an age of very few, and understands the conflicts inherent in a city like Mumbai better than anyone I know.
Do you ever hear from Corean and Kim, the two women you wrote about in your National Magazine Award-winning New Yorker piece, ''The Marriage Cure''?
Kim's not been in touch recently, but Corean is doing well, and still fighting like mad on behalf of her children and grandchildren. She's one of several women I've come to know in the course of my work whose example and insight have helped me conduct my own life less ridiculously. In fact I hold her personally responsible for my marriage.
What were your favorite books as a child? Did you have a favorite character or hero?
My sister and I loved Encyclopedia Brown, the fifth-grade nerd/observer who seldom took more than a day to unravel the nefarious conspiracies of childhood. Every child detective requires a sidekick, obviously, and I thought Encyclopedia's sidekick, Sally Kimball, was way cooler than any of Nancy Drew's. In addition to being smart, Sally was the only kid in town who could beat up Bugs Meany. About the particular criminals Encyclopedia and Sally outwitted, the only one I remember is a cheater in a disgusting-sneakers competition. But as a child I treasured the idea of this infinitely just place called Idaville. In Idaville the weak were rarely bullied for long, and the bad guys didn't get away.
What was the last book that made you cry?
I'm not usually one for leaving tear stains in the margins, but in recent weeks I caught myself sobbing twice -- while reading a Saunders story and a forthcoming book by my friend David Finkel. Finkel's first book, ''The Good Soldiers,'' followed a battalion charged with carrying out George W. Bush's ''surge.'' The new book follows some of those veterans as they struggle to reintegrate themselves into American life, and it's devastating.
The last book that made you laugh?
''Spilt Milk,'' by the Brazilian novelist Chico Buarque. A deathbed monologue about class, race, love and political history has no right to be this funny.
What's the best love story you've ever read?
Shakespeare's underrated ''Troilus and Cressida,'' a story of flawed people in a transactional historical context that renders notions of pure love absurd. It's a love story for our time that just happened to be written at the turn of the 17th century.
If you could meet any writer, dead or alive, who would it be? What would you want to know?
I'm useless when I meet writers I love -- I go slack-jawed and stupid with awe. So I'm happy, even in my fantasy life, to give the Great Ones their space. It's enough to know them from what they put on the page.
Who are your favorite writers of all time? And among your contemporaries?
My top-10 list is an unstable thing, with new favorites regularly charging in and threatening to unseat the venerables, but Joseph Roth, Herman Melville, and George Eliot and Orwell are always on it. First among my contemporaries would have to be the late Roberto Bolaño. ''The Savage Detectives'' and ''By Night in Chile'' double-handedly yanked me out of a depression several years back, and reading ''2666'' while reporting in the slums was like a little miracle.
I was working my butt off trying to investigate the violent deaths of some homeless children, under circumstances that had been covered up by the police, when I reached the section of ''2666'' entitled ''The Part About the Crimes.'' It begins with a relentless, near-forensic account of corpses and injustices (closely based on the murders of poor women in Juarez) that opens out into this fevered exploration of both the psychological cost of paying attention to the tragedies of others and the social cost of looking away. That section of the book undid me so thoroughly that I'll probably never reread it, even though I surely grasped only a sliver of what Bolaño was trying to say. And I suppose that's the built-in sorrow of my life's most profound encounters with books, beginning with ''A Wrinkle in Time'' in third grade. To reread what you loved most at a particular moment is to risk the possibility that you might love it less, and I want to keep my memories undegraded.
If you had to give reading assignments to an aspiring journalist, what books would make the top of your list?
Rebecca West's ''Black Lamb and Grey Falcon''; Anna Funder's ''Stasiland''; Barbara Demick's ''Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea''; Adrian Nicole LeBlanc's ''Random Family''; Philip Gourevitch's account of the Rwandan genocide; Joe Sacco's graphic reportage; ''The Corner,'' by David Simon and Ed Burns; and Denis Johnson's nonfiction collection ''Seek,'' mainly for the piece about trying to meet Charles Taylor during the Liberian civil war. I could go on and on, but I'd probably end the list with Kathryn Schulz's ''Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error.'' It's about the animating power of doubt and correction, and a lack of self-certainty is something my favorite nonfiction writers seem to have in common.

OVERDRESSEDThe Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion
By Elizabeth L. Cline244 pp. Portfolio/Penguin. $25.95.
In her introduction to ''Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion,'' the journalist Elizabeth L. Cline recalls buying ''seven pairs of $7 shoes'' at Kmart. Regret follows, and soon afterward, a wardrobe inventory. When Cline cleans out her closet she discovers, among other things, 61 tops, 60 T-shirts, 15 cardigans and hooded sweatshirts, 21 skirts and 20 pairs of shoes, most of which she never wore.
A quote from the former Vogue editor Diana Vreeland comes to mind: ''Give 'em what they never knew they wanted.'' Fast-fashion retailers like H&M, Topshop and Forever 21 are great at hawking what we never knew we wanted. Not only that, they offer it at steadily reduced prices. Cline, who admits to being a ''reformed fast-fashion junkie,'' notes that ''because of low prices, chasing trends is now a mass activity, accessible to anyone with a few bucks to spare.'' Quality is no longer an issue, because you need clothes to last just ''until the next trend comes along.'' 
The wastefulness encouraged by buying cheap and chasing the trends is obvious, but the hidden costs are even more galling. Cline contends that ''disposable clothing'' is damaging the environment, the economy and even our souls, and she presents a dense and sobering skein of data to support her thesis. Today, the United States makes only 2 percent of the clothing its consumers purchase, compared with roughly 50 percent in 1990; in 2010, Goodwill sold 163 million pounds of used clothes and household items. Cline travels to Guangdong Province in China, a region crowded with textile factories, and observes, ''The air pollution was so thick I couldn't photograph anything a quarter-mile off the highway -- it was lost in the smog.''
One antidote to this high-speed style Armageddon is ''slow fashion'' -- a concept, like ''slow food,'' that is itself garnering trend-worthy status. There is a rash of ''ethical fashion'' blogs and books on the subject (Lucy Siegle's ''To Die For'' comes to mind), and the movement is becoming so popular that even the global clothing giants have glommed on. H&M, for example, now has a ''Conscious Collection,'' a line of organic cotton fashions designed to appeal to the conscientious customer.
Cline adheres to the ''slow'' mantra -- ''make, alter and mend'' -- and advises us to buy recycled, organic and locally produced clothing. She's a persuasive advocate; when she writes that ''sewing gives back a feeling of agency and self-sufficiency,'' I'm tempted to bring the Singer up from the basement. But she could have delved even deeper: why have so many consumers (including Cline) become hooked on fast fashion in the past decade? Is our lust for cheap clothing symptomatic of a larger malaise? What role do social media, which encourage relentless image consciousness, play in our shopping choices? Do we believe that by continually acquiring and displaying what we wear, we are creating an identity, an eternal brand of the self? And what's really going on in those disturbing ''haul'' videos, in which shoppers post reviews of their purchases on YouTube?
When Cline writes that ''people crave connections to their stuff,'' she prompts another question: Have we somehow become disconnected from ourselves? If we don't stop to consider this, we may end up perpetually rushing out to buy more ''stuff,'' never realizing what we truly need, genuinely want and cannot afford to waste.

HEADLINE: Money Changes Everything

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON

 BODY:
Depending on when you're reading this column, economists have a pretty good guess as to what kind of mood you're in. If it's Sunday, you're almost certainly happier than if you're catching it on a Monday. Either way, there's a good chance you're in a lousy mood if it's 7 a.m. (Sorry!) You'll be happier around lunchtime, sadder at 2 p.m. but should perk up by 8 in the evening.
And economists will definitely have a theory about your happiness based on where you live. In collaboration with psychologists, a number of respected economists have spent much of the past decade or so mapping our levels of happiness across borders and daytime hours. Angus Deaton, an economist at Princeton University, is helping shape the movement to incorporate subjective measures of emotions into serious economic analysis. The goal is to use this new data to inform more traditional measures, like G.D.P. or the unemployment rate, and to influence government policy. Or at least that's the idea. 
Happiness quantification sounds a bit wishy-washy, sure, and through a series of carefully administered surveys across the globe, economists and psychologists have certainly confronted a fair number of sticky issues around how to measure, and even define, happiness. Still, some of the data make lots of anecdotal sense. Given that Nevada was ground zero for the housing bust, it's not surprising that its citizens are less happy than Coloradans. Other findings, though, are more opaque. Why does western Long Island score several points higher on the happiness scale than most of Brooklyn? (Does being richer make you feel better than being cooler?) Why do Filipinos, who live in a relatively poor country, report such positive emotions?
Though still unrefined, happiness quantification has come quite a long way since 1974, when a University of Southern California economist named Richard Easterlin published an important paper that put the field on the map. His conclusion, known as the Easterlin paradox, stated that people do not become happier as they get richer. Around the same time, the Kingdom of Bhutan (population 738,000; average income, around $5,800) also began plans to measure what it called gross national happiness. These ideas might have had an impact, but nobody paid attention. ''The general reaction of economists,'' Easterlin told me, ''was: 'This is just subjective testimony that nobody puts any credit in.' ''
Happiness studies became a hot discipline in the early 2000s, and France, Britain and other governments now conduct surveys of their own national levels of emotional well-being. It can be fairly instructive. Deaton, who advised the French government on its report, said, ''The French are pretty miserable.'' The United Kingdom's Office of National Statistics reports only a slight happiness dip despite a deep recession. On the other hand, Bhutan's happiness survey is so complex that I have no idea what the Bhutanese are feeling. Nonetheless, a United Nations committee has called upon the world's governments to adopt happiness measures. A United States government panel is exploring the issue here.
As more data come in, however, many economists are becoming convinced of one significant change: the original Easterlin paradox doesn't quite hold up. Broadly speaking, the data now indicate that as people get richer, they report getting happier too. Though it's not quite that simple. Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan who helps advise the U.S. government on happiness statistics, told me that poor people in poor countries are not unhappy simply because they don't have wads of cash. They are more likely to have fewer choices, more children who die in childbirth and other grave problems. And while wealthier nations are generally happier, there is no evidence, Wolfers says, that an artist would be happier if she became a hedge-fund trader.
Happiness statistics may be most valuable in smaller, local discussions. Understanding how different sorts of programs affect the well-being of citizens would be enormously helpful to a mayor choosing between building a new bridge or offering a tax cut. I came across the very real role that money can play in happiness when I reported on Yvrose Jean Baptiste, a Haitian woman who lost all of her meager wealth in the 2010 earthquake. After the story was broadcast on NPR, listeners sent her nearly $4,000, which represents several years of wages to the average Haitian. When I visited Baptiste a few months later, I didn't need any official statistic to tell me that her life had been transformed. She had paid for her aunt's cancer treatments, sent her children to school and invested in a small market stall that provided a steadier income. She looked years younger.
Wolfers says that Baptiste's story is typical of what happens when traditional agrarian societies give way to slightly less poor urban ones. As we ponder how to help the nearly three billion people who live on less than $2.50 per day, it is important to realize that seemingly small changes in income do lead to profound increases in happiness. In wealthier nations, of course, it takes a lot more money. Still, most rich countries have reported increases in happiness as they become richer.
There is one strange exception. The U.S. is nearly three times as rich today as it was in 1973, when Easterlin was collecting his data. According to nearly every survey, though, Americans are not at all happier than we were back then. This is explained, in part, by the fact that many Americans have not shared in the increased wealth. With the disappearance of pensions and the increased volatility of labor markets, many workers face more uncertainty than ever before.
But the decline in happiness may suggest a more deeply rooted issue. So much debate over government policy is based on economic statistics that come out of the market. But the goal of government is not just to maximize revenue. It's also to make citizens better off. There is no standardized way for it to see how its decisions influence our well-being. What if government is spending money on things that don't make us happy?
In this sense, happiness quantification is anything but wishy-washy. For much of what government does, Deaton says, it is far more rigorous to base decisions on whether they actually improve lives than on some other potentially misleading data. ''It's not like the economic data we're collecting now is terrific,'' Deaton told me. After all, nothing boosts G.D.P. like a debt-fueled housing bubble or a costly health care system. If happiness became a core part of government statistics, he says, we might figure out what it is Americans want. And then maybe, we could give it to them.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. Happiness quantification is growing rapidly.
2. The question is: How do we use this information?
3. And can it actually make us happier?

HEADLINE: Better Place Pulls Out Of U.S. and Australia

BYLINE: By BRADLEY BERMAN

 BODY:
Better Place, a company that provides charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, said on Wednesday that it would wind down its operations in North America and Australia and concentrate solely on Denmark and Israel.
The company was founded five years ago by Shai Agassi, a charismatic Israeli entrepreneur who had previously been a top executive at SAP, the software company. Mr. Agassi raised more than $800 million in private capital on his vision of breaking the world's oil addiction by offering convenient battery-swapping stations for electric cars.
But the company failed to demonstrate the feasibility of its battery-swapping concept, even though it managed to create a small network of stations in Israel and Denmark. It has posted $477 million in cumulative losses since 2010, and four months ago replaced Mr. Agassi with a new chief executive, Evan Thornley, who had been the top Better Place executive in Australia. Mr. Thornley unexpectedly resigned in January after just three months in the job, and has been replaced by Dan Cohen. 
Mr. Cohen, who became the company's third chief executive after leaving the company for a brief period, had served as vice president for strategic initiatives for four years.
On Jan. 22, around the time Mr. Thornley left the company, the Israeli business publication Globes reported that he had left over differences of opinion with the largest shareholder, the Israel Corporation, about Better Place's strategic direction. The company, which was founded in Palo Alto, Calif., is based in Tel Aviv.
On Nov. 28, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the Israel Corporation had warned that it would stop injecting cash into Better Place unless it received a viable business plan by the end of 2012.
In December, Julie Mullins, a company spokeswoman who has since left Better Place, said that under Mr. Thornley's direction Better Place was "not moving away from battery switching, but is also looking to be the network service provider of choice for any E.V." This suggested a strategic shift to electric-vehicle charging and related software.
Previously, Better Place's business model had relied on securing automakers' commitments to make vehicles that would be compatible with its robotic battery-swap stations, which resemble drive-through car washes. Mr. Agassi had envisioned a network of stations where motorists could pull in, have their depleted batteries replaced with fully charged units, and return to the road in roughly the amount of time it would take to fill a conventional car with gasoline.
To date, only Renault has agreed to participate, converting a limited number of its electric Fluence sedans, sold in Europe, for battery swapping.
Better Place Hawaii, which operates E.V. charging locations but not swapping stations, informed its customers Tuesday about the North American shutdown. In an e-mail to customers, Brian Goldstein, director of Better Place Hawaii, said the company "will work to ensure continued public charging services for all our Hawaii members." The company's Web site states that Better Place offers more than 150 charging points in Hawaii.
In 2011, the State Energy Office of the Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism provided $581,943 in federal stimulus money to Better Place.
With the announcement that United States operations would cease, Better Place is withdrawing from its plans to build battery-swapping stations for a fleet of electric taxis in San Francisco and in San Jose, Calif. In October, the California Energy Commission approved $3 million for the eTaxi project, according to Forbes.
In a statement on Better Place's Web site, Mr. Cohen, the new chief executive, said the company would focus in the short term on its operations in Israel and Denmark. "At the same time," he said, "we had to make some difficult decisions on actions to be taken elsewhere in the world."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Looking Beyond Income, Toward a Tax on Wealth Itself

BYLINE: By ANNA BERNASEK

 BODY:
INCOME tax rates have recently been raised slightly for some affluent people, and there is pressure for additional increases. But some economists say raising marginal income tax rates on high earners may miss the mark.
One reason is that the truly wealthy employ all kinds of legal means to minimize their tax liability, including shifting income around the world, deferring gains on their assets and many other sophisticated strategies. Another, though, is that taxes on ordinary income simply don't apply to inheritance or investment, principal sources of wealth.
Under legislation that Congress approved on New Year's Day the top marginal income tax rate for 2013 has risen to 39.6 percent from 35 percent for individuals on ordinary income over $400,000 and for couples on income over $450,000, while tax deductions and credits start phasing out on income as low as $250,000. But what is being taxed is often just a small portion of the income and wealth of the very richest Americans; unearned income, including unrealized gains and gains on investments, is either not taxed or taxed at a fraction of the top rate on wages. 
Taxing wealth in addition to income is one way to make sure that the rich contribute more to government coffers. That would essentially be a tax on household assets like property, stocks, bonds, unincorporated businesses, trusts, art and yachts.
The idea is to aim at the wealthiest part of the population, perhaps the top 1 percent, a group that has seen the most significant and consistent accumulation of wealth over the last few decades.
''A wealth tax is an attempt to fill the holes in income tax,'' said Douglas A. Shackelford, a tax expert at the University of North Carolina. ''The primary hole is unrealized capital gains. That's behind the big buildup of dynastic wealth.''
COUNTRIES like Canada have a tax on asset appreciation, based on the value of the assets at the time of the owner's death. The United States does not, and the tax code contains a huge loophole through which to pass wealth to one's heirs.
Here is how that can work in practice:
A billionaire can borrow against his stocks, art and real estate, and spend that borrowed money without paying tax. All he has to do is pay interest on the loan. When he dies, his heirs can sell the assets to pay off the debt. Under an existing rule known as the ''step-up in basis,'' no matter how much the assets have appreciated in value, no one will owe income tax on that gain. And the rest of his fortune goes to his heirs without anyone ever paying income taxes on the appreciation in the assets.
Partly to close loopholes like this, Ronald I. McKinnon, an economist at Stanford, advocates a wealth tax in addition to income tax. He outlined his proposal in a recent op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal titled ''The Conservative Case for a Wealth Tax.''
Professor McKinnon's plan would require households to list all domestic and foreign assets annually. There would be a $3 million wealth exemption, which, in his estimation, would exclude more than 95 percent of the population. The remainder would be subject to a flat tax of about 3 percent of household wealth.
In Europe, in addition to a wealth tax, many countries have a value-added, or consumption tax. Because the idea of a consumption tax is politically unpopular in the United States, he said in an interview, ''I think the case is even stronger in the U.S.''
''Plus,'' he added, ''the income tax is a poor vehicle for hitting the wealthy.''
Other economists say that a wealth tax would also address other problems.
''Wealth inequality and lack of access to opportunity is destroying the meritocratic aspects of our economy,'' said Daniel Altman, an economist at New York University and a former member of the editorial board of The New York Times. ''That will cost us growth in the long run.''
Mr. Altman proposes replacing the income tax with a wealth tax. He estimates that a flat wealth tax of 1.5 percent would be more than enough to replace the revenue from current income, estate and gift taxes. But he proposes establishing tax brackets according to wealth levels. For instance, no tax might be imposed for a household's first $500,000 in wealth, 1 percent for the next $500,000 and 2 percent for wealth above $1 million.
Proponents of a wealth tax also say it would encourage innovation and risk-taking because it wouldn't tax wealth in its early phases, but only after it has been amassed.
There are several main criticisms. For one, valuing unfamiliar assets -- say, private businesses or art collections -- would not be easy. A related issue is liquidity, as an owner may not be able to readily obtain cash based on the value of the assets in question. And some fear a negative effect on capital formation.
There are also possible legal roadblocks. Matthew J. Franck, writing for National Review Online, said instituting a wealth tax might require a constitutional amendment. A similar concern haunted proponents of the income tax until ratification of the 16th Amendment in 1913.
IT is unclear whether the idea of a wealth tax will ever gain traction in the United States. But longtime deficit problems remain, and tax increases of some type may well be part of the solution. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States raised less tax revenue in 2010 as a proportion of gross domestic product than any other industrialized nation, aside from Chile and Mexico.
''Should we reform the income tax, the estate tax or bring in a third tax like the wealth tax?'' asked Professor Shackleford at the University of North Carolina. ''We have to do something. There's a tremendous amount of tax escaping because we don't tax the deceased and we don't tax the heirs.''

HEADLINE: Battling College Costs, a Paycheck at a Time

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
If Steve Boedefeld graduates from Appalachian State University without any student loan debt, it will be because of the money he earned fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and the money he now saves by eating what he grows or kills.
Zack Tolmie managed to escape New York University with no debt -- and a degree -- by landing a job at Bubby's, the brunch institution in TriBeCa, where he made $1,000 a week. And he had entered N.Y.U. with sophomore standing, thanks to Advanced Placement credits. All that hard work also yielded a $25,000 annual merit scholarship.
The two are part of a rare species on college campuses these days, as the nation's collective student loan balance hits $1 trillion and continues to rise. While many students are trying to defray some of the costs, few can actually work their way through college in a normal amount of time without debt and little or no need-based financial aid unless they have an unusual combination of bravery, luck and discipline.
''I literally never went out,'' Mr. Tolmie says. ''There just was not time to do that.'' 
Plenty of influential people assume that teenagers can ask parents for loans if all else fails, as Mitt Romney suggested during the 2012 presidential campaign. Others recall working their way through college themselves, including Representative Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina who heads a House subcommittee on higher education and work force training. ''I spent seven years getting my undergraduate degree and didn't borrow a dime of money,'' she once said at a subcommittee meeting, adding that she was bewildered, given her own experience, by tales of woe she had heard from people with $80,000 in debt.
But students nowadays who try to work their way through college without parental support or loans face a financial challenge of a different order than the one that Ms. Foxx, 69, confronted as a University of North Carolina undergraduate more than 40 years ago. Today, a bachelor's degree from Appalachian State, the largest university in her district, can easily cost $80,000 for a state resident, including tuition, room, board and other costs. Back in her day, the total was about $550 a year. Even with inflation, that would translate to just over $4,000 for each year it takes to earn a degree.
And the paychecks that Mr. Tolmie managed in the big city are only a dream in towns like Boone, where employers have their pick of thousands of Appalachian State undergraduates. Even the most industrious, like Kelsey Manuel, a junior who drives 10 miles each way to a job in a resort where she earns $10 to $11 an hour, often cannot work enough to finish college debt-free.
No one tracks how many students are trying to work their way through without parental assistance or debt, but plenty work long hours while also attending classes full time. As of 2010, some 17 percent of full-time undergraduates of traditional age worked 20 to 34 hours a week, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. About 6 percent worked 35 hours or more.
Students who work fewer than 30 hours a week (excluding federal work-study jobs) while in college were 1.4 times more likely to graduate within six years than students who spent more than 30 hours a week in a job, according to an article by Pilar Mendoza, an assistant professor of higher education administration at the University of Florida, in The Journal of Student Financial Aid last year. Their grades are likely to be better, too, since they have more time to study.
But working less has financial consequences. ''You have two choices,'' Ms. Mendoza says of students whose families could not or would not contribute to their college costs. ''You either work, or you acquire debt.''
Banking on Brunch
Zack Tolmie chose to work. He first caught sight of New York University on television when he was a freshman in high school in Altamont, N.Y., outside Albany. While his parents wanted him to attend college, their savings suffered in the 2001 recession.
So Mr. Tolmie got a job at a Johnny Rockets restaurant. By the time he started college in 2007, he had saved $8,000, four times as much as his parents had accumulated for him.
Impressed by the pluck he had demonstrated in passing so many Advanced Placement tests, N.Y.U. guaranteed Mr. Tolmie $25,000 in merit scholarships each year, which left him with about $75,000 that he needed to earn over three years. ''I had a chart on my desk so that every time I sat down I would need to look at it,'' he says. ''Every two weeks I needed X amount. That first year, it would have been around $600 after taxes.''
He got his lucky break when a server from Bubby's spotted him working elsewhere and said he would probably be happier working with her. He let her boss know how eager he was. ''I made it clear I wanted to work as much as possible,'' he says. Waiters could earn $300 each on the weekend brunch shift, with its rapid turnover of tables and parade of mimosas.
As the new guy, he lacked the seniority to get those shifts. But he would show up for them anyway because colleagues would often bail out if a willing replacement was standing by. Then, he would work a double shift and stay until midnight. ''It was kind of funny,'' he says. ''I was waiting tables so I could go to school, and so many times I thought, 'If only I didn't have to go to school, I could just work day shifts.' ''
Mr. Tolmie picked a double major in math and economics, in part because he knew he could finish in three years. Inevitably, there were trade-offs, including his B-plus average. ''I could have probably done better if I had devoted an extra 10 hours each week,'' he says. ''But that wasn't really an option.''
He also didn't have much of a social life. ''The absolute worst was hearing about friends back at home and the colleges they went to, especially the ones that have proper campuses,'' he says. ''I didn't have a friend that I'd bring home for Christmas break.''
Mr. Tolmie received his degree in 2010 and works as a mortgage broker. He looks at people around him and is glad he didn't take another approach to paying for college.
''There is someone I worked with at the restaurant who went to school for music,'' he says. ''But music doesn't pay well. And with the hours as a waiter, he can't do what he wants to do as a musician. He's working, enslaved to the student loan debt, all for a career he's not able to pursue.''
Homegrown Groceries
Appalachian State costs less than half what N.Y.U. does, but there are not many jobs in Boone, N.C., where a teenager can make $300 in a couple of hours.
Steve Boedefeld's solution was to earn much of the money he needed before he got there. A native of Ridgedale, Mo., he was a straight-A student in high school and an avid reader of military history, particularly Vietnam chronicles. ''I remember reading all of those books,'' he says. ''And I didn't want my grandson to look back and ask me why I didn't go when my country was at war.'' The financial benefits to enlisting with the elite Army Rangers were attractive, too.
''My folks tried everything to keep me from joining the Army,'' he says. ''They told me that I could go to school wherever I wanted and that they would pay for it. But I was pretty much dead-set that I could do it on my own. Their parents didn't float their bill, so why should I be different?''
Mr. Boedefeld enlisted in 2006 and finished his service in 2010, after three tours of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, each lasting three to six months. The discipline that allowed him to endure Ranger training and survive combat has carried over to his financial life. As a soldier in a war zone away from his wife, Jennifer, he earned as much as $5,000 a month, much of it tax-free thanks to longstanding rules governing combat pay. They put away $10,000 to $15,000 annually. ''One of my friends calls me an economy killer,'' he said.
The Boedefelds arrived in Boone with enough money for a down payment on a fixer-upper. They moved there because Appalachian State offered a degree in renewable energy that interested Mr. Boedefeld, now 25. He joined the North Carolina National Guard to get in-state tuition rates, and his service enables him to buy reasonably priced health insurance for his wife and two sons.
With his National Guard service, his $2,000 a month or so in G.I. Bill benefits and the $10 an hour he makes working 15 to 20 hours a week for an electrician, the family is debt-free, save for their mortgage. They have found a number of low-cost ways to stretch the budget they keep posted on the refrigerator.
''We definitely live on what we can grow in the garden and what I can hunt for,'' he says, over a dinner of homemade venison enchiladas topped with salsa made of vegetables from the garden outside. ''I try to plan so that we make at least two deer meals a week.''
He is also known in the neighborhood as the guy to call when a tree is down. He cuts and splits it to fuel the wood stove that heats the family's house.
Even after all of the chopping, hunting and parenting, Mr. Boedefeld is on schedule to graduate in the spring and hopes to teach technology, engineering and design to high school students. He has maintained a 3.8 grade-point average, in part by having little contact outside of class with other students.
He worries about those who arrive on campus without any direction. ''I think some students are naïve,'' he says. ''It's half their fault and half because they just don't know what college is meant for. People are going to school because they think they should, when you should go to school for an investment.''
Investing in Oneself
When Kelsey Manuel, 21, transferred from a community college near her home in Lexington, N.C., to Appalachian State, she worried about enrolling without a clear career goal. But she soon settled on a hospitality major, having worked as a waitress near her home. She made $16,000 in 2011.
Those earnings, however, kept her from being eligible for much federal financial aid, and she was only able to earn just over $12,000 in 2012 at a similar job at a hotel about 10 miles from campus. Her parents have not been able to help her pay for college, and she is now on pace to end up with at least $30,000 in student loan debt.
Esther Manogin, director of the office of student financial aid at Appalachian State, worries that students fail to place debt in context. ''You could not buy a new S.U.V.,'' she says, for the average debt level of the university's graduates, which is likely to be around $25,000 for this year's freshmen who borrow and finish their degrees. ''I don't encourage them to take out loans if they don't need them. But if that's the only way they can get an education and realize their dream, then I think it's an excellent investment in themselves.''
According to the College Board, the average debt among all bachelor's degree recipients from public universities was $13,600 for the 2010-11 school year. The average among all those who borrowed was $23,800, and many of them were probably getting at least some financial assistance from their parents. The average full-time undergraduate at a four-year public university during the 2012-13 school year is paying a net price of $12,110 for tuition, room, board and other fees after taking grant aid and tax credits into consideration, though not everyone who wants or needs to work to pay for college will qualify.
As it is for many students who work long hours and have little spending money to show for it, Ms. Manuel's financial situation sets her apart and exposes her to any number of slights. Joining a sorority is out of the question, given the dues and the fact that many social functions occur during prime working hours.
Then there are the comments about her banged-up Toyota with nearly 134,000 miles on it. ''I heard someone say recently: 'Don't let her drive her car. You should see it!' '' she says. ''I don't have money to get it fixed.''
Friends from Lexington wonder why she doesn't often return to visit, without realizing that if she didn't work she would literally be losing money. And peers at school ask why she cannot spend the money she's earned. ''Before it's even made, it has a home,'' she says.
She worries that her long hours on the job may put her academic performance and future employment prospects in jeopardy.
Indeed, this is Ms. Manogin's biggest fear about students like this. ''I just don't see how they cannot let their grades suffer,'' she says. ''Research says that for every hour of class, you need to allocate three hours of study.''
She declined to comment on Representative Foxx's nose-to-the-grindstone, debt-free exhortation. ''Probably anything I say about Virginia Foxx will get me fired,'' she says.
Ms. Manuel, though, didn't hesitate to note the long odds of earning enough while enrolled in college full-time to avoid student loans. ''If I could make that kind of money, believe me, I'd do it.'' A spokeswoman for Representative Foxx declined an interview request.
Ms. Manuel says she does wish that she had saved more money from previous jobs. But so far, she doesn't regret having enrolled at Appalachian State.
''I know that in the end, I'm probably going to be in a better situation,'' she says. ''I'm going to know the value of a dollar. These are the things that you just need to learn to grow up.''
Degrees of Debt: This series is examining the implications of soaring college costs and the indebtedness of students and their families.

HEADLINE: Like an Aging Elvis, Star Retains Its Power

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
Mercedes-Benz couldn't have known it at the time. But from the moment the SL300 flashed its novel gullwing doors at the New York auto show of 1954, this sports car began building Mercedes from an American obscurity into the luxury powerhouse it is today.
Mercedes hadn't planned to build street versions of the SL racecars that heralded its triumphant postwar return to motorsports. But after securing a promised order for hundreds of cars from Max Hoffman, the influential New York-based importer who also convinced Porsche and BMW to create sports cars for Americans, Mercedes approved production of the SL.
That coupe, followed by a roadster, became a Hollywood star through associations with celebrities like Clark Gable and Natalie Wood. Movie cameos followed, from the SL's appearance as a racecar in Elvis Presley's ''Viva Las Vegas'' to Grace Kelly driving Frank Sinatra in one in ''High Society.'' 
A year ago, a rare alloy-body SL300 Gullwing fetched a record $4.6 million at a Gooding & Company auction in Arizona. Like Mercedes itself -- or Elvis in a jump suit -- the modern SL has grown fat, rich and happy. Now sold exclusively as a hardtop convertible, the SLs of today are powerful, technically advanced two-seaters with V-8 or V-12 engines. Yet they are to sports cars as the Vegas Elvis is to rock 'n' roll -- a flashy, bulging facsimile, as much about comfortable seats for patrons as about hip-shaking performance.
In other words, the SL is as establishment as it gets. If the message isn't clear, the big Mercedes star on the front drives it home like a silver-plated belt buckle.
Then there's the price: $106,405 to start, rising to $123,445 for the SL550 that I tested.
Entering its sixth generation, the 2013 SL is two inches longer and wider than the previous version. Yet even Mercedes has realized that the SL has raided the fridge too many times. Its new aluminum chassis and body -- the first mass-produced aluminum structure in Mercedes history -- trims 275 pounds compared with the departed model.
That still leaves the SL550's claimed weight at just under two tons, about 600 pounds more than, say, a Corvette. Yet this new version actually feels more agile and less ponderous. Thank the aluminum diet, suspension trickery and the sort of overwhelming power once reserved for high-performance AMG editions.
That aluminum structure is a science fair's worth of cast, extruded and sheet pieces; just 10 percent of the car's weight is conventional steel.
The new twin-turbo 4.7-liter V-8 amasses 429 horsepower, up from 382 horses of the bigger, naturally aspirated 5.5-liter in the 2012 model. The bigger gain is in torque, which rises to an almost ridiculous 516 pound-feet, a 32 percent increase. (For full-bore ridiculousness, the SL63 AMG version makes up to 557 horsepower).
Lashed to a discreet-shifting 7-speed automatic transmission, even the base-model SL550 scampers to 60 miles per hour in barely four seconds, on virtual par with last year's SL63 AMG model.
Like one of its main rivals, the BMW 6 Series, the Mercedes feels impervious. This SL's light but strong structure barely quivers over railroad tracks or potholes. Its steering is protected from unwanted intrusions like a hip-hop mogul surrounded by bodyguards. And like a nightclubbing star, the steering rack seems lubricated with a rare, expensive brand of liqueur.
So yes, the SL550 drives as a six-figure, grand-touring convertible should: beautifully. It's too bad the beauty ends there.
Sneak up from the side, as though the SL were a grazing thoroughbred, and this Benz still looks awfully good. The profile is low and lean, with classic long-hood, short-deck proportions.
But to quote Cher Horowitz, the deceptively canny Valley Girl in ''Clueless,'' the SL is a full-on Monet: from far away, it looks all right; up close, it's a big old mess.
Practical concerns drive some of those visual issues. The SL's rear end has thickened over the years, in part to make room for the motorized sandwich of the retracted hardtop. The front end's tall, bluff shape is partly demanded by Europe's pedestrian-safety regulations.
But regulators can't be blamed for the SL's disjointed appearance, especially a front and back that are the design equivalent of a blind date: these two strangers aren't about to get along -- especially if the rear end should ask, ''Does this composite deck make me look fat?''
The interior is much easier on the eyes, including the test car's sumptuous three-way of red and black leather with black-ash wooden trim. The seats are eye-popping and back-comforting. A stubby metal joystick of a shifter is new.
A standard Harman Kardon sound system nestles enormous 7.9-inch subwoofers inside the footwells, using the enclosures to amplify the bass. Wind buffeting in the cabin is minimal.
The Airscarf system, with headrest fans to warm your neck on chilly top-down days, is standard. The roof opens or closes in less than 20 seconds. Another $2,500 brings Magic Sky Control, which darkens the clear glass sunroof at the touch of a button. A stop-start system shuts down the engine, to save fuel, when the car is halted. The federal fuel economy rating is 24 m.p.g. on the highway and 16 in town.
Electric power steering, a first on the SL, has a variable ratio, delivering faster response over the first few degrees of steering input. That makes for quicker turn-in when you first crank the wheel and for easier low-speed parking maneuvers.
Adaptive cruise control with pre-collision braking, blind spot monitors and a lane-departure monitor are part of a $2,950 Driver Assistance Package.
Given all the advanced engineering, it's amazing that some simple details slipped Mercedes's attention. For years, critics have complained that it's too easy to confuse the turn-signal stalk with the adjacent cruise-control lever.
This SL fails to remedy the situation. And now a third stalk is wedged onto the column to electrically tilt and telescope the wheel. The three stalks together create a kind of unholy Jenga arrangement.
Some other longtime SL annoyances remain, including triangle-shaped rear side windows that you barely notice -- until you return to the parked car to find they've been open for hours, leaving your car vulnerable to thieves. That mistake happens, invariably, when you close the roof and forget to retoggle the window switch after the main glass rises. You'd think Mercedes would discover the wonders of a universal windows-up switch, like the one in Audi cabriolets.
The cup holders are shallow and often powerless against rising G-forces. Hermetically sealed java is in order when a driver treads on the gas. The SL is explosively quick, and the optional Active Body Control ($4,090) pins it to the pavement.
Yet both despite and because of electronic distractions, the SL still doesn't drive like a Porsche or other pure sports cars. The throttle can feel indecisive, granting too little or too much power, the latter upsetting the balance. The Benz feels supersonic over twisty roads, but can also feel as if it's not fully connected to the pavement. That's largely due to the active steering, which is quick but smothers road feel in pools of digital butter.
None of this will surprise the doctors, athletes and entrepreneurs who choose the SL for what it is: a classic, comfortable roadster that confers instant status.
For such buyers, the SL's irreproachable status has long been a key. I'd say ''more power to them,'' but the SL has that covered as well.
INSIDE TRACK: A rich German dessert, served al fresco.

HEADLINE: Why In The World Would You Ever Give Money Through Kickstarter?

BYLINE: By ROB TRUMP

 BODY:
For about three years, between the ages of 12 and 15, I spent much of my free time on Internet forums devoted to the collectible-card game Magic: The Gathering. It became an obsession, consuming my mind and becoming the only thing I wanted to talk about. And once I realized that nobody I ever met face to face was particularly interested in a long debate on the merits of Zuran Orb vis-à-vis Claws of Gix, I turned to the Web.
On one site in particular, I became a regular -- not only in conversations about Magic rules and strategy but on general issues like politics, culture, science and sports. Over time, even as my interest in the game waned and I played less, my connection to the people I met stayed strong, and I was spending more and more time on the site. Many regulars and I became close friends. Yet my family was still freaked out when one community member, having decided to leave the game of Magic, sent me a huge box of his old cards. 
When my mother found out that my mysterious benefactor by mail was a guy in his 20s, she immediately took the position that he was a child molester trying to lure me out to California from Minnesota. In all fairness, I have no evidence that he wasn't a predator, but the simpler explanation seems much more likely: he just wanted to give me a gift.
When a person is open and giving, our default reaction is often suspicion, especially when the Internet is involved. And it's exactly that sort of suspicion that has underscored much of the media reaction to Kickstarter, an online crowdfunding platform. More or less anyone is allowed to post a project on Kickstarter with a stated financing goal, and more or less anyone is allowed to contribute to that project. The major caveats are that the projects must be creative and that the creators must offer rewards at different tiers of contribution, much in the way that PBS offers you a tote bag if you donate a certain amount during a fund-raiser.
In the beginning, Kickstarter seemed primarily like a venue for upstart bands or small theater companies to raise a few thousand dollars to get projects off the ground. Over the past year, though, Kickstarter has played a surprising role in gathering increasingly astonishing amounts of money for increasingly well-known artists. In March 2012, the video-game auteur Tim Schafer sought $400,000 to make a new game but ended up with $3.36 million; in May, the musician Amanda Palmer set a goal of $100,000 to record a new album and raked in more than $1 million.
Along with a rise in the site's public profile, the media narrative about Kickstarter has changed from one of astonishment (''So, people will just give you money?'') to one of skepticism (''All right, who's getting hosed here?'') to the current uneasy middle ground -- optimistic but ready to jettison the whole thing as soon as some opportunist abuses it to abscond with a bunch of cash. Kickstarter-financed projects that run into trouble or fail to materialize are often cited as a flaw in the model: to take only the two examples above, Schafer has documented for his backers that his project is on a pace to run over its budget, and Palmer, following her windfall, has faced criticism for soliciting free help from local musicians while on tour. The suggestion in both cases is that their Kickstarter contributors were somehow duped, like suckers who fell for a Nigerian e-mail scam.
The common thread in all of this coverage is that it typically uses the language and logic of simple supply and demand, regarding Kickstarter essentially as a meeting place for entrepreneurs and investors. Which is a big reason the site's success seems so hard to explain. Kickstarter, like the box of Magic cards I was given, is baffling by the tenets of a self-serving marketplace. (''What's in it for him?'' was the question my mother was trying in vain to answer.) And if you allow for things like file-sharing -- and many Kickstarter rewards and projects are the types of things that could be pirated, like games, albums or films -- then it becomes fairly clear that pretty much none of the people donating have a purely economic incentive to participate at all. Why not just let everybody else finance this new album and download a torrent of it later?
But Kickstarter backers aren't investors, and they aren't looking for the project that will give them the greatest return on their money. Kickstarter does not function as a store (as its Web site goes to great pains to remind you), any more than PBS is ''selling'' you a tote bag in exchange for your donation. Kickstarter as a phenomenon is made much more comprehensible once you realize that it's not following the logic of the free market; it's following the logic of the gift.
In his book ''Debt: The First 5,000 Years,'' the anthropologist David Graeber examines our history of debt and money, concluding, in part, that humans do not naturally tend toward impersonal, reciprocal exchange. Instead, exchange usually develops in cultures first as a part of a larger social and cultural ritual. One of the most compelling cultures Graeber profiles is the Tiv of West Africa, who have very particular rules about exchange. For starters, they believe that bringing an economic transaction to full completion is essentially immoral, or at least frowned upon, because it implies that one party doesn't want anything to do with the other in the future. If a Tiv man or woman gives you a gift, you are supposed to respond with another gift of slightly greater or lesser value. The outstanding debt between the two of you is a signal that your relationship is going to continue. To respond with a gift of equal value would be to say implicitly that you wish to even things out and draw your relationship to a close.
Kickstarter is run according to a similar form of gift logic. The artists create a short video, explaining themselves and conveying their personality. People contribute to them because they're friends who know the artist personally; they're fans engaged in a highly personal if unidirectional relationship with the artist; or simply because they're intrigued by the project and want some sense of participation in it. (Though it has been estimated that only 10 to 20 percent of contributors find projects this way, through the Kickstarter site rather than through the artists' own social-media promotions -- and on average, these people donate less money.)
In response to the contribution, as in Tiv custom, the artist gives something of slightly greater or lesser value to the person who contributed. And it's almost always the case that the rewards for donations have a lower market value than the money being asked for (much like that public-television tote bag). There's one notable reason for this: the highly personal logic of the gift exchange, a transaction by which a personal relationship is strengthened, not diminished.
There's also an odd symbiosis created by Kickstarter, a reversal of the way the culture industry traditionally operates. On Kickstarter,if not enough backers pony up, the project quite likely won't exist at all. This makes its projects oddly impervious to piracy. If all your potential fans are freeloaders inclined to download something only if it's free, your project won't be financed in the first place, and there will be nothing for them to pirate.
Some critics of Kickstarter have objected to the transaction fees collected by the site itself, which is the source of its revenue. Josh MacPhee, writing in The Baffler (for which Graeber often writes as well), complained that Kickstarter extracts value from social networks while giving nothing social in return.
Admittedly the interaction with Kickstarter Inc. is an impersonal, business transaction, but it's not an exploitative one: artists choose to use Kickstarter because it's a known entity, it adds some legitimacy to their projects and helps them with presentation. Communities flock to donate to Kickstarter projects for the same reasons. And it's not correct to say that Kickstarter gives nothing back. To the contrary, it provides something increasingly rare in today's society: a platform for an essentially noneconomic transaction, the kind that builds friendships and communities. Some of the more innovative users of Kickstarter, like Schafer, have even offered a kind of forum membership as a donation reward; an invitation into a place where fans can congregate and socialize online, much as I did in my early teenage years.
And unlike the individual projects featured on the site, Kickstarter, the business, is susceptible to market forces. If at some point we all decide that its fees are too high, there's nothing to stop people from migrating to any of Kickstarter's increasing number of competitors, like Indiegogo or RocketHub. Kickstarter is replaceable, in competition with other more-or-less-equivalent services, and it keeps no relationship with us after we've donated. We are free to leave it whenever we please.
In 1983, Lewis Hyde, another writer inspired by gift economies, published ''The Gift,'' an examination of the nature of the creative impulse and its relationship to the market economy. Hyde emphasized the forward motion of the gift, arguing that artistic creation is propelled by eros, or love, rather than the logos of number-crunching, and as such it is incapable of being subsumed by the market. Even if art is sold, the forces that led to its existence operate according to the need to share something with the world. Hyde's focus on the artist as creator and gift-giver is narrower than Graeber's more historical approach, but it made ''The Gift'' a sensation and an inspiration to writers like Margaret Atwood and David Foster Wallace. And if Graeber's work helps us understand the psychology of crowdfunding, then Hyde's work is vindicated by Kickstarter's success. The desire to make art has always been inherently social, not economic, and now, even in a society defined by the free market, the means to produce art can come from an inherently social mechanism as well.
As with the Tiv, on Kickstarter, the reward gift doesn't bring the transaction to completion. After financing a project and dispensing rewards, artists who use Kickstarter are in a permanent debt to the fans who supported them. This is borne out by their actions: pretty much no one who has had a successful Kickstarter project has ever been able to shut up about how thankful they are. Many have subsequently donated to or helped promote other projects. And if the artists don't show the appropriate reverence for their benefactors, public opinion can turn nasty. The reaction against Palmer's use of others' volunteer labor occurred not because her call for free help indicated some maddening market inefficiency. (Unpaid labor, after all, is the height of efficiency.) What really upset people is that her actions seemed to indicate an insufficient appreciation for the gift she received.

HEADLINE: Lost in the Stars of a Hotel's Rating

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
THE Internet deserves credit for creating new and cash-saving ways to handle mundane tasks, like booking a hotel. But these innovations can come at a price, and the price is often insanity. Other times it's rage. More often, it's rage's slightly mellower cousin, frustration.
Our question this week is from a man who handled his Internet-inflamed frustration the best way that one can. He didn't get mad, or go nuts. He just collected a lot of evidence. 
Q. On Nov. 8, I visited Hotwire's Web site to reserve a room in Ithaca, N.Y., where I was going for business. I used the site's ''opaque'' system, which allows you to specify the quality of hotel where you'd like to stay but doesn't say where you'll end up until you've committed to pay. But you can get a look at names of a handful of hotels in each category.
In Ithaca, Hotwire's 3-star list looked fine -- Holiday Inn Express, Hampton, Best Western, etc. So I typed in that I'd like two nights at a 3-star hotel, which would cost $135 a night. To my surprise, I ''won'' two nights at the Clarion Hotel. I've stayed there before and found it pretty awful. I would never have bid on a 3-star hotel had I known that the Clarion was in the mix.
Which it should not have been, according to Hotwire itself. The Clarion appears on the company's list of Ithaca hotels where you might land when specifying a 2.5-star hotel. When I later double-checked this through an online chat with a Hotwire customer representative, I was told that the Clarion in Ithaca is actually a 2-star property. In another online chat, I was told it's a 2.5-star property.
Regardless, when I called Hotwire and asked for a refund, a rep and his manager refused. They explained that the Clarion in Ithaca is a 3-star property, and in subsequent e-mails the company did not seem to care that its Web site and two online reps say otherwise. I say Hotwire sold me a 2- or 2.5-star property while charging me a 3-star rate. I actually stayed at the Courtyard when I went to Ithaca, but nobody at Hotwire will listen when I argue that I deserve a refund.
Care to see if they'll listen to you?
KEVIN BRUNS
Potomac, Md.
A. The Haggler contacted Hotwire and sent along a copy of one of Mr. Bruns's online chats. It includes this exchange:
Mr. Bruns: That property in Ithaca is a 2.5 star? So if I bid on a 3-star, there's no chance I will get the Clarion, right?
Hotwire: Yes. If it is under our 3-star category you are guaranteed to get a 3-star hotel.
What happened here? Garrett Whittemore, a Hotwire spokesman, said that while the Clarion chain gets 2.5 stars, Hotwire sometimes awards higher or lower grades to individual properties. ''Many hotel chains are independently owned and operated, so some offer more or less amenities and services than others, and that will impact their class levels appropriately,'' the spokesman wrote in an e-mail. ''Although in general Clarions fall into the 2.5-star category, there are many that qualify for the 3-star class in our rating system, and the Clarion in Ithaca is one of them.''
So what's with the reps who say otherwise in online chats? A mistake, wrote Mr. Whittemore. He said that one of those reps had already been ''educated'' -- which somehow sounds vaguely ominous -- so that this wouldn't happen again. Maybe Hotwire can educate its Web site, too. The Haggler visited it and went through some of the same motions that Mr. Bruns did. Up pops the Clarion in the company's list of Ithaca hotels where you might land if you opt for a 2.5-star stay. Maybe the site is referring here to the Clarion as a chain, but it sure doesn't make that clear.
Given the confusion, Hotwire said it would refund Mr. Bruns's money. That's nice. But here's a metaquestion: Why are the ministrations of the Haggler necessary in a case like this, where it's clear that a customer has been given bad information, and thus has a legitimate grievance? Mr. Bruns had every scrap of evidence he needed, including screen grabs. He also had a receipt from the Courtyard. Why aren't companies like Hotwire supple enough to truly listen to people like Mr. Bruns and accommodate them, without a nudge?
No doubt many people call Hotwire each year and demand refunds, for lame or laughable reasons. No doubt it's harder than it looks to sort the credible complaints from the noncredible ones. But as the Haggler has written before, if we're headed for an economy dominated by the service sector, why can't we do service really well?
The Haggler posed these questions to the outside public-relations representative who handles media inquiries for Hotwire. That's right -- Hotwire's spokesman has a P.R. rep, and a media-shy one at that, who did not want to be quoted. He promised to cogitate and follow up. Did the Haggler expect a thoughtful, philosophical answer? Yes, he did, proving once again that he is an idealistic fool. The P.R. rep offered nothing thoughtful at all and instead claimed that because Mr. Bruns had used a different name during his online chat, the company was never able to piece his entire story together until the Haggler stepped in.
This is nonsense. Mr. Bruns e-mailed all the details to Hotwire a week after this mini-debacle, in November. Hotwire had the entire tale months ago.
So as perverse as this may sound, take comfort in this episode, all you aggrieved consumers: on occasion, when the Haggler asks a company a question, he can't get a straight answer, either.

HEADLINE: Planning Ahead, With an Eye on Tax Changes

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
IF you've gathered up the documents and compiled the data for your 2012 tax return, congratulations. The next part, of course, may be painful: actually calculating your taxes.
But you may feel better if you can figure out how to improve your tax situation for the next filing season. By taking into account changes in the tax law, some planning is possible.
Even if you rely on tax software or a professional preparer, it always helps to know what questions to ask. Here are some issues to consider:
MEDICARE SURCHARGES To hear the politicians in Washington tell it, you might think that taxes will rise this year only for individuals with incomes above $400,000 and married couples filing jointly with incomes above $450,000. But that is not the whole story. Millions of Americans with lower incomes will face higher taxes because of new Medicare surcharges. 
John J. Connors of Milwaukee, a lawyer and accountant who formerly taught tax law at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Wisconsin, notes that a surcharge of nine-tenths of 1 percent will be levied on earnings above $200,000 for single filers and on earnings above $250,000 for joint filers. Separately, a surcharge of 3.8 percent will apply to net investment income for people whose adjusted gross incomes top the $200,000 and $250,000 thresholds.
While investment income has traditionally meant capital gains, interest and dividends, it is very broadly defined for the Medicare surcharges , Mr. Connors said, including rental income, as well as profits from passive investments, in which a person puts money into a business but is not active in it.
Small-business owners could be affected, he says, because more than 90 percent of businesses file tax returns as S corporations or partnerships in which profits flow through to the owners and are taxed at the individual level. Mr. Connors said there was a loophole for S corporation owners who minimized their salaries and instead paid out business profits as distributions, which are not subject to the surtax.
Trusts will be especially hard hit, he said. Those with investment income above $11,950 will owe $3,090 in income tax, plus 39.6 percent of the amount above $11,950, as well as the 3.8 percent Medicare surcharge on investment income. People with trusts might consider paying out as much of the trust income as possible because it would be subject to the surtax only if a beneficiary's income exceeded the $200,000 or $250,000 threshold.
ESTIMATED TAXES Most business owners and self-employed people must pay estimated taxes for the first quarter of this year by April 15. Barbara Weltman, a tax lawyer in Millwood, N.Y., says filers should consider whether they will owe the new surcharges when calculating their estimates. Retirees who rely on investment or real estate income may also be liable for estimated taxes and may be required to pay the Medicare surcharge even if they themselves are covered by Medicare, said Ms. Weltman, who is also a contributing editor to ''J.K. Lasser's Your Income Tax 2013.''
MEDICAL EXPENSES Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., suggests several planning points for families with big medical expenses, which have been deductible only to the extent that unreimbursed costs exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. For most taxpayers, that floor will rise this year to 10 percent, though for people 65 and over, that change will be delayed until after 2016.
Couples should calculate taxes both as married filing separately and as married filing jointly, he says. If one spouse has a lower income than the other but high medical expenses, the net result of filing separately may be lower overall taxes, he adds, ''but it is not axiomatic.''
Remember to include medical-related transportation costs, he says. If you drive your own car, mileage for 2012 is deductible at 23 cents a mile, rising to 24 cents this year (unlike driving for charity, deductible at 14 cents a mile for 2012 and 2013, or for business, at 55 cents a mile, rising to 56.5 cents this year). Parking and tolls may also be included.
He said people who help support elderly parents could include the parents' costs in calculating a medical expense deduction, provided that they pay the medical bills directly rather than giving money to the parents so they can pay them. This applies even if the taxpayers are not entitled to a dependency exemption.
FAMILY FINANCES Sidney Kess, a tax lawyer and certified public accountant who is of counsel to the firm Kostelanetz & Fink, cites other aspects of family finances to consider. For example, if a widow or a widower is supporting adult children, he or she may be able to list them as dependents and file as head of household, rather than single.
Another consideration involves long-term capital gains and dividends. That income is tax-free for people in the 10 percent and 15 percent tax brackets, meaning taxable income no higher than $35,350 for a single filer in 2013 or $70,700 for a couple filing jointly. In some instances, Mr. Kess said, it may be advantageous for affluent people to give investment assets to a low-income relatives. Provided that the low-income relatives aren't subject to what is known as the kiddie tax, they would owe no taxes on the income.
This would also reduce the affluent person's income, and that reduction could have significant benefits. That's because taxpayers in the new top bracket of 39.6 percent will be taxed at 20 percent on such income, five percentage points higher than for those in the 25 through 35 percent brackets. In addition, single filers with adjusted gross incomes above $250,000 ($300,000 for married couples) face phase-outs of itemized deductions and personal exemptions this year.
HOME OFFICE DEDUCTION This tax break is for self-employed people who work from home, regardless of whether that is full-time or sideline work, and for employees whose employers require them to maintain a home office. It has been known as an audit trap, in part because complicated rules have resulted in filing errors.
For 2013 there is a new option, said Julie A. Welch, of Kansas City, Mo., a certified public accountant and certified financial planner at Meara Welch Browne P.C.
''To reduce paperwork burdens, the I.R.S. will allow qualified taxpayers to deduct $5 per square foot for home office expenses,'' up to a maximum of $1,500, she said. ''In addition, you will be able to deduct 100 percent of the interest on your mortgage and 100 percent of the real estate taxes as itemized deductions on Schedule A.'' The traditional home office deduction required apportioning those costs between the home office on Form 8829 and Schedule A.
Two traditional requirements, however, still apply: the home office must be used regularly and exclusively for business and must be necessary for the conduct of the business.
SOCIAL SECURITY TAX Withholding for Social Security has gone back to 6.2 percent this year, and on earnings up to $113,700. The tax had been shaved by two percentage points the past two years to stimulate the economy. The change could amount to an annual increase of $2,274 for a single person or up to $4,548 for a couple, Mr. Connors said.
He also cited these parts of the new law:
For taxpayers taking the standard deduction, rather than itemizing deductions, the marriage penalty has been eliminated. The standard deduction for married filers is twice that of single filers, $12,200 versus $6,100.
The mass transit benefit break, which had been cut to $125 a month after 2011, has been reinstated and extended. Employees can exclude up to $245 a month from gross income for employer-provided mass transit as well as for parking benefits this year. For 2012, $240 was retroactively set as the upper monthly limit for both of those benefits.
The option for taxpayers who itemize federal deductions to deduct state and local sales taxes rather than state income taxes has been reinstated for this year and made retroactive for 2012. The option may benefit people who live in states without a state income tax, like Texas or South Dakota, or who buy a big-ticket item like a car or yacht.
The option for taxpayers aged 70 1/2 or older to make tax-free transfers of up to $100,000 from an I.R.A. to a charity has been reinstated for last year and extended for this year. By having the money transferred directly, taxpayers may satisfy the legal requirement for minimum distributions after age 70 1/2 without increasing adjusted gross income and hence taxes.
Mr. Connors said the law provided an exception to the direct transfer rule for people who took the required distributions in December or January and would now like to have the money go to charity.

HEADLINE: French Ingenuity on Four Wheels

BYLINE: By PETER SIGAL

 BODY:
Paris -- Soon after the turn of the 20th century, Marcel Leyat, like many mechanically inclined young men, decided to build a motorcar.
What emerged from Leyat's Paris workshop in 1913 was a car like none before or since. The Hélica dispensed with bourgeois features like a chassis, a transmission and front-wheel steering. Up front, Leyat mounted a huge propeller, and the driver and passenger sat fore and aft in a canvas-covered cockpit. A chain connected to a steering wheel turned the rear wheels.
He sold two dozen. 
''Levat was an aviator,'' Claude Guenifféy, an expert on the Hélica, said Wednesday at the Levat display at Retromobile, the vast classic car exhibition here. ''So when he decided to build a car he built one like a plane without wings.''
But while the Hélica appears to have descended to Earth from another planet, it slots neatly into the French carmaking tradition of, well, ignoring tradition pretty much altogether.
The full flowering of French ingenuity is on display at Retromobile, now in its 38th year at the Paris Expo center in the south of the city. Over five days, an expected 75,000 visitors will take in displays of hundreds of landmark vehicles from Les Grands Trois -- Renault, Citroën and Peugeot -- and giants of the golden age of motoring like Bugatti, Talbot-Lago and Delahaye. Vendors in the cavernous hall offer vintage Art Deco racing posters, orphaned Lalique hood ornaments and refurbished steering wheels.
Mr. Guenifféy is one of the few people who can answer this burning question about the Hélica, of which only two survive: How does it handle?
''It's like driving a big ventilator,'' he said, laughing. ''It makes a lot of noise. It's very strange and scary.''
Well, it isn't all that bad, said Jeff Lane of the Lane Motor Museum in Nashville, who built a replica Hélica using plans that Mr. Guenifféy discovered in a vineyard building in 2004. Because the Hélica is essentially powered by a stiff breeze, it takes a couple of minutes to reach 30 m.p.h.
In sharp contrast to Leyat's spindly machine, my eye was drawn to a cascading 1937 Delahaye in two-tone sky blue and cream, the automotive equivalent of a perfectly coifed Afghan hound. I struck up a conversation with a polished older gentleman in double-breasted coat and pocket square, who told me that the coachwork was actually a re-creation of a Figoni et Falaschi design that was fabricated by Auto Classique Touraine.
He opened the door of a 1937 Bugatti 57 Atalante and pointed to the tobacco-colored leather interior in the sleek coupe. ''Hermès,'' he said. ''Alligator.''
''Patrick,'' he said, introducing himself. ''Patrick Delage.'' Could it be? Mais oui! Indeed he said he was the great-grandson of Louis Delage, the creator of the legendary Delage, a luxury rival to the more sporting Bugattis that was later acquired by Delahaye.
But life isn't all chocolate and Champagne. The French have created legendary quotidian cars, too, infusing econoboxes with a little joie de vivre. While there are just a handful of space-oddity Citroën 2CVs still doddering around Paris, swarms of smooth-riding Renault 5s (known in America as Le Car) and Peugeot 205s still zip along the country's village lanes and cobblestone streets.
Last year, the Renault 5 had its day at Retromobile, 2012 being its 40th anniversary, so this year it was the 205's turn, the banty Peugeot celebrating 30 years.
''I call it a 'no filter' car, with direct feeling controls,'' said François-Xavier Basse, the editor of Youngtimers magazine, which is devoted to the cars of 1970-90.
Like millions of French youth, his first car was a 205. ''Even today, it's very modern,'' he said. ''It was the first exciting car from Peugeot in the period,'' replacing the stodgy 104. The 205, designed in 1983, competed with the Renault 5.
Peugeot nailed it: The company sold 5.3 million 205s over 15 years, including the pocket-rocket 205 GTI and a ferocious turbocharged rear-engine version that won the fabled Group B rally championship in 1985. Appropriately, for a car that can be had now for about $1,300, one of the base-model 205s on display had a quarter-size rust hole near the rear window.
The various strands of French design came together in the Citroën DS, introduced in 1955 at the Paris Salon de l'Auto, causing such a sensation that 80,000 people immediately slapped down their hard-earned francs as a deposit.
A grinning shark's mug capped a cigar-shaped torso that tapered toward the rear. A complex hydraulic system controlled a self-leveling suspension, power disc brakes, a semiautomatic gearbox and power steering. In later models, the front headlights pivoted with the steering, which was controlled by a wheel with a single spoke. Because, hey, who needs two?
And even better for style-conscious Parisiens, the DS came in a rainbow of pastel shades.
''The DS means revolution,'' said François Melcion, the director of Retromobile. ''And the French, we like revolution.''
The heart of the DS line was always the four-door sedan, but the main display at Retromobile -- the private collection of the Swiss dealer Lukas Huni, and meant to mimic the 1955 debut -- also includes the hangarlike Safari wagon and a few of the coachbuilder Henri Chapron's slender cabriolets, which can fetch six-figure prices at auction.
Though parts of Retromobile seemed a sea of French racing blue, foreign marques made a strong showing. Mercedes brought one of its record-setting 1909 Blitzen-Benz streamliners, powered by a 21.5-liter engine.
And should the typical high-end auction fare prove too tame -- the star of the Artcurial catalog at Retromobile is a 1936 Talbot-Lago T150C that soldiered on to race at Le Mans four times until 1949, and carried a presale estimate of $1.6 million to $2.2 million -- a Dassault Mirage V attack jet was to be auctioned on Friday. But unlike the daredevil drivers of Marcel Leyat's propeller cars, any buyer of the Mirage who hopes to take it to the air would certainly need a pilot's license, if not actual combat experience.

HEADLINE: Like an Aging Elvis, Star Retains Its Power

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
Mercedes-Benz couldn't have known it at the time. But from the moment the SL300 flashed its novel gullwing doors at the New York auto show of 1954, this sports car began building Mercedes from an American obscurity into the luxury powerhouse it is today.
Mercedes hadn't planned to build street versions of the SL racecars that heralded its triumphant postwar return to motorsports. But after securing a promised order for hundreds of cars from Max Hoffman, the influential New York-based importer who also convinced Porsche and BMW to create sports cars for Americans, Mercedes approved production of the SL.
That coupe, followed by a roadster, became a Hollywood star through associations with celebrities like Clark Gable and Natalie Wood. Movie cameos followed, from the SL's appearance as a racecar in Elvis Presley's ''Viva Las Vegas'' to Grace Kelly driving Frank Sinatra in one in ''High Society.'' 
A year ago, a rare alloy-body SL300 Gullwing fetched a record $4.6 million at a Gooding & Company auction in Arizona. Like Mercedes itself -- or Elvis in a jump suit -- the modern SL has grown fat, rich and happy. Now sold exclusively as a hardtop convertible, the SLs of today are powerful, technically advanced two-seaters with V-8 or V-12 engines. Yet they are to sports cars as the Vegas Elvis is to rock 'n' roll -- a flashy, bulging facsimile, as much about comfortable seats for patrons as about hip-shaking performance.
In other words, the SL is as establishment as it gets. If the message isn't clear, the big Mercedes star on the front drives it home like a silver-plated belt buckle.
Then there's the price: $106,405 to start, rising to $123,445 for the SL550 that I tested.
Entering its sixth generation, the 2013 SL is two inches longer and wider than the previous version. Yet even Mercedes has realized that the SL has raided the fridge too many times. Its new aluminum chassis and body -- the first mass-produced aluminum structure in Mercedes history -- trims 275 pounds compared with the departed model.
That still leaves the SL550's claimed weight at just under two tons, about 600 pounds more than, say, a Corvette. Yet this new version actually feels more agile and less ponderous. Thank the aluminum diet, suspension trickery and the sort of overwhelming power once reserved for high-performance AMG editions.
That aluminum structure is a science fair's worth of cast, extruded and sheet pieces; just 10 percent of the car's weight is conventional steel.
The new twin-turbo 4.7-liter V-8 amasses 429 horsepower, up from 382 horses of the bigger, naturally aspirated 5.5-liter in the 2012 model. The bigger gain is in torque, which rises to an almost ridiculous 516 pound-feet, a 32 percent increase. (For full-bore ridiculousness, the SL63 AMG version makes up to 557 horsepower).
Lashed to a discreet-shifting 7-speed automatic transmission, even the base-model SL550 scampers to 60 miles per hour in barely four seconds, on virtual par with last year's SL63 AMG model.
Like one of its main rivals, the BMW 6 Series, the Mercedes feels impervious. This SL's light but strong structure barely quivers over railroad tracks or potholes. Its steering is protected from unwanted intrusions like a hip-hop mogul surrounded by bodyguards. And like a nightclubbing star, the steering rack seems lubricated with a rare, expensive brand of liqueur.
So yes, the SL550 drives as a six-figure, grand-touring convertible should: beautifully. It's too bad the beauty ends there.
Sneak up from the side, as though the SL were a grazing thoroughbred, and this Benz still looks awfully good. The profile is low and lean, with classic long-hood, short-deck proportions.
But to quote Cher Horowitz, the deceptively canny Valley Girl in ''Clueless,'' the SL is a full-on Monet: from far away, it looks all right; up close, it's a big old mess.
Practical concerns drive some of those visual issues. The SL's rear end has thickened over the years, in part to make room for the motorized sandwich of the retracted hardtop. The front end's tall, bluff shape is partly demanded by Europe's pedestrian-safety regulations.
But regulators can't be blamed for the SL's disjointed appearance, especially a front and back that are the design equivalent of a blind date: these two strangers aren't about to get along -- especially if the rear end should ask, ''Does this composite deck make me look fat?''
The interior is much easier on the eyes, including the test car's sumptuous three-way of red and black leather with black-ash wooden trim. The seats are eye-popping and back-comforting. A stubby metal joystick of a shifter is new.
A standard Harman Kardon sound system nestles enormous 7.9-inch subwoofers inside the footwells, using the enclosures to amplify the bass. Wind buffeting in the cabin is minimal.
The Airscarf system, with headrest fans to warm your neck on chilly top-down days, is standard. The roof opens or closes in less than 20 seconds. Another $2,500 brings Magic Sky Control, which darkens the clear glass sunroof at the touch of a button. A stop-start system shuts down the engine, to save fuel, when the car is halted. The federal fuel economy rating is 24 m.p.g. on the highway and 16 in town.
Electric power steering, a first on the SL, has a variable ratio, delivering faster response over the first few degrees of steering input. That makes for quicker turn-in when you first crank the wheel and for easier low-speed parking maneuvers.
Adaptive cruise control with pre-collision braking, blind spot monitors and a lane-departure monitor are part of a $2,950 Driver Assistance Package.
Given all the advanced engineering, it's amazing that some simple details slipped Mercedes's attention. For years, critics have complained that it's too easy to confuse the turn-signal stalk with the adjacent cruise-control lever.
This SL fails to remedy the situation. And now a third stalk is wedged onto the column to electrically tilt and telescope the wheel. The three stalks together create a kind of unholy Jenga arrangement.
Some other longtime SL annoyances remain, including triangle-shaped rear side windows that you barely notice -- until you return to the parked car to find they've been open for hours, leaving your car vulnerable to thieves. That mistake happens, invariably, when you close the roof and forget to retoggle the window switch after the main glass rises. You'd think Mercedes would discover the wonders of a universal windows-up switch, like the one in Audi cabriolets.
The cup holders are shallow and often powerless against rising G-forces. Hermetically sealed java is in order when a driver treads on the gas. The SL is explosively quick, and the optional Active Body Control ($4,090) pins it to the pavement.
Yet both despite and because of electronic distractions, the SL still doesn't drive like a Porsche or other pure sports cars. The throttle can feel indecisive, granting too little or too much power, the latter upsetting the balance. The Benz feels supersonic over twisty roads, but can also feel as if it's not fully connected to the pavement. That's largely due to the active steering, which is quick but smothers road feel in pools of digital butter.
None of this will surprise the doctors, athletes and entrepreneurs who choose the SL for what it is: a classic, comfortable roadster that confers instant status.
For such buyers, the SL's irreproachable status has long been a key. I'd say ''more power to them,'' but the SL has that covered as well.

HEADLINE: Looking Beyond Income, Toward a Tax on Wealth Itself

BYLINE: By ANNA BERNASEK

 BODY:
INCOME tax rates have recently been raised slightly for some affluent people, and there is pressure for additional increases. But some economists say raising marginal income tax rates on high earners may miss the mark.
One reason is that the truly wealthy employ all kinds of legal means to minimize their tax liability, including shifting income around the world, deferring gains on their assets and many other sophisticated strategies. Another, though, is that taxes on ordinary income simply don't apply to inheritance or investment, principal sources of wealth.
Under legislation that Congress approved on New Year's Day the top marginal income tax rate for 2013 has risen to 39.6 percent from 35 percent for individuals on ordinary income over $400,000 and for couples on income over $450,000, while tax deductions and credits start phasing out on income as low as $250,000. But what is being taxed is often just a small portion of the income and wealth of the very richest Americans; unearned income, including unrealized gains and gains on investments, is either not taxed or taxed at a fraction of the top rate on wages. 
Taxing wealth in addition to income is one way to make sure that the rich contribute more to government coffers. That would essentially be a tax on household assets like property, stocks, bonds, unincorporated businesses, trusts, art and yachts.
The idea is to aim at the wealthiest part of the population, perhaps the top 1 percent, a group that has seen the most significant and consistent accumulation of wealth over the last few decades.
''A wealth tax is an attempt to fill the holes in income tax,'' said Douglas A. Shackelford, a tax expert at the University of North Carolina. ''The primary hole is unrealized capital gains. That's behind the big buildup of dynastic wealth.''
COUNTRIES like Canada have a tax on asset appreciation, based on the value of the assets at the time of the owner's death. The United States does not, and the tax code contains a huge loophole through which to pass wealth to one's heirs.
Here is how that can work in practice:
A billionaire can borrow against his stocks, art and real estate, and spend that borrowed money without paying tax. All he has to do is pay interest on the loan. When he dies, his heirs can sell the assets to pay off the debt. Under an existing rule known as the ''step-up in basis,'' no matter how much the assets have appreciated in value, no one will owe income tax on that gain. And the rest of his fortune goes to his heirs without anyone ever paying income taxes on the appreciation in the assets.
Partly to close loopholes like this, Ronald I. McKinnon, an economist at Stanford, advocates a wealth tax in addition to income tax. He outlined his proposal in a recent op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal titled ''The Conservative Case for a Wealth Tax.''
Professor McKinnon's plan would require households to list all domestic and foreign assets annually. There would be a $3 million wealth exemption, which, in his estimation, would exclude more than 95 percent of the population. The remainder would be subject to a flat tax of about 3 percent of household wealth.
In Europe, in addition to a wealth tax, many countries have a value-added, or consumption tax. Because the idea of a consumption tax is politically unpopular in the United States, he said in an interview, ''I think the case is even stronger in the U.S.''
''Plus,'' he added, ''the income tax is a poor vehicle for hitting the wealthy.''
Other economists say that a wealth tax would also address other problems.
''Wealth inequality and lack of access to opportunity is destroying the meritocratic aspects of our economy,'' said Daniel Altman, an economist at New York University and a former member of the editorial board of The New York Times. ''That will cost us growth in the long run.''
Mr. Altman proposes replacing the income tax with a wealth tax. He estimates that a flat wealth tax of 1.5 percent would be more than enough to replace the revenue from current income, estate and gift taxes. But he proposes establishing tax brackets according to wealth levels. For instance, no tax might be imposed for a household's first $500,000 in wealth, 1 percent for the next $500,000 and 2 percent for wealth above $1 million.
Proponents of a wealth tax also say it would encourage innovation and risk-taking because it wouldn't tax wealth in its early phases, but only after it has been amassed.
There are several main criticisms. For one, valuing unfamiliar assets -- say, private businesses or art collections -- would not be easy. A related issue is liquidity, as an owner may not be able to readily obtain cash based on the value of the assets in question. And some fear a negative effect on capital formation.
There are also possible legal roadblocks. Matthew J. Franck, writing for National Review Online, said instituting a wealth tax might require a constitutional amendment. A similar concern haunted proponents of the income tax until ratification of the 16th Amendment in 1913.
IT is unclear whether the idea of a wealth tax will ever gain traction in the United States. But longtime deficit problems remain, and tax increases of some type may well be part of the solution. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States raised less tax revenue in 2010 as a proportion of gross domestic product than any other industrialized nation, aside from Chile and Mexico.
''Should we reform the income tax, the estate tax or bring in a third tax like the wealth tax?'' asked Professor Shackleford at the University of North Carolina. ''We have to do something. There's a tremendous amount of tax escaping because we don't tax the deceased and we don't tax the heirs.''

HEADLINE: Battling College Costs, a Paycheck at a Time

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
If Steve Boedefeld graduates from Appalachian State University without any student loan debt, it will be because of the money he earned fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and the money he now saves by eating what he grows or kills.
Zack Tolmie managed to escape New York University with no debt -- and a degree -- by landing a job at Bubby's, the brunch institution in TriBeCa, where he made $1,000 a week. And he had entered N.Y.U. with sophomore standing, thanks to Advanced Placement credits. All that hard work also yielded a $25,000 annual merit scholarship.
The two are part of a rare species on college campuses these days, as the nation's collective student loan balance hits $1 trillion and continues to rise. While many students are trying to defray some of the costs, few can actually work their way through college in a normal amount of time without debt and little or no need-based financial aid unless they have an unusual combination of bravery, luck and discipline.
''I literally never went out,'' Mr. Tolmie says. ''There just was not time to do that.'' 
Plenty of influential people assume that teenagers can ask parents for loans if all else fails, as Mitt Romney suggested during the 2012 presidential campaign. Others recall working their way through college themselves, including Representative Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina who heads a House subcommittee on higher education and work force training. ''I spent seven years getting my undergraduate degree and didn't borrow a dime of money,'' she once said at a subcommittee meeting, adding that she was bewildered, given her own experience, by tales of woe she had heard from people with $80,000 in debt.
But students nowadays who try to work their way through college without parental support or loans face a financial challenge of a different order than the one that Ms. Foxx, 69, confronted as a University of North Carolina undergraduate more than 40 years ago. Today, a bachelor's degree from Appalachian State, the largest university in her district, can easily cost $80,000 for a state resident, including tuition, room, board and other costs. Back in her day, the total was about $550 a year. Even with inflation, that would translate to just over $4,000 for each year it takes to earn a degree.
And the paychecks that Mr. Tolmie managed in the big city are only a dream in towns like Boone, where employers have their pick of thousands of Appalachian State undergraduates. Even the most industrious, like Kelsey Manuel, a junior who drives 10 miles each way to a job in a resort where she earns $10 to $11 an hour, often cannot work enough to finish college debt-free.
No one tracks how many students are trying to work their way through without parental assistance or debt, but plenty work long hours while also attending classes full time. As of 2010, some 17 percent of full-time undergraduates of traditional age worked 20 to 34 hours a week, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. About 6 percent worked 35 hours or more.
Students who work fewer than 30 hours a week (excluding federal work-study jobs) while in college were 1.4 times more likely to graduate within six years than students who spent more than 30 hours a week in a job, according to an article by Pilar Mendoza, an assistant professor of higher education administration at the University of Florida, in The Journal of Student Financial Aid last year. Their grades are likely to be better, too, since they have more time to study.
But working less has financial consequences. ''You have two choices,'' Ms. Mendoza says of students whose families could not or would not contribute to their college costs. ''You either work, or you acquire debt.''
Banking on Brunch
Zack Tolmie chose to work. He first caught sight of New York University on television when he was a freshman in high school in Altamont, N.Y., outside Albany. While his parents wanted him to attend college, their savings suffered in the 2001 recession.
So Mr. Tolmie got a job at a Johnny Rockets restaurant. By the time he started college in 2007, he had saved $8,000, four times as much as his parents had accumulated for him.
Impressed by the pluck he had demonstrated in passing so many Advanced Placement tests, N.Y.U. guaranteed Mr. Tolmie $25,000 in merit scholarships each year, which left him with about $75,000 that he needed to earn over three years. ''I had a chart on my desk so that every time I sat down I would need to look at it,'' he says. ''Every two weeks I needed X amount. That first year, it would have been around $600 after taxes.''
He got his lucky break when a server from Bubby's spotted him working elsewhere and said he would probably be happier working with her. He let her boss know how eager he was. ''I made it clear I wanted to work as much as possible,'' he says. Waiters could earn $300 each on the weekend brunch shift, with its rapid turnover of tables and parade of mimosas.
As the new guy, he lacked the seniority to get those shifts. But he would show up for them anyway because colleagues would often bail out if a willing replacement was standing by. Then, he would work a double shift and stay until midnight. ''It was kind of funny,'' he says. ''I was waiting tables so I could go to school, and so many times I thought, 'If only I didn't have to go to school, I could just work day shifts.' ''
Mr. Tolmie picked a double major in math and economics, in part because he knew he could finish in three years. Inevitably, there were trade-offs, including his B-plus average. ''I could have probably done better if I had devoted an extra 10 hours each week,'' he says. ''But that wasn't really an option.''
He also didn't have much of a social life. ''The absolute worst was hearing about friends back at home and the colleges they went to, especially the ones that have proper campuses,'' he says. ''I didn't have a friend that I'd bring home for Christmas break.''
Mr. Tolmie received his degree in 2010 and works as a mortgage broker. He looks at people around him and is glad he didn't take another approach to paying for college.
''There is someone I worked with at the restaurant who went to school for music,'' he says. ''But music doesn't pay well. And with the hours as a waiter, he can't do what he wants to do as a musician. He's working, enslaved to the student loan debt, all for a career he's not able to pursue.''
Homegrown Groceries
Appalachian State costs less than half what N.Y.U. does, but there are not many jobs in Boone, N.C., where a teenager can make $300 in a couple of hours.
Steve Boedefeld's solution was to earn much of the money he needed before he got there. A native of Ridgedale, Mo., he was a straight-A student in high school and an avid reader of military history, particularly Vietnam chronicles. ''I remember reading all of those books,'' he says. ''And I didn't want my grandson to look back and ask me why I didn't go when my country was at war.'' The financial benefits to enlisting with the elite Army Rangers were attractive, too.
''My folks tried everything to keep me from joining the Army,'' he says. ''They told me that I could go to school wherever I wanted and that they would pay for it. But I was pretty much dead-set that I could do it on my own. Their parents didn't float their bill, so why should I be different?''
Mr. Boedefeld enlisted in 2006 and finished his service in 2010, after three tours of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, each lasting three to six months. The discipline that allowed him to endure Ranger training and survive combat has carried over to his financial life. As a soldier in a war zone away from his wife, Jennifer, he earned as much as $5,000 a month, much of it tax-free thanks to longstanding rules governing combat pay. They put away $10,000 to $15,000 annually. ''One of my friends calls me an economy killer,'' he said.
The Boedefelds arrived in Boone with enough money for a down payment on a fixer-upper. They moved there because Appalachian State offered a degree in renewable energy that interested Mr. Boedefeld, now 25. He joined the North Carolina National Guard to get in-state tuition rates, and his service enables him to buy reasonably priced health insurance for his wife and two sons.
With his National Guard service, his $2,000 a month or so in G.I. Bill benefits and the $10 an hour he makes working 15 to 20 hours a week for an electrician, the family is debt-free, save for their mortgage. They have found a number of low-cost ways to stretch the budget they keep posted on the refrigerator.
''We definitely live on what we can grow in the garden and what I can hunt for,'' he says, over a dinner of homemade venison enchiladas topped with salsa made of vegetables from the garden outside. ''I try to plan so that we make at least two deer meals a week.''
He is also known in the neighborhood as the guy to call when a tree is down. He cuts and splits it to fuel the wood stove that heats the family's house.
Even after all of the chopping, hunting and parenting, Mr. Boedefeld is on schedule to graduate in the spring and hopes to teach technology, engineering and design to high school students. He has maintained a 3.8 grade-point average, in part by having little contact outside of class with other students.
He worries about those who arrive on campus without any direction. ''I think some students are naïve,'' he says. ''It's half their fault and half because they just don't know what college is meant for. People are going to school because they think they should, when you should go to school for an investment.''
Investing in Oneself
When Kelsey Manuel, 21, transferred from a community college near her home in Lexington, N.C., to Appalachian State, she worried about enrolling without a clear career goal. But she soon settled on a hospitality major, having worked as a waitress near her home. She made $16,000 in 2011.
Those earnings, however, kept her from being eligible for much federal financial aid, and she was only able to earn just over $12,000 in 2012 at a similar job at a hotel about 10 miles from campus. Her parents have not been able to help her pay for college, and she is now on pace to end up with at least $30,000 in student loan debt.
Esther Manogin, director of the office of student financial aid at Appalachian State, worries that students fail to place debt in context. ''You could not buy a new S.U.V.,'' she says, for the average debt level of the university's graduates, which is likely to be around $25,000 for this year's freshmen who borrow and finish their degrees. ''I don't encourage them to take out loans if they don't need them. But if that's the only way they can get an education and realize their dream, then I think it's an excellent investment in themselves.''
According to the College Board, the average debt among all bachelor's degree recipients from public universities was $13,600 for the 2010-11 school year. The average among all those who borrowed was $23,800, and many of them were probably getting at least some financial assistance from their parents. The average full-time undergraduate at a four-year public university during the 2012-13 school year is paying a net price of $12,110 for tuition, room, board and other fees after taking grant aid and tax credits into consideration, though not everyone who wants or needs to work to pay for college will qualify.
As it is for many students who work long hours and have little spending money to show for it, Ms. Manuel's financial situation sets her apart and exposes her to any number of slights. Joining a sorority is out of the question, given the dues and the fact that many social functions occur during prime working hours.
Then there are the comments about her banged-up Toyota with nearly 134,000 miles on it. ''I heard someone say recently: 'Don't let her drive her car. You should see it!' '' she says. ''I don't have money to get it fixed.''
Friends from Lexington wonder why she doesn't often return to visit, without realizing that if she didn't work she would literally be losing money. And peers at school ask why she cannot spend the money she's earned. ''Before it's even made, it has a home,'' she says.
She worries that her long hours on the job may put her academic performance and future employment prospects in jeopardy.
Indeed, this is Ms. Manogin's biggest fear about students like this. ''I just don't see how they cannot let their grades suffer,'' she says. ''Research says that for every hour of class, you need to allocate three hours of study.''
She declined to comment on Representative Foxx's nose-to-the-grindstone, debt-free exhortation. ''Probably anything I say about Virginia Foxx will get me fired,'' she says.
Ms. Manuel, though, didn't hesitate to note the long odds of earning enough while enrolled in college full-time to avoid student loans. ''If I could make that kind of money, believe me, I'd do it.'' A spokeswoman for Representative Foxx declined an interview request.
Ms. Manuel says she does wish that she had saved more money from previous jobs. But so far, she doesn't regret having enrolled at Appalachian State.
''I know that in the end, I'm probably going to be in a better situation,'' she says. ''I'm going to know the value of a dollar. These are the things that you just need to learn to grow up.''
Degrees of Debt: This series is examining the implications of soaring college costs and the indebtedness of students and their families.

HEADLINE: Like an Aging Elvis, Star Retains Its Power

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
Mercedes-Benz couldn't have known it at the time. But from the moment the SL300 flashed its novel gullwing doors at the New York auto show of 1954, this sports car began building Mercedes from an American obscurity into the luxury powerhouse it is today.
Mercedes hadn't planned to build street versions of the SL racecars that heralded its triumphant postwar return to motorsports. But after securing a promised order for hundreds of cars from Max Hoffman, the influential New York-based importer who also convinced Porsche and BMW to create sports cars for Americans, Mercedes approved production of the SL.
That coupe, followed by a roadster, became a Hollywood star through associations with celebrities like Clark Gable and Natalie Wood. Movie cameos followed, from the SL's appearance as a racecar in Elvis Presley's ''Viva Las Vegas'' to Grace Kelly driving Frank Sinatra in one in ''High Society.'' 
A year ago, a rare alloy-body SL300 Gullwing fetched a record $4.6 million at a Gooding & Company auction in Arizona. Like Mercedes itself -- or Elvis in a jump suit -- the modern SL has grown fat, rich and happy. Now sold exclusively as a hardtop convertible, the SLs of today are powerful, technically advanced two-seaters with V-8 or V-12 engines. Yet they are to sports cars as the Vegas Elvis is to rock 'n' roll -- a flashy, bulging facsimile, as much about comfortable seats for patrons as about hip-shaking performance.
In other words, the SL is as establishment as it gets. If the message isn't clear, the big Mercedes star on the front drives it home like a silver-plated belt buckle.
Then there's the price: $106,405 to start, rising to $123,445 for the SL550 that I tested.
Entering its sixth generation, the 2013 SL is two inches longer and wider than the previous version. Yet even Mercedes has realized that the SL has raided the fridge too many times. Its new aluminum chassis and body -- the first mass-produced aluminum structure in Mercedes history -- trims 275 pounds compared with the departed model.
That still leaves the SL550's claimed weight at just under two tons, about 600 pounds more than, say, a Corvette. Yet this new version actually feels more agile and less ponderous. Thank the aluminum diet, suspension trickery and the sort of overwhelming power once reserved for high-performance AMG editions.
That aluminum structure is a science fair's worth of cast, extruded and sheet pieces; just 10 percent of the car's weight is conventional steel.
The new twin-turbo 4.7-liter V-8 amasses 429 horsepower, up from 382 horses of the bigger, naturally aspirated 5.5-liter in the 2012 model. The bigger gain is in torque, which rises to an almost ridiculous 516 pound-feet, a 32 percent increase. (For full-bore ridiculousness, the SL63 AMG version makes up to 557 horsepower).
Lashed to a discreet-shifting 7-speed automatic transmission, even the base-model SL550 scampers to 60 miles per hour in barely four seconds, on virtual par with last year's SL63 AMG model.
Like one of its main rivals, the BMW 6 Series, the Mercedes feels impervious. This SL's light but strong structure barely quivers over railroad tracks or potholes. Its steering is protected from unwanted intrusions like a hip-hop mogul surrounded by bodyguards. And like a nightclubbing star, the steering rack seems lubricated with a rare, expensive brand of liqueur.
So yes, the SL550 drives as a six-figure, grand-touring convertible should: beautifully. It's too bad the beauty ends there.
Sneak up from the side, as though the SL were a grazing thoroughbred, and this Benz still looks awfully good. The profile is low and lean, with classic long-hood, short-deck proportions.
But to quote Cher Horowitz, the deceptively canny Valley Girl in ''Clueless,'' the SL is a full-on Monet: from far away, it looks all right; up close, it's a big old mess.
Practical concerns drive some of those visual issues. The SL's rear end has thickened over the years, in part to make room for the motorized sandwich of the retracted hardtop. The front end's tall, bluff shape is partly demanded by Europe's pedestrian-safety regulations.
But regulators can't be blamed for the SL's disjointed appearance, especially a front and back that are the design equivalent of a blind date: these two strangers aren't about to get along -- especially if the rear end should ask, ''Does this composite deck make me look fat?''
The interior is much easier on the eyes, including the test car's sumptuous three-way of red and black leather with black-ash wooden trim. The seats are eye-popping and back-comforting. A stubby metal joystick of a shifter is new.
A standard Harman Kardon sound system nestles enormous 7.9-inch subwoofers inside the footwells, using the enclosures to amplify the bass. Wind buffeting in the cabin is minimal.
The Airscarf system, with headrest fans to warm your neck on chilly top-down days, is standard. The roof opens or closes in less than 20 seconds. Another $2,500 brings Magic Sky Control, which darkens the clear glass sunroof at the touch of a button. A stop-start system shuts down the engine, to save fuel, when the car is halted. The federal fuel economy rating is 24 m.p.g. on the highway and 16 in town.
Electric power steering, a first on the SL, has a variable ratio, delivering faster response over the first few degrees of steering input. That makes for quicker turn-in when you first crank the wheel and for easier low-speed parking maneuvers.
Adaptive cruise control with pre-collision braking, blind spot monitors and a lane-departure monitor are part of a $2,950 Driver Assistance Package.
Given all the advanced engineering, it's amazing that some simple details slipped Mercedes's attention. For years, critics have complained that it's too easy to confuse the turn-signal stalk with the adjacent cruise-control lever.
This SL fails to remedy the situation. And now a third stalk is wedged onto the column to electrically tilt and telescope the wheel. The three stalks together create a kind of unholy Jenga arrangement.
Some other longtime SL annoyances remain, including triangle-shaped rear side windows that you barely notice -- until you return to the parked car to find they've been open for hours, leaving your car vulnerable to thieves. That mistake happens, invariably, when you close the roof and forget to retoggle the window switch after the main glass rises. You'd think Mercedes would discover the wonders of a universal windows-up switch, like the one in Audi cabriolets.
The cup holders are shallow and often powerless against rising G-forces. Hermetically sealed java is in order when a driver treads on the gas. The SL is explosively quick, and the optional Active Body Control ($4,090) pins it to the pavement.
Yet both despite and because of electronic distractions, the SL still doesn't drive like a Porsche or other pure sports cars. The throttle can feel indecisive, granting too little or too much power, the latter upsetting the balance. The Benz feels supersonic over twisty roads, but can also feel as if it's not fully connected to the pavement. That's largely due to the active steering, which is quick but smothers road feel in pools of digital butter.
None of this will surprise the doctors, athletes and entrepreneurs who choose the SL for what it is: a classic, comfortable roadster that confers instant status.
For such buyers, the SL's irreproachable status has long been a key. I'd say ''more power to them,'' but the SL has that covered as well.

HEADLINE: Looking Beyond Income, Toward a Tax on Wealth Itself

BYLINE: By ANNA BERNASEK

 BODY:
INCOME tax rates have recently been raised slightly for some affluent people, and there is pressure for additional increases. But some economists say raising marginal income tax rates on high earners may miss the mark.
One reason is that the truly wealthy employ all kinds of legal means to minimize their tax liability, including shifting income around the world, deferring gains on their assets and many other sophisticated strategies. Another, though, is that taxes on ordinary income simply don't apply to inheritance or investment, principal sources of wealth.
Under legislation that Congress approved on New Year's Day the top marginal income tax rate for 2013 has risen to 39.6 percent from 35 percent for individuals on ordinary income over $400,000 and for couples on income over $450,000, while tax deductions and credits start phasing out on income as low as $250,000. But what is being taxed is often just a small portion of the income and wealth of the very richest Americans; unearned income, including unrealized gains and gains on investments, is either not taxed or taxed at a fraction of the top rate on wages. 
Taxing wealth in addition to income is one way to make sure that the rich contribute more to government coffers. That would essentially be a tax on household assets like property, stocks, bonds, unincorporated businesses, trusts, art and yachts.
The idea is to aim at the wealthiest part of the population, perhaps the top 1 percent, a group that has seen the most significant and consistent accumulation of wealth over the last few decades.
''A wealth tax is an attempt to fill the holes in income tax,'' said Douglas A. Shackelford, a tax expert at the University of North Carolina. ''The primary hole is unrealized capital gains. That's behind the big buildup of dynastic wealth.''
COUNTRIES like Canada have a tax on asset appreciation, based on the value of the assets at the time of the owner's death. The United States does not, and the tax code contains a huge loophole through which to pass wealth to one's heirs.
Here is how that can work in practice:
A billionaire can borrow against his stocks, art and real estate, and spend that borrowed money without paying tax. All he has to do is pay interest on the loan. When he dies, his heirs can sell the assets to pay off the debt. Under an existing rule known as the ''step-up in basis,'' no matter how much the assets have appreciated in value, no one will owe income tax on that gain. And the rest of his fortune goes to his heirs without anyone ever paying income taxes on the appreciation in the assets.
Partly to close loopholes like this, Ronald I. McKinnon, an economist at Stanford, advocates a wealth tax in addition to income tax. He outlined his proposal in a recent op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal titled ''The Conservative Case for a Wealth Tax.''
Professor McKinnon's plan would require households to list all domestic and foreign assets annually. There would be a $3 million wealth exemption, which, in his estimation, would exclude more than 95 percent of the population. The remainder would be subject to a flat tax of about 3 percent of household wealth.
In Europe, in addition to a wealth tax, many countries have a value-added, or consumption tax. Because the idea of a consumption tax is politically unpopular in the United States, he said in an interview, ''I think the case is even stronger in the U.S.''
''Plus,'' he added, ''the income tax is a poor vehicle for hitting the wealthy.''
Other economists say that a wealth tax would also address other problems.
''Wealth inequality and lack of access to opportunity is destroying the meritocratic aspects of our economy,'' said Daniel Altman, an economist at New York University and a former member of the editorial board of The New York Times. ''That will cost us growth in the long run.''
Mr. Altman proposes replacing the income tax with a wealth tax. He estimates that a flat wealth tax of 1.5 percent would be more than enough to replace the revenue from current income, estate and gift taxes. But he proposes establishing tax brackets according to wealth levels. For instance, no tax might be imposed for a household's first $500,000 in wealth, 1 percent for the next $500,000 and 2 percent for wealth above $1 million.
Proponents of a wealth tax also say it would encourage innovation and risk-taking because it wouldn't tax wealth in its early phases, but only after it has been amassed.
There are several main criticisms. For one, valuing unfamiliar assets -- say, private businesses or art collections -- would not be easy. A related issue is liquidity, as an owner may not be able to readily obtain cash based on the value of the assets in question. And some fear a negative effect on capital formation.
There are also possible legal roadblocks. Matthew J. Franck, writing for National Review Online, said instituting a wealth tax might require a constitutional amendment. A similar concern haunted proponents of the income tax until ratification of the 16th Amendment in 1913.
IT is unclear whether the idea of a wealth tax will ever gain traction in the United States. But longtime deficit problems remain, and tax increases of some type may well be part of the solution. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States raised less tax revenue in 2010 as a proportion of gross domestic product than any other industrialized nation, aside from Chile and Mexico.
''Should we reform the income tax, the estate tax or bring in a third tax like the wealth tax?'' asked Professor Shackleford at the University of North Carolina. ''We have to do something. There's a tremendous amount of tax escaping because we don't tax the deceased and we don't tax the heirs.''

HEADLINE: Battling College Costs, a Paycheck at a Time

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
If Steve Boedefeld graduates from Appalachian State University without any student loan debt, it will be because of the money he earned fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and the money he now saves by eating what he grows or kills.
Zack Tolmie managed to escape New York University with no debt -- and a degree -- by landing a job at Bubby's, the brunch institution in TriBeCa, where he made $1,000 a week. And he had entered N.Y.U. with sophomore standing, thanks to Advanced Placement credits. All that hard work also yielded a $25,000 annual merit scholarship.
The two are part of a rare species on college campuses these days, as the nation's collective student loan balance hits $1 trillion and continues to rise. While many students are trying to defray some of the costs, few can actually work their way through college in a normal amount of time without debt and little or no need-based financial aid unless they have an unusual combination of bravery, luck and discipline.
''I literally never went out,'' Mr. Tolmie says. ''There just was not time to do that.'' 
Plenty of influential people assume that teenagers can ask parents for loans if all else fails, as Mitt Romney suggested during the 2012 presidential campaign. Others recall working their way through college themselves, including Representative Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina who heads a House subcommittee on higher education and work force training. ''I spent seven years getting my undergraduate degree and didn't borrow a dime of money,'' she once said at a subcommittee meeting, adding that she was bewildered, given her own experience, by tales of woe she had heard from people with $80,000 in debt.
But students nowadays who try to work their way through college without parental support or loans face a financial challenge of a different order than the one that Ms. Foxx, 69, confronted as a University of North Carolina undergraduate more than 40 years ago. Today, a bachelor's degree from Appalachian State, the largest university in her district, can easily cost $80,000 for a state resident, including tuition, room, board and other costs. Back in her day, the total was about $550 a year. Even with inflation, that would translate to just over $4,000 for each year it takes to earn a degree.
And the paychecks that Mr. Tolmie managed in the big city are only a dream in towns like Boone, where employers have their pick of thousands of Appalachian State undergraduates. Even the most industrious, like Kelsey Manuel, a junior who drives 10 miles each way to a job in a resort where she earns $10 to $11 an hour, often cannot work enough to finish college debt-free.
No one tracks how many students are trying to work their way through without parental assistance or debt, but plenty work long hours while also attending classes full time. As of 2010, some 17 percent of full-time undergraduates of traditional age worked 20 to 34 hours a week, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. About 6 percent worked 35 hours or more.
Students who work fewer than 30 hours a week (excluding federal work-study jobs) while in college were 1.4 times more likely to graduate within six years than students who spent more than 30 hours a week in a job, according to an article by Pilar Mendoza, an assistant professor of higher education administration at the University of Florida, in The Journal of Student Financial Aid last year. Their grades are likely to be better, too, since they have more time to study.
But working less has financial consequences. ''You have two choices,'' Ms. Mendoza says of students whose families could not or would not contribute to their college costs. ''You either work, or you acquire debt.''
Banking on Brunch
Zack Tolmie chose to work. He first caught sight of New York University on television when he was a freshman in high school in Altamont, N.Y., outside Albany. While his parents wanted him to attend college, their savings suffered in the 2001 recession.
So Mr. Tolmie got a job at a Johnny Rockets restaurant. By the time he started college in 2007, he had saved $8,000, four times as much as his parents had accumulated for him.
Impressed by the pluck he had demonstrated in passing so many Advanced Placement tests, N.Y.U. guaranteed Mr. Tolmie $25,000 in merit scholarships each year, which left him with about $75,000 that he needed to earn over three years. ''I had a chart on my desk so that every time I sat down I would need to look at it,'' he says. ''Every two weeks I needed X amount. That first year, it would have been around $600 after taxes.''
He got his lucky break when a server from Bubby's spotted him working elsewhere and said he would probably be happier working with her. He let her boss know how eager he was. ''I made it clear I wanted to work as much as possible,'' he says. Waiters could earn $300 each on the weekend brunch shift, with its rapid turnover of tables and parade of mimosas.
As the new guy, he lacked the seniority to get those shifts. But he would show up for them anyway because colleagues would often bail out if a willing replacement was standing by. Then, he would work a double shift and stay until midnight. ''It was kind of funny,'' he says. ''I was waiting tables so I could go to school, and so many times I thought, 'If only I didn't have to go to school, I could just work day shifts.' ''
Mr. Tolmie picked a double major in math and economics, in part because he knew he could finish in three years. Inevitably, there were trade-offs, including his B-plus average. ''I could have probably done better if I had devoted an extra 10 hours each week,'' he says. ''But that wasn't really an option.''
He also didn't have much of a social life. ''The absolute worst was hearing about friends back at home and the colleges they went to, especially the ones that have proper campuses,'' he says. ''I didn't have a friend that I'd bring home for Christmas break.''
Mr. Tolmie received his degree in 2010 and works as a mortgage broker. He looks at people around him and is glad he didn't take another approach to paying for college.
''There is someone I worked with at the restaurant who went to school for music,'' he says. ''But music doesn't pay well. And with the hours as a waiter, he can't do what he wants to do as a musician. He's working, enslaved to the student loan debt, all for a career he's not able to pursue.''
Homegrown Groceries
Appalachian State costs less than half what N.Y.U. does, but there are not many jobs in Boone, N.C., where a teenager can make $300 in a couple of hours.
Steve Boedefeld's solution was to earn much of the money he needed before he got there. A native of Ridgedale, Mo., he was a straight-A student in high school and an avid reader of military history, particularly Vietnam chronicles. ''I remember reading all of those books,'' he says. ''And I didn't want my grandson to look back and ask me why I didn't go when my country was at war.'' The financial benefits to enlisting with the elite Army Rangers were attractive, too.
''My folks tried everything to keep me from joining the Army,'' he says. ''They told me that I could go to school wherever I wanted and that they would pay for it. But I was pretty much dead-set that I could do it on my own. Their parents didn't float their bill, so why should I be different?''
Mr. Boedefeld enlisted in 2006 and finished his service in 2010, after three tours of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, each lasting three to six months. The discipline that allowed him to endure Ranger training and survive combat has carried over to his financial life. As a soldier in a war zone away from his wife, Jennifer, he earned as much as $5,000 a month, much of it tax-free thanks to longstanding rules governing combat pay. They put away $10,000 to $15,000 annually. ''One of my friends calls me an economy killer,'' he said.
The Boedefelds arrived in Boone with enough money for a down payment on a fixer-upper. They moved there because Appalachian State offered a degree in renewable energy that interested Mr. Boedefeld, now 25. He joined the North Carolina National Guard to get in-state tuition rates, and his service enables him to buy reasonably priced health insurance for his wife and two sons.
With his National Guard service, his $2,000 a month or so in G.I. Bill benefits and the $10 an hour he makes working 15 to 20 hours a week for an electrician, the family is debt-free, save for their mortgage. They have found a number of low-cost ways to stretch the budget they keep posted on the refrigerator.
''We definitely live on what we can grow in the garden and what I can hunt for,'' he says, over a dinner of homemade venison enchiladas topped with salsa made of vegetables from the garden outside. ''I try to plan so that we make at least two deer meals a week.''
He is also known in the neighborhood as the guy to call when a tree is down. He cuts and splits it to fuel the wood stove that heats the family's house.
Even after all of the chopping, hunting and parenting, Mr. Boedefeld is on schedule to graduate in the spring and hopes to teach technology, engineering and design to high school students. He has maintained a 3.8 grade-point average, in part by having little contact outside of class with other students.
He worries about those who arrive on campus without any direction. ''I think some students are naïve,'' he says. ''It's half their fault and half because they just don't know what college is meant for. People are going to school because they think they should, when you should go to school for an investment.''
Investing in Oneself
When Kelsey Manuel, 21, transferred from a community college near her home in Lexington, N.C., to Appalachian State, she worried about enrolling without a clear career goal. But she soon settled on a hospitality major, having worked as a waitress near her home. She made $16,000 in 2011.
Those earnings, however, kept her from being eligible for much federal financial aid, and she was only able to earn just over $12,000 in 2012 at a similar job at a hotel about 10 miles from campus. Her parents have not been able to help her pay for college, and she is now on pace to end up with at least $30,000 in student loan debt.
Esther Manogin, director of the office of student financial aid at Appalachian State, worries that students fail to place debt in context. ''You could not buy a new S.U.V.,'' she says, for the average debt level of the university's graduates, which is likely to be around $25,000 for this year's freshmen who borrow and finish their degrees. ''I don't encourage them to take out loans if they don't need them. But if that's the only way they can get an education and realize their dream, then I think it's an excellent investment in themselves.''
According to the College Board, the average debt among all bachelor's degree recipients from public universities was $13,600 for the 2010-11 school year. The average among all those who borrowed was $23,800, and many of them were probably getting at least some financial assistance from their parents. The average full-time undergraduate at a four-year public university during the 2012-13 school year is paying a net price of $12,110 for tuition, room, board and other fees after taking grant aid and tax credits into consideration, though not everyone who wants or needs to work to pay for college will qualify.
As it is for many students who work long hours and have little spending money to show for it, Ms. Manuel's financial situation sets her apart and exposes her to any number of slights. Joining a sorority is out of the question, given the dues and the fact that many social functions occur during prime working hours.
Then there are the comments about her banged-up Toyota with nearly 134,000 miles on it. ''I heard someone say recently: 'Don't let her drive her car. You should see it!' '' she says. ''I don't have money to get it fixed.''
Friends from Lexington wonder why she doesn't often return to visit, without realizing that if she didn't work she would literally be losing money. And peers at school ask why she cannot spend the money she's earned. ''Before it's even made, it has a home,'' she says.
She worries that her long hours on the job may put her academic performance and future employment prospects in jeopardy.
Indeed, this is Ms. Manogin's biggest fear about students like this. ''I just don't see how they cannot let their grades suffer,'' she says. ''Research says that for every hour of class, you need to allocate three hours of study.''
She declined to comment on Representative Foxx's nose-to-the-grindstone, debt-free exhortation. ''Probably anything I say about Virginia Foxx will get me fired,'' she says.
Ms. Manuel, though, didn't hesitate to note the long odds of earning enough while enrolled in college full-time to avoid student loans. ''If I could make that kind of money, believe me, I'd do it.'' A spokeswoman for Representative Foxx declined an interview request.
Ms. Manuel says she does wish that she had saved more money from previous jobs. But so far, she doesn't regret having enrolled at Appalachian State.
''I know that in the end, I'm probably going to be in a better situation,'' she says. ''I'm going to know the value of a dollar. These are the things that you just need to learn to grow up.''
Degrees of Debt: This series is examining the implications of soaring college costs and the indebtedness of students and their families.

HEADLINE: Longtime Wall Street Deal Maker Expands Advisory Firm

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Robert Wolf, a former chairman of UBS, was expected to formally announce on Monday the hiring of several executives for his firm, 32 Advisors, including former members of the Obama administration. 

 BODY:
During his 29-year career on Wall Street, Robert Wolf has amassed a contact list full of boldface names from the worlds of finance and politics, up to and including President Obama.
Now the deal maker is drawing upon that list as he expands the advisory shop he formed last summer.
Mr. Wolf was expected to formally announce on Monday the hiring of several executives for his firm, 32 Advisors, including former members of the Obama administration. Among them are Austan D. Goolsbee, the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; Barry Johnson, who headed a White House initiative to encourage foreign investment in the United States; and Kevin Varney, until recently the senior vice president and chief of staff of the Export-Import Bank. 
"I realized there were many gaps in our country, gaps which I wouldn't have been as aware of were I not working with the president," Mr. Wolf said in an interview on Friday.
The new firm is a big change for Mr. Wolf, who has spent virtually all of his career working for two major banks. At this time last year, he enjoyed a palatial office spanning much of an entire floor of a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper, one of the perks of being UBS's chairman of the Americas.
Now he runs 32 Advisors from a smaller corner office, though it still brims with reminders of his proximity to power: photos of himself with Mr. Obama, President Bill Clinton and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, as well as a big autographed picture of David Ortiz of the Boston Red Sox.
Mr. Wolf, a former bond salesman who rose through the ranks at Salomon Brothers and then UBS, gained a new perch of prominence in 2006, when he befriended Mr. Obama, then a senator on the cusp of unfurling a run for the presidency. The banker became one of the president's most outspoken advocates on Wall Street, even as others in finance switched allegiance to Mitt Romney last year.
His new shop is aimed at helping a small number of clients on a variety of issues. Mr. Goolsbee, for instance, will lead the economic intelligence unit and dispense detailed forecasts and analysis. Mr. Johnson will aid foreign companies through the thicket of red tape involved in making big investments in the United States. Many clients of the firm -- there are 10 so far, including UBS -- will contract for only one topic area.
Mr. Goolsbee said that after leaving the Obama administration, he had considered ways to consult with clients while teaching at the University of Chicago. Then his friend, Mr. Wolf, came up with a solution that appeared to work for both of them.
"He had approached me, and he said, 'Why not plug in with 32 Advisors doing economic intelligence?' " Mr. Goolsbee said in a telephone interview. "There was demand for that private sector kind of thing, and it seemed like a natural fit."
Mr. Wolf described his pitch to prospective partners this way: "Guys, I've watched you for years. Now I want to help you build a business."
Over time, the firm will add new services, growing to about 10 streams of business. Some that 32 Advisors can't supply, like a broker-dealer or lobbying, will be handled by external partners.
Mr. Wolf said he is looking forward to his new role as entrepreneur.
"We answer our own phones. It's humbling," he said with a laugh. "I'm nervously optimistic. But I'm a pretty confident guy."

HEADLINE: Gridlock on the Rio Grande

BYLINE: By VERONICA ESCOBAR. 
Veronica Escobar, a Democrat, is the county judge in El Paso.

 BODY:
EL PASO
TALK of comprehensive immigration reform is welcome news -- especially because it could offer a possible path for citizenship for undocumented immigrants and more visas for highly skilled workers. 
But the debate's focus on enforcement is ill-advised and its approach is still too narrow. By emphasizing enforcement, federal resources won't go where they are truly needed: America's international ports of entry, where millions of dollars in goods enter and leave the country each day.
These ports are overburdened and underfinanced. While billions are spent on walls and drones, the movement of people and goods is choked. Instead of further militarization of our southern border, we need to invest in the movement of people and goods through our land ports. The El Paso area's five ports of entry handle tremendous traffic: in the 2011 fiscal year, they had 6.8 million pedestrian crossings, 811,000 truck crossings and almost 11 million car crossings, which translated into $80 billion in trade.
Much of that trade arrives in the form of trucks that go on to points deep inside the country. But a substantial amount stays in El Paso: some 350,000 visitors walk across the Paso del Norte bridge into downtown every month.
But these ports haven't received significant federal investment in personnel or technology for years. Facilities are outdated and understaffed. A Texas Department of Transportation assessment found that two were already at ''operational failure,'' with average peak wait times of more than an hour for commercial traffic and two hours for passenger traffic.
One has only to view the rush hour between El Paso and Ciudad Juárez, its Mexican counterpart: long lines of idling vehicles and exasperated pedestrians, infuriating at best, hazardous -- during sweltering summer months -- at worst.
Last year Steve Ortega, an El Paso City Council member, frustrated by the lack of meaningful response to the long wait times, drove repeatedly across the border to experience the process himself. Each morning he waited at least twice as long as what was being reported, mainly because most of the available lanes were closed for lack of staff.
El Paso isn't alone; ports of entry all along the border need investment. But for too long, policy makers, including the Obama administration, have fixated on security and enforcement to the exclusion of all else.
The result is a significant and chronic loss of jobs and trade on both sides of the border. But long waits could be eliminated if the federal government would aggressively invest in personnel, port infrastructure and technology.
El Paso County is building a new port of entry, but the federal government has to pay for its personnel. Will it be another clogged artery in a country that fails to recognize the enormous benefits of cross-border movement, or will it be adequately staffed through more rational immigration reform?
When government prioritizes enforcement and minimizes the benefits of the people and goods flowing through those ports, it does so at its own peril. Just as a path to citizenship for the undocumented would create millions of new taxpayers, a smoother path through our ports would create stronger economies.

HEADLINE: A Tax To Pay For War

BYLINE: By R. RUSSELL RUMBAUGH. 
R. Russell Rumbaugh, an Army veteran and a former analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency and the Senate Budget Committee, is a senior associate at the Stimson Center, studying federal spending on military and foreign affairs.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
NOW that Congress has discarded the idea that taxes can never be raised, we must change how we pay for the wars we ask our military to fight. We should institute a war tax.
With leading officials calling for action in Syria, and the American military providing support for France's intervention in Mali, the need for such a tax is urgent. And President Obama's call for tax reform as the next round of budget negotiations begins offers a perfect opportunity to enact it.
Military spending has been declining since 2009, easing the conflict between pursuing our national security interests and solving our fiscal crisis. But if we undertake new military interventions, that tension will come roaring back. 
Those who look at our military spending as a percent of gross domestic product and argue that we could spend more are right. At our current level of $646 billion, we are spending roughly 4 percent of G.D.P. on national defense, well below cold war averages. The missing part of their argument is whether we can afford to pay for it now or would have to borrow, adding to the national debt. After all, war spending -- like all government spending -- wrecks public finances only when more money is spent than is brought in.
This simple equation is nothing new. Three years ago, the Senate Budget Committee adopted a bipartisan amendment requiring that wars be paid for. The Simpson-Bowles deficit-reduction commission and Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, both proposed doing much the same thing. None of these proposals resolved the question of whether to pay for future wars through spending cuts or raising more revenue. Now that Congress has finally passed legislation letting taxes increase, we must make a choice and require a tax surcharge to pay for any military operation.
War traditionally has motivated major changes in tax policy. The Civil War brought the first income tax. World War I made the federal income tax permanent. World War II brought tax withholding. In 1969, at the height of the Vietnam War, the United States ran a budget surplus because of a tax surcharge Congress forced President Lyndon B. Johnson to accept.
Today's budget negotiations offer a similar opportunity to make a surcharge permanent. President Obama called for counting as savings the money that will not be spent as the war in Afghanistan winds down. Many decried the scheme as playing with funny money because he plans to exit Afghanistan in 2014 anyway; the savings only exist because of an accounting trick in Congressional budgeting. But if those savings were associated with an actual policy change, they would start looking more real.
Since the Budget Control Act already caps military spending, there is an easy way to implement the surcharge: any spending over the caps would require it. If we felt the need to use the military and could do so under the spending caps, as the Obama administration did in 2011 responding to the earthquake in Japan and the uprising in Libya, no surcharge would be necessary. But if military action required supplemental financing, any amount over the caps would be offset with new revenue raised by an automatic surcharge on taxes.
By tying military action to additional revenue, the president would actually have a freer hand in deciding when to use force. Every argument the Obama administration makes for military action would explicitly include a call for increased taxes, forcing the question of whether the stakes in the military situation are worth the cost. If the American people agree they are worth it, the president will get both the political support and financing he needs.
Syria is the most immediate example. We now know that some top officials have argued for arming the rebels, as the secretaries of state and defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff did last year. Others argue for an even more robust military response, while detractors insist that we should learn from Iraq and not get involved at all.
Such decisions should not be divorced from economic considerations, but neither should we allow our finances to prevent us from pursuing vital American security interests. Putting in place a permanent tax surcharge to pay for wars would ensure that we could achieve our interests throughout the world without further worsening our finances.
If military action is worth our troops' blood, it should be worth our treasure, too -- not just in the abstract, but in the form of a specific ante by every American.

HEADLINE: An Advisory Firm Expands, Drawing on Obama Contacts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
During his 29-year career on Wall Street, Robert Wolf has amassed a contact list full of boldface names from the worlds of finance and politics, up to and including President Obama.
Now the deal maker is drawing upon that list as he expands the advisory shop he formed last summer.
Mr. Wolf was expected to formally announce on Monday several hires for his firm, 32 Advisors, including former members of the Obama administration. Among them are Austan D. Goolsbee, the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; Barry Johnson, who headed a White House initiative to encourage foreign investment in the United States; and Kevin Varney, until recently the senior vice president and chief of staff of the Export-Import Bank. 
"I realized there were many gaps in our country, gaps which I wouldn't have been as aware of were I not working with the president," Mr. Wolf said in an interview on Friday.
The new firm is a big change for Mr. Wolf, who has spent virtually all of his career working for two major banks. At this time last year, he enjoyed a palatial office spanning much of an entire floor of a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper, one of the perks of being UBS's chairman of the Americas.
Now he runs 32 Advisors from a smaller corner office, though it still brims with reminders of his proximity to power: photos of himself with Mr. Obama, President Bill Clinton and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, as well as a big autographed picture of David Ortiz of the Boston Red Sox.
Mr. Wolf, a former bond salesman who rose through the ranks at Salomon Brothers and then UBS, gained a new perch of prominence in 2006, when he befriended Mr. Obama, then a senator on the cusp of unfurling a run for the presidency. The banker became one of the president's most outspoken advocates on Wall Street, even as others in finance switched allegiance to Mitt Romney last year.
His new shop is aimed at helping a small number of clients on a variety of issues. Mr. Goolsbee, for instance, will lead the economic intelligence unit and dispense detailed forecasts and analysis. Mr. Johnson will aid foreign companies through the thicket of red tape involved in making big investments in the United States. Many clients of the firm -- there are 10 so far, including UBS -- will contract for only one topic area.
Mr. Goolsbee said that after leaving the Obama administration, he had considered ways to consult with clients while teaching at the University of Chicago. Then his friend, Mr. Wolf, came up with a solution that appeared to work for both of them.
"He had approached me, and he said, 'Why not plug in with 32 Advisors doing economic intelligence?' " Mr. Goolsbee said in a telephone interview. "There was demand for that private sector kind of thing, and it seemed like a natural fit."
Mr. Wolf described his pitch to prospective partners this way: "Guys, I've watched you for years. Now I want to help you build a business."
Over time, the firm will add new services, growing to about 10 streams of business. Some that 32 Advisors can't supply, like a broker-dealer or lobbying, will be handled by external partners.
Mr. Wolf said he is looking forward to his new role as entrepreneur.
"We answer our own phones. It's humbling," he said with a laugh. "I'm nervously optimistic. But I'm a pretty confident guy."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Brazil, Where a Judge Made $361,500 in a Month, Fumes Over Pay

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Lis Horta Moriconi and Taylor Barnes contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.

 BODY:
SÃO PAULO, Brazil -- There are many ways of striking it rich in Brazil, but one strategy may come as a particular surprise in today's economic climate: securing a government job.
While civil servants in Europe and the United States have had their pay slashed or jobs eliminated altogether, some public employees in Brazil are pulling down salaries and benefits that put their counterparts in developed countries to shame.
One clerk at a court in Brasília, the capital, earned $226,000 in a year -- more than the chief justice of the nation's Supreme Court. Likewise, São Paulo's highway department paid one of its engineers $263,000 a year, more than the nation's president.
Then there were the 168 public employees in São Paulo's auditing court who received monthly salaries of at least $12,000, and sometimes as much as $25,000 -- more than the mayor of the city, Brazil's largest, was earning. Indeed, the mayor at the time joked that he planned to apply for a job in the parking garage of the City Council building when his term ended in December after the São Paulo legislature revealed that one parking valet earned $11,500 a month. 
As Brazil's once-booming economy stalls, these ''super salaries,'' as they have become known here, are feeding newfound resentment over inequality in the nation's unwieldy bureaucracies. Powerful unions for certain classes of civil servants, strong legal protections for government workers, a swelling public sector that has created many new well-paying jobs, and generous benefits that can be exploited by insiders have all made Brazil's public sector a coveted bastion of privilege.
But the spoils are not distributed equally. While thousands of public employees have exceeded constitutional limits on their pay, many more are scraping to get by. Across the country, schoolteachers and police officers generally earn little more than $1,000 a month, and sometimes less, exacerbating the country's pressing security concerns and long-faltering education system.
''The salary distortions in our public bureaucracy have reached a point where they are an utter and absolute disgrace,'' said Gil Castello Branco, director of Contas Abertas, a watchdog group that scrutinizes government budgets.
Privileged public employees, once called maharajahs in a nod to the opulence of India's old nobility, have long existed in Brazil. But as Brazil nourishes ambitions of climbing into the ranks of developed nations, a new freedom of information law requires public institutions to reveal the wages of their employees, from rank-and-file civil servants like clerks to cabinet ministers.
Though some officials are resisting the new rules, new disclosures at public institutions have revealed case after case of public employees earning more than Supreme Court justices, who made about $13,360 a month in 2012, an amount established in the Constitution as the highest salary that public employees can receive. In the Senate and Chamber of Deputies alone, more than 1,500 employees earned more than the constitutional limit, according to Congresso em Foco, a watchdog group.
State judges can do even better. One in São Paulo recently pulled down $361,500 in a month. That is not a typo: some judges in Brazil are paid more in a single month than their counterparts in high-income countries earn in an entire year. (The top annual salaries for judges in New York State are climbing to around $198,600.)
The recent revelations, including of an auditor in Minas Gerais State who earned $81,000 in one month and a librarian who got $24,000 in another, have spurred a strong reaction in some quarters. Joaquim Barbosa, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, revoked the super-salaries of the 168 employees in São Paulo's auditing court in December. Another fed-up federal judge issued an injunction in October suspending payments to 11 cabinet ministers, but the attorney general said he would seek to overturn the ruling.
Some historians blame Portugal, the former colonial ruler, for creating a powerful public bureaucracy in which mandarins wield great influence and earn outsize salaries. Brazil's byzantine judicial system also provides ways for certain senior civil servants to circumvent constitutional pay limits. Some collect pensions from previous stints in government -- often their full salary at the time of retirement -- after shifting into another high-paying public job.
Then there are the extra allowances for housing and food, the generous reimbursement rates for distance driven on the job and, of course, the loopholes. One provision dating to 1955 enables some public employees to take a three-month leave every five years. But those who forgo the leave, now intended to encourage workers to take postgraduate courses, can seek to collect extra money instead.
Some high-ranking members of the governing Workers Party, including Finance Minister Guido Mantega, have been able to get around the constitutional limit by receiving an extra $8,000 a month for serving on the boards of state enterprises, and many legislators are entitled to annual bonuses of more than $26,000 so they can purchase attire like business suits.
Still, in the developing world, Brazil's Civil Service is envied in some aspects for its professionalism. Rigorous exams for an array of coveted government jobs generally weed out unprepared applicants. Pockets of excellence, like some public research organizations, have won acclaim in areas like tropical agriculture.
But some taxpayers fume over the privileges in the public sector, whose ranks swelled by 30 percent in the past decade to encompass 9.4 million employees in a country of 194 million. Powerful unions stymie efforts to fire civil servants, making such jobs exceptionally stable and well protected.
While Brazil's government comfortably finances itself through tax collection and issuing debt, services like education and sewage treatment remain woeful. Despite imposing high taxes, Brazil ranked last among 30 rich industrialized and developing countries in the quality of services citizens get for the taxes they pay, according to the nonprofit Brazilian Institute of Tax Planning.
Some lawmakers have come under personal scrutiny. Fernando Collor de Mello, a former president who once denounced the maharajahs and is now a senator, was recently found to be spending more than $30,000 a month of public money to employ a gardener and two archivists.
In Maranhão, one of Brazil's poorest states, legislators have granted themselves the equivalent of 18 monthly salaries -- each of about $10,000 -- in a single year, justifying the move as a cost-of-living allowance.
The new freedom of information law, supported by President Dilma Rousseff, who earns about $174,000 a year, is intended to expose such practices. Not surprisingly, some entrenched government interests have dragged their feet in complying with the law.
When Congress finally decided in 2012 to allow people to obtain the salary information of its employees, it also required them to find the name of each employee and submit it online. In other words, if someone wanted the information on the legislature's 25,000-strong work force, then that person had to independently identify them and submit 25,000 separate online requests.
If only it were that easy here in São Paulo. One clerk at the state's high court, Ivete Sartório, was reportedly paid about $115,000 after convincing her superiors that she should be compensated for not taking leaves of absence. But when asked recently about her wages, a spokesman for the court, Rômulo Pordeus, said that Ms. Sartório's ''matriculation number'' was needed to request the information.
When asked how any curious taxpayer could get that number, he replied that it was in Ms. Sartório's possession, and that he did not want to bother her about it. ''I'm not going to ask for her matriculation number, because it's annoying, understand?'' Mr. Pordeus said. ''No one likes to say how much they earn.''

HEADLINE: Remembering Marshall Miles, Player and Writer

BYLINE: By PHILLIP ALDER

 BODY:
Marshall Miles of Redlands, Calif., one of the most imaginative bridge players, died on Tuesday. He was 86.
He earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Claremont Men's College (now Claremont McKenna College) and a law degree from the University of California, Los Angeles. He practiced law for 37 years. He was married to Betty Harris for 28 years, until her death in 2000. 
Miles, a member of the American Contract Bridge League's Hall of Fame, won seven North American titles, most in partnership with Eddie Kantar, and was a member of the victorious senior team at the 2004 World Bridge Games in Istanbul. But he will be remembered more for his excellent books and magazine articles. Particularly fascinated by bidding, he made many innovative suggestions; for example he advocated four-card-suit overcalls on hands unsuitable for a takeout double, even at the two-level.
He made sensible points that are not often found in the literature. In ''Competitive Bidding in the 21st Century,'' in the section about two-suited overcalls, he wrote, ''When you show a two-suiter and the opponents play the hand, they can often play dummy-double by finessing against your partner's queens and jacks in the other two suits. You should not reveal your shape unless there is a likelihood that your side will play the hand, either to make what you bid or as a sacrifice.''
Miles was also a perfect gentleman, never berating partner and always willing to discuss bridge with anyone, whether an expert or a beginner.
A top-class declarer, Miles took full advantage of an unwise penalty double in the diagramed deal.
How did Miles (South) analyze the play in five hearts doubled after West led the club king?
East's double made it clear that he had all five missing trumps and the diamond ace. (He would not have doubled purely on the basis of one trump trick.) It was also highly likely that West had an eight-card suit for his five-club overcall.
Accordingly South won the first trick and played five rounds of hearts. This gave East the lead, but he had no riposte. Miles had to take five spades, four hearts, one diamond and one club.
Note that if East had not doubled, South might have been nervous that West had the diamond ace. And if he did, then this line of play would have resulted in down six.
Miles's colorful personality and pen will be missed.

HEADLINE: Fusions That Defy Categories

BYLINE: By STEVE SMITH

 BODY:
The musical world has changed surprisingly quickly since New Amsterdam, a vital composer-led record label and live-event presenter, teamed up with the Kaufman Center to produce the first Ecstatic Music Festival in 2011. The fundamental notion of the series was to facilitate and encourage collaboration among musicians with disparate styles, bridging art-music and vernacular traditions. 
That idea anticipated a trend that has grown more widespread and pervasive. As Judd Greenstein, the festival's curator, notes in an essay posted on the Kaufman Center Web page, ''This development means that we don't have to make the case for our principles anymore but instead are operating in a world that largely takes them for granted.''
Few of the fusions included in this year's festival fit any definition of commonplace. But when the composer Sarah Kirkland Snider shared a bill with the genre-flouting vocalist and songwriter Shara Worden, the indie-pop singer D M Stith, the indefinable consort Clogs and Orchestra for the Next Century at Merkin Concert Hall on Wednesday evening, the mix was cozy and seamless.
This program -- presented in collaboration with the WNYC radio series ''New Sounds Live'' and streamed on the Internet radio station Q2 -- was a particularly familial collusion. Ms. Snider and Ms. Worden worked together on ''Penelope,'' a ravishingly melancholy 2010 song cycle. Mr. Stith has sung with Ms. Worden's band, My Brightest Diamond. Ms. Worden studied composition with the Clogs violist and vocalist Padma Newsome. And the orchestra included players well known within New York's highly permeable new-music circle.
What drew all these artists together was ''Unremembered,'' a new song cycle by Ms. Snider based on a sequence of 10 poems by Nathaniel Bellows. Initially conceived as a vocal octet, the work grew into an orchestral cycle tailored to the voices of Ms. Worden, Mr. Newsome and Mr. Stith, Ms. Snider explained onstage. Five more singers supported the soloists.
Performed on the concert's second half, ''Unremembered'' reeled through elusive and evocative glimpses of a rural childhood among trees and ponds, with subtle electronics and sounds of nature linking the songs. Employing a broader temperamental palette than she used for ''Penelope'' Ms. Snider still showed a predilection for the wistful and melancholy. Again she made striking use of Ms. Worden's distinctive voice, conveying innocence, ambiguity and insight.
The work attested to Ms. Snider's thorough command of musical mood setting, organically integrating the structural economy and direct impact of pop songs with deft, subtle orchestrations that lent emotional gravity and nuance. Delicate sketches and animated videos by Mr. Bellows, projected overhead, strengthened a pervasive sense of memory's mutability. The orchestra, conducted by Gary M. Schneider, played with sensitivity and expressiveness.
Cohesion was sometimes shaky during an opening sequence of opera excerpts and Clogs songs by Mr. Newsome, whose folksy croon suited his madrigalesque writing. But in Mr. Stith's ''Mountains of Mind,'' sweetly arranged by Mr. Greenstein to complement Mr. Stith's vulnerable falsetto, and in three vivid, ambitious songs by Ms. Worden the orchestra supplied elegant accompaniment.
The Ecstatic Music Festival runs through March 21 at Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan; (212) 501-3330, ecstaticmusicfestival.org.

HEADLINE: Complex Investments Prove Risky as Savers Chase Bigger Payoff

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
Regulators across the country are confronting a wave of investor fraud that is saddling retirement savers with steep losses on complex products that until a few years ago were pitched only to the most sophisticated investors.
The victims are among the millions of Americans whose mutual funds and stock portfolios plummeted in the wake of the financial crisis, and who started searching for ways to make better returns than those being offered by bank deposits and government bonds with minuscule interest rates.
Tens of thousands of them put money into speculative bets promoted by aggressive financial advisers. The investments include private loans to young companies like television production firms and shares in bundles of commercial real estate properties.
Those alternative investments have now had time to go sour in big numbers, state and federal securities regulators say, and are making up a majority of complaints and prosecutions. 
''Since the crisis, we've seen more and more people reaching out into different types of exotic investments that are a big concern to us,'' said William F. Galvin, the Massachusetts secretary of the commonwealth.
Last Wednesday, Mr. Galvin's office ordered one of the nation's largest brokerage firms, LPL Financial, to pay $2.5 million for improperly selling the real estate bundles, known as nontraded REITs, or real estate investment trusts, to hundreds of state residents from 2006 to 2009, in some cases overloading clients' accounts with them.
LPL said it agreed, as part of the settlement, to reform its process for selling such alternative investments.
There are few good statistics on the extent of the problem nationally. But cases are mounting in the offices of regulators like A. Heath Abshure, the securities commissioner in Arkansas, where a majority of the 66 open securities cases involve complex investments sold to less sophisticated investors looking for a steady return.
J. Bradley Bennett, chief of enforcement at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, Wall Street's self-regulatory group, said that for the last two years, 10 staff members have looked at the ''proliferation of these products, to understand how they are being sold.''
''It's got our attention,'' he said. ''We recognize the trends.''
Brokers promoting bad investments to unsophisticated investors is nothing new. But while the easy prey used to be people looking to get rich quick, the pool has widened to include savers looking for ways to earn the kind of income once reliably available from traditional investments.
Regulators are warning investors that the dangers are unlikely to recede, given the Federal Reserve's pledge to keep interest rates near zero and the push among financial firms to earn more revenue from so-called alternative investments marketed to retail investors. Brokers are eager to sell these investments because they often bring in higher commissions than standard mutual funds and stocks.
The money that retail investors have in alternative investments in the United States, ranging from baskets of commodities to mutual funds that employ sophisticated trading, more than doubled from 2008 to 2012, to $712 billion from $312 billion, according to McKinsey & Company. Many of the products hold out the promise of higher returns while ostensibly being immune to the volatility of stock markets.
The phenomenon of investors' actively moving money in pursuit of higher interest rates, known as chasing yield, is reverberating through the economy. Jeremy C. Stein, a Federal Reserve governor, said in a speech on Thursday that he worried that investors desperate for yield could be creating a bubble in widely available investments like junk bonds.
Mary Beck, a furniture business consultant in Pasadena, Calif., said that in 2008, as the stock investments in her husband's I.R.A. began to fall quickly, the couple moved $470,000 to a new product recommended by their broker.
While the offering was unfamiliar -- part ownership in a fleet of luxury cars -- Ms. Beck bought the pitch because her broker had been around for years, and the product offered what seemed to be a modest annual interest rate of 7 percent.
''We knew that 12 percent wasn't realistic, but 7 percent seemed realistic,'' Ms. Beck said. ''To us, it was a very conservative way to ensure that we'd increase our savings.''
Soon after they stopped receiving interest payments, the Becks lost their money when the venture went bankrupt in 2012. Ms. Beck and her husband have been reconfiguring their retirement and are planning to work longer.
Her lawyer, Andrew Stoltmann, is representing 10 of the broker's customers, who have filed claims with the financial industry group, saying that the broker used their money on his own ''exotic, opulent'' lifestyle.
There is no agreed-upon list of the financial products that have caused problems for yield-chasing investors, but regulators say certain ones come up particularly often. Private placements, investments in largely unproven private companies, have been on the list of top enforcement concerns published by the national organization of state securities regulators every year since 2007.
Private placements are supposed to be available only to wealthy, sophisticated investors, but several loopholes, including relaxed procedures for verifying wealth, have allowed them to end up in the portfolios of less sophisticated retirement savers.
Gary Spiegel, 54, a woodworker in upstate New York, was persuaded to buy into three private placements after he grew tired of the volatile stock market and withdrew all of his money in March 2010. Much of that money, $100,000, went into a company that was supposed to produce a bilingual television show, ''Hacienda Heights,'' while paying a reliable 10 percent interest rate.
''The banks weren't giving interest, and I was getting turned off by stocks,'' said Mr. Spiegel, who says he ended up losing $318,000. He settled a legal dispute with his broker this month, just before an arbitration hearing.
Mr. Spiegel's lawyer, Stuart D. Meissner, said that before the financial crisis, he never saw a client with a private placement case, but that they are now commonplace.
REITs have been one of the most heavily sold products because there are few rules about who can buy them. Popular for years, they used to come primarily in funds that could be traded on public exchanges. The hot new version -- the type that got LPL Financial in trouble in Massachusetts -- can be bought and sold only in private transactions.
The outstanding amount of such nontraded REITs grew to $65 billion last year, from $43 billion in 2009, according to Direct Investments Spectrum. The private nature of these investments has been advertised as a good thing, because it means they are less likely to move up and down with the stock market. But it has also made it hard for investors to value their holdings or to get out when they need the money.
In addition to the Massachusetts case, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority issued a $14 million fine in October against a big purveyor of nontraded REITs in the New York area, David Lerner Associates.
The group warned in January about one of the newest products being sold to retail investors: so-called business development companies, which hold the debt of small companies. Money in such investments grew to $4.5 billion last year from $8 million in 2008, according to MTS Research Advisors.
John Morgan, the securities commissioner in Texas, said that based on the complaints coming into his office, the appeal of alternative products appeared to be undimmed. ''The people that we talk to are just trying to find a stable source of income,'' he said. ''The promoters have found a sweet spot here.''

HEADLINE: Olivetti's Artful Breakthroughs

BYLINE: By ALICE RAWSTHORN

 BODY:
MILAN -- Any Italian visitors who ventured into the garden of the Museum of Modern Art in New York in the autumn of 1952 would have discovered something surprisingly familiar: one of the gigantic tubular metal structures that usually flanked Italy's motorways advertising the typewriters, calculators and other office machines made by Olivetti.
The billboard was part of an exhibition to toast Olivetti's design achievements. At the time, the company was hailed as a role model of intelligent, imaginative management, and a lynchpin of Italy's post-war economic revival. Central to its success was its enlightened patronage of contemporary design and art, and the finesse with which they were integrated into its commercial interests. 
Olivetti's contribution to the design culture of post-war Italy is now being celebrated in another exhibition, ''Programmare l'arte: Olivetti and the new kinetic avant garde'' at Museo del Novecento in Milan. Running through March 3, the new show presents some of the works from a 1962 exhibition of kinetic art and design, which experiments with light and movement, presented at the Olivetti showroom on the opposite side of Piazza del Duomo in Galleria Vittorio Emanuele. It also traces the preparations for the 1962 exhibition in the correspondence of one of its co-curators, the influential Italian designer and design theorist Bruno Munari.
Museo del Novecento has created an engaging and intriguing exhibition that evokes the intellectual dynamism and the playful spirit of the young Italian designers and artists who were at the forefront of the early 1960s kinetic art movement, and Olivetti's interest in them. Munari's exchanges with the participants were jocular and friendly, and photographs of the 1962 opening, taken by Mario Dondero, show the designer Enzo Mari goofing around Olivetti's showroom with friends from Gruppo T, the experimental art group.
Using one of its most conspicuous commercial buildings to exhibit the work of a radical, yet obscure cultural movement, like kinetic art and design, would have seemed distinctly odd for most bastions of the Italian corporate establishment, but not Olivetti.
Founded in 1908 by Camillo Olivetti as a typewriter manufacturer in Ivrea, near Turin, the company soon became known for its technical innovations, including the introduction of the first portable typewriter in 1932. After Camillo's son, Adriano, took charge in the 1930s, Olivetti expanded internationally and diversified into new product sectors, including electronics and computing. Cultured, sophisticated and public spirited, Adriano Olivetti was an engineer who was fascinated by art, design and architecture, and drew on his knowledge of those fields in his corporate role.
As well as commissioning gifted illustrators and graphic designers to produce posters, brochures and advertising campaigns, Olivetti worked with talented architects, including Luigi Figini and Gino Pollino, who designed an elegant factory in the Modernist style at Ivrea with social housing for its employees.
But the most radical aspect of Olivetti's design strategy was the use of design in the product development process. Rather than restricting its industrial designers to the roles of stylists, who determined the appearance of its products after the engineers had developed them, Olivetti involved them from the start, ensuring that they contributed to decisions on tooling its cost-effective factories, as well as stylistic details. As most of its ''designers'' had trained in other disciplines, like the architect Marcello Nizzoli, who became Olivetti's chief design consultant in the late 1930s, their approach to design tended to be intuitive, ingenious and strong on lateral thinking.
Not only did MoMA devote an exhibition to Olivetti's design coups in 1952, it acquired several of its products for its permanent collection. By then, Olivetti was also influencing the way other businesses were run. When Thomas J. Watson Jr. was preparing to succeed his father as chief executive of I.B.M. in the mid-1950s, he visited Olivetti's New York showroom on Fifth Avenue and was so impressed by the space and its contents, that he flew to Italy to see its corporate headquarters. Determined to instill Olivetti's commitment to design quality and modern sensibility in I.B.M., Watson hired a former MoMA design curator, Eliot Noyes, as I.B.M.'s equivalent of Nizzoli.
For its part, the Olivetti company became even more adventurous in its approach to design throughout the 1950s, encouraged by Adriano Olivetti's son, Roberto, who shared his father's passion for both design and technology. By the end of the decade, the company had constructed a beautiful showroom on Piazza San Marco in Venice, designed by a local architect, Carlo Scarpa, and invited the Modernist grandee Le Corbusier to produce a design proposal for an electronics factory near Milan. Olivetti was also working with a young Italian architect Ettore Sottsass, who collaborated with Roberto Olivetti and the engineer Mario Tchou on a series of innovations, including the Elea 9003, Italy's first mainframe computer.
Sadly, Adriano Olivetti died in 1960, followed by Tchou a year later. Roberto sustained the company's cultural activities, notably by inviting some of the young artists and designers in the kinetic art movement, like those in Gruppo T and the Padua-based Gruppo N, to participate in workshops on the then-innovative concept of programming. Struck by the parallels between their work and Olivetti's research into computing, Roberto Olivetti agreed to support Munari's 1962 exhibition and to host it in the Milan showroom.
The exhibition toured around the world for three years, but by the end, the company was so stricken by debt, management problems and competition from Japanese imports that it had been forced to sell its once dazzling electronics division to General Electric. Yet its design legacy has lived on in other companies, starting with I.B.M., where Watson and Noyes forged long and productive collaborations with gifted designers, including Charles and Ray Eames, and Paul Rand.
There are still echoes of Olivetti's design strategy today, notably in the way that Vitra, the Swiss furniture group, has embedded architectural patronage within its corporate culture, as well as in the design and architecture buffs who flock to the exquisitely restored Scarpa showroom in Venice and to Museo del Novecento's tribute to Bruno Munari's kinetic art exhibition.

HEADLINE: In France, Seasonal Workers With a Ph.D.

BYLINE: By D.D. GUTTENPLAN

 BODY:
PARIS -- They come in the autumn, when the grapes lie heavy on the vines. They leave in late spring, after the cherries are off the trees in the Pyrenees and the hops harvested in Alsace. Under French law they are considered ''saisonniers,'' or seasonal workers. But instead of spending their days picking apples, they toil in the university classrooms of Paris, teaching French language and literature, art history and political science.
The use of adjuncts -- part-time faculty who have little possibility of tenure or permanent employment -- is increasingly common in U.S. colleges and universities. But European law gives workers more rights, and French workers are among the most protected in Europe -- unless, it seems, if they work for an American university.
Nadia Malinovich came to Paris 10 years ago. The author of a book on French and Jewish identity, she has a doctorate from the University of Michigan. Yet like many American academics in Paris, she found herself moving through a series of temporary jobs without full benefits or security, and where she was paid only for the hours she actually spent in the classroom. 
She has taught at a University of California program in Paris and New York University's Paris center.
''It was clear to me right away that this was not going to lead to a real job,'' she said of the U.S. programs. ''There's no security, no benefits. I only managed because my husband had a regular job.''
Dr. Malinovitch, who had also taught at the Institut d'études politiques, commonly known as Sciences Po, eventually found a job in the French system. As a maître de conférences (roughly the equivalent of an associate professor in the United States) at the Université de Picardie Jules Verne, she is considered a civil servant and enjoys all the protections of French labor laws.
That security may be why, out of more than a dozen academics teaching at American study-abroad programs in France interviewed for this article, she was the only one willing to be identified.
''The problem is that French law doesn't protect us, and American law doesn't know we exist,'' said a teacher at both the N.Y.U. and Columbia programs in Paris, who declined to be identified because she felt it would put her jobs at risk. ''If you get sick, you don't get paid. Women are entitled to at least 16 weeks' paid maternity leave under French law, but if they find out you are pregnant, they simply don't renew your contract for the next semester. None of us have any job security.''
Robert Hornsby, Columbia University's assistant vice president for media affairs, declined to comment.
Emilia Doerr, a spokeswoman for the University of California's Education Abroad Program, said by e-mail, ''We understand that the employment regulations in France are complex. The University of California Education Abroad Program partners with a third party to provide instructional support to our Paris program.''
John Beckman, vice president for public affairs at New York University, said by e-mail that many of the adjuncts who teach at the university's Paris campus ''are French nationals who have full-time appointments at French institutions of higher learning.'' He also said the university pays the French government at least 50 percent of faculty salaries to cover benefits like health care, pension contributions and unemployment insurance.
''It is unfounded to say that our adjunct faculty do not receive these benefits; my understanding is that they can (and do) take advantage of maternity leave, sick leave, professional development, just as all other French employees do,'' Mr. Beckman wrote.
French citizens who teach at the Paris campuses of U.S. universities say conditions are the same for them.
''If I get sick and have to miss a class, I don't get paid,'' said a French citizen who has taught at Columbia University's Reid Hall campus in Paris, as well as at the Paris programs run by N.Y.U., Wellesley and the University of Chicago.
''When I did my Ph.D., I taught in the French system, where if you got sick, you just got sick,'' said the instructor, who asked to be unidentified because he feared losing his job. ''With the American schools, the contract is for so many hours, so if you get sick, you have to make up any hours. Otherwise, if I miss a class, I don't get paid.''
He has not been offered a long-term contract in the five years that he has worked for U.S. school programs in France and juggles five classes a semester at four different institutions.
''We are like the migrants who pick apples, with a new contract every semester,'' he said.
According to the Adjunct Project Web site, adjuncts at Columbia in New York earn $5,000 to $7,500 per course, while N.Y.U. pays about $5,000 to $10,000. Salaries at the Paris campuses of both schools are about &#x20ac;80, or $108, an hour, or roughly $4,000 per semester for a three-hour-a-week class.
The pay, at &#x20ac;80 an hour, is only for contact hours, the French instructor said. ''We only get paid for when we actually teach -- not for marking papers or class preparation,'' he said.
In contrast, schools like the American University in Paris, a private institution chartered by both U.S. and French law, seem to operate under a stricter set of criteria.
Neil Gordon, dean and vice president for academic affairs of the American University in Paris, confirmed by e-mail that benefits at A.U.P. included virtually unlimited, state-subsidized, paid sick leave; maternity and paternity leave; unlimited unpaid leave with the guarantee of return to work for any parent of a child younger than 3; generous paid holidays; and a ''mutuelle,'' or third-party insurance, that brings the state medical insurance coverage up to 100 percent.
''While French salaries in academia, as elsewhere, are generally lower than American, the benefits that accompany the job render employment here highly competitive with America,'' he said.
The American University in Paris is required to offer most of its faculty permanent contracts known as C.D.I., or ''contrat à durée indeterminée.'' The overwhelming majority of A.U.P. faculty are on these contracts, like at most French universities.
A small number of A.U.P. staff, typically those who fill in for faculty members on parental leave or sabbatical, are hired under fixed-term, temporary contracts known as C.D.D., or ''contrat à durée determinée.''
According to Nadia Achache, director of human resources at the Université Paris Ouest Nanterre La Défense, ''if you work under a C.D.D. and they want to hire you again, they have to offer you a permanent contract.''
''Sometimes we need 'vacataires,''' she said about freelance contract workers. ''They only come for a couple of hours a week, for two or three months.''
But Linda Jarvin, dean of the Paris College of Art, said that more than half of the faculty there were on temporary contracts, with 45 percent working as freelancers. The college, which was formerly linked to Parsons The New School for Design in New York, awards both U.S. and French degrees.
She said that working freelance ''is a choice we offer them.''
''You get paid a higher rate, because we don't have to pay employee taxes,'' Dr. Jarvin said. ''That goes directly to the employee.''
''The majority of our teachers are adjuncts. It's important to expose our students to teachers who have active professional lives,'' she said, referring to the fact that many adjuncts also work as artists, designers or critics. ''Besides, this is a school, so we will never have a need to hire someone for the full 12 months.''
''It's true that French law allows academics to be hired under fixed-term contracts -- it's exactly the same rule as for agricultural workers,'' said Jean-Marc Wasilewski, a Paris-based human rights lawyer. ''But those are supposed to be limited to 18 months.''
''The problem is that it's up to the employee to prove they really have a permanent job,'' Mr. Wasilewski said of those who wanted full benefits. ''You can go to a labor tribunal -- what we call a 'Conseil de prud'hommes.' But you have to be able to prove the abuse.''
Many of the teachers at U.S. programs in France interviewed for this article said they feared going public.
''I know of many cases when faculty dissent of any kind led to nonrenewal of contracts,'' said an American Ph.D. holder who worked at a program in France, who asked not to be identified because he feared losing his job. Like the other Americans interviewed, he described himself as a ''vacataire,'' or freelance worker.
Mr. Wasilewski, the lawyer, said that freelance workers had even fewer rights than teachers on fixed-term contracts.
''The contract can be broken at any time,'' he said, adding that such positions were only supposed to exist inside public institutions.
French law requires anyone working as a freelancer in a university to have a permanent job elsewhere, partly to make sure their social insurance is covered. Even the conditions allowing for the use of fixed-term C.D.D. contracts were recently tightened under a law passed in March known as the Loi Sauvadet.
But Dr. Malinovich, the American professor teaching in France, said that U.S. study-abroad programs seemed to operate outside such strictures. ''The places I worked never asked if I had an 'employeur principal.' It's almost like they operate in a separate universe,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Ignorance Caucus

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Last week Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, gave what his office told us would be a major policy speech. And we should be grateful for the heads-up about the speech's majorness. Otherwise, a read of the speech might have suggested that he was offering nothing more than a meager, warmed-over selection of stale ideas.
To be sure, Mr. Cantor tried to sound interested in serious policy discussion. But he didn't succeed -- and that was no accident. For these days his party dislikes the whole idea of applying critical thinking and evidence to policy questions. And no, that's not a caricature: Last year the Texas G.O.P. explicitly condemned efforts to teach ''critical thinking skills,'' because, it said, such efforts ''have the purpose of challenging the student's fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority.'' 
And such is the influence of what we might call the ignorance caucus that even when giving a speech intended to demonstrate his openness to new ideas, Mr. Cantor felt obliged to give that caucus a shout-out, calling for a complete end to federal funding of social science research. Because it's surely a waste of money seeking to understand the society we're trying to change.
Want other examples of the ignorance caucus at work? Start with health care, an area in which Mr. Cantor tried not to sound anti-intellectual; he lavished praise on medical research just before attacking federal support for social science. (By the way, how much money are we talking about? Well, the entire National Science Foundation budget for social and economic sciences amounts to a whopping 0.01 percent of the budget deficit.)
But Mr. Cantor's support for medical research is curiously limited. He's all for developing new treatments, but he and his colleagues have adamantly opposed ''comparative effectiveness research,'' which seeks to determine how well such treatments work.
What they fear, of course, is that the people running Medicare and other government programs might use the results of such research to determine what they're willing to pay for. Instead, they want to turn Medicare into a voucher system and let individuals make decisions about treatment. But even if you think that's a good idea (it isn't), how are individuals supposed to make good medical choices if we ensure that they have no idea what health benefits, if any, to expect from their choices?
Still, the desire to perpetuate ignorance on matters medical is nothing compared with the desire to kill climate research, where Mr. Cantor's colleagues -- particularly, as it happens, in his home state of Virginia -- have engaged in furious witch hunts against scientists who find evidence they don't like. True, the state has finally agreed to study the growing risk of coastal flooding; Norfolk is among the American cities most vulnerable to climate change. But Republicans in the State Legislature have specifically prohibited the use of the words ''sea-level rise.''
And there are many other examples, like the way House Republicans tried to suppress a Congressional Research Service report casting doubt on claims about the magical growth effects of tax cuts for the wealthy.
Do actions like this have important effects? Well, consider the agonized discussions of gun policy that followed the Newtown massacre. It would be helpful to these discussions if we had a good grasp of the facts about firearms and violence. But we don't, because back in the 1990s conservative politicians, acting on behalf of the National Rifle Association, bullied federal agencies into ceasing just about all research into the issue. Willful ignorance matters.
O.K., at this point the conventions of punditry call for saying something to demonstrate my evenhandedness, something along the lines of ''Democrats do it too.'' But while Democrats, being human, often read evidence selectively and choose to believe things that make them comfortable, there really isn't anything equivalent to Republicans' active hostility to collecting evidence in the first place.
The truth is that America's partisan divide runs much deeper than even pessimists are usually willing to admit; the parties aren't just divided on values and policy views, they're divided over epistemology. One side believes, at least in principle, in letting its policy views be shaped by facts; the other believes in suppressing the facts if they contradict its fixed beliefs.
In her parting shot on leaving the State Department, Hillary Clinton said of her Republican critics, ''They just will not live in an evidence-based world.'' She was referring specifically to the Benghazi controversy, but her point applies much more generally. And for all the talk of reforming and reinventing the G.O.P., the ignorance caucus retains a firm grip on the party's heart and mind.

HEADLINE: A Growing Trend: Young, Liberal And Open to Big Government

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
MISSOULA, Mont. -- This funky college town, nestled along two rivers where five mountain ranges converge, has long been a liberal pocket, an isolated speck of blue in a deeply red state. Now Montana is electing more politicians who lean that way, thanks to a different-minded generation of young voters animated by the recession and social issues.
Sam Thompson, a 22-year-old environmental studies major at the University of Montana here, considers himself ''fiscally conservative'' but opposes cuts to Medicare; he expects to need health coverage when he grows old. Aaron Curtis, 27, a graduate student, admired Jon Huntsman, a moderate Republican, but could not stomach Mitt Romney's opposition to same-sex marriage.
Billie Loewen and Heather Jurva, editors at the student newspaper, speak of a Depression-era mentality that is pushing their generation to back Democrats. Saddled with student debt, they worry about health care and are terrified that they will not find good jobs. ''You might be just one accident away from losing everything,'' said Ms. Jurva, who has worked 40 hours a week waiting on tables to put herself through school. 
It is no secret that young voters tilt left on social issues like immigration and gay rights. But these students, and dozens of other young people interviewed here last week, give voice to a trend that is surprising pollsters and jangling the nerves of Republicans. On a central philosophical question of the day -- the size and scope of the federal government -- a clear majority of young people embraces President Obama's notion that it can be a constructive force, a point he intends to make in his State of the Union address on Tuesday.
''Young people absolutely believe that there's a role for government,'' said Matt Singer, a founder of Forward Montana, a left-leaning though officially nonpartisan group that seeks to engage young people in politics. ''At the same time, this is not a generation of socialists. They are highly entrepreneurial, and know that some of what it takes to create an environment where they can do their own exciting, creative things is having basic systems that work.''
Here in Montana, a state that backed John McCain in 2008 and Mr. Romney last year, voters under 30 have helped elect two Democratic senators and a new Democratic governor. Nationally, young voters have since 2004 been casting their ballots for Democrats by far wider margins than previous young generations -- a shift that could reshape American politics for decades.
Under-30 voters are ''the only age group in which a majority said the government should do more to fix problems,'' the nonpartisan Pew Research Center reported in November. In a Pew survey a year earlier, more than 8 in 10 said they believed that Social Security and Medicare had been good for the country, and they were especially supportive of seeing the programs overhauled so they would be intact when they retire. (Young people were also more open than their elders to privatizing the programs.)
And while Washington fights about how to cut the federal deficit, young voters believe that it is more important to create jobs, have affordable access to health care and develop ''a world-class education system,'' according to the Institute of Politics at Harvard.
Those sentiments were borne out in interviews here. When Forward Montana convened a focus group at a Missoula cafe to develop a ''youth agenda'' last week, the deficit did not register a mention. One attendee, Michael Graef, an 18-year-old who started a fitness business rather than attend college, said he rarely thought about the deficit.
''Education is top on my list,'' he said. ''If everybody is better educated, most of the other issues can work themselves out.''
Steve Bullock, the new Democratic governor, won after campaigning on a promise to freeze college tuition. Young voters also helped Senator Jon Tester, another Democrat, who narrowly ousted a Republican incumbent in 2006 and won re-election last year. Both times, polls stayed open hours past their official closing time to accommodate huge lines of students. Both times, Forward Montana ran huge voter registration drives -- an effort that may ''pay really big dividends'' for Democrats in the future, said Christopher Muste, a political scientist here.
The victories rattled Republican state lawmakers, who are now trying to undo a Montana law that permits voters to register on Election Day. Republicans say last-minute registration creates long lines and confusion.
On campus here last week, dozens of students crowded into a stuffy conference room to hear Jorge Quintana, a Democrat and chief counsel to the Montana secretary of state, warn that their ''voting rights are under attack.''
Nationally, voters under 30 accounted for 19 percent of the electorate last year, up from 18 percent in 2008. These millennials are by far the most ethnically and racially diverse voter cohort; whites account for just 58 percent of them, according to the Pew center, while 76 percent of older voters are white.
That diversity is partly why young voters skew liberal, said Scott Keeter, the center's director of survey research. As more young people come of age, the electorate will grow more diverse. Unless Republicans break the bonds between Democrats and minorities, Mr. Keeter said, ''this alignment is going to be baked into the younger generation.''
Kristen Soltis Anderson, who studies young voters for the Winston Group, which advises House Republicans, said her party ignores young voters at its peril. She sees ''a real risk'' that Republicans could lose millennials in the coming years.
So as Republican leaders focus on trying to attract more Hispanics and women, Ms. Anderson is urging them to develop a message that will appeal to the under-30 crowd by emphasizing nongovernmental alternatives to solving problems, as opposed to just limiting government.
''When you ask young voters what caused the recession, this whole idea that there wasn't enough regulation, or it was George W. Bush's fault, is present,'' she said. ''When conservatives make the argument, 'Hey, the government needs to get out of the way and let you make decisions for yourself,' a lot of young people don't have this idea of the government as a boogeyman. So it makes the conservative message less resonant.''
There is, of course, no guarantee that millennials will hold onto their current liberal tendencies. Studies show that voters are heavily influenced by the president with whom they came of age; the Franklin D. Roosevelt generation, for instance, stayed Democratic for decades, while many in the Reagan generation remained Republican.
But views can evolve; baby boomers, who supported big government in their 20s and 30s, have become more conservative over time, the Pew center has found. While today's young voters are more likely to identify as Democrats than Republicans or independents, their ideas and philosophies are not quite fixed yet, said John Della Volpe, the polling director at Harvard's Institute of Politics.
Here in Missoula, young people who voted for Mr. Obama last year said in interviews that they would be open to voting Republican, particularly if a candidate supports same-sex marriage. Young Republicans, too, hope their party will shift on that issue.
''The social issues are hard,'' said Ashley Nerbovig, a 19-year-old who backed Mr. Romney. ''It's not realistic that you can be against gay marriage and abortion.''
If the economy had been in better shape, she said, ''I would have picked Obama over Romney for social issues.''
Mr. Della Volpe said he saw opportunities for Republicans in the future if they could rebrand themselves. Democrats, meanwhile, are looking ahead, convinced by the data that their philosophy -- if not their party -- will prevail.
''My analysis has been for a while that it's going to come down to not whether the government should address certain problems, but how,'' said Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress in Washington. ''We'll shift from, 'Does government even have a role?' to 'Given that government needs to play a role, what's the best way of doing that?' ''
He added: ''I expect those to be the arguments 10 or 15 years from now. That would be a big shift, but I think it's coming.''

HEADLINE: Quietly Killing a Consumer Watchdog

 BODY:
If you'd like to know why Republicans are trying to shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, take a look at three things the agency has already accomplished in its first 18 months: 
¶It called a halt to predatory practices by mortgage lenders, ensuring that borrowers are not saddled with loans they can't afford and preventing brokers from earning higher commissions for higher interest rates.
¶It won an $85 million settlement from American Express, which it accused of deceptive and discriminatory marketing and billing practices.
¶It opened an investigation into questionable marketing practices by banks and credit card companies on college campuses, which often take place after undisclosed financial arrangements are made with universities.
The consumer bureau has taken seriously its mandate to protect the public from the kinds of abuses that helped lead to the 2009 recession, and it has not been intimidated by the financial industry's army of lobbyists. That's what worries Republicans. They can't prevent the bureau from regulating their financial supporters. Having failed to block the creation of the bureau in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, they are now trying to take away its power by filibuster, and they may well succeed.
The bureau cannot operate without a director. Under the Dodd-Frank law, most of its regulatory powers -- particularly its authority over nonbanks like finance companies, debt collectors, payday lenders and credit agencies -- can be exercised only by a director. Knowing that, Republicans used a filibuster to prevent President Obama's nominee for director, Richard Cordray, from reaching a vote in 2011. Mr. Obama then gave Mr. Cordray a recess appointment, but a federal appeals court recently ruled in another case that the Senate was not in recess at that time because Republicans had arranged for sham sessions.
That opinion, if upheld by the Supreme Court, is likely to apply to Mr. Cordray as well, which could invalidate the rules the bureau has already enacted. The president has renominated Mr. Cordray, but Republicans have made it clear that they will continue to filibuster, using phony arguments to keep the agency from operating.
Earlier this month, 43 Senate Republicans wrote a letter to the president, vowing to block any nominee until ''key structural changes'' are made, including a bipartisan commission to run the bureau instead of one director, and Congressional control of its appropriations. (It is now financed with bank fees paid to the Federal Reserve.)
These arguments are designed solely to give Congress more opportunities to stop financial regulation. A board evenly divided between the parties would quickly reach a stalemate and become inoperative, much as the Federal Election Commission has become. Besides, board members can be filibustered as easily as a director.
Other bank regulators, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, are not subject to the appropriations process, as a shield against political interference. Congress does, however, control the budgets of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and House Republicans have voted to strip those agencies of money needed to regulate derivatives and curb abuses. The consumer bureau was enacted by law, and now Republicans are using backdoor methods to destroy it. There is no greater argument for Senate Democrats to ban filibusters of presidential nominees, particularly when the future of an entire agency is at stake.

HEADLINE: Revitalizing Manhattan's Midtown East

 BODY:
Thirty years have passed since New York City planners established the zoning rules for the glamorous swath of Manhattan known as East Midtown, an area that is home to Madison Avenue, Park Avenue, the Waldorf-Astoria and Grand Central Terminal. Much of the office space is aging and, in Mayor Michael Bloomberg's view, cannot compete for global business with the West Side of Manhattan, let alone major cities in other countries. 
Mr. Bloomberg is now quietly pushing for a new development plan for this area that he wants to have approved by the end of his term in December. Nearly everyone agrees that the area is due for rezoning, but it cannot be driven by an end-of-term deadline. The plan, when it emerges, requires a thorough public vetting since it will almost certainly determine the development in this important part of town over the next 30 years.
Last July, the Department of City Planning produced only the barest outline of a proposal, but it was enough to raise questions. In broad terms, the plan would allow developers to build a new crop of office towers in the area around Grand Central. In the city's latest map, the area stretches from midway between Madison and Fifth Avenues to sections of Third and Second Avenues, and north from 39th Street to a stretch of 57th Street.
The official rezoning process will begin in mid-March when the administration releases a detailed proposal and environmental impact study. We have every hope that the plan will sensibly balance the area's competing needs, including provisions for the increased pedestrian and commuter traffic new buildings are likely to bring and for the architectural variety that any good neighborhood needs. But the window between the plan's release and the mayor's departure is small, leaving too little time for the public to study the plan and propose changes.
There are important concerns. Some officials think the plan should include residential dwellings, to keep the neighborhood alive at night. Others want to make sure that the new buildings are architecturally compelling. Still others note that the subway platforms below ground are as congested as the streets and sidewalks above.
The Municipal Art Society, among others, worries that the plan could lead to the demolition of valued older buildings -- like the Roosevelt Hotel on Madison Avenue, the Graybar Building on Lexington and the Yale Club on Vanderbilt -- they believe are important to the historical fabric of the area. They have asked the Landmarks Preservation Commission to consider landmarking these and a number of other buildings, but the commission, which answers to the mayor, has been moving too slowly.
We share these many concerns. Mr. Bloomberg and his planners have made a start on a worthy, complicated project. But the city must take the time to get it right.

HEADLINE: Montefiore's President, Influential in Albany, Is Unknown by Design

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Dr. Steven M. Safyer, the president of Montefiore Medical Center, never said a word to the burly man standing next to him in a hospital gift shop demanding to know who was responsible for removing all the candy bars. Though it was Dr. Safyer who had banned candy, soda and deep-fried foods from hospital premises, as part of an anti-obesity campaign, he simply waited for the tirade to end and then stepped up to pay for his bag of cashews.
''I confess I didn't intervene because I am sensible,'' he said.
The man behind the largest hospital system in the Bronx -- one that delivers nearly a third of the babies born in the borough -- remains largely unknown, by choice. But behind the scenes, where he holds court with political and business leaders while speaking in the language of a community activist, Dr. Safyer has become one of the most powerful figures in a borough of 1.4 million residents facing a growing health crisis from obesity, diabetes, asthma and chronic diseases. 
So when state and city health officials wanted to save a bankrupt Bronx hospital in Westchester Square, they asked Montefiore to step in to continue providing services. When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed a citywide ban on supersize sodas last summer, he did so in the lobby of a Montefiore hospital, flanked by Dr. Safyer and physicians.
And when Bronx leaders have sought to promote economic development in the area, they have counted on the medical center's expansion -- a $142 million ambulatory care center is under construction -- to draw businesses and visitors, and even named Dr. Safyer to a task force on redeveloping the Kingsbridge Armory, a key project, though the hospital has no direct stake in it.
''He's not a household name, but when Steven Safyer speaks, a lot of people listen,'' Rubén Díaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, said. ''When Steven Safyer wants to take on a task, a lot of people want to be helpful.''
Dr. Safyer, 63, took the helm of Montefiore in 2008 after three decades at the hospital, starting as an intern and resident who later spent years caring for inmates at Rikers Island. Today, he oversees four hospitals and 125 health clinics across the Bronx and lower Westchester County with a staff of 18,332 -- making it the borough's largest employer -- providing services from primary care to fertility treatments and outpatient cardiac procedures.
The position gives Dr. Safyer, who lives on the Upper East Side and earns $2.1 million a year in salary and bonus, outsize influence in the Bronx.
In Montefiore's version of a war-room session last fall, Dr. Safyer, in a gray pinstripe suit, told 100 employees, many in white coats and surgical scrubs, that the hospital provided comprehensive medical care to about one-third of Bronx residents, and emergency or non-routine care to another one-third -- all in one of the poorest, and most health-challenged, urban communities in the nation.
''Health care is a human right, not a privilege,'' Dr. Safyer said firmly.
Dr. Safyer exhorted the employees to work together to find innovations as the hospital sought to expand to serve more people while lowering its costs.
''There's no private equity,'' and there are no private investors there, he said. ''We need to provide for the future and we need to have a positive bottom line.''
Dr. Safyer is the latest in a line of influential Montefiore leaders, including Dr. Martin Cherkasky, a confidant of former Mayor Edward I. Koch, who have helped shape the history of the Bronx. The hospital chain started in 1884 on the Upper East Side as a home for patients with chronic illnesses. It later moved to Harlem and then to the Bronx, evolving into a full-service medical center focused on care for the poor and underserved, and becoming one of the first hospitals to set up a home health care agency and a social work department.
In recent years, it has sought to move away from a standard fee-for-service pay model to one in which insurers pay upfront for complete patient care.
''There are many places that provide sophisticated medical care,'' said Dr. Allen Spiegel, dean of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, whose students and faculty practice and conduct research at Montefiore through a close partnership. ''There are relatively few places that are as responsible for the social and community care as Montefiore. This combination is somewhat unique in the country.''
A big part of the job is politics. Dr. Spencer Foreman, Dr. Safyer's predecessor, said he had cultivated relations with local and state officials. ''In a big, diverse world like health care, influence is a big commodity,'' Dr. Foreman said.
Dr. Safyer serves as chairman of the Greater New York Hospital Association, an influential industry group, which has given him a greater voice to lobby in Albany. He was on a governor-appointed task force that recommended sweeping changes in the way the state paid for Medicaid patients, many of which were adopted by the state. In 2011, Montefiore and other hospitals sought legislation to cap malpractice awards paid by hospitals at $250,000. While the cap was not adopted, the hospitals did receive some financial relief: a medical indemnity fund that pays for care for children born with defects. That fund, created through a tax on hospitals that deliver babies, helped lower malpractice premiums, hospital officials said.
''I'm not 6-foot-8 and 300 pounds of muscle,'' Dr. Safyer said. ''You have to use persuasion. You have to figure out what the levers are. We've had tremendous success in the last couple years.''
Bronx political leaders and consultants said Dr. Safyer was not one to yell or threaten but was so relentless in laying out his arguments over and over again that it could be very hard to say no to him. ''He is an extremely forceful and effective advocate for the hospital and its interests,'' said Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, a Democrat whose district includes Montefiore.
But a traditional power broker, Dr. Safyer is not. He does not wine and dine politicians, and by his own admission, does not count any of them among his inner circle. Instead, Dr. Safyer was described repeatedly as a low-key and effective leader by politicians, Montefiore employees, and even community activists, including some who worry the hospital is becoming too big and powerful and gobbling up neighborhoods.
State Senator Gustavo Rivera, a Democrat, said he mispronounced the doctor's name for months -- calling him Dr. SAFE-r -- without the doctor saying anything. His name is pronounced SAF-yer, and when the senator realized his mistake, he apologized.
''He said, 'That's fine,' '' Mr. Rivera recalled, adding: ''When I think of the unfortunately petty people I know up here in Albany, the smallest things can set them off. He understands the power he has, but he's humble.''
In his immaculate office at Montefiore, Dr. Safyer finished a working lunch recently with hospital executives who briefed him on state and federal health care legislation. From a health standpoint, his meal was beyond reproach: chunks of broiled salmon and lentil soup.
Under Dr. Safyer's direction, Montefiore has become a leader in anti-obesity efforts in the Bronx. It has offered zumba classes and cooking demonstrations in waiting rooms, and brought a farmers market to hospital grounds. It has worked with local officials to sponsor community health fairs where its doctors take blood pressure readings and give free diabetes and H.I.V. tests.
Dr. Safyer said he found social activism early. He grew up in Malverne, on Long Island, the older son of a paper salesman and a Holiday Inn manager. (His brother, Andrew, is now dean of the school of social work at Adelphi University.)
In middle school, Dr. Safyer attended civil rights rallies for school integration, and at Cornell University, where he aspired to become a labor lawyer and earned a bachelor's degree in labor relations, he protested the Vietnam War. Later, he said: ''I decided that my mother was right and that it would be good for me to have a profession.''
He returned to New York to take pre-med classes at Columbia University. He enrolled in medical school at Einstein, where he met his wife, and completed his residency in Montefiore's social medicine program, which viewed medicine as an instrument of social justice and sent doctors into poor and underserved neighborhoods. His wife, Dr. Paula Marcus, is a geriatric psychiatrist at Montefiore; both of their daughters also work at hospitals.
Dr. Safyer volunteered for the National Health Service Corps, which paid medical school tuition in return for service in poor areas, and he was sent to the Montefiore health program at Rikers for three years. He became so absorbed that he stayed for a total of eight years, becoming the director and persuading city officials to build a separate hospital for tuberculosis patients to help contain a disease that seemed poised to make a comeback.
''Some people would advise me not to get into every fight,'' Dr. Safyer said. ''But any fight that's with merit, I consider tackling because I think it's kind of my responsibility. I have a platform that allows me to do things, and where I can, I do.''

HEADLINE: Challenging Apple's Cool

BYLINE: By BRIAN X. CHEN; Roy Furchgott contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Apple, for the first time in years, is hearing footsteps.
The maker of iPhones, iPads and iPods has never faced a challenger able to make a truly popular and profitable smartphone or tablet -- not Dell, not Hewlett-Packard, not Nokia, not BlackBerry -- until Samsung Electronics.
The South Korean manufacturer's Galaxy S III smartphone is the first device to run neck and neck with Apple's iPhone in sales. Armed with other Galaxy phones and tablets, Samsung has emerged as a potent challenger to Apple, the top consumer electronics maker. The two companies are the only ones turning profits in the highly competitive mobile phone industry, with Apple taking 72 percent of the earnings and Samsung the rest.
Yet these two rivals, who have battled in the marketplace and in the courts worldwide, could not be more different. Samsung Electronics, a major part of South Korea's expansive Samsung Group, makes computer chips and flat-panel displays as well as a wide range of consumer products including refrigerators, washers and dryers, cameras, vacuum cleaners, PCs, printers and TVs. 
Where Apple stakes its success on creating new markets and dominating them, as it did with the iPhone and iPad, Samsung invests heavily in studying existing markets and innovating inside them.
''We get most of our ideas from the market,'' said Kim Hyun-suk, an executive vice president at Samsung, in a conversation about the future of mobile devices and television. ''The market is a driver, so we don't intend to drive the market in a certain direction,'' he said.
That's in stark contrast to the philosophy of Apple's founder Steven P. Jobs, who rejected the notion of relying on market research. He memorably said that consumers don't know what they want.
Nearly everything at Samsung, from the way it does research to its manufacturing, is unlike Apple. It taunts Apple in its cheeky advertisements while Apple stays above the fray.
And the Korean manufacturer may even be putting some pressure on Apple's world-class designers. Before Apple released the iPhone 5, which had a larger screen than earlier models, Samsung had already been selling phones with even bigger displays, like the 5.3-inch screen Galaxy Note, a smartphone so wide that gadget blogs call it a phablet.
Samsung outspends Apple on research and development: $10.5 billion, or 5.7 percent of revenue, compared with $3.4 billion, or 2.2 percent. (Samsung Electronics is slightly bigger than Apple in terms of revenue -- $183.5 billion compared with $156.5 billion -- but Apple is larger in terms of stock market value.)
Samsung has 60,000 staff members working in 34 research centers across the globe, including, Russia, Britain, India, Japan, Israel, China and Silicon Valley. It polls consumers and buys third-party research reports, but it also embeds employees in countries to study trends or merely to find inspiration for ideas.
Designers of the Galaxy S III say they drew inspiration from trips to Cambodia and Helsinki, a Salvador Dalí art exhibit and even a balloon ride in an African forest. (It employs 1,000 designers with different backgrounds like psychology, sociology, economy management and engineering.)
''The research process is unimaginable,'' said Donghoon Chang, an executive vice president of Samsung who leads the company's design efforts. ''We go through all avenues to make sure we read the trends correctly.'' He says that when the company researches markets for any particular product, it is also looking at trends in fashion, automobiles and interior design.
Hangil Song, a Samsung product designer, described a visit to the Marina Bay Sands resort in Singapore, where he said he was amazed by the views of the sky, the cityscape and the water. He wanted to create an effect where water was overflowing from the screen. As a result, taps and swipes on the Galaxy S III's phone screen create a unique ripple effect.
The genesis of the wide Galaxy Note phone reflects that same kind of consumer research. From focus groups and surveys, Samsung found that many respondents wanted a device that was good for handwriting, drawing and sharing notes. Asian-language speakers, in particular, found it easier to write characters on a device using a pen than typing. Those insights led to the Note, a smartphone that comes with a digital pen.
In courts, jury members have said some of Samsung's research appears to comes closer to copying. Apple sued Samsung in Federal District Court last year for patent infringement and won a $1 billion judgment. One of the most explosive pieces of evidence was a detailed report breaking down each hardware and software feature of the iPhone and how each compared to Samsung phone features. Samsung is fighting the decision in court.
Samsung says studying the market helps it build confidence for the wireless carriers that its mobile devices will sell well. That, in turn, persuades the carriers to aggressively sell Samsung phones and tablets. ''That's kind of the secret sauce,'' said Kevin Packingham, chief product officer of Samsung. (Samsung also spends heavily on advertising globally. It outspends Apple and Microsoft.)
Daniel Hesse, Sprint's chief executive, called Samsung a ''terrific partner'' because of its willingness to work with the carriers on the creation of phones. For carriers, that could be a refreshing alternative to working with Apple, which completely controls the design of its iPhone's hardware and software. ''They work with the carriers, they want to hear from you what you want, they don't tell you what it's going to be. It's very two-way,'' Mr. Hesse said.
Samsung differs in one other important way. It remains a manufacturer, while Apple contracts out the assembly of its devices. Horace H. Dediu, a mobile industry analyst at Asymco, said that historically, it built its business around producing and selling components to other manufacturers, including Apple, Sony and Hewlett-Packard. While Samsung had been making and selling consumer electronics in Korea and developing markets for decades, these relationships taught it a lot about competing with -- and beating -- the biggest names in the industry. .
By working with so many companies, it gets insight into how to plan investments for successful products. And it can use the same resources to build its own products, Mr. Dediu said. This is why Samsung has long had a reputation of being a ''fast follower.''
Apple has been one of Samsung's largest customers. Samsung's flash memory processors, graphic chips, solid-state drives and display parts have appeared in Apple's iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices and MacBooks. But for some of its latest mobile products, Apple has been seeking other vendors like Toshiba, Elpida and Sharp to use their components instead.
Having worked closely with Apple and other companies for years, Samsung, which dedicated $21 billion last year -- almost twice as much as Apple -- for capital expenditures, can easily get a sense of how to plan production and distribution of a successful phone, Mr. Dediu said.
The next battle between Apple and Samsung is expected to be in TVs and wearable computers. Despite being labeled a fast follower, Samsung doesn't appear to be waiting for Apple to make the first move in smarter TVs. Samsung is offering a box that people can buy to upgrade the speed and software of their Samsung TV, similar to the way they would get software upgrades for their phones.
This year, most of the televisions it is selling are Internet-connected and can run apps that help customers find what to watch. That's something similar to what Apple watchers have been predicting for years from the Cupertino, Calif., company.
Mr. Dediu said that Samsung had made no serious investment in the ''cloud,'' where content is stored on remote servers and pulled from people's devices over the Internet. The cloud could play a more crucial role as mobile products shift away from big screens toward wearable devices, like glasses and wrist devices, he said.
But then, the one thing Samsung may have trouble learning is how exactly Apple is going to swerve next.

HEADLINE: Builder of China's 'Great Firewall' Finds His Holiday Greetings Spurned

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: When Fang Binxing, a major architect of China's system of Internet censorship, sent netizens New Year's greetings over the weekend, many told him to "go to hell." 

 BODY:
BEIJING - Fang Binxing is known here as the "Father of the Wall," that is, the Great Firewall - the sprawling system of technological controls in China that has created a parallel online world, or "Chinternet," where global favorites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook are blocked. 
In fact, it's fair to say that Mr. Fang is unpopular among quite a few of China's hundreds of millions of netizens, though he does have his admirers, including among those who support the government's large-scale efforts to "weiwen," or maintain stability. 
Just how unpopular he is was demonstrated again over the weekend when his New Year's microblog greeting was promptly bombarded with messages telling him to "go to hell," according to netizens (it wasn't possible to read each message, but Mr. Fang's post had been forwarded over 23,000 times at the time of writing).
Pithily, in one word repeated again and again, the critics said: "gun," or "[#x6eda]." (The word literally means "roll," or, in an officially accepted slang variation, "beat it.")
"Fang Binxing sends everyone New Year's greetings! May all be joyful and successful in the Year of the Snake!" he posted on his Sina Weibo, or microblog, account, on Saturday, continuing with salutations to his university (he is the president of the University of Posts and Telecommunications in Beijing) and a poem.
"Yesterday, a university president wished everyone Happy New Year on his microblog account and the result was he got over 10,000 forwards saying 'go to hell,' " He Bing, deputy director of the School of Law at the China University of Political Science and Law, posted to his nearly 395,000 followers on Sina Weibo. 
"As long as people like this continue to be the presidents of universities there's no hope for China," Mr. He's post continued. By Tuesday afternoon it had been forwarded about 3,700 times.
Mr. Fang acknowledged in an interview in 2011 that he had designed major parts of the Great Firewall. He is a lightning rod for protest among the Internet-savvy who want broader freedom of speech. 
He's had eggs and a shoe thrown at him, and in 2011 had to close his newly opened microblog after thousands of users left comments within hours - almost all of them critical, the populist newspaper Global Times noted. 
"I regard the dirty abuse as a sacrifice for my country," the newspaper quoted Mr. Fang as saying. 
Attention is growing around the world on how the Chinese state uses the Internet, with The Washington Post reporting today on a new intelligence assessment in the United States. The newspaper writes that according to a National Intelligence Estimate, the United States is the target of "a massive, sustained cyber-espionage campaign" and that China is "the country most aggressively seeking to penetrate the computer systems of American businesses and institutions to gain access to data that could be used for economic gain."
The Post is one of a number of U.S. news organizations, including The New York Times, that recently reported having been subjected to cyberattacks believed to have Chinese origins. (The Times has been blocked in China since running a story last year about wealth accumulated by the family of the outgoing prime minister, Wen Jiabao.)
Back in Beijing, Mr. Fang hasn't posted anything since his New Year greeting, so it isn't clear how he feels about the reaction to it. Meanwhile, word continues to circulate that more "upgrades," or tightening, of the Great Firewall lie ahead. 
In December, several overseas-based companies that provide VPNs to both non-Chinese and Chinese users in the country (a VPN, or virtual private network, enables users to get around the Chinternet, or "cross the Wall" as it's known here, by logging on via overseas servers) said their services had been interrupted. 
In what some read as a warning, Mr. Fang appeared to tell Global Times that overseas-based companies offering VPNs to people in China must register with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
"I haven't heard that any foreign companies have registered," he said. Unregistered VPN service providers are not protected by Chinese law and any company running a VPN business should realize it has a responsibility to register, he said, according to Global Times.

HEADLINE: Does Your Life Leave You Enough Time to Relax?

BYLINE: SHANNON DOYNE


HIGHLIGHT: Could you change your daily routine so that you had more time to rest? 

 BODY:
 Imagine your life with more sleep, longer breaks from school and all your other obligations, maybe even regular naps. 
Do these changes appeal to you? Or does the thought of devoting more time to relaxing fill you with stress and worry?
In the Opinion piece "Relax! You'll Be More Productive," Tony Schwartz argues that "the best way to get more done may be to spend more time doing less." He explains: 
 More and more of us find ourselves unable to juggle overwhelming demands and maintain a seemingly unsustainable pace. Paradoxically, the best way to get more done may be to spend more time doing less. A new and growing body of multidisciplinary research shows that strategic renewal - including daytime workouts, short afternoon naps, longer sleep hours, more time away from the office and longer, more frequent vacations - boosts productivity, job performance and, of course, health.
"More, bigger, faster." This, the ethos of the market economies since the Industrial Revolution, is grounded in a mythical and misguided assumption - that our resources are infinite.
Time is the resource on which we've relied to get more accomplished. When there's more to do, we invest more hours. But time is finite, and many of us feel we're running out, that we're investing as many hours as we can while trying to retain some semblance of a life outside work.
... The Stanford researcher Cheri D. Mah found that when she got male basketball players to sleep 10 hours a night, their performances in practice dramatically improved: free-throw and three-point shooting each increased by an average of 9 percent.
Daytime naps have a similar effect on performance. When night shift air traffic controllers were given 40 minutes to nap - and slept an average of 19 minutes - they performed much better on tests that measured vigilance and reaction time.
Longer naps have an even more profound impact than shorter ones. Sara C. Mednick, a sleep researcher at the University of California, Riverside, found that a 60- to 90-minute nap improved memory test results as fully as did eight hours of sleep.
... In the 1950s, the researchers William Dement and Nathaniel Kleitman discovered that we sleep in cycles of roughly 90 minutes, moving from light to deep sleep and back out again. They named this pattern the Basic-Rest Activity Cycle or BRAC. A decade later, Professor Kleitman discovered that this cycle recapitulates itself during our waking lives.
The difference is that during the day we move from a state of alertness progressively into physiological fatigue approximately every 90 minutes. Our bodies regularly tell us to take a break, but we often override these signals and instead stoke ourselves up with caffeine, sugar and our own emergency reserves - the stress hormones adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol.
Working in 90-minute intervals turns out to be a prescription for maximizing productivity. Professor K. Anders Ericsson and his colleagues at Florida State University have studied elite performers, including musicians, athletes, actors and chess players. In each of these fields, Dr. Ericsson found that the best performers typically practice in uninterrupted sessions that last no more than 90 minutes. They begin in the morning, take a break between sessions, and rarely work for more than four and a half hours in any given day.
 Students: Tell us ...

        
How do you balance all the things you need to do in an average day with the need to sleep and rest?
        
Do you ever feel like being sleep deprived or less than fully rested causes you to make mistakes, take more time to accomplish tasks or otherwise do less than your best?
        
If so, how could you change your routine to allow you to have more downtime?
        
If you could take more breaks, would you? How would you spend this time?
        
Does the idea of working for 90 minutes then having time to relax before resuming seem familiar to you? Possible? Why or why not?

HEADLINE: The Underpopulation Bomb

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: It's not a low fertility rate but rather the failure of public policies to provide sufficient support for parents that is troubling, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She recently edited and contributed to "For Love and Money: Care Provision in the United States." 
The birth dearth/empty cradle/baby bust is upon us, threatening consequences just as dire as the overpopulation bomb that Paul Ehrlich predicted would cause mass global starvation in the 1970s. The growing percentage of elderly in the population, the root cause of many of our problems, will soon render the United States economically feeble.
This dire prophecy of underpopulation has gradually made its way from the pages of Foreign Policy to The New York Times and, most recently, The Wall Street Journal. The alarmist fear-mongering is no better founded than Paul Ehrlich's earlier panic. 
Oddly, both sides of the humans-as-bombs debate share certain assumptions. Both seem terrified by the costs of caring for human dependents, whether young or old, describing them as a threat to economic welfare.
Both seem convinced that demography is destiny - that if we just raised the correct number of children, our problems would be solved.
Both typically blame the state for interfering with the relationship between the family and the economy, either subsidizing too many births through public assistance or providing social insurance to the elderly, making them less dependent on their own children for support in old age.
All three assumptions are staggeringly wrong.
Critics of the standard measure of gross domestic product (myself included) have long pointed out that it includes only the value of goods and services purchased in the market. Reducing the dependency "burden" would free time and money to spend on other things. Yet most of us place enormous value on our commitments to family members, friends, neighbors and fellow citizens, whatever their age. Otherwise (my inner economist urges me to add) why would we spend so much time and money on them?
Fertility decline is not some precipitous event. Under way for more than 150 years in the United States and many other parts of the world, it began long before the advent of modern birth-control methods or the so-called welfare state. Potential for young adults to migrate to new areas, along with the growth of wage employment, increased the economic independence of the younger generation and weakened family-based farms and enterprises. The gradual empowerment of women gave them more voice in marriage and family-size decisions.
Recent changes in the average number of births per woman in the United States have been quite modest. As the demographer Philip Cohen points out, the average number of births per woman in the United States declined steeply in the early 1970s, rose in the 1980s and leveled out before heading back down when the 2007 recession hit.
Economic growth, improvements in public health and advances in medical technology, in concert with fertility decline, are increasing the share of elderly in the population. The elderly are more prone to disability than other groups, so this demographic shift will impose costs. But let's not forget that improved life expectancy represents a huge gain in living standards. How much would you be willing to pay for an extra year of life?
Complaints about the graying of the population sometimes imply an inevitable loss of economic dynamism. But I know of no historical evidence that either the productivity or the creativity of a society is determined by the age structure of its population.
The interaction between demographic and economic change is so much more complex than the simplistic doomsday scenario implies. Some interesting - and not always optimistic - efforts to grapple with it can be found in an open-access special issue of Population and Development Review, recently published by the Population Council in honor of its retiring editor, Paul Demeny.
In retrospect, Mr. Demeny stands out as one of the first demographers to consider seriously the problems that below-replacement fertility poses for the sustainability of public and private pension systems. This is a far more specific and, in my view, more realistic concern than the others described above. It calls attention to the need to rethink some fundamental institutional arrangements that shape the distribution of the costs of caring for dependents.
Several articles in the special issue, including one I wrote with Douglas Wolf of Syracuse University, "The Intergenerational Welfare State," point out that modern social-insurance systems have socialized some benefits of child-rearing by taxing the younger generation to help support the older one.
As I've pointed out in previous posts, both employers and those who devote relatively few resources to raising children are able to indirectly capture some future benefits from the labor power that committed parents nurture.
Yet public support for parents compensates them for only a small share of the costs they incur and outmoded institutional arrangements make it difficult for them to easily combine wage employment with care provision.
The uneven and partial socialization of family costs is probably not a major factor driving fertility decline, which unfolded in many countries - including India and South Korea - long before the establishment of public pensions.
In the absence of those pensions, individuals might choose to invest in private annuities for support in old age rather than in raising children, whose ability and willingness to help parents in old age would remain difficult to determine even if parents were given a strong legal claim on their earnings, as Mr. Demeny and others have proposed.
Regardless of its possible impact on family size decisions, the current distribution of the costs of children seems conspicuously unfair to parents, with particularly negative consequences for single mothers, whose access to good jobs and public retirement benefits remains limited.
Jonathan Last, in The Wall Street Journal, concludes his article on "America's Baby Bust" with a simple plea for more babies. I conclude with a plea for public policies that could help parents raise healthier, happier children into ever more productive adults.

HEADLINE: A Closer Look at the Creation of a Vast Pacific Shark Sanctuary

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A marine conservationist describes the path to creating the world's biggest shark sanctuary. 

 BODY:
Here's a Dot Earth postcard from the South Pacific, describing the final step in the creation of a vast international sanctuary for sharks. It's written by , a young woman who, after working as a biologist in a drug discovery laboratory in San Diego for nearly a decade, decided it was time to pursue her passion for marine life. Cramp is now the program manager for the Pacific Islands Conservation Initiative, a nonprofit environmental group based in the Cook Islands:
I'm writing from Rarotonga, Cook Islands, an idyllic tropical paradise of 26 square miles in the South Pacific. But my focus isn't the beauty; it's the sharks. 
Sharks are in trouble around the world. Not because they are a menace, but because overfishing is outpacing their reproductive capacity (see "New Estimates of the Shark-Fin Trade"). While some nations are adopting shark fin bans, there's another approach developing in the South Pacific. 
Like separate pieces of a puzzle, French Polynesia, Tokelau and American Samoa recently created enormous shark no-take zones in their territorial waters. Separately, these are huge accomplishments, but when the Cook Islands - the only country with waters bordering the other three - joined the party, the largest contiguous shark sanctuary in the world was created.
I joined Pacific Islands Conservation Initiative (PICI) in May, 2011, as the volunteer program manager. My goal was to advance the shark sanctuary campaign devised by PICI founder Stephen Lyon a number of years ago. Steve and I agreed that if we consulted the local community and they didn't want to protect sharks from commercial exploitation, we'd walk away. But they did want sharks protected, and in the end the campaign received overwhelming support.
Progress still took time. Let's face it, I'm no Jacques Cousteau and sharks are not as cuddly as dolphins. Thankfully, a few prominent community members who understood the scientific and cultural implications of shark protection - and spoke in the local language on their behalf - bolstered our efforts. We even managed to gain the support of local fishermen even though they said they were terrorized by sharks on occasion in their traditional canoes. Commercial longline boat operators also endorsed the plan.
We made sure that the proposed shark regulations protected the rights of the artisanal fishers, had no economic impact on the country, eased fisheries enforcement, and had resounding popular support. But after countless meetings, the Ministry of Marine Resources still hesitated to ban commercial fishing of all species of shark.
We reached a turning point when a local news story reported that three tons of shark fins were found during a routine inspection on an Asian vessel, and the ministry still chose not to act. The campaign gained momentum locally, and in turn, provided us more international recognition and ultimately, more resources.
Inspired by a Los Angeles Times article about our efforts, Michael Balster, an environmental attorney from the Paul Hastings Group, offered to work pro bono for a year drafting the regulations which later became law.
The Pew Environment Group afforded us the resources to visit the outer islands' communities. We received support from every island we visited, including some we weren't able to reach, because -- coupled with evidence of overfishing -- sharks are revered as guardians in Cook Islands culture.
On 12/12/12, after more than a year and a half of advocating for sharks, I was sitting in the observer's box in the Cook Islands Parliament when The Minister of Marine Resources, the Honorable Teina Bishop, chose to act.
He announced with pride that the Cook Islands were declaring all 771,000 square miles of their exclusive economic zone, an area of sea the size of Mexico, a protected area for all sharks, rays and skates (see "Regulations Explained"). There are still issues to address -- such as nearby high-seas fishing and the challenges in patrolling such a large protected area.
But sanctuaries are now established as a critical tool for reducing shark mortality, and in the South Pacific, the combined efforts of small island nations are adding up to an enormous advance in marine conservation.

HEADLINE: S.&P. Lawsuit Draws New Line in the Sand

BYLINE: DAVID ZARING


HIGHLIGHT: The government's lawsuit against Standard &#038; Poor's over credit ratings suggests that we may see fewer settlements and more court cases involving financial institutions in the future. 

 BODY:
 David Zaring is assistant professor of legal studies at the Wharton School of Business. 
The United States government's lawsuit against Standard & Poor's proves that there is still life in the effort to hold financial institutions responsible for the financial crisis, for at least a little while longer. Three aspects of the suit are particularly interesting. 
The first relates to the government's insistence on an admission of guilt from S.&P. Such admissions are costly to extract, and often viewed as unnecessary - ordinary people do not admit guilt when they get divorced, or pay up after auto accidents, after all, even where the fault is clear. 
Perhaps for this reason, the Securities and Exchange Commission has not required such admissions in the past, much to the consternation of some observers, and at least one judge. Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan reacted with horror to the S.E.C.'s nonadmission settlements with Citigroup and Merrill Lynch over wrongdoing related to the financial crisis. 
The S.&P. suit shows that at least part of the government has come around to Judge Rakoff's way of thinking. If so, we should expect to see fewer settlements and more court cases in the future. 
A second aspect of the litigation offers context. It is always difficult to know whether the multimillion-dollar fines imposed on financial institutions are a hardship or a slap on the wrist, with the costs quickly passed on to the customers. 
In this case, the government apparently asked S.&P. to pay $1 billion, which was too high a price for peace for the credit rating agency. The company apparently protested that that the sum amounted to its parent company's yearly profit, a ratio that it could not abide. It provides some evidence of how much will strike a defendant - even a well-heeled financial defendant - as too much. 
The final interesting aspect of the lawsuit is constitutional. S.&P. will likely defend its ratings as protected by the First Amendment's right to free expression. The First Amendment does not give anyone a right to commit fraud, as Steven M. Davidoff and Peter J. Henning have observed, and the sort of commercial speech that covers credit ratings is entitled to somewhat less protection than is core political speech. 
But S.&P.,founded by a journalist offering information to investors about railroads, has successfully invoked a "reporter's privilege" to fend off lawsuits claiming that its ratings were issued negligently. 
To be sure, that privilege has always been an uncertain one. Federal courts in California, where the suit has been filed, have not always recognized the reporter's privilege even for newspaper and television reporters involved in criminal investigations, and plenty of other courts have dismissed its extension to credit ratings agencies. 
Still, if S.&P. is singled out for ratings that were matched by the other ratings agencies, the government's case might look like an exercise favoring certain speakers over others, and that might be a problem. It might even encourage the government to file lawsuits against other ratings agencies.

HEADLINE: The Temptation to Trade on Confidential Information

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: Two recent insider trading cases seem to indicate that the desire for quick profits is simply clouding our judgment, the author writes. 

 BODY:
Everyone loves a sure thing. And in the case of insider trading, the profits may be just too tempting. 
Two cases filed last week by the Securities and Exchange Commission epitomize just how quickly some have jumped at the opportunity to profit from confidential information, despite the risks of being discovered and the subsequent costs.
In one case,two information technology workers learned that their company was involved in merger negotiations when one helped the chief executive figure out how to attach confidential deal documents to an e-mail. The other involved a husband learning about a confidential acquisition from his wife, who is a lawyer, after an event with a client's general counsel was canceled on short notice. 
 In both situations, the defendants bought stock in the companies involved in the deals the day after learning the confidential information, showing virtually no compunction about violating the law. Nor does it appear they did much to conceal their actions - they used accounts in their own names to buy and sell shares. 
Did the desire for quick profits simply cloud their better judgment, or is insider trading something people do not consider to be wrongful?
The S.E.C. noted that the two technology workers, Blake R. Wellington and Daniel J. Vance, went to great lengths to finance their trades. Mr. Wellington took out a $25,000 loan from an online lending site, an expensive transaction given the high interest rates charged by these lenders. Mr. Vance borrowed from his 401(k) account, and sold personal computer equipment and his truck to raise the money for his stock purchase.
The merger was announced two weeks after their purchases, producing a total profit of about $72,000. Under their settlement with the S.E.C., they were required to return all their gains and had to pay an additional $79,000 in penalties and prejudgment interest. Whatever vehicle Mr. Vance bought to replace his truck is probably gone now, too.
In the second case, the S.E.C. charged James Balchan with insider trading when he bought shares in National Semiconductor. He learned confidential information about a merger involving the firm after his wife told him that a law firm event involving the company's general counsel had been canceled because he was tied up in negotiations with Texas Instruments.
The next morning, Mr. Balchan bought 2,000 shares of National Semiconductor, and another 1,000 shares a few days later, reaping a profit of about $29,000 when the acquisition was announced.
Mr. Balchan's wife is a partner in the Houston office of a national law firm that did work for National Semiconductor, so any information she had about the deal was confidential.
Whether Mr. Balchan had the same duty of confidentiality is a different question, however, because he was not an employee of the law firm. In its complaint, the S.E.C. contends that Mr. Balchan breached a duty of trust and confidence to his wife because he was aware of her obligation to a client of the firm.
That theory of insider trading may be a bit of a stretch under the law. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held in United States v. Chestman that "marriage does not, without more, create a fiduciary relationship." In that case, the court overturned an insider trading conviction when a husband traded on information he leaned from his wife about a takeover of her family's company.
The S.E.C. adopted Rule 10b5-2 in 2000 to address family situations, taking the exact opposite approach of the Chestman decision. The rule provides that there is a duty of trust and confidence "whenever a person receives or obtains material nonpublic information from his or her spouse, parent, child or sibling."
Mr. Balchan settled with the S.E.C., agreeing to disgorge his profit and pay a penalty plus interest of $30,615. So the question of whether it was a violation of securities law for the husband to trade based on confidential information received from his wife will not be tested in this case.
The two cases raise questions about our society's attitudes toward insider trading. Why are citizens so eager to trade on information to make a quick, if rather modest, profit when the prohibition against insider trading is fairly clear and widely known? Unlike hedge fund managers who face pressure to produce profits on a daily basis, these defendants were handed an opportunity to trade and did so almost immediately.
The recent crackdown on insider trading has certainly been hard to miss in the news media. 
While some have questioned the scope of the insider trading prohibition, there is a general public perception that it is wrongful. Stuart P. Green, a Rutgers law professor, and Matthew B. Kugler, a psychologist, conducted a survey about when trading on confidential information should be punished. Their article in The Fordham Urban Law Journal concluded that it was "only when the trader obtained the confidential information in some presumably illicit manner, such as by appropriating it from his employer or client, that our subjects regarded it as clearly worthy of prohibition and censure."
Insider trading is a violation that involves cheating by taking advantage of access to confidential information along with a strong dose of greed to overcome the usual moral constraint against engaging in illegal conduct. There is no easily identifiable victim in insider trading, so it can be easy to justify it to oneself because no individual is actually losing money in the process, just the faceless mass of traders in the market.
The fact that some people appear to be willing, and even eager, to trade on confidential information when presented the opportunity shows that sometimes any constraints on acting illegally can be easily overcome. 
Is it worth it? That question hardly seems to matter.

HEADLINE: Price for a New Hip? Many Hospitals Are Stumped

BYLINE: ELISABETH ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A new paper puts a spotlight on an opaque medical system in which prices are often hidden from consumers. 

 BODY:
Jaime Rosenthal, a senior at Washington University in St. Louis, called more than 100 hospitals in every state last summer, seeking prices for a hip replacement for a 62-year-old grandmother who was uninsured but had the means to pay herself.
The quotes she received might surprise even hardened health care economists: only about half of the hospitals, including top-ranked orthopedic centers and community hospitals, could provide any sort of price estimate, despite repeated calls. Those that could gave quotes that varied by a factor of more than 10, from $11,100 to $125,798. 
Ms. Rosenthal's grandmother was fictitious, created for a summer research project on health care costs. But the findings, which form the basis of a paper released on Monday by JAMA Internal Medicine, are likely to fan the debate on the unsustainable growth of American health care costs and an opaque medical system in which prices are often hidden from consumers.
"Transparency is all the rage these days in government and business, but there has been little push for pricing transparency in health care, and there's virtually no information," said Dr. Peter Cram, an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Iowa, who wrote the paper with Ms. Rosenthal. He added: "I can get the price for a car, for a can of oil, for a gallon of milk. But health care? That's not so easy."
President Obama's Affordable Care Act focused primarily on providing insurance to Americans who did not have it. But the high price of care remains an elephant in the room. Although many experts have said that Americans must become more discerning consumers to help rein in costs, the study illustrates how hard that can be.
"We've been trying to help patients get good value, but it is really hard to get price commitments from hospitals - we see this all the time," said Jeff Rice, the chief executive of Healthcare Blue Book, a company that collects data on medical procedures, doctors visits and tests. "And even if they say $20,000, it often turns out $40,000 or 60,000."
There are many caveats to the study. Most patients - or insurers - never pay the full sticker price of surgery, because insurance companies bargain with hospitals and doctors for discounted rates. When Ms. Rosenthal balked at initial high estimates, some hospitals produced lower rates for a person without insurance.
But in other ways the telephone quotations underestimated prices, because they did not include the fees for outpatient rehabilitation, for example.
In an accompanying commentary, Andrew Steinmetz and Ezekiel J. Emanuel of the University of Pennsylvania acknowledged that there was "no justification" for the inability to provide estimates or for the wide range of prices. But they said that more rigorous data on quality - like infection rates and unexpected deaths - were required to know when high prices were worth it.
"Without quality data to accompany price data, physicians, consumers and other health care decision makers have no idea if a lower price represents shoddy quality of if it constitutes good value," they wrote.
But, broadly, researchers emphasized that studies had found little consistent correlation between higher prices and better quality in American health care. Dr. Cram said there was no data that "Mercedes" hip implants were better than cheaper options, for example.
Jamie Court, the president of the California-based Consumer Watchdog, said: "If one hospital can put in a hip for $12,000, then every hospital should be able to do it. When there's 100 percent variation in sticker price, then there is no real price. It's about profit."
Dr. Cram said the study did contain some good news: some of the country's top-ranked hospitals came up with "bargain basement prices" in response to repeated calls. "If you're a good consumer and shop around, you can get a good price - you don't have to pay $120,000 for a Honda," he said.
But that shopping can be arduous in a market not set up to respond to consumers. To get a total price, Ms. Rosenthal often had to call the hospital to get its estimate for on-site care, and a separate quote from doctors. And many were simply perplexed when she asked for a price upfront, Ms. Rosenthal said, adding, "The people who answered didn't know what to do with the question."

We have that."

Ms. Mills became increasingly visible as a messenger for the Obama administration, which has been eager to present itself as relentlessly pursuing an entrepreneurial agenda. She helped lead the administration's Startup America program, which pairs government initiatives with private-sector stars in an effort to foster high-growth entrepreneurship. In January 2012, President Obama elevated the position of S.B.A. administrator to his cabinet. 
In a statement released by the White House, Mr. Obama thanked Ms. Mills for her tenure. "I asked Karen to lead the Small Business Administration because I knew she had the skills and experience to help America's small businesses recover from the worst economic crisis in generations - and that's exactly what she's done," he said. "Because of Karen's hard work and dedication, our small businesses are better positioned to create jobs and our entire economy is stronger."
The administrator, in turn, praised her staff. "Four years ago, when I arrived at the S.B.A., America's small businesses and entrepreneurs were struggling in the face of the worst economic environment since the Great Depression - and a banking sector that was frozen," Ms. Mills wrote in a memo. "Together, we rolled up our sleeves and went to work."
She will remain at the agency's helm until the Senate confirms her replacement. A White House spokesman would not say when President Obama would name that successor. Ms. Mills, who was a venture capitalist before she joined the agency in 2009, did not say what she planned to do next.

HEADLINE: Swimming With Gentle Giants

BYLINE: RACHEL CARTWRIGHT


HIGHLIGHT: I'm looking down into 200 feet of water and resting just below me is a 45-foot-long behemoth; a female humpback whale. From below her massive girth, a tiny calf peeks out. 

 BODY:
 Rachel Cartwright teaches biology at California State University Channel Islands and has studied trends in habitat use in humpback whale mother-calf pairs in Hawaiian waters. 
 Jan. 20, 2013 
For many field biologists, there may be moments when you consider the focus of your lifelong work and wonder: How did I end up here?
Working with humpback whales in the warm, tropical waters of Hawaii, I have that moment at the start of each field season. I grew up in the north of England where, like most youngsters, my experience of the ocean was limited to a yearly bone-chilling knee-deep paddle in the murky gray waters of Blackpool, a well-known Northern seaside resort. Around age 10, I managed the required 25 yards across a frigid swimming pool, and with that, I figured I had all the aquatic skills I would need in later life. 
Fast forward more than 20 years, and here I sit, poised on the side of a 20-foot-long research boat. I've traded the gray North Atlantic waters for the azure-blues of the Pacific and temperate for tropical climes. But this water has no reassuring bottom close to my feet. Instead, I'm looking down into 200 feet of water and resting just below me is a 45-foot-long behemoth; a female humpback whale. From below her massive girth, a tiny calf peeks out. New humpback moms rarely rest with such young calves in tow, so my teammate John Cesere and I know that is a moment not to be missed. We grab snorkels, masks and cameras and slip gently into the water. 
Despite their huge size, humpback whales, especially females with calves, are as skittish as young deer. The challenge is to approach without disturbing them -- one stroke of the huge fluke and they will be long gone. We've already spent an hour with this pair, following from our research boat at a discrete distance, plotting their movements, dive patterns and surface activity. But humpback whales generally spend less than 10 percent of their time at the surface. As researchers we catch just fleeting glimpses of their behavior. To get the full perspective, we need to see the underwater portion, so with that in mind, we gently push away from the side of the boat and float toward the resting pair.
Researchers have long presumed that it is the well-being of these young calves that draw humpback and other baleen whales to the tropics, the warm water temperatures being more suited to the survival and growth of these young, skinny offspring. However, as it turns out, even the smallest calves are thermo-neutral, generating enough metabolic heat to keep them toasty warm in even the most frigid waters. It is the threat of predation that propels pregnant females out of their summertime feeding regions and off across 3,000 miles of open waters to breeding grounds like Hawaii.
Neonate baleen whale calves are small and naïve, and though tailor-made for fund-raising posters, they're extremely uncoordinated and would basically be an easy meal for the smart, marine-mammal-eating transient killer whales that frequent their feeding grounds. So pregnant females head for nutrient-poor, subtropical waters, beyond the range of this potential predator and their relocation motivates the rest of the humpback population to follow. Fertile females and males ready to breed also head south and juveniles follow suit, too.
Humpbacks show up in Hawaii by Thanksgiving, congregating in these waters from across an arc of feeding regions that stretch from British Columbia to the Russian peninsula. And although we have yet to document exactly where and when pregnant females give birth, by mid-January females with their young calves arrive and the protected waters between the islands of Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kaho'olawe become an impromptu nursery.
Over all, Hawaii hosts approximately 50 percent of the central North Pacific stock of humpback whales, placing the region right at the heart of a true conservation success story. In the late '70s, numbers of humpback whales visiting waters in Hawaii had dropped to as low as 200 to 300 each year and the population looked to be inevitably bound for extinction. But the implementation of the ban on commercial whaling in 1986, combined with the added protection of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the instigation of protected marine areas, like the National Marine Sanctuaries and also the timely uptick in environmental awareness and appreciation, have brought humpback whales back from the brink. They are still listed as an endangered species, but most populations are now increasing around the globe.
In the North Pacific, numbers are rising by a healthy 7 percent each year. Over the course of the winter, 9,000 to 11,000 humpback whales may use the waters of Hawaii as their wintertime home, with newly born calves of the year consisting of some 10 percent of this population. The coastal waters between Maui, Lanai, Molokai and Kaho'olawe make up the core of Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary and more than 200,000 visitors a year come to the old whaling town of Lahaina on Maui to take a whale-watching trip. Widely recognized as one of the best places in the world to see whales in the wild, whale watching now contributes around $85 million annually to the local economy and serves as a perfect example of the ecosystem capital that may be generated by a healthy and vital local whale population.
But all may not be well in paradise. As whale-watching companies switch to larger vessels and land use along the shoreline transitions from agriculture to housing, the coastal regions of west Maui are becoming more and more urbanized. Typically, within subtropical breeding grounds, mothers with young calves favor shallow coastline areas, as they offer the new moms some respite from overly amorous male whales presumed to be more common in the deeper midchannel areas. However our recent research suggests that females and their young calves are moving away from some regions of the shoreline, and are now found more frequently in the deeper waters of the channel.
Whether this is a result of noise, traffic or even water quality remains to be seen and any costs of this switch away from the shoreline have yet to be accurately quantified. But as any good behavioral ecologist will tell you, habitat shifts are not done lightly, usually there is a cause and all too often there may be a consequence. Which brings us to the key question we hope to answer this season: For maternal females in Maui waters, is there a cost to this offshore switch?
I will be looking into this question, working with my colleague Blake Gillespie. We're both from California State University Channel Islands, a wonderful institution that has most generously provided sabbatical leave for me this semester to undertake this work. Others in the team include the experienced local boat captains Amy Venema and Terence Mangold, the underwater photographers John and Dan Cesere of C3 Submerged, and a number of hard-working local volunteers. Our work is funded primarily through private donations; Mark Percival of Britain has supported our project throughout. We add to this with our own direct fund-raising efforts and we also receive support from concerned local whale-watching companies, like Ultimate Whalewatch Maui. As the season progresses, we'll be joined intermittently by a documentary team from the BBC, as well as young, enthusiastic undergraduates from our university.
For now, I'm pretty much mesmerized by the mother and her calf below me. I fin slightly toward mom, reminding myself that there must be good reasons we call these animals gentle giants. I'm hoping to document clear signs of age for the calf, like fetal folds, a dimple at the neck or a lingering umbilical scar. Typically, moms with young calves like this travel almost continually, so it's rare to get a chance to document these neonate indicators. 
As I watch the mother maneuver around her calf, she turns slightly to place me in her clearest line of sight, off to her side. She waits as the calf rolls off her far side, ducks underneath and then pops up once more, alongside mom. My teammate John falls back as she moves into the slowest travel. She heads slightly toward me, the calf on my side. The pair pauses as they swim leisurely by; two large eyes slowly inspect me. Then, with the calf safely tucked in the draft of her pectoral fin, a mere movement of her fluke propels the mother on and I'm left bobbing like shark bait in the water column. The season lies ahead, no doubt to produce more questions than answers, but my lingering thought for today - exactly who was watching who?

HEADLINE: Raikkonen Leads Formula One Trials in Spain

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: Second fastest on the final day of Formula One time trials in Spain was Jules Bianchi, who is seeking a spot on the Force India team. 

 BODY:
The balance of power in Formula One racing may be in for a bit of a shake-up this season, if the results of the first major open test of the season at the Jerez, Spain, circuit last week are any indication.
Kimi Raikkonen, driving for Lotus, topped the timing charts on the final session of four days of trials; his teammate Romain Grosjean was quickest in the second session. Both drivers said they were excited by the early promise of their new E21 chassis. 
Second fastest on the final day was Jules Bianchi, auditioning for the second slot on the Force India team. He was ahead of the defending world champion, Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull. Vettel, Sauber's Esteban Gutierrez and the Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton were among the busiest drivers in the sessions, each logging many dozens of laps.
Teams were working on not only dialing in suspension setups on their new cars, but also measuring tire wear and fuel economy. Another full test session is scheduled to begin Feb. 19 at Circuit de Catalunya outside of Barcelona, Spain. (F1.com)

 DuPont has been a sponsor of Jeff Gordon's stock car ride for more than 20 years - about as long as any major sponsor for any team in Nascar. His team members, in consideration of DuPont's multicolor logo scheme, were even known as the Rainbow Warriors.
But those days are over. When Nascar's Speed Weeks resumes this week in Daytona Beach, Fla., get used to the Axalta Coating Systems special.
The name change was mandated when the Carlyle Group investment firm, which also controls, Hertz, Dunkin' Donuts and Allison Transmission, took over DuPont Performance Coatings this year.
Disappointed sentimentalists, however, may find Gordon's change of identity easier to deal with than some of the other odd bedfellows in Nascar this year. A Chinese company, SANY, a maker of heavy construction equipment, is now sponsoring a Nascar team - that of Tommy Baldwin Racing and driver Dave Blaney. Although the car wears No. 7, it will also carry a stylized rendition of the SANY "three ones" logo, which signifies, "first class enterprise, first class employees and first class contribution to society."
And finally, what does so-called clean coal have to do with powering those Dale Earnhardt Jr. cars in Nascar's Nationwide series? The clean coal industry is sponsoring the cars and providing the money that will put Earnhardt and his teammate, Kasey Kahne, on the track. (nascar.com)

HEADLINE: Bail Process Varies by Borough, Analysis Shows

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS


HIGHLIGHT: An analysis by New York City's Criminal Justice Agency found wide variations in whether defendants in felony cases are released at arraignment, detained until bail is paid or denied bail altogether. 

 BODY:
Jonathan Lippman, New York State's chief judge, called last week for fundamental revisions in how bail is set. Among other changes, he would let judges take into account whether defendants pose a threat to the public, rather than only whether they are a flight risk. 
 An analysis by the New York City Criminal Justice Agency found wide variations in whether defendants in felony cases are released at arraignment, detained until bail is paid or denied bail altogether.
The proportion detained ranged from 44 percent in the Bronx to 62 percent in Manhattan. (It was 56 percent in Queens, 54 percent on Staten Island and 53 percent in Brooklyn). 
 The agency assesses each defendant's likelihood of returning to court and either recommends they be released, cautions that they pose a moderate risk of not returning or suggests they not be released. How judges follow those recommendations also varied. 
In the Bronx, 47 percent of the felony defendants rated as high risks were released anyway, compared with 20 percent in Manhattan (and 31 percent on Staten Island, 30 percent in Brooklyn and 24 percent in Queens). 
Over all, in 2011, 8 percent of defendants who were recommended for release failed to return to court at the appointed time. Among those not recommended for release, 22 percent failed to return.

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Unveil Proposal to Avert Broad Spending Cuts

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Senate Democratic leaders are closing in on a $120 billion package of tax increases on the affluent and targeted spending cuts that they say would be large enough to put off looming, across-the-board spending cuts. 

 BODY:
Senate Democratic leaders are closing in on a $120 billion package of tax increases on the affluent and targeted spending cuts that they say would be large enough to put off looming, across-the-board spending cuts to defense and domestic programs for 10 months. 
 The package combines a new 30-percent minimum tax rate for income over $1 million with new limits on tax incentives for retirement once retirement saving reaches a certain level. The legislation would also eliminate some subsidies to agribusinesses and retain some targeted defense cuts, according to aides familiar with the plan, which they emphasized could still be changed. Senate Democrats will hash over the package at their weekly policy lunch Tuesday, hoping to formally unveil their plan to put off the automatic cuts by Thursday, just two weeks before cuts of between 6 percent and 9 percent kick in March 1. 
 Congressional Republican leaders have said they will not accept any tax increases to shut off the so-called sequester, which would cut spending by close to $1 trillion over 10 years. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said Monday that the Democratic plan was designed to fail as a precursor to an onslaught of attacks from President Obama designed to pin the cuts on Republicans.
 "The time has come to finally take on Washington's spending problem in a bipartisan way, and that means the president will actually have to move beyond the gimmicks and the taxes and propose real spending cuts," Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor, "because, I assure you, my constituents in Kentucky will not accept a tax hike in place of spending cuts already agreed to by both parties - I suspect none of our constituents would."
 The Democratic leadership package is considerably more restrained than what many liberals wanted. On Monday, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, introduced a more sweeping sequester-replacement bill that would close corporate tax loopholes worth more than twice the tax measures in the leadership plan. Mr. Whitehouse conceded their bill could never pass, but, he said, they unveiled it to prove "it's not necessary to walk into the fiscal bandsaw of sequestration."
 "Even if one disagrees with the American people, and sees these egregious loopholes as somehow justified, how can one argue that preserving them is more important than avoiding the damage of sequestration?" Mr. Levin asked. "How are these loopholes more important than preventing a recession caused not by the ups and downs of the economic cycle or by the reckless behavior of financial speculators, but by sequestration?"
 Senate Democratic leaders also dropped plans to include provisions ending tax breaks for oil and gas companies. Aides familiar with the package said those provisions would divide Democrats, including Senators Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Begich of Alaska, both of whom are running for re-election next year in states heavily dependent on oil exploration.

HEADLINE: Don't Worry, It's Just Part of a Communist Plot

BYLINE: J. DAVID GOODMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Police Department warned that a television production would be setting off fireballs in Queens and Brooklyn this week. 

 BODY:
Don't mind the fireballs in Queens and Brooklyn - they're all part of the show.
The Police Department gave New Yorkers a heads-up on Monday that at two locations over the next two days - in Richmond Hill, Queens, on Tuesday and on Union Street in Brooklyn on Wednesday - there will be a "controlled explosion with a fireball effect" on the sets of a television production. The "controlled pyrotechnic" events will occur after dark both days, the police said, though the fiery effects may illuminate some of the surrounding area, as fire is wont to do. 
Jake Goldman, a spokesman for the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment, said they were for the same show, "The Americans," a new drama on the FX network about two cold-war-era K.G.B. spies posing as Americans.
"Worth noting," he added, "that the stunts come at a time when the local industry employs 130,000 New Yorkers and contributes over $7 billion to the city's economy."
It was not immediately clear how much money this week's fireballs would generate for the city.

HEADLINE: Where the Singles Are: A Dating Guide by ZIP Code

BYLINE: STEVE LOHR


HIGHLIGHT: Las Vegas and San Jose are among the cities where single men most outnumber single women, according to a new data analysis by Trulia, a residential real estate Web site. In Washington, Boston and New York, single women outnumber men. 

 BODY:
At Trulia, a residential real estate Web site, the analysts are constantly crunching data - home and apartment listings, prices, school ratings, crime rates and other numbers.
With Valentine's Day coming this week, Jed Kolko, Trulia's chief economist and head of analytics, decided to sift through household, gender, city and neighborhood data in America. If you're looking for someone single of the opposite sex, where are your chances best and worst, statistically speaking? 
He posted his findings on the Trulia Trends site on Monday.
According to Trulia's analysis, men living alone most outnumber women living alone in Las Vegas; Honolulu; Palm Bay, Fla.; Gary, Ind.; and San Jose, Calif. 
Women most outnumber men in Bethesda, Md.; Washington; Boston; New York; and Raleigh, N.C.
At the broader metropolitan level, Mr. Kolko said in an interview, labor markets are typically the determining factor. Men outnumber women in regions that have a higher proportion of technology, manufacturing and construction jobs. Women outnumber men most in places with more professional services jobs and in bigger cities.
The data sets for many thousands of ZIP codes, Mr. Kolko explained, all came from the 2010 census and were downloaded onto a laptop, then sliced, diced and manipulated using Stata data analysis and statistical software.
The data was massaged a bit. Only people living alone were counted; an earlier survey showed singles prefer to date someone who lives alone. And this time, Mr. Kolko factored out the gay and lesbian population, using the assumption that the share of gay or lesbian singles in neighborhoods would be roughly equal to same-sex couples living in those neighborhoods. (Last year, Mr. Kolko did an analysis of the ZIP codeneighborhoods with the highest shares of gays and lesbians.)
Local industries may play a large role in gender populations for cities as a whole. But neighborhoods, Mr. Kolko said, are a more genuine reflection of where people want to live. So for each of the 10 largest metropolitan areas, he calculated the ZIP codes with the highest ratio of men to women, and women to men.
Men, Mr. Kolko observed, tend to settle near downtown or in recently redeveloped neighborhoods like the Waterfront in Boston or Long Island City in New York. Women are more likely to live in residential areas, including the Marina in San Francisco and Queen Anne in Seattle, and neighborhoods that are seen as safe and are more affluent, like the Upper East Side of New York and Upper Connecticut Avenue in Washington.
More women in high-income neighborhoods? Is this another sign of the much-discussed trend of women doing better than men? Mr. Kolko did not push the data that far. "It probably says more about where men and women choose to live in a given city rather than which gender is more successful," he said.

HEADLINE: A Tribute to the Pope, and It Goes Well With Milk

BYLINE: COREY KILGANNON


HIGHLIGHT: There could be only one response at Artuso's bakery in the Bronx to word that Pope Benedict XVI was resigning: make some cookies with his image on them like the ones sold when he said Mass at Yankee Stadium in 2008. 

 BODY:
[Video: Watch on Youtube.]
When Anthony Artuso heard the news of Pope Benedict XVI's resignation plans on Monday, what else could he do but order up a batch of pope cookies.
"So many people loved these cookies," Mr. Artuso said, referring to a round cookie bearing the pontiff's likeness that his family's bakery in the Bronx made when Benedict visited New York in 2008. "We still get calls asking for them, but we only made them during the pope's visit."
Artuso Pastry Shop made the cookie thick and round - five inches in diameter - from the same shortbread dough used for the two-tone bakery classic known as the black-and-white. 
"It's basically the same thing as a black-and-white, but we put the pope's photo on it," said Natalie Corridori, a manager at Artuso's. 
Back in 2008, the bakery, on 187th Street in Belmont, made perhaps 500 of them, mostly to sell at Yankee Stadium when the pope celebrated Mass there. (At the time, Artuso's had a stand at the stadium, selling cookies during home games with players' faces on them.)
"They sold out almost immediately - they sold like hot cakes," Ms. Corridori said.
In fact, Mr. Artuso said essentially that the cookie was so perfect for the occasion that he had decided not to make it again. But given the momentous nature of the resignation, he decided to reprise the cookie. The price, $3.50 outside the stadium in 2008, has come down to $2 in the shop.
On Monday afternoon, things were hectic in the kitchen, where the staff had just finished a batch of similar cookies with Spider-Man's face on them for a little boy's party and an order had come in for a girl's birthday cake decorated to resemble a bottle of lip gloss.
Ms. Corridori had the bakers make a dozen cookies and apply moist icing to the top. She then selected an online photograph of Pope Benedict and used a special pastry printer, loaded with food-coloring "ink," to print his beneficent face onto round, thin sheets of icing that were then applied to the top of the cookies.
 "I hate to take a bite out of the pope," she said, pulling one of the cookies in half to sample it.
Artuso's is one of many multigenerational Italian shops near Arthur Avenue in a neighborhood that was once heavily Italian. That has changed in recent years, as Albanians and Latinos have moved in.
Elsewhere in the neighborhood, shop owners were not exactly jumping on the pope-memorabilia bandwagon. The two main religious-item stores - Catholic Goods Center and Mount Carmel Catholic Book Shop, both on 187th Street, near Artuso's - closed in recent years.
At DeCicco Brothers Novelties on Arthur Avenue, there were still two Pope Benedict bobblehead dolls in the window, left over from 2008. Giovanna DeCicco, whose family owns the business, sensed a sudden economic opportunity when a reporter expressed interest in them.
"The price was $25, but now, I don't know," she said with a slight smile.
At Artuso's, Mr. Artuso said he was unsure how many cookies to stock.
"It's all happened so quickly," he said. "I think the neighborhood was really caught off guard. I know we were."

HEADLINE: East Midtown, Below Ground

BYLINE: JULIET LAPIDOS


HIGHLIGHT: Mayor Bloomberg's rezoning plan doesn't really grapple with transit. 

 BODY:
Unlike London and Hong Kong and Tokyo and nearly every city that would dare call itself a global economic hub, New York City has no express rail link between its airports and its central business districts. If you work in the Chrysler Building on Lexington Avenue, and you need to catch a flight at J.F.K., the quickest route is to take the 4/5/6 to the E to the AirTrain. By some estimates, the 4/5/6 is at 116 percent capacity. 
Lately our mayor, Michael Bloomberg, has been warning that New York could lose its wealthiest corporate tenants to cities like London and Hong Kong and Tokyo. But he's not especially concerned about the city's rickety infrastructure. He's worried that our buildings aren't tall enough, and wants to rezone the city's premier business area, East Midtown, to encourage development of larger, more modern skyscrapers. If you work in the Chrysler Building, you might see new towers rise above its spire.

As our editorial this morning noted, the area is due for rezoning, and could surely use new construction. Some 300 of its roughly 400 buildings are more than 50 years old, and don't offer the column-free spaces or environmental features that tenants now demand. But the mayor's current plan doesn't really grapple with the problems below ground. 
Tentative proposals for improving the East Midtown transit situation are unambitious. The M.T.A.'s focused on crowd circulation: Increasing capacity on platforms, ameliorating pathways between lines, reconfiguring exits, installing escalators.
That's not nothing. Better stations will mean commuters can move faster from train to street. If there's less crowding on platforms, the M.T.A. can run more trains. (Currently there are long "dwell times" in East Midtown because frantic passengers squeeze into trains and block the doors.) Still, none of the authority's concepts seem designed to address the fact that the area's main line, the 4/5/6, is already above capacity. As for the long-promised Second Avenue subway, which should eventually reduce overcrowding: The city has financing to complete only phase one of that project, an extension of the Q up to 96th street.
Even assuming that the M.T.A.'s proposals are all that's needed to make East Midtown commuting sufferable for the foreseeable future, there's reason to doubt that the authority will have the money it requires. And it needs a lot of money: Between $340 million and $465 million.
The city's latest idea is to use rezoning as a carrot - to require developers to contribute to a transit fund before obtaining a building permit. But the tri-board task force on East Midtown, comprising Manhattan community boards four, five and six, said in a letter last week to the Department of City Planning that "there is no clear sign that sufficient funds are or will be available to address [M.T.A. infrastructure needs] or that such funds could be acquired in time to make improvements before density increases."
There's nothing wrong with building taller, newer towers to make sure the business community doesn't decamp for Tokyo, but surely if we want to compete with Tokyo we have to make sure tenants can easily get to their taller, newer towers.

HEADLINE: A Bipartisan Team Tackles Immigration

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Two Republicans (Haley Barbour and Condoleezza Rice) and two Democrats (Henry Cisneros and Edward G. Rendell) have formed a commission to prod Congress on immigration. 

 BODY:
It may take strange bedfellows to pass a broad revamping of the immigration system this year. If so, the Bipartisan Policy Center, a research group in Washington, appears to have assembled some. 
Two Democrats -- Henry Cisneros, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Bill Clinton, and Edward G. Rendell, a former governor of Pennsylvania -- will join two Republicans -- Haley Barbour, a former governor of Pennsylvania, and Condoleezza Rice, President George W. Bush's secretary of state, will lead a new commission with the goal of prodding Congress to act.
Also on staff will be Rebecca Talent, who until recently was Senator John McCain's chief of staff, having worked on the immigration issue for more than a decade.
In a conference call with reporters Monday afternoon, it was clear that the four leaders of the commission do not yet agree on the details of a comprehensive plan to change the nation's immigration laws.
Mr. Rendell and Mr. Cisneros emphasized the need to have a "pathway to citizenship" for the country's 11 million illegal immigrants, something Republicans often oppose. Mr. Barbour talked about the need for a guest worker program that unions dislike.
"It's going to be difficult to reach agreement," Mr. Rendell conceded. "There are many issues which are very thorny."
The group says it will try to develop consensus around a series of issues relating to immigration, and will push for specific solutions when it does. In the meantime, the leaders of the new commission appear to agree on one thing: It's time to act.
Mr. Cisneros said he had high hopes that the commission would demonstrate "that there is bipartisan will to fix our immigration system."
"We know we have an issue that has to be resolved," Ms. Rice, now a professor at Stanford University, said.
"No one is happy with the state of immigration policy today," she added. "It's high time that the United States of America get a handle on this vexing problem. It goes right to the core of who we are."
